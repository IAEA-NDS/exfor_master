DETECTOR   (NAICR) The spectrometer consisted of two 7.6 cm
           diameter x 7.6 cm long NaI(Tl) detectors mounted
           collinearly in a lead encasement.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The cross sections were measured by
           using the activation technique in which the
           annihilation radiation from the induced positron
           activity is detected in coincidence.

SAMPLE     (22-TI-46,ENR=0.86) Measurements we made with both
           enriched and natural targets. One 46Ti target
           enriched to 86% abundance was made by evaporation.
           The thickness of this target was also determined by
           comparing its yield to that of the natural abundance
           targets but at an incident lab energy of 1.22 MeV.
           Titanium targets of naturally occurring abundances
           were prepared by evaporation onto 0.5 mm tantalum
           pieces. Titanium targets were ~400 microg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute uncertainty in the (p,gamma)
           cross sections is estimated to be +-20%. This
           estimate includes uncertainties
           (ERR-1) +-10% uncertainty in the target thickness.
           (ERR-2) +-5% uncertainty in the absolute efficiency
           calibration of the annihilation spectrometer and in
           the current integration.
           (ERR-3) Cross sections remeasured for both proton
           capture reactions reproduced within +-15% of the
           average value.

SAMPLE     (24-CR-50,ENR=0.986) Measurements we made with both
           enriched and natural targets. Four 50Cr targets
           enriched to 98.6%, with thicknesses of approximately
           520, 580, 600 and 750 microg/cm2 were made by
           evaporation. The enriched 50Cr target thicknesses
           were determined by comparing the yield from the
           enriched targets to the yield of the natural
           abundance targets at an incident lab energy of 1.40
           MeV. Chromium targets of naturally occurring
           abundances were prepared by evaporation onto 0.5 mm
           tantalum pieces. The chromium targets were ~600
           microg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute uncertainty in the (p,gamma)
