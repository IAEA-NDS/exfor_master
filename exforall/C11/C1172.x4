TITLE      11Be continuum studied through proton scattering
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Inverse kinematics
INC-SOURCE A pure secondary beam of 11Be with an intensity of
           ~10**5 pps at an energy of 63.7A MeV was produced by
           bombarding a 1100 mg/cm2 Be production target with a
           13C beam accelerated to 100A MeV in the K1200 cyclotron
SAMPLE     CH2 target, 1mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Array of eight telescopes, 5 x 5
           cm2 active area. Each telescope was composed of a 300
           mu-m thick Si strip detector with 16 vertical strips
            (3 mm wide) backed by a 500 mu-m thick PIN diode
           detector and a 1 cm thick stopping CsI detector read
           out by 4 photodiodes.
           (DRFTC,SCIN) in coincidence with the recoil protons,
           the scattered fragments were detected in the S800
           spectrometer equipped with its standard detection
           system: a pair of position sensitive cathode readout
           drift chambers for trajectory measurements followed
           by a multi-segmented ion chamber and two large
           plastic scintillators.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data received from the author (A. Shrivastava)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The systematic error is approximately 10%,
           mainly due to the uncertainty in the target thickness,
           while the incident beam particles were counted
           individually with a drift chamber placed at the
           entrance of the target chamber
           (DATA-ERR) The error bars shown are statistical
           and take into account the errors on the carbon
           target data which have been subtracted
