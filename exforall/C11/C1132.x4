           counted at various He3 bombarding energies and angles
           of detection.

DETECTOR   (BF3) B10 enriched BF3 counter (modified long
           counter). The counter tube was 2.5 cm in diameter and
           15 cm in length and was embedded in a paraffin
           cylinder 15 cm in diameter and 12.2 cm long.
SAMPLE     The carbon target used for the excitation functions
           and for the total yield was made by cracking carbon
           from methyl iodide (CH3I) on a tungsten blank of
           1.905 cm diameter and 0.025 cm thickness. The
           thickness of the carbon target was about 60 keV for 3
           MeV He3 particles. For the study of the angular
           distributions, a carbon target was made in the same
           way as mentioned above on a thick tantalum backing. It
           was about 300 keV thick for 3 MeV He3 ions.

DETECTOR   (BF3) B10 enriched BF3 counter (modified long
           counter). The counter tube was 2.5 cm in diameter and
           15 cm in length and was embedded in a paraffin
           cylinder 15 cm in diameter and 12.2 cm long.
SAMPLE     The carbon target used for the excitation functions
           and for the total yield was made by cracking carbon
           from methyl iodide (CH3I) on a tungsten blank of
           1.905 cm diameter and 0.025 cm thickness. The
           thickness of the carbon target was about 60 keV for 3
           MeV He3 particles. For the study of the angular
           distributions, a carbon target was made in the same
           way as mentioned above on a thick tantalum backing. It
           was about 300 keV thick for 3 MeV He3 ions.
