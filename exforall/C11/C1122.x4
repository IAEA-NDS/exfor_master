FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
           Bevalac.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The gamma-ray spectrometer itself consisted
           of a 20.32 cm diameter by 10.16 cm thick NaI(Tl)
           crystal coupled through a linear amplifier to a 1600
           channel pulse height analyzer.
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) For alpha detection.
           (IOCH) Ion chambers ICl-3: The readout from these
           chambers provided a monitor for the stability of the
           beam at the high intensities. These ion chamber
           readings were also used to record the time
           distribution of the incident beam during the course of
           a given irradiation.
SAMPLE     A polystyrene target consisted of a 3.81 cm diameter
           circular disk which was closely fitted inside a
           circular annulus whose diameter was 7.62 cm. The
           pieces were constructed to have parallel faces and a
           nominal thickness of 1.57 mm. The carbon content
            (12C+13C) of polystyrene is 91.5% carbon by weight.
           Each graphite target block had nominal dimensions of
            (5.1 x 5.1x2.54 cm3). The dimensions and weight of
           each graphite target used were measured and recorded.
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) The duration of the entire irradiation
           procedure was about 3-4 hours. During the
           irradiations, the beam position and intensity were
           visually monitored on a pulse-by-pulse basis, and the
           accumulated incident flux was manually recorded after
           every 10 spills. The 11C was counted using a NaI(Tl)
           gamma-ray spectrometer. An irradiated polystyrene
           target was sandwiched between a pair of 0.157 cm
           thick copper plates, an the gamma rays from the
           annihilation of the beta+ from the 11C decay were
           measured in the spectrometer. The central disk and
           the annulus of each polystyrene target were counted
           separately.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Systematic plus statistical. The errors in
           the cross section are dominated by possible counting
           losses in the two scintillator system and effects due
           to slight misalignment of the beam.
           (ERR-1) Possible counting losses as reflected by the
           difference in counts between the two sets of
           electronics never amounted to more than 2%.
           (ERR-2) An error contribution of 2% was assigned to
           allow for possible slight misalignment of the beam
           during irradiation.
