METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) Following irradiation, polonium
           was chemically separated from the target and catcher
           foils by spontaneous deposition on silver. The
           radioactivity of the 207Po product was assayed with
           thin NaI(Tl) X-ray detectors.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were analysed with the CLSQ
           least-squares program.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,15.) The random errors in both the
           cross-section and range values are estimated as
           10-15%, being comprised primarily of the uncertainty
           in target thickness.

SAMPLE     (82-PB-206,ENR=0.974) Targets for these experiments
           were prepared by electrodeposition of lead to a
           thickness of 1 mg/cm2 onto thin nickel foil. The
           target material consisted of highly enriched
           206Pb (97.4%). The recoil catchers were prepared of
           very pure (99.999%) aluminum foil having a surface
           density of 5 mg/cm2. Stacks consisting of six
           target-catcher pairs were mounted in a target holder
           which also served as a Faraday cup for determination
           of the beam intensity.
