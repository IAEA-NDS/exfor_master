SAMPLE     (4-BE-9,ENR=1.0) 151 mg/cm2 Be target.
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16
           cm thick lead shield.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) The 12Be beam was incident on a 151
           mg/cm2 9Be target which was surrounded by an array of
           38 NaI(Tl) position-sensitive gamma-ray detectors.
           The position information from the array was used to
           correct for the Doppler effect by converting event by
           event the registered gamma energy to the projectile
           rest frame.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) We have constructed the response by using the
           code GEANT to create simulated events, which were
           adjusted to the known energy resolution and
           subsequently analyzed in the same way as the real data.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Only selected systematic errors are given.
           (ERR-1) A photopeak detection efficiency with a
           relative accuracy of 5%.
           (ERR-2) An adjustment with a linear background
           component and the range restricted to the photopeak
           and just above (250 - 500 keV) increases this by 1.4%
            (absolute) but gives a poorer fit in the region from
           150 to 250 keV. The possible systematic error arising
           from the background is reflected in the error limit.
           (ERR-3) Absolute intensity error 4.5%.
           (ERR-4) Branching ratio error 4.5%.
