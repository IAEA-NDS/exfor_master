SAMPLE     The targets were circular disks of copper (>99.99%
           pure)of radius 6.35 mm and thickness 5.6 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector in conjunction with a
           4096-channel analyzer.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,EXTB) Irradiations were carried out at
           two laboratories. The chemical procedure for the
           separation of copper: The irradiated copper disks
           were weighed and dissolved in 1 ml of 4.5N HCl and a
           few drops of H202. The solution was evaporated to
           dryness and the residue was dissolved in a few drops
           of 4.5N HCl. The chemical yield was typically between
           70% and 90%. Samples were sandwiched between two
           aluminum disks to ensure complete annihilation of the
           emitted positrons, and the gamma-ray spectra were
           measured. The activities were followed for at least
           three half-lives.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors given are total errors calculated
           at a 95% level of confidence as the square root of
           the sum of squares of total random and systematic
           errors.
           (ERR-1) the integrated deuteron beam current (2%).
           (ERR-2) detector efficiency (3%).
           (ERR-3) decay scheme (1%).
