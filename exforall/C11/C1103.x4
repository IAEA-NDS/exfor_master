REACTION   (8-O-16(P,A)7-N-13,PAR,SIG)
SAMPLE     Targets were produced by evaporating WO3 of natural
           isotopic constitution onto arrays of 0.5 mm thick
           tantalum blanks The mass density deposited was
           measured to be 4.0 mg/cm2 by a crystal-oscillator
           thickness monitor system.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) crystals.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The targets were irradiated with the
           proton beam for periods comparable to the 13N
           half-life. After bombardment, the targets were
           transformed to an off-line annihilation spectrometer
           which counted coincidence pulses between two NaI(Tl)
           crystals.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The cross-section scale is estimated to be
           uncertain by 15% owing to the uncertainty in
           determination of the absolute oxygen content of the
           targets and to the uncertainty in the value of the
           spectrometer efficiency.
COMMENT    Authors say that in their opinion the cs to higher
           levels of N-13 are negligible in the energy range
           considered and therefore they used the partial cs to
           the ground state to determine the (total) reaction
           rate.

REACTION   (8-O-16(P,A)7-N-13,,SGV)
METHOD     The reaction rate for the 160(p,alpha)13N was
           calculated as an average over the Maxwell-Boltzmann
           distribution of the product of cross section and
           velocity.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The major source of uncertainty appears to
           be associated with the experimental cross sections.
           The assigned uncertainty for reaction rate
           determination is 20%.
COMMENT    Authors say that in their opinion the cs to higher
           levels of N-13 are negligible in the energy range
           considered and therefore they used the partial cs to
           the ground state to determine the (total) reaction
           rate.
