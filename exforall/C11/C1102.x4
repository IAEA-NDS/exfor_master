           Synchrocyclotron.
SAMPLE     A series of three relatively thick (1 g/cm2) pure (>
           99.999%) gold targets. The targets were sandwiched
           between two gold catcher foils and wrapped in
           aluminum foil.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,PHD) After a suitable cooling period,
           the gold targets were dissolved and a measured amount
           of 160Tb tracer was introduced to monitor chemical
           yield. The alpha-radioactivity measurements were
           performed in vacuum using a silicon surface-barrier
           detector coupled to a multichannel pulse-height
           analyzer. Analysis of the pulse-height spectra and a
           series of absorption measurements confirmed the
           emission of 4 MeV alpha-particles from each of the
           samples. Chemical yields were determined by
           comparison of the 160Tb gamma-spectra of the various
           samples with a similarly mounted sample prepared
           directly from the tracer solution. (No correction for
           160Tb produced by protons in the gold target was
           needed since this amount was negligible compared to
           the amount of tracer added.)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Somewhat arbitrarily, uncertainties of +-
           40% (excluding the uncertainties due to beam energy
           dispersion) have been assigned to the present data. A
           main factor in this estimate are the uncertainties in
           the incident proton intensities.
           (ERR-1,,5.) An upper limit of about 5% on the total
           149Tb production from impurities in the gold was
           calculated from Rudstam's empirical formula
           (ERR-2,3.,4.) The contributions due to secondaries
            (including both cascade and evaporation particles) to
           196Au were estimated to be between 3 and 4% at the
           highest energy of this experiment using both
           experimental and theoretical results.
