SAMPLE     (6-C-14,ENR=0.55) Carbon targets 55% enriched in 14C.
DETECTOR   (COIN) An anticoincidence crystal spectrometer.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Enriched and regular carbon targets were
           used. Both target measurements resulted in comparable
           amounts of 7-N-16, which indicates that target
           contaminants are responsible for 7-N-16 production.
ANALYSIS   A qualitative upper limit for 6-C-14(d,gamma) cross
           section was established by comparing C-15 and N-16
           activities using the known 6-C-14(d,p) cross section.
REL-REF    (R,C1692001,R.A.Douglas+,J,CJP,34,1097,1956) 14C(d,p)
           cross sections were taken.
