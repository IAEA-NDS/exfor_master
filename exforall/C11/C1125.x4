TITLE      Deuteron Capture in C14

           (J,BAP,7,112(A6),1962) Preliminary results.
INSTITUTE  (1USATEX,1USATNC)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USATEX) The University of Texas electrostatic
           generator.
SAMPLE     (6-C-14,ENR=0.55) Acetylene (C2H2), enriched to an
           isotopic ratio of 55% in C14. The acetylene itself
           was used as a gaseous target in some preliminary
           bombardments, but self-supporting carbon foils and
           carbon deposits on gold backings were also used as
           targets.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) An anticoincidence crystal
           spectrometer, 3- x 3-in. NaI crystal, plastic
           scintillator.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Enriched and regular carbon targets were
           used. Both target measurements resulted in comparable
           amounts of 7-N-16, which indicates that target
           contaminants are responsible for 7-N-16 production.
