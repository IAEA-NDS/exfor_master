            Irradiation and analysis procedure
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Ti-3H target of 2.293 mg/cm2 with the 3H/Ti
           ratio of 1.4 at the start of the irradiation.
           Deuterium ion beam energy was 2.000(11) MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) First gamma-ray spectra measurement
           was perform 20 min after irradiation. The second one
           was carried out after a period of time significantly
           greater than the half-live of the short-living
           radionuclides, such as 184Re and 186Re.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,IOCH) Measurements of the neutron fluence were
           done with two ionization chambers, one loaded with
           235U and another one with 238U. The chamber with 238U
           target was used for the determination of the neutron
           fluence rate, and the 235U chamber was used as a
           neutron flux monitor.
           (HPGE)
           - coaxial HPGe-detector with a 40% relative efficiency
           - BEGe with 50% relative efficiency
SAMPLE     Rhenium disks (20 mm in diameter and 5 mm in
           thickness) of natural isotopic abundance with a
           stated relative purity of 99.9%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
