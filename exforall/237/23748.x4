            Experimental setup and filtered neutron spectrum
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNJAE) ANNRI(BL04) beam line of MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons (606kW).
           The proton beams were supplied at a repetition rate of
           25 Hz and in the "double-bunch mode", in which the
           pulsed protons consist of two bunches, each with a
           width of 100 ns, at intervals of 600 ns.
           To improve neutron energy resolution, Fe neutron
           filters with thickness of 20 cm were installed.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 330 mm (diam.) and 203 mm in thickness, 90 deg
            with respect to the neutron beam line.
           Dead time is typically 3 us.
           (SCIN) Two plastic scintillator to eliminate events
            triggered mainly by cosmic rays:
            - 403 (354) mm in outer (inner) diam. and 330 mm in
              length for 90deg detector;
            - 266 (225) mm in outer (inner) diam. and 254 mm in
              length for 125deg detector.
           DAQ: CAEN V1720 Digitizer (12bit, 250MHz)
METHOD     (FNB,TOF) Neutron TOF experiment with a neutron
           filtering system.
SAMPLE     An 243Am sample with a mass of 38.14 mg and an
           activity of 281.8 MBq was used. The sample was shaped
           like a disk with 10 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in
           thickness, made of AmO2 powder mixed with binder
           material of Y2O3 (39 mg) . The sample was sealed in
           an Al container.
           A dummy sample, an Al container with the identical
           dimensions to the 243Am sample, including only Y2O3,
           was also used for background measurements.
           A carbon sample with a diameter of 10 mm and a
           thickness of 0.5 mm was used as neutron scatterer
           to subtract background.
           A gold sample with a 10 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness
           was used for normalization.
           A boron sample with a diameter of 10 mm and a
           thickness of 0.5 mm was used for neutron spectrum
           measurement.
INC-SPECT  Relative neutron TOF spectrum was measured by
           detecting the 478-keV gamma rays from
           10B(n,alpha gamma)7Li reactions.
           Energy distribution of the filtered neutron spectrum
           was written in NIM-A1003(2021)165318.
ANALYSIS   The pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) was
           applied to derive the neutron capture yield.
           Measurements with the carbon sample,
           "Dummy replica sample", and "Blank (no sample) " were
           used for back ground estimation.
           The neutron capture cross section of 243Am was
           determined relative to the capture cross section of
           197Au.
CORRECTION Dead Time Correction was applied with the extended
           dead-time model.
           Correction factors for self shielding and multiple
           scattering were deduced using the PHITS.
           Contributions of discriminated gamma-rays to the
           capture yields were estimated from theoretical
           calculation using the nuclear reaction model code
           CCONE and detector response functions obtained
           by PHITS code.
           Contributions from the impurities to the capture
           yield were calculated using the evaluated cross
           sections of the impurities in JENDL-4.0.
           The influence of the fission events was very small
           and neglected.
