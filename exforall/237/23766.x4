TITLE      Measurement of the 234U(n,f) cross section in the
           energy range between 14.8 and 17.8 MeV using

INC-SOURCE (D-T) The deuteron beams were accelerated to energies
           ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 MeV, then they passed through
           two molybdenum foils of 5 um thickness each. Thus,
           they impinged on the solid Ti-tritiated target with
           the desirable(lower) energy.
SAMPLE     The 234U and 238U samples are thin 5 um disks with a
           2.6 cm radius deposited on a 100 um Al-backing.
           The impurities were found to be much less than 1 % of
           the total active mass.
           The samples were placed at a distance of 20 cm from the
           tritium target, thus limiting their angular
           acceptance to +- 20 degrees.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A Micromegas detector assembly was used to
           record the fission fragments.
