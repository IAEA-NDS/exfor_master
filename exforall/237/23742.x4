FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR).
INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR.
           The nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is
           5.86E+10 (n/cm2/sec) at 1 MW power operation.
           The AUTHORs confirmed that the TC-Pn was extremely
           thermalized on the basis of Westcott's convention
           using neutron flux monitors: Au-197, Co-59, Sc-45,
           Cu-63, and Mo-98. (See Fig. 8 in the REFERENCE.)
SAMPLE     (73-TA-181,NAT=0.99988)
           Sample:    Ta Foil    0.006 mmt  1.129+-0.001 mg
           Monitor:   Au/Al Alloy wire      4.451+-0.001 mg
                      Co Foil    0.005 mmt  0.632+-0.001 mg
                      Sc Foil    0.025 mmt  0.405+-0.001 mg
                      Cu Foil    0.025 mmt  3.587+-0.001 mg
                      Mo Foil    0.025 mmt  1.129+-0.001 mg
           The sample and the monitors were irradiated
           in the TC-Pn for 30 minutes under 1-MW power operation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 25%.
           The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of the Ge detector were
           measured using a mixed source AM-8140 (Eckert & Ziegler
           Nuclitec GmbH, Germany) : Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57,
           Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113, Cs-137, Co-60 and Y-88.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott's convention method.
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well
           thermalized (See Fig.8 in the REFERENCE) , epithermal
           component in Westcott's convention method was
           negligibly small.
ANALYSIS   The reaction rate of the Ta sample was obtained from
           the yield of each gamma ray emitted from the
           irradiated Ta sample.
           The weighted average of the reaction rates was derived
           using 1121-, 1189-, 1221- and 1231-keV gamma rays.
           Thermal capture cross section and g-factor were taken
           from the REL-REF.
           The thermal-neutron flux was derived as
            (5.688+-0.091)E+10(n/cm2/sec) using the reaction
           rates and the thermal cross section of the monitors.
           The cross section of Ta-181 was derived from the
           reaction rate of the Ta sample and the
           thermal-neutron flux component.
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for thermal neutrons were
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and
           area densities of the sample and the monitors.
           The coincidence summing effect was estimated from
           the peak-to-total ratios and the peak efficiencies.
