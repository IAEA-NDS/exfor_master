INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons.
            Neutron fluence was calculated to be 1.7E+18 cm**-2
           using Fe-58 cross section 1.153 b from
           Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,26-FE-58(N,G)26-FE-59,,SIG,,MXW)
SAMPLE      1.07 mg of enriched (58.4%) Fe-58
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiation time 24 hr.
            Decay corrected Fe-59 activity 2.30+-0.02 MBq was
           measured with gamma spectroscopy.
           Fe-60/Fe-58 ratio (1.0+-0.2)*10**-1 was measured by
           AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry).
CORRECTION  Contribution of epi-thermal and fast neutrons was
           neglected.
ADD-RES    . Upper limit 1.E-8 % for mass A=60 fission chain yield
           was measured by AMS method using a sample chemically
           extracted from radioactive waste concentrate of the
           reprocessing plant WAK in Karlsruhe, Germany.
           . Table 1 - model calculations for the double neutron
           capture production of Fe-60.

COMMENT    Of authors. This cross-section was measured to estimate
           production of Fe-60 via neutron capture reaction.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
