FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR CSN) ISOL facility ALTO (Orsay)
SAMPLE      ALTO radioactive ion beams are available as mass-
            separated photo-fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,SCIN) 4pi beta-plastic scintillator counter
           (HPGE)
           (HE3SP) 80 3He-filled neutron counters embedded in
           high-density polyethylene.
           Beta-gated and beta-neutron gated gamma spectra were
           used to determine neutron detection efficiency for
           beta-delayed neutron energy spectrum for 82Ga as well
           as for the beta efficiency.
PART-DET   (B-,DN,DG)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
            - T1/2 for 82Ga determined by recorded neutron
           activity build-up during the collection of 82Ga beam
           onto the tape
            - The beta decay chains over three generations
           following the decay of 82Ga are considered for
           evaluation of P1n.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Each of the parameters was varied within
           error bars to obtain a set of solutions. The final
           uncertainty was obtained as a root square from the
           sum of quadratic deviations around the mean.
