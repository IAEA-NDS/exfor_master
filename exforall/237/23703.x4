TITLE       Zirconium-97 in the spontaneous fission of uranium-238
AUTHOR     (M.N.Rao)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,29,863,1967)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKLN)
SAMPLE      Two kg of depleted ammonium diuranate (99.99% U-238,
           0.01 % U-235), 1.4 kg U-238 .
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Phillips low background anticoincidence GM
           counter assembly .
           Counting efficiency 38.0+-1.0 % was assumed the same
           for Zr-97 and Nb-97.
METHOD     (CHSEP)7 days of Zr-97 activity growing,
            4 hr radiochemical procedure.
            Counting after complete decay of Zr-97.

REACTION   (92-U-238(0,F)40-ZR-97,CUM,FY)
DECAY-DATA (40-ZR-97,17.HR,B-,1900.) 16.hr measured by decay curve
           (41-NB-97,,B-,1300.)
ANALYSIS      Zr-97 yield was calculated as
             (NiLAMBLAi/(N238*LAMBLAf))*100, where
           NiLAMBLAi - equilibrium activity of the fission product
           with mass number i,
           N238 - number 0f U-238 atoms,
           LAMBDAf - U-238 spontaneous fission decay constant,
            (7.8+-0.9)*10**17 1/yr.
           Equilibrium activity of Zr-97 :
           1st run - (3.67+-0.37)*10**-4 dis/sec per g U-238,
           2nd run - (3.96+-0.4)*10**-4 dis/sec per g U-238.
