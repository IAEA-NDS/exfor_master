INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target.
           The proton beams with an energy of 3 GeV and an average
           power of 140 kW were injected into the mercury target
           at a repetition rate of 25 Hz.
           The proton beam was operated with a single bunch mode
           with a width of 100 ns.
SAMPLE     (48-CD-112,ENR=0.9827)
           A Cd-112 enriched target was used but it included
           Cd-113 with a fraction of 0.6%.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,BGO) Array of Ge detector consists of two cluster
           Ge detectors and eight coaxial-Ge detectors with BGO
           anti-coincidence shields. In the analysis, the two
           cluster-Ge detectors were used. Individual cluster
           detectors have seven HPGe crystals.
METHOD     (TOF,GSPEC) Flight length = 21.5 m
ANALYSIS   Prompt gamma-rays from Cd-112 resonances were
           measured with gating on the resonances in the TOF.
           The gamma-rays decaying to the ground state of
           113Cd with energies of 299 keV and gamma-rays of 259
           keV which decays to the isomer were clearly observed.
           The gamma-ray intensity ratios of 259 keV to
           the sum of 259 and 299 keV were deduced
           at each resonance of Cd-112.
           These ratios are expected to be approximately
           proportional to the isomer production ratios.
           The following expected ratios were calculated
           using the CCONE Hauser-Feshbach statistical model.
                From  Jpi = 1/2+ states 0.18
                      Jpi = 1/2- states lower than 0.18
                      Jpi = 3/2- states 0.27
           The spin and parity were assigned from the measured
           isomer production ratios.
