INSTITUTE  (2BLGMOL)
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) BR2 reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) T7 channel
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutrons . Flux 1.6E+9 n/(cm2*sec) in earlier
           measurement, 5.4E+8 n/(cm2*sec) at later .
SAMPLE      U-235 (90% enriched) 1 to 2 g with SB+5 or As+5
           carriers in solution in ~25 cm3 of 30% H(2)SO(4).
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 5 He-3 counters with TMC 400-channel
           multiscaler.
           Time intervals 0.1 sec for first 20 sec, 1 sec for
           later time.
           Efficiency was measured by 56-sec Br-87
           delayed neutron source to be ~7%.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Irradiation time from 5 to 60 sec,
           gas collection time 2 to 5 sec,
           As and Sb were separated as hydrides.
HISTORY    (20200520C)  M.M.
