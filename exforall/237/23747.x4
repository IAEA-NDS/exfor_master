FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNKEK) BL05 Low-Divergence beam branch in
           MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The pulsed neutron beams are produced by the
           spallation process at the MLF in J-PARC.
           Peak energy was 11.7 meV at the time of measurement.
           The proton beam power was approximately 410 kW.
SAMPLE     Natural noble gas (He, Ar, Kr and Xe) was used as
           target and Ne gas was used as a monitor material.
           The gas was filled in an aluminum target cell with
           a diameter of 50 mm and a length of 150 mm giving it
           a volume of about 300 cm3.
           The gas was pressurized to approximately 1.85 atm and
           the pressure and temperature was monitored
           continuously throughout each run.
DETECTOR   (PS,PROPC) Neutrons scattered by the target gas were
           detected by a 3He-gas-filled position sensitive
           detector (HePSD).
           The HePSD contained seven proportional counter tubes
           each with a diameter of 12.7 mm covering an area
           600 mm wide and 90 mm high.
METHOD     (TOF)
           -Acquire angular and energy-dependent scattering data
            for target gases and Ne.
ANALYSIS   The neutron count rate was measured separately for
           each gas species and for the empty cell.
           Empty-cell data are subtracted from that of
           the gas-filled cell and normalized by the number
           density and the proton beam power at MLF.
           Form the ratios of the results of target gases (He, Ar,
           Kr and Xe) with respect to that of Ne.
           Perform a Monte Carlo simulation in order to correct
           the differences of angular distribution of scattered
           neutrons between the target gases and Ne.
           Using the experimental event rates of the target gases
           relative to the measured Ne data and scattering cross
           sections of Ne, scattering cross section of the target
           gases were deduced.
           The free atom cross sections were calculated from the
           deduced bound atom cross sections.
ERR-ANALYS In the analysis,
           -Statistical uncertainty in the ecperiments
           -Systemtic uncertainties due to pressure and
            temperature stability
           -Systemtic uncertainties due to pressure dependence of
            cell geometry (negligibly small),
           -Systemtic uncertainties due to multiple scattering
            (<0.1%)
           -Uncertainty in the simulation
           were discussed.
           (ERR-T) Total Uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty in the experiments.
