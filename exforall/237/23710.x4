TITLE       The mass-yield curve for fission of 237Np by 14.5 MeV
           neutrons
AUTHOR     (R.F.Coleman,B.E.Hawker,J.L.Perkin)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,14,8,1960)
INSTITUTE  (2UK ALD)
FACILITY     500 keV deuterons bombard zirconium-tritide target.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  .  5.E+9 /sec/cm2 to measure various fission yields
           relative to Mo-99 yield.
           . Smaller neutron flux to measure absolute yield of
           Mo-99.
           .Neutron flux was determined by counting associated
           alpha-particles from D-T reaction.
           Thermal and epithermal neutrons  < 3.E-5 % of 14 MeV
           flux, 1-3 MeV neutrons ~1% of 14 MeV flux.
SAMPLE      200 mg of pure Np dioxide in the form of discs of
           100 mg/cm2 thickness between Al-catcher foils.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) . Placed at 135 deg to deuteron beam - to count
           alpha-particles for the flux measurement.
           . 4PI proportional counter for fission products.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Details are given in the article.

ANALYSIS   Each value is the mean of three independent
           determinations from different irradiations.
CORRECTION  For Cd-115 - 10% correction to take into account
           the yield of Cd-115m.

FLAG       (1.) Measured by absolute neutron flux determination.
           (2.) Measured by mass yield curve determination.
           (3.) Mean of two measured values.
METHOD      1. Irradiation at known neutron flux. Np-237 fission
           cross section used was base on two values
           2.4+-0.2 b for 14.6 MeV of Protopopov+ and
           2.5+-0.07 b for 14.0 MeV of Moat;
            More precise value at slightly lower energy was used.
            2. Relative mass yield curve was normalized to 200 %.
           Mirror points were calculated on the base of
           NU ~4.5 n/fis to draw smooth curve.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
           article. It's mentioned only, that for value with
           Flag 1. the error includes error of fission cross
           section.
