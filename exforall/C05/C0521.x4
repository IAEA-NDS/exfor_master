TITLE      Neutron Yields from the 4-12 MeV Proton Bombardment of
            11B, 13C and 18O as Related to the Production of 11C,
            13N and 18F
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL)
DETECTOR   (BF3) Reactor-grade graphite sphere with 8 BF3
            counters embedded near the surface.
ERR-ANALYS Error in neutron yield, exclusive of correction for
            detector efficiency is about 2%.

REACTION   (5-B-11(P,X)0-NN-1,,PY,,TT)
SAMPLE     "Inifinitely" thick target of enriched 11B powder.
CORRECTION Since the neutron energy spectrum is not know, no
            correction has been made for neutron detection
            efficiency (estimated <5% at highest energy).

REACTION   (6-C-13(P,N)7-N-13,,SIG,,AV,DERIV)
SAMPLE     "Inifinitely" thick target of high-purity reactor-
            grade graphite.
ANALYSIS   Derived from natural carbon data.  Since 12C(p,n)
            thresholds are above the maximum proton energy used,
            12C does not contribute to natural carbon yield.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron energy-loss using values of

            (1970).
