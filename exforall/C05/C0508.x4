TITLE      Fusion of a neutron skin nucleus: The 209Bi(4He,4n)
            reaction.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Three-stage Van de Graaf accelerator
            facility combined with a large supercondacting
            solenoid magnet (the TwinSol system) for collecting
            and focusing the secondary 6He.
INC-SOURCE Radioactive 6He beam produced by the 7Li+9Be reaction.
           Beam passed through a Au monitor, then a series of
            alternating Mylar degrader foils and targets.
           Due to energy loss in the degrader foils and targets,
            incident energy range seen by Bi targets in target
            stack spanned 20.0 - 31.6 MeV.
SAMPLE     Stack of 16 209Bi targets backed with 0.825 mg/cm**2
            Mylar, nominal thickness 1 mg/cm**2, alternating
            with removable Mylar degraders (each 0.825 mg/cm**2).
DETECTOR   (SILI) 32 Si surface barrier detectors, each 150
            microns thick and 3 cm**2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA)
           Bi targets were irradiated for approximately 17 h
            and then quickly transfered to the off-line counting
            system (each of the 16 targets was placed between
            two closely spaced detectors so that total solid
            angle subtended by the detectors for each target was
            about 60 % of 4pi). The irradiated targets were
            counted for approximately 20 h.
           Before irradiation, each of the targets was also
            counted for 24 h to establish the background alpha-
            activity levels.
DECAY-DATA (85-AT-211,7.2HR,A)
MONITOR    Beam monitored by 6He scattering from Au foils.
CORRECTION Corrected for
           . background
           . solid angle,
           . finite counting time,
           . time to transfer the targets from the on-line
             scattering chamber to the off-line counting system
             (about 45 min),
           . decay of 211At during the irradiation.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The result, for energies above the Coulomb
            barrier, are compared the statistical model prediction
            using the code PACE.

REACTION   (83-BI-209(2-HE-6,4N)85-AT-211,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties given.
            Systematic uncertainty about 10%, mainly due to the
             uncertainties in the target thickness and in the
             ratio of 6He to primary beam current.
           (EN-ERR) Estimated systematic errors based on
            variation in the measured energies in the monitors
            and measurements with detectors in the direct
            secondary beam.
FLAG       (1.) The result of the 1st independent measurement.
           (2.) The result of the 2nd independent measurement.
           (3.) The result of the 3rd independent measurement.
