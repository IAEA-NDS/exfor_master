TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF NUCLEAR INELASTIC SCATTERING CROSS
           SECTION OF THORIUM-232 FOR 144 KEV SI-FILTERED
           NEUTRONS,
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMIS) UNIV. OF MISSOURI RESEARCH REACTOR.
METHOD     FILTER-BEAM METHOD.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) SI-FILTERED NEUTRONS.
            ONE MM THICK B10 PLATE SUPPRESSED THE THERMAL NEUTRONS
MONITOR    (90-TH-232(N,SCT)90-TH-232,,SIG)
           THE SUM OF THE ELASTIC AND INELASTIC ANGLE INTEGRATED
             DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION WAS NORMALIZED TO
             TOTAL (11.8+-0.1B)-CAPTURE (0.18+-0.017B).
DETECTOR   SPHERICAL H2-GAS COUNTER.
SAMPLE     TWO METALLIC TH PLATES EAC 5.08*5.08*0.318 CM3.
            0.15 PERCENT OXYGEN IMPURITY WAS PRESENT IN THE
            SAMPLES.
CORRECTION BACKGROUND GAMMAS WERE NEGLIGIBLE IN BACGROUND
           SUBTRACTION.
           ELASTIC SCATTRING BACKGROUND WAS MEASURED WITH
             SAMPLE OUT OF THE BEAM.
           FOR THE INELASTIC EXPERIMENT THE BACKGROUND WAS
             MEASURED BY REPLACING THE TH-232 SAMPLE WITH A
             LEAD SAMPLE IN THE BEAM.
