TITLE      EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF ANAMALOUS SCATTERING
           LENGTHS OF SAMARIUM FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) BROOKHAVEN HIGH FLUX BEAM REACTOR.
METHOD     (DIFFR) DIFFRACTION.
             1800 INDEPENDENT REFLECTIONS WERE MEASURED AT A
             WAVE LENGTH OF 1.3 ANGSTROM AND THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
             REFINED TO A FINAL R-VALUE OF 0.058.
           140 REFLECTIONS WITH STRONG SM-CONTRIBUTION WERE
             MEASURED AT A NUMBER OF WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 0.827
             AND 1.300 ANGSTROMS.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) 002 BE FACE CRYSTAL WAS USED TO OBTAIN THE
                  MONOCHROMATIC NEUTRON BEAM WITH WAVE LENGTHS
                  BETWEEN 0.827 AND 1.300 ANGSTROMS.
SAMPLE     A SINGLE CRYSTAL OF A SODIUM SAMARIUM EDTA COMPLEX
             NA+(SM(C10H12N2O8).3H2O-5H2O WAS USED.
             SAMPLE AT 37 DEGREES KELVIN IN HELIUM ATMOSPHERE.
ANALYSIS   A LEAST-SQUARED ANALYSIS OF THE REAL AND IMAGINARY
             PARTS OF THE SCATTERING LENGTH IN RELEVANT
             TERMS WAS PERFORMED TO OBTAIN THE SCATTERING
             LENGTH FOR NATURAL SAMARIUM.
ASSUMED    THE SCATTERING RADIUS WAS ASSUMED TO BE 7.98 FERMI.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY.
