TITLE      Neutron scattering from Os isotopes at 60 keV and Re-Os
           nucleochronology.
FACILITY   (VDG)
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight with 2.3 meter flight path.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n) reaction
           Energy spread of 5 keV from the Li-target
           overall energy spread was about 7.5 keV.
MONITOR    Zero degree time-flight-detector.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillation detectors for TOF
           energy separation one for 90 deg scattered neutron
           detection and the other for monitoring incident
           0 deg neutron flux.
           Detector resolution was 3.5 ns.
SAMPLE     Disks of 1 cm diameter and 0.15 cm thick.
            O-187 sample enriched to 70%.
            O-188 sample enriched to 94.5%.
ANALYSIS   Scattering yields were converted to cross sections
           by normalization to assumed isotopic scattering
           cross sections and to determine anisotropy
           coefficients.
           Inelastic/elastic yield ratio and the assumed
           scattering cross section were used to determine
           the inelastic and the elastic scattering cross
           sections for 187-Os.
           Differential scattering data for both the samples
           were measured to constrain the s- and p-wave
           scattering amplitudes.
           2-3% uncertainty in determining cross
           sections was attributed to the non-availability
           of measured cross sections for the minor isotopes
           in the 187-Os and 188-Os samples used.
CORRECTION Energy dependent neutron detection efficiency
           correction = 3.3%.
           Multiple scattering corrections for elastic
           and inelastic scattering = 12% for 187-Os.
