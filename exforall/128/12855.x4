TITLE      NEUTRON SCATTERING FROM OS ISOTOPES AT 60 KEV AND RE-OS
           NUCLEOCHRONOLOGY.
FACILITY   (VDG)
METHOD     (TOF) TIME-OF-FLIGHT WITH 2.3 METER FLIGHT PATH.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) L-7(P,N) REACTION
           ENERGY SPREAD OF 5 KEV FROM THE LI-TARGET
           OVERALL ENERGY SPREAD WAS ABOUT 7.5 KEV.
MONITOR    ZERO DEGREE TIME-FLIGHT-DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) TWO PLASTIC SCINTILLATION DETECTORS FOR TOF
           ENERGY SEPARATION ONE FOR 90 DEG SCATTERED NEUTRON
           DETECTION AND THE OTHER FOR MONITORING INCIDENT
           0 DEG NEUTRON FLUX.
           DETECTOR RESOLUTION WAS 3.5 NS.
SAMPLE     DISKS OF 1 CM DIAMETER AND 0.15 CM THICK.
            O-187 SAMPLE ENRICHED TO 70 PERCENT.
            O-188 SAMPLE ENRICHED TO 94.5 PERCENT.
ANALYSIS   SCATTERING YIELDS WERE CONVERTED TO CROSS SECTIONS
           BY NORMALIZATION TO ASSUMED ISOTOPIC SCATTERING
           CROSS SECTIONS AND TO DETERMINE ANISOTROPY
           COEFFICIENTS.
           INELASTIC/ELASTIC YIELD RATIO AND THE ASSUMED
           SCATTERING CROSS SECTION WERE USED TO DETERMINE
           THE INELASTIC AND THE ELASTIC SCATTERING CROSS
           SECTIONS FOR 187-OS.
           DIFFERENTIAL SCATTERING DATA FOR BOTH THE SAMPLES
           WERE MEASURED TO CONSTRAIN THE S- AND P-WAVE
           SCATTERING AMPLITUDES.
           2-3 PERCENT UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING CROSS
           SECTIONS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NON-AVAILABILITY
           OF MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE MINOR ISTOPES
           IN THE 187-OS AND 188-OS SAMPLES USED.
CORRECTION ENERGY DEPENDENT NEUTRON DETECTION EFFICIENCY
           CORRECTION = 3.3 PERCENT.
           MULTIPLE SCATTERING CORRECTIONS FOR ELASTIC
           AND INELASTIC SCATTERING = 12 PERCENT FOR 187-OS.
