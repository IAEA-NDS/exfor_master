TITLE      Measurement of the prompt fission neutron multiplicity
            from the 245Cm(n,f) and 242(m)Am(n,f) reactions
SAMPLE     235U vapor was deposited on five tantalum foils, each
            6 micro-m thick with 500 microgram/cm2.
           Monitor sample 8.3+-0.16 milligrams 235U, 99.8% pure.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213 liquid scintillator 12.5 and 5cm long
           (FISCH)
           Efficiencies for detecting fission events in the
            fission chamber was about 95%.
ANALYSIS   Pre-fission evaporation spectrum was assumed to be
            isotropic for the samples.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Quoted errors are strictly statistical in
           and include the following uncertainties:
            1) coincident neutron counts,
            2) total fission counts,
            3) measured deadtimes,
            4) measured backgrounds.
           Systematic uncertaity does not exceeded 1/5 of
            statistical uncertainty.

           Typical energy uncertainty is +-40 keV at 4 MeV and
            +-260 keV at 14 MeV.
SAMPLE     Fission chamber was constructed with two samples of
           245Cm: 195.3+-4.0 micrograms - 99.9% pure, and
                  201.0+-4.0 micrograms - 99.2% pure.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight. 13.4-m flight path.
DETECTOR   Timing resolution on the fission signals was 1 ns.
           The neutron detector threshold was set above 0.3 MeV.
CORRECTION The following corrections were made
            (1) Background neutrons in neutron detector (<5%),
            (2) Pileup-induced deadtime in neutron detector (<15),
            (3) Spontaneous-fissioning sample contaminants
                (<3% for 99.9% sample, <10% for 99.2% sample)
            (4) Geomettrically-induced differences in the neutron
                detection efficiency (<1%)
           Data were multiplied by a factor of 1.045.

                 spectrum distributions.
