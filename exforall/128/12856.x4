           Least-squares analysis was performed to determine the
            precursor half-lives from neutron and beta decay
            curves.
           Total delayed neutron yields were calculated with
            the measured delayed neutron probability and the
            cumulative yield of the precursor and summing
            over all precursors.
CORRECTION Background component was included in the least-squares
           analysis.
