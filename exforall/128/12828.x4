TITLE      NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS AND DOPPLER EFFECT OF THE
             1.056 EV RESONANCE IN 240-PU
FACILITY   (CHOPF) HIGH FLUX BEAM REACTOR
METHOD     (TOF) 22 METER FLIGHT PATH
DETECTOR   (GELI) FOR CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS,
             3-HE DETECTOR FOR TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS.
SAMPLE     TWO SAMPLES OF 240-PU, ONE METALIC AND ONE OXIDE,
            EACH 6.35 CM BY 5.72 CM WERE USED. THE METALLIC SAMPLE
            IS 98.3 PERCENT ENRICHED 240-PU WITH A THICKNESS OF
            224.E-7 ATOMS/BARN. THE OXIDE SAMPLE IS 96.3 PERCENT
            ENRICHED 240-PU WITH A THICKNESS OF 179.E-7 ATOMS/
            BARN.
CORRECTION DATA CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND, DEAD-TIME AND DOPPLER
             BROADENING.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) TOTAL ERROR INCLUDING TRANSMISSION NORMAL-
            IZATION, SAMPLE UNIFORMITY, ASSUMED VALUE OF R-PRIME
            AND STATISTICS.
STATUS     (APRVD) R.E.CHRIEN, 83/9/22.
