TITLE      Claibration of a Li-glass detector for neutron
            energies above 50 keV by the 1H(t,n)3He reaction.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALAS) Ion beam facility
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
SAMPLE     Li glass, enriched to 95% 6Li.
METHOD     (TOF)
           Each data point above 1.3 MeV is measured relative to
            one point below 252 keV, reflecting the cross section
            ratios between the two neutron groups of the source
            reaction. These ratios, obtained from an energy-
            dependent evaluation of 3H(p,n)3He, which included a
            measurement of the 180-degree excitation function
            [M.Drosg et al., LA-10444-MS (1985)] for improved
            back angle data, have correlated uncertainties.
MONITOR    A scale difference of 6.07% was obtained between the
            data below 251.6 keV with the data of ENDF/B-VI.
            Consequently, all data have been multiplied by 1.061
            so that scale is relative to ENDF/B-VI between 50 keV
            and 252 keV.
CORRECTION Corrected for multiple scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Scale uncertainty.
           Additional scale error of at most +-2.8% for the data
            above 1.3 MeV resulting from correlated errors of the
            high and low energy pairs.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by M. Drosg, Feb. 23, 1999.
           Data received by email from M. Drosg, Nov. 1998.
           Data as of March 15, 1994.
