TITLE      Fission Cross Section of Uranium-234
FACILITY   (VDG) Oak Ridge 5-Mev Van de Graaff.
INC-SOURCE (P-T). Tritium gas target.
SAMPLE     2 foils of 234U plated over a one-inch circle on 2-mm
            thick platinum backing, one thin foil containing
            about 1 mg of uranium, and one thick foil containing
            about 4 mg. The quantity of uranium in the thin foil
            known accurately.
           2 monitor foils of 235U plated in the same way as
            sample foils, thin and thick foils of same weights as
            234U foils.
           234U and 235U foils placed back to back.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A double ionization chamber.
           A mixture of 97% argon plus 3% carbon dioxide at a
            pressure of two atmospheres supplied with a flow of
            0.1 cubic foot per hour. The chamber was surrounded
            by a 1/32-inch thick shield of cadmium to absorb
            slow neutrons.
METHOD     For calibration the thin and thick foils of the same
            isotopic content were placed in the fission chamber
            back to back, and exposed to neutrons from a Po-Be
            source for several hours. The fission yields ratios
            were found to 0.2% for the pair of 234U foils and
            for the pair of 235U foils.
           Then the thick foils used to find the 234U to 325U
            cross section ratio.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . background, and counts from pileup of alpha pulses
             in the 234U (<0.01%).
           . different absorption losses of the fission
             fragments for foils facing toward and away neutron
             source (~1% at 4 MeV).
           Not corrected for effect of room scattered neutrons
             on 235U fission cross section (correction factor
             determined to be 1.01+-0.01).
ERR-ANALYS Contributions to uncertainties:
           . quantity of uranium deposited on foils (14%);
           . effect of room scattered neutrons (1%);
           . beam momentum (0.15%);
           . amplifier gain changes (0.12%);
           . statistics (1.5-3%).
STATUS     (CURVE) Data read from curve in report LA-1714 (taken
             from Barshall Curves).
