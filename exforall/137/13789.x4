TITLE      The Scattering of slow neutrons by gaseous ortho- and
           parahydrogen: spin dependence of the neutron-proton
           force.
SAMPLE     Ortho- and parahydrogen gas contained in a cylindrical
            copper bomb. Liquid air used to keep the gas at 90 K.
            A pressure line for up to several hundred atmospheres
            connected the bomb to the storage hydrogen tank and a
            calibrated pressure gauge.
INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) 200 mg of radium as bromide mixed with 10 g of
            powdered beryllium metal. Paraffin used as a moderator
            for the work with room temperature neutrons. Neutrons
            obtained through the walls of Dewar vessel surrounding
            Ra-Be source and containing a cylinder of paraffin
            immersed in liquid air.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission.
           Parahydrogen gas obtained after 24 hour conversion
            by placing a few hundred cc charcoal in about eight
            liters of liquid normal hydrogen in a Dewar surrounded
            by a liquid air. The gas analyses were made by the
            heat conductivity method of Bonhoeffer.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Boron Trifluoride neutron detector. The distances
            from the scatterer to the source and to the counter
            were each about 25 cm.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections calculated from measured transmission
            by converting pressures into number of H2 molecules
            in the beam using the perfect gas laws.
CORRECTION Results corrected for scattering into counter of
            neutrons that would have missed it if scatterer had
            not been present. Correction calculated assuming
            isotropic scattering and checked experimentally by
            measuring scattering cross sections of ethane,
            ethylene, and methane in apparatus.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties given.
