TITLE      Measurement of 10B(n,t) Cross Section in a Fast-Neutron
            Spectrum
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAAGN) Coupled Fast Reactivity Measurement
            Facility (CFRMF) at Aerojet Nuclear Company.
INC-SPECT  Fast reactor-type neutron spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV). Sample irradiated for 4.68E8 W-min.
           (CHSEP) Irradiated capsules dissolved and tritium
            distilled and oxidized. Tritiated water collected
            and counted. Dummy samples spiked with a tritium
            standard used for calibration.

           Dosimetry (activation) foils of Au, In and Ni placed
            between the capsules to measure the neutron fluence.
           The total fluence determined as 3.93 +/- 0.31 x E+15
            n/cm2 by normalizing the results to those of McElroy
            et al, private communication, 1972.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties given. Estimated
            error in each individual tritium measurement <4%.
            Estimated spectral uncertainty 8%.
STATUS     Data taken from text of reference.

SAMPLE     Boron contained in stainless-steel capsules. Each
            capsule contained ~250 mg of B2O3. Eleven capsules
            loaded axially in a tube 6 in. in length centered in
            the CFRMF.
