TITLE      Angular Anisotropy in the 6Li(n,alpha)3H Reaction in
           the eV and keV Energy Region
FACILITY   (ACCEL) Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA)
SAMPLE     Thin sample of 6LiF 101 microg/cm2
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Diffused-junction Si detector located at
METHOD     (TOF). 9.03-meter flight-path.
           The intensity ratio of the well resolved alpha
            and triton groups at 2.06 and 2.73 MeV was measured
            from 0.5 eV to 25 keV neutron energy in the forward
            and backward directions (solid angle ~pi). The
            anisotropy measurable down to 10 eV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties given.
ADD-RES    In the energy region 10 eV - 10 keV the results give
            an energy dependence for the triton to alpha ratio at
            0 deg (or alpha to triton ratio at 180 deg) of the
            form 1+c*E**0.54 where c is 0.005 and E is the
            neutron energy in eV.
STATUS     Data taken from text of reference.
