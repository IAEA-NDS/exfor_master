TITLE      Angular Anisotropy in the 6Li(n,alpha)3H Reaction at
            25 keV
FACILITY   (REAC) Iron-filtered beam facility at the NBS reactor.
            Well-collimated l-cm-diameter beam with an intensity
            of 5E+5 n/(cm**2 s).
INC-SPECT  99% of the beam composed of 25-keV neutrons and the
            remaining 1% made up of contaminants at 82, 137
            and 270 KeV. No thermal-neutron contaminant found.
SAMPLE     80 microg/cm2 (0.3 microns) of 6LiF with 3-cm2
            circular area mounted by evaporation on the front face
            of the Silicon surface-barrier detector.
DETECTOR   Proton-recoil spectrometer used to measure spectrum of
            neutron beam.
ANALYSIS   After determination of the background, the numbers of
            tritons and alphas were estimated for each of the 2pi
            measurements and normalized to the average number of
            particles observed in the forward and backward
            distributions. This was done under the assumption
            that, to the first approximation, tritons and alphas
            are emitted in opposite directions in the laboratory
            system.
           From the number of tritons and alphas emitted in each
            of the experimental conditions were determined the
            degree of asymmetry involved in each case:
            forward-to-backward 0 deg and 45 deg 2pi asymmetry,
            forward-to-backward 0 deg ~0.6pi (45 deg cone)
            asymmetry, defined as the ratio of the number of
            tritons in this directions.
ADD-RES    From the experimental results a coarse-grided angular
            distribution obtaibed and presented in graphical form
            for both the lab and the center-of-mass system.
STATUS     Data taken from Table I of reference.

REACTION   ((3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,DA)//(3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,DA))
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Silicon surface-barrier 2 pi detector, mounted
            on a pyrofilite (non-hydrogenous) ring, coated on
            front face (by evaporation) with sample of 6LiF, and
            enclosed in aluminum holder with thin (0.25 mm) front
            and back windows to minimize neutron scattering.
METHOD     Four series of runs performed and pulse-height
            distributions of both 3H and 4He recorded.
CORRECTION Background subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties arising from
            estimation of the background (main source) and from
            counting statistics.
ADD-RES    The backward-to-forward ratio with the front and back
            faces at 45 degrees to beam was measured as
            1.39+-0.11.

REACTION   ((3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,DA)//(3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,DA))
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Commercial, partially-depleted, surface-barrier
            detector (D2) with an active area of 200 mm2 and with
            an alpha (5.5 MeV) resolution of 19 keV (FWHM),
            placed coaxially with the 6Li detector (at 90 deg to
            the beam) and in such a way as to subtend a 45 cone
            for the products detected.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence measurements, yielded number of
            forward and backward emitted products.
CORRECTION Contribution from small peaks due to thermal-neutron
            contamination was subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties, arising from
            subtraction of small peaks and from counting
            statistics.
