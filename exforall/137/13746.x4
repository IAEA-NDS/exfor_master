TITLE      5He ternary fission yields of 252Cf and U235(n,f)
FACILITY   Gammasphere array at Argonne National Laboratory
SAMPLE     252Cf source (30 microCi) sandwiched between two Au
            foils each 19 mg/cm**2 in thickness.  An 0.84 mg/cm**2
            Mylar foil is placed On each side of the Cf sample.
METHOD     (EDE) Energy distribution analysis.
            No reliable data was obtained for alpha energies below
            9.0 MeV, the low energy cutoff of the measurement.
DETECTOR   (TELES) 2 DE-E Si detector telescopes installed in the
            center of the Gammasphere array. Each DE-E telescope
            included one DE detector (15 microns thick and 10x10
            mm**2 area) and one E strip detector (400 microns
            thick and 60x60 mm**2 in area) with 29 strips.
           The DE and E telescopes, installed at 6 and 40 mm
            from the source, respectively, provided Z and A
            identification for all charged light particles.
MONITOR    Energy calibration of telescopes performed with 224Ra
            and 228Th radioactive source and 6.2-MeV alpha peak
            from decay of 252Cf deposited on surface of Au foil.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . energy loss of alpha particles in Au foil,
           . 6.2-MeV decay alpha particles from accidental
             contamination of surface of Au foil with the source
             material.
ANALYSIS   Shape of energy spectrum of ternary alpha particles
            analyzed. Low energy tail was attributed to alpha
            particles originating from 5He emission. Contribution
            from the breakup of 6He and 8He was neglegted as <1%.
           Observed energy spectra fitted with Gaussian functions
            to disentangle contributions of 5He and 4He.
            The only requirement of the fitting procedure is that
            widths of the two Gaussian distributions have the same
            FWHM.
            The small additional spread in momentum which is
            contribution of the breakup of 5He to distribution
            imparted by the fission is neglected in this approach.
STATUS     Data taken from Table I in reference.

CRITIQUE   ** BY AUTHOR ** Application of method with 5He-particle
            energy fixed at 15.4 MeV, as reported by of Cheifetz,
            to data of Loveland for 252Cf, and of D'hondt et al.
            and Caitucoli et al. for 235U(n,f), where the alpha
            spectra extend to ~0.1MeV, leads to ternary 5He yields
            much larger than the 4He data and to very different
            FWHM fit for the two He isotopes.  This is at variance
            with the experimental observation that, for ternary
            particles of the same charge, widths of energy
            disributions are independent of mass.
