FACILITY   (VDGT,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     Titanium nitride (TiN) 300 nm thick layer prepared by
            reactive sputtering onto 0.5-mm thick Ta backing
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 100% efficiency.
           Detector efficiency was calibrated for large volume
            sample.
METHOD     The beam energies of 300 and 1070 keV (middle of the
            yield curve) were chosen for the 278 and 1058 keV
            resonances to obtain the maximum yield.
           Energy loss was calculated by the SRIM code.
           (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC)
            Cyclic activation method :
             - 5 min irradiation with average intensity of 5 uA,
             - 10 or 20 min measurement,
            repeated up to 30 cycles in a single irradiation
            campaign.
           (BCINT) Irradiation were done in a Faraday-cup like
            targetholder to measure the charge carried by the
            beam to the target.
