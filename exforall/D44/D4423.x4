SAMPLE     Solid-state TiN targets were prepared by reactive
           sputtering onto thick Ta backings.
           Targets with thicknesses of 100, 200, and 300 nm
           were used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The targets were irradiated by proton beams of
           about 5 uA on target. The energy range between 600 and
           1500 keV was covered with 50-100 keV energy steps.
           (SITA) Single target irradiation was performed with
           with a cyclic activation. Each irradiation lated for
           5 min which was followed by a 10- or 20-min beam-off
           period used for decay counting.
           (GSPEC) The 511-keV positron-annihilation gamma
           radiation following the 15O decay was measured.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The primary proton energy was determined to a
           precision of better than 1 keV.
           The quoted uncertainties of the effective energy
           takes into account the target thickness, stopping
           power and primary beam energy uncertainties.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the standard way as the square root
           of the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters.

           (ERR-2)detector efficiency (4.0 %)
           (ERR-3)beam intensity (3.0 %)
           (ERR-4)decay data (1.0 %)
