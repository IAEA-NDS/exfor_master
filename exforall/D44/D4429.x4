SAMPLE     High purity natural Sc metalic foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured by using charged
           particle activation method.
           (GSPEC) Activity measurement of the reaction products
           was done by Gamma-spectrometry based on HPGe detectors.
           (STTA) Stacked foil targets were irradiated with
           beam of 100 nA for 1 h.  Primary energy was deduced
           from set-parameters of the cyclotron.
           (EDEG)Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           polynomial approximation of Andersen ad Ziegler.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured nondestructively without chemical separation.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental results were compared to the
           result calculated by the TENDL and EMPIRE theoretical
           model codes.
