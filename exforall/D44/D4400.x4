SAMPLE     High purity 3He gas (99.999%),  in a ~42mm long
           gascell, 23+-2C, ~100mbar.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 100% efficiency
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC) Gas cell closed by 10.5um Al
           windows was irradiated with alpha beam of different
           energies to measure the 7Be activation product
           implanted into the exit window.
           Irradiation were done in a Faraday-cup like
           targetholder with average beam intensity of 0.5-1.4 uA,
           for 16-23h duration.
           Several series of gamma-spectra were recorded to
           be able to follow the decay of 7Be.
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT online data library.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The mid-energy of the beam energy in the cell
           was estimated by SRIM code. Uncertainty of 0.3% initial
           and uncertainty due to the entrance foil stopping
           power and the target gas stopping power.
           The uncertainty of the mid-energy was 0.46-0.52%.
           (ERR-S)   statistical uncertainty  (1.9-2.8%)
           (ERR-SYS) total systematic uncertainty (4.3%)
           (ERR-1)   detector efficiency (2.0%)
           (ERR-2)   gamma intensity (0.4%)
           (ERR-3)   beam current (3.0%)
           (ERR-4)   gas volume (2.4%)
