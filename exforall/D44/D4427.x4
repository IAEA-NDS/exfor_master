FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     Sm2O3 with natural isotopic abundances evaporated
           by an electron beam onto 6um Al backing.
           The areal density of the Sm atoms was measured with
           Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS).
           Thickness of the five targets was in the range of
            (0.5-1.0)E+18 atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (LEGE) A thin crystal high-purity germanium detector
           optimal for the detection of low-energy g-radiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation was done in vacuum with 1 euA beam
           of alpha particles. The lengths of irradiations
           varied between 2 and 24hours.
           (SITA) Targets were irradiated one by one.
           Decay data were taken from the latest nuclear data
           compilation.
           The effective energy calculation is based on the
           energy loss of the beam in the target layer.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the effective energy is
           made up by the uncertainty of the primary beam energy
            (0.3%), the target thickness, and the stopping power
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is
           calculated as the quadratic sum of the error sources.

           (ERR-2) energy loss calculation (5%)
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-4) beam current integration (3%)
           (ERR-5) beam intensity (3%)
