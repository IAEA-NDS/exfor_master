SAMPLE     High purity gold layer with thicknesses between 0.1
           and 0.3 um evaporated onto thin aluminum foil, or
           self-supporting gold foils with thicknesses of
           0.6-0.7 um.
DETECTOR   (LEGE) or LEPS low-energy photon spectrometer
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC) Targets were irradiated one by
           one at different particle energy for 20 - 34 h with
           1 - 2.5 uA beam intensity in a Faraday-cup like
           target holder with -300 V suppression voltage.
           Absolute detector efficiency was determined at 10 cm
           wich then was converted to closer geometry 3 cm by
           measuring the same source at both distances several
           times.
           Spectra were recorded in every hour, than spectra were
           summ up to reduce the statistical uncertainty below
           10%. This spectrum summing was done separately for
           each of the studied peaks.
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT online data library.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The effective energy in each case is taken at
           the middle of the target. The energy loss is
           calculated with SRIM. The energy uncertainty
           determined by the initial beam-energy uncertainty
           of 0.3%. The effect of the target thickness and
           energy loss on beam-energy uncertainty is 0.005-0.05%
           and thus neglected.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty of the cross sections
           are estimated in the  standard way as the square root
           of the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters.
