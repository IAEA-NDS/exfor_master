           (A,,N.Jarmie+,R,LA-2014,1956) Angular distribution of
            neutrons from d(T,n)He-4 reaction was evaluated from
            curves given by N.Jarmie and J.D.Seagrave.
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR SAC) Van De Graaff generator, producing
                   a 4 microAmp beam of 4.2 MeV deuterons.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)Air cooled titanium-tritium disk target 1 mg/cm**2
                   thick, various neutron angles used to obtain
                   different energies.
SAMPLE     -All samples were cylinders of spectroscopically pure
            elements of diameter 10.5 mm and length 49.5 mm.
            Eight such samples used spaced at 20 deg intervals.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation. Eight samples were irradiated
            simultaneously in all cases except silicon. In silicon
            measurement only one sample was irradiated at time.

            Background measured with unirradiated sample in
            rotation at frequent intervals was found to be less
            few percents of counts under photopeak.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) well crystal, 4.4 cm by 5.1 CM, with
                   a cylindrical well 1.3 cm in diameter and
                   4.01 cm deep. For samples counting.
            Before counting the samples were placed in plexiglass
            holder also served to absorb a part of unwanted beta
            activity, that accompanies the gamma rays.
            Empirical measure of "effective" efficiency of crystal
            for the irradiated sources was described in Appendix
            of reference.
            Entire spectrometer was surrounded by 5 cm lead to
            reduce background.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator used as proton recoil
                   spectrometer. Scintillator was 2.0 cm in
                   diameter, 1.0 cm thick, mounted on an EMI
                   6097 photomultiplier and placed at 50 cm
                   from the target at 90 deg to beam direction.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Photopeaks were assumed to have Gaussian shape,
            Compton tails with backgrounds were amused to be given
            by series of exponential.
           (AREA) Area under photo peak was evaluated and standard
            errors were obtained by inverting the normal matrix.
STATUS      Data from publication.
CORRECTION For background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data errors obtained from :
            1.error in area of photopeak.
            2.Errors in absolute efficiency determination of the
              well crystal.
            3.Errors in the d-t angular distribution.
            4.Error in the neutron flux measurement.
            Maximum error in neutron energy was 150 keV.

           disagreement with other exp. data. It was supposed,
            that data of Fig.11 are for Co-59(n,p) reaction, were

           -In the case if these data are for Ni-58(N,P)Co-58-G,
           the reversed order of EN (like for Ni-58(n,2n) reaction
           ,SUBENT 009) could be assumed to obtain reasonable
           agreement with other exp. data and taking into account
            used in this article Q=+0.365 MeV.
           -See also COMMENT in SUBENT 006 to find data, which
            could be probably assumed as Ni-58(N,P)Co58 cross

COMMENT    Of compiler. There are misprints in Table 3 : data for
           this reaction are presented in reverse order.See Fig.13
            of reference. And Fig. of REL-REF, page 3-208.
HISTORY    (20080312A) M.M. Correction was done in according to

ANALYSIS    Only the 1.098 MeV gamma was used. Q=-0.780 MeV was
            given in Table 2 for this reaction.
CRITIQUE   Of compiler. Data given for this reaction in SUBENT 006
           are in disagreement with other exp. data.
           Data presented in this SUBENT 010 are data digitized
           from Fig.11 of reference(marked as Ni-58(n,p) reaction,
           what is probably wrong, because disagrees with other
           exp. data) in according to assumption(of compiler),
            that data for n,p reaction on Ni and Co were jumbled.
            These digitized data are in reasonable agreement with
            other exp. data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-DIG)    Digitizing error of DATA and DATA-ERR.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data were digitized from Fig.11 of reference.
             These data are absent in Table of reference.
             These data has not be found in REL-REF.
