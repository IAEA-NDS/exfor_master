            TIAL CROSS SECTION AT LOW ENERGY-.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) 6 MV EN TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) D(D,N)HE-3 REACTION.
SAMPLE     .MIXTURE OF ORDINARY AND DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE
            POWDERS TO A FOIL THAT WAS ANALYZED WITH ELASTIC
            SCATTERING OF PROTONS.
METHOD     (EDE  ) PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION BY E/DELTA E
            MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SOLID-STATE DETECTOR.
           (PSSSD) POSITION SENSITIVE SOLID STATE DETECTOR IN
            THE 10 MEV MEASUREMENT.
ANALYSIS   .EXPERIMENT WAS A MEASUREMENT OF THE RATIO BETWEEN THE
            N-D AND N-P ELASTIC DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION WHERE
            WHERE THE N-P CROSS SECTION WAS CALCULATED FROM THE
            FORMULA BY LOMON AND WILSON, PHYS.REV,C9,(1974) 1329.
           .MEAN SCATTERING ANGLE IN THE 180 DEGREE DATA WERE
            ABOUT 170 DEGREES AND THE DATA WERE TRANSFERED TO 180
            DEGREE USING DIFFERENT ASSUMED SHAPES OF THE ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) CROSS SECTION CALCULATED USING
            A FORMULA OF LOMON AND WILSON.
COMMENT    .EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS COMPARED WITH THEORETICAL
            CALCULATIONS.

HISTORY    (790806C) CN.
           (790827E)
CORRECTION .A MONTE CARLO COMPUTER CODE WAS USED TO CALCULATE
            THE MEAN LABORATORY ANGLE OF THE RECOILING NUCLEI
            AND THE CORRECTION FACTOR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE
            GEOMETRY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT, THE ANGULAR
            SHAPE OF THE N-P AND N-D ELASTIC CROSS SECTION AND
            THE COULOMB SCATTERING IN THE DELTA E DETECTOR AND
            THE TARGET.
ERR-ANALYS .DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE
            COUNTING STATISTICS, PEAK SUMMATION, BACKGROUND AND
            ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENCES, ENERGY, TARGETS, THE REF-
            ERENCE CROSS SECTION, THE MONTE CARLO TECHNIQUE AND
            THE GEOMETRICAL SETUP. TOTAL ERROR IN THE 8 MEV
            MEASUREMENT IS 1.0 PERCENT AND IN THE 10 MEV MEASURE-
            MENT 1.4 PERCENT IN 180 DEGREES AND 3.0 PERCENT IN
            120 DEGREES. FOR DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS SEE TEXT AND
            TABLES IN REFERENCES.
