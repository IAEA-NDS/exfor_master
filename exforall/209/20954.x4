TITLE       Comparison of the fission characteristics of thermal-
            neutron-induced fission of Pu-239 and the spontaneous
            fission of Pu-240
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) BR 1 graphite reactor.
SAMPLE     .Plutonium acetate, 0.06 mg/cm2, electrosprayed on a
            gold-coated vyns film. About 8.3% Pu-239 and
            about 90% Pu-240. Exact isotopic composition
            given in table 1 in 73ROCH,2,51,1973.
METHOD     (COINC) A two-parameter correlation experiment with
            coincident pulse heights were registered event by
            event.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two large gold-silicon surface barrier
            detectors.
ANALYSIS   .The post-neutron kinetic energy values were
            calculated with a time dependent linear equation and
            the law of conservation of impulse was applied,
            corrected for neutron emission.
PART-DET   (FF   ) Fission fragments.
COMMENT     Total energy balance calculated and values given in
            table 3 in reference.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from Table 2 of 73ROCH,2,51,1973.
CORRECTION .Data corrected for neutron emission using a formula
            obtained by Milton and Fraser.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) .Measurements done in such a way that
            systematic errors cancel and only statistical errors
            have to be taken into account.
