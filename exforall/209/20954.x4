TITLE      -COMPARISON OF THE FISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF THERMAL-
            NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION OF PU-239 AND THE SPONTANEOUS
            FISSION OF PU-240-.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR 1 GRAPHITE REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) THERMAL COLUMN OF THE BR 1 REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .PLUTONIUM ACETATE, 0.06 MG/CM2, ELECTROSPRAYED ON A
            GOLD-COATED VYNS FILM. ABOUT 8.3 PERCENT PU-239 AND
            ABOUT 90 PERCENT PU-240. EXACT ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION
            GIVEN IN TABLE 1 IN REFERENCE.
METHOD     (COINC) A TWO-PARAMETER CORRELATION EXPERIMENT WITH
            COINCIDENT PULSE HEIGHTS WERE REGISTERED EVENT BY
            EVENT.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) TWO LARGE GOLD-SILICON SURFACE BARRIER
            DETECTORS.
ANALYSIS   .THE POST-NEUTRON KINETIC ENERGY VALUES WERE
            CALCULATED WITH A TIME DEPENDENT LINEAR EQUATION AND
            THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF IMPULSE WAS APPLIED,
            CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON EMISSION.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS.
COMMENT     TOTAL ENERGY BALANCE CALCULATED AND VALUES GIVEN IN
            TABLE 3 IN REFERENCE.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.
HISTORY    (790615C) CN.
           (790626E)
CORRECTION .DATA CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON EMISSION USING A FORMULA
            OBTAINED BY MILTON AND FRASER.
ERR-ANALYS .MEASUREMENTS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT SYSTEMATIC
            ERRORS CANCEL AND ONLY STATISTICAL ERRORS HAVE TO BE
            TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
