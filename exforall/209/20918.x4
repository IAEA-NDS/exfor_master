TITLE      -THE C-12(N,ALPHA0)BE-9 REACTION AT 13.9 AND 15.6 MEV-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) NEUTRON INTENSITY AT SAMPLE = 5X10**6 PER
                   CM-SQ PER SEC.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL CARBON 0.4 MG/CM-SQ AND 1.0 MG/CM-SQ THICK
            ON A TANTALUM BACKING.
METHOD     .DIRECT DETECTION OF EMITTED PARTICLES.
DETECTOR   (TELES) COUNTER TELESCOPE CONSISTING OF TWO CO2
                   GAS PROPORTIONAL DELTA-E COUNTERS AND A
                   SILICON SEMICONDUCTOR E COUNTER.
           (LONGC) LONG COUNTER USED TO MONITOR NEUTRON FLUX.
MONITOR    (2-HE-4(N,EL)2-HE-4,,SIG) HELIUM GAS TARGET PLACED
                   IN TARGET POSITION TO CALIBRATE THE NEUTRON
                   FLUX USING A CROSS SECTION CALCULATED FROM
                   THE PHASE SHIFTS OF HOOP AND BARSHALL IN
