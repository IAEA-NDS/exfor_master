TITLE       Neutron depolarization in elastic scattering
FACILITY   .No information given.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-C12) Polarized neutrons from the C12(d,n)
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-FW) - energy spread
SAMPLE     .Five cylindrical samples 5 cm in dia. and 5 cm in
            length with a 2.5 cm hole at the center. Ni, Cu, Al,
            Co, Bi all with natural isotopic compositions.
METHOD     (TOF) A time of flight liquid helium polarimeter.
           .Triple scattering experiment.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) One NE213 liquid scintillator to detect
            neutrons and one 6810A scintillator to detect alpha
            recoils in the helium.
PART-DET   (A) Alphas.
COMMENT    .All data were normalized to the integrated beam
            current.
CORRECTION .The correction for setting the polarization, obtained
            by scattering an unpolarized beam from the sample,
            equal to zero is estimated to be 15 percent at most.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The possible source of errors in the
           detection system was checked and found to be negligable
