TITLE      -(N,ALPHA) REACTION ON C-12 INDUCED BY 14.1 MEV
            NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT-WALTON GENERATOR USED AT 250 KEV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) NEUTRON YIELD ABOUT 5X10**8 SEC-1
SAMPLE     .POLYETHYLENE FOIL 2X2 CM-SQ IN AREA AND 1.3 MG/CM-SQ
            IN THICKNESS SUPPORTED ON A TANTALUM FOIL.
METHOD     .DIRECT DETECTION OF EMITTED ALPHAS USING PULSE
            SHAPE DISCRIMINATION TO REJECT OTHER CHARGED
            PARTICLES.
DETECTOR   (CSICR) HARSHOW CSI(TL) SCINTILLATOR, 20 MM IN DIAM.
                   AND 0.4 MM THICK, USED AS PRIMARY DETECTOR.
                   ENERGY CALIBRATION OF DETECTOR MADE WITH PO
                   AND TH SOURCES. ENERGY RESOLUTION ABOUT 11
                   PER-CENT FOR 5.3 MEV ALPHAS.
           (LONGC) BF-3 LONG COUNTER CALIBRATED WITH A PU-BE

           .ONLY THE TRANSITION TO THE GROUND STATE WAS MEASURED
            BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION OF LOWER ENERGY ALPHAS BY
            THOSE FROM THE C-12(N,3A) REACTION.
COMMENT    .THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION SHOWS PEAKING AROUND 40 DEG
            ANALYSED IN TERMS OF PICK-UP AND KNOCK-ON MODELS,
            AND AT BACKWARD ANGLES ANALYSED IN TERMS OF A HEAVY
