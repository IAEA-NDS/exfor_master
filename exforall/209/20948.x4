TITLE       Intercomparison of the intermediate-energy standard
            neutron fields at the NISUS and MOL-EE
            facilities by means of absolute fission chambers.
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK LON) Thermal column at the reactor at the
            University of London Reactor Centre (NISUS).
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Natural uranium spherical shell in the
            thermal column of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  Intermediate-energy standard neutron field at
            the NISUS facility.
SAMPLE     .Vacuum evaporated oxides onto 0.13 mm thick polished
            platinum backing. Sample mass of U-235 was
            175 (+-1.4%) mu-g/cm2 and isotopic composition was:
             U-235: 99.748+-0.003%  U-238: 0.1261+10.0007%
             U-234: 0.0608+-0.0012% U-236: 0.0652+-0.0012%
METHOD     .Dual triple-scaler with multichannel analyzer.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission chambers.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments.
CORRECTION .Corrections for dead-time loss, undetected fragments,
            fission in other isotopes have been applied. For
            detailed information see table 4 in reference.

            confidence level encompass propagation of,

           (ERR-2) uncertainty in target weight of U-235
                       (denominator)
              * uncertainties in corrections and
           (ERR-3,,0.4) errors in run-to-run flux level

COMMENT    .Run-to-run normalization factors have been obtained
            from a weighted combination of the responses of the
            two fission chamber monitors.
           .Compiler's comment: -  A neutron spectrum of the NISUS
            facility (close to Sig-Sig) is available in the
            IRDF-2002 'Standard spectra' in IRDF-2002 collection
            of the reactor spectra:
