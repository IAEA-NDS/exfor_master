                   THE CU ISOTOPES ONE OF WHICH, CU-63(N,2N) IS
                   SUPERSEDED IN THE PRESENT WORK IN WHICH A
                   MORE RECENT BRANCHING RATIO IS USED. THE
                   THEORETICAL TREATMENT IS ALSO REPRODUCED.

TITLE      -ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION OF ACTIVATION CROSS-SECTIONS
            FOR 14.7 AND 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) VAN DE GRAAFF PRODUCING 300 KEV DEUTERONS.
                   SAMES ACCELERATOR GIVING 140 KEV DEUTERONS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERIUM-TRITIUM, TARGET THICKNESS LARGE
                   COMPARED WITH RANGE OF INCIDENT DEUTERONS.
INC-SPECT  .NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRA FROM TARGET COMPUTED BY THE
            METHOD OF J.BENVENISTE AND J.ZENGER, REPORT NUMBER
            UCRL 4266. MEAN NEUTRON ENERGY WAS 14.7 MEV AT 140
            KEV DEUTERON ENERGY AND 14.8 MEV AT 300 KEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 CM BY 7.6 CM NAI(TL) SCINTILLATOR WHOSE
                   EFFICIENCY WAS CALCULATED USING THEORY FROM
                   THE LITERATURE AND CHECKED WITH A STANDARD
                   NA-22 SOURCE. OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE ON THE
                   PHOTOPEAKS OF THE SPECTRA AND THE PEAK-TO-
                   TOTAL RATIO FOR THE CRYSTAL WAS DETERMINED
                   EXPERIMENTALLY WITH MONOENERGETIC GAMMA RAY
                   EMITTERS.
           (SOLST) SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR PLACED AT
                   150 DEGREES TO THE INCIDENT DEUTERONS TO
                   MONITOR THE NEUTRON FLUX BY DETECTING THE
                   ASSOCIATED ALPHAS.

            2.ISOTOPE DECAY SCHEME.
            3.FINITE SIZE OF NEUTRON SOURCE.
            IN ADDITION ALLOWANCE WAS MADE BY TWO METHODS FOR
            ANY POSSIBLE VARIATION OF NEUTRON PRODUCTION RATE
            DURING THE IRRADIATION.
ERR-ANALYS .DETAILED ERROR BREAKDOWN GIVEN FOR THE CASE OF THE
            CU-63(N,2N) REACTION. FOR OTHER REACTIONS THE ERRORS
            WERE SLIGHTLY LARGER DUE TO POORER STATISTICS AND
            UNCERTAINTIES IN THE DECAY SCHEMES.
