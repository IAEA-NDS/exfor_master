           (J,NAT,216,996,196712) This article, by A.J.Cox and
                   D.Crumpton, gives (n,2n) cross-sections for
                   the Cu isotopes one of which, Cu-63(n,2n) is
                   superseded in the present work in which
                   more recent branching ratio is used. The
                   theoretical treatment is also reproduced.

TITLE       Absolute determination of activation cross-sections
            for 14.7 and 14.8 MeV neutrons
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK BIA) Van de Graaff producing 300 keV deuterons
                   SAMES accelerator giving 140 keV deuterons.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)   Deuterium-tritium, target thickness large
                   compared with range of incident deuterons.
INC-SPECT  .Neutron energy spectra from target computed by the
            method of J.Benveniste and J.Zenger, report number
            UCRL 4266. Mean neutron energy was 14.7 MeV at 140
            keV deuteron energy and 14.8 MeV at 300 keV.
REL-REF    (M,,J.Benveniste+,R,UCRL-4266,1954) Determination of
             the neutron energy spectra from thick targets
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 cm by 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) scintillator whose
                   efficiency was calculated using theory from
                   the literature and checked with a standard
                   Na-22 source. Observations were made on the
                   photopeaks of the spectra and the peak-to-
                   total ratio for the crystal was determined
                   experimentally with monoenergetic gamma ray
                   emitters.
           (SIBAR) Silicon surface barrier detector placed at
                   150 degrees to the incident deuterons to
                   monitor the neutron flux by detecting the
                   associated alphas.
MONITOR    (1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,DA) Associated particle.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for-
            1.gamma self-absorption.
            2.Isotope decay scheme.
            3.Finite size of neutron source.
            In addition allowance was made by two methods for
            any possible variation of neutron production rate
            during the irradiation.

           (ERR-1) Error in geometry factor for alpha detection

           (ERR-11) Uncertainty due to neutron absorption paths
           .In the article it is mentioned that summary of errors
            and estimated values for the reaction 63Cu(n,2n)62Cu.
            The errors quoted on the other cross-sections were
            obtained in a similar manner but are somewhat larger,
            due to increased statistical errors and uncertainties
            in the decay schemes.
