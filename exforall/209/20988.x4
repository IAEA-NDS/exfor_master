INC-SOURCE (D-T ) T(d,n)4He reaction
SAMPLE     Two high-pressure gas scintillators filled with a
           mixture of 135 atm of helium and 15 atm of xenon.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two He-Xe gas scintillators as scatterers
                       and two plastic scintillators
PART-DET   (A) Alpha recoils in the two gas scintillators
           (N) Neutrons in the plastic scintillators
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight spectra of neutrons
                       scattered from second scatterer to plastic
                       scintillators
           (COINC) Fast coincidence between first and second
                       scatterer
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Systematic errors of equal order like the
                       statistical are excluded because of the
                       experimental set-up and the compensation
                       technique.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental result compared with
                       calculated values using a monte carlo
                       computer code
CORRECTION Dead time correction of about 2% have been applied.
