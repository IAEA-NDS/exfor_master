           Description of pulsed-neutron source 'Elliot K-tube'
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.9576) Reactor grade D2O poisoned with
            304.0 +/- 0.5 g of enriched (95.76+/-0.04%) 6Li
            carbonate contained in a large cylindrical steel tank
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two liquid NE311 scintillation counters
            (2 inch diam. x 1 1/2 inch thick.)
METHOD     (SLODT) Decay constant of fast pulse neutrons injected
            to the system reaching to equilibrium with the
            temperature of the moderator was determined, and then
            the absorption cross section was derived from the
            interpolation of the decay constant to an infinite
            system.
ADD-RES    Diffusion constant of pure D2O (2.014+/-0.010)E+5 cm2/s
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
