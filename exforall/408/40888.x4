METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE      For energetic dependence measurements of the CS-ratio
            two samples were used. First - U-235 content is 99.992
            percent, 2-nd - TH-232 content is 100 % .
             For absolute normalization of CS-ratio two samples
            were used: 3-d - U-235 content is 0.36 % , Th-232
            content is 99.64 % . 4-th - U-235 content is 5.48 % ,
            TH-232 content is 94.52 % .
CORRECTION   Neutron background from lab.hall scattering is 3.+-
             0.2 % , that of expt. arraignment - 0.8 %  in the
             energy range 6.8 - 8 MeV . Correction from fis.frag.
             deceleration is 1.5 %  in the fiss.thres. region

FLAG       (1.)  Energies for which cs-ratio was measured for
                 sample number four (Th-232 content 94.52 % ,
                 U-325 content 5.48 % , thickness 260 milligram/
                 cm2). Those energies serve for normalization of
                 cross-section ratio
