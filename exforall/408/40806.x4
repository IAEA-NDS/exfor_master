EXP-YEAR   (1954)
SAMPLE     Spherical samples of metallic U of external diameter
           4cm, internal diameter 3.4 cm, aperture diameter 2.1cm,
           were covered by Cd of 0.9mm thick and placed in
           a thin-walled brass container.
           Natural and enriched 90.1% U-235 samples.
METHOD     (SHELT)   Spherical shell transmission
            Ratio of detector sensitivities to 14 MeV neutrons and
            to neutrons from nonelastic processes - 0.874+-0.030.
DETECTOR   (BF3)  BF3 counter in graphite prism.
CORRECTION Inelastic scattering and (n,3n) reactions were
           neglected.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not explained.
