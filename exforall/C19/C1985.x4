DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16
           cm thick lead shield.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) The gamma rays from the decay of
           13B excited states were detected by an array of 38
           cylindrical NaI(Tl) detectors which completely
           surrounded the target. Recoiling 13B core fragments
           were momentum analyzed using the S800 spectrograph.
           The targets of Be and Au were 228 and 256 mg/cm2
           thick, respectively, chosen to produce an energy
           straggling of about the same magnitude as the
           resolution of the spectrograph. Time-of-flight
           information over a distance of 70 m combined with
           the energy loss and total energy signal obtained with
           a segmented ion chamber and a 5 cm thick plastic
           scintillator, respectively, were used to identify and
           measure the yields of the fragments in the focal
           plane of the spectrograph. Two x/y position-sensitive
           cathode-readout drift chambers in the focal plane
           were used to determine the momentum and angle
           information of the fragments.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) An energy spectrum of gamma rays in coincidence
           with 13B fragments has been transformed into the
           projectile rest frame using the position of the
           incident g ray measured in the NaI array, which
           allows for Doppler correction on an event-by-event
           basis via Monte-Carlo simulation using the code
           GEANT. The simulation took into account Doppler
           broadening, the distortion of the shapes caused by
           the back transformation to the projectile rest frame,
           and the calculated gamma-ray detection efficiencies.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall error in these cross sections are
           of the order of 18% mostly due to systematic
           uncertainties.

           in the beam 12%.
