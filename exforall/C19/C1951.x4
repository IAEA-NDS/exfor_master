FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed using 800 MeV
           1H+ ions at the LANSCE accelerator facility in the
           Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) Blue Room.
SAMPLE     Natural Terbium foils with diameter of 24.7mm,
           thickness of 80.4 mg/cm2 and purity of 99.9%. Target
           foils were sandwiched between single 25 mu-m thick
           Kapton tape, which served as a catcher for recoil
           ions.Two target foil stacks were irradiated in the
           measurement of the data reported here. The first
           stack included only two terbium foils and accepted a
           beam current of 49 +- 3 nA for approximately 0.5
           hours. The second stack, comprised of 10 terbium
           foils, was irradiated for 10.4 +- 0.1 hours with an
           average beam current of 50 +- 4 nA
DETECTOR   (HPGE)The HPGe detector used to assay the foils was a
           p-type Al-window ORTEC GEM detector with a relative
           efficiency at 1333 keV of about 10% and a measured
           FWHM at 1333 keV of 1.99 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,CUM,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The activity at the end of bombardment of each
           isotope of interest was determined by fitting of
           its decay curve.
DECAY-DATA Gamma energies and intensities were taken by authors
           from NNDC online databases.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainties in linear regressions fitted parameters
           were computed from covariance matrices as the standard
           error in the activity extrapolated to the end of
           bombardment.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in detector calibration
                   and geometry
           (ERR-2) Syst. uncertainty in target foil dimensions
           (ERR-3,6.7,8.1) Systematic uncertainty in proton flux
                           determination
