DETECTOR   (PROPC) Cerium activities produced from the reactions
           on Ce142 and the Ce141 produced by the decay of La141
           were both counted with end-window proportional
           counters.

FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL)Irradiations took place using
           circulating beam of the Brookhaven Cosmotron at
           proton energies of 1.0 Bev and above.
SAMPLE     Natural Cerium in the form of Ce02was used in the
           experiment. All targets were prepared by forming a
           slurry of spectroscopically pure Ce02 in acetone and
           allowing this mixture to settle in a large glass
           chimney onto a piece of 0.003-inch aluminum foil.
           The target consisted of an aluminum-Ce02 mat plus
           an additional 3-mil aluminum foil to be used to
           monitor the proton beam

SAMPLE     The targets were prepared by the evaporation of
           metallic barium on 0.003-inch aluminum foil to a
           thickness of about 0.5 mg/cm2. A thin coating of
           aluminum was evaporated on top of the barium to

           barium films were irradiated in a stack, with
           aluminum absorbers suitably interposed to obtain
           various alpha-particle energies below the 42-MeV
           maximum energy of the beam.
