SAMPLE     Stopping natural boron target. Stopping sulfur
           hexafluoride gas  cell.
DETECTOR   (BGO,SCIN) The detector was 4 in. long and 4 in.
           diameter cylindrical BGO detector from St. Gobain
           with integrally mounted photomultiplier tube fitted
           with a Hamamatsu base.
PART-DET   (G) The measurements are for only the indicated
           gamma-rays. Neutrons are  excluded by time-of-flight
           gating in the B(d,gamma 15.1) measurements, and  the
           alphas through atmospheric stopping in the F(p,a gamma)
            measurements.
METHOD     (PHD,TOF) The normalization of the pulse height
           spectra was completed by comparing the integrated
           counts in the energy regions of interest to those in
           the associated MCNP5 modeled pulse height spectra. A
           pulsed and bunched incident beam allowed for signal
           gating on time-of-flight spectra in order to reduce
           background in the measurements.
ANALYSIS   The detector response function for both measurements
           was modeled using MCNP5.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error analysis does include the values for
           total errors, both  statistical and systematical
           estimates are included.
COMMENT    Private Communication from K.W.Cooper, the journal
           article is in preparation.
