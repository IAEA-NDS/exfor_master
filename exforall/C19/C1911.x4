FACILITY   (MESON,1USALAS)
INC-SOURCE LAMPF external proton beam with the stripped H+ beam
           at 800 MeV.
SAMPLE     The targets were 5 cm x 5 cm x 0.181 g/cm2 and 0.354
           g/cm2 NE 102 plastic scintillators.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) crystals.
PART-DET   (AR)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,BGCT) The 11C activity, which is 100%
           beta+ decay to 11B, was measured after bombardment
           using the a beta+gamma-gamma coincidence technique.
           Each NaI windowed the 0.511 MeV annihilation
           photopeak pulses. A gamma-gamma coincidence between
           the two indicated a beta+ decay in a scintillator.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The beta+, gamma-gamma, and beta+gamma-gamma
           counts were all multiscaled and fitted to a half-life
           curve with 11C 1224 sec half-life, and each had a
           xi2/(degree of freedom) of approximately one.

           (TABLE) Data were taken from the abstract, page 753.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty is solely based on the
           uncertainty in the ion chamber,  beam intensity
           measurements. Statistical errors are negligible.
           (ERR-1) 1% dead time for beta+ counting.
           (ERR-2) 2% Background for NaI gamma-gamma counting.
COMMENT    Final cross section value based on the measurement of
           two different thickness targets.
