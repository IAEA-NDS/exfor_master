TITLE      Excitation Functions of the (p,pn) and (p,2p)
           Reactions on Ce142 at 60 - 233 MeV

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAROC) Experiment performed at the internal
           proton beam of the Rochester 130-in. synchrocyclotron
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure cerium dioxide was used as the
           target material. The target contained approximately
           100 mg of CeO2
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Samples were counted on an end-window,
           methane-flow beta proportional counter
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)Indirect method which involved determining
           La141 by counting the daughter Ce141. Within 15 min
           after termination of the bombardment the CeO2 target
           material was quantitatively dissolved in 10M HNO3 and
           made up to a known volume.Two aliquots were taken,
           one of which was allowed to stand until all the 4-hr
           La141 had decayed to Ce141. Cerium was immediately
           separated and precipitated as the oxalate from the
           other aliquot by the method of Glendenin et al. The
           aliquot which had been allowed to stand until the
           La141 had decayed to Ce141 was treated in identical
           fashion, giving a second oxalate sample for counting
           which contained Ce141 from the (p,pn) reaction plus
           that from the decay of the (p,2p) product La141.
           Chemical yields were determined gravimetrically by
           ignition of the oxalate to Ce02 after counting was
           complete.
