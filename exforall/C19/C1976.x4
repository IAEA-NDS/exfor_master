FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT)Experiment performed at FN Tandem
           accelerator at the University of Notre Dame using
           TwinSol facility
SAMPLE     Enriched 58Ni foil, with thicknesses of 426 mu-g/cm2,
           used for the measurements at 12.7 and 11.5 MeV
           Enriched 58Ni foil, with thicknesses of 924mu-g/cm2,
           used for the measurements at 10.2 MeV.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Protons were detected using dE-E
           telescopes optimized to detect protons at backward
           angles. Their dE detectors stopped backscattered low
           energy alpha particles. Telescopes were placed at
           backward angles of 117, 132, 147, and 162 deg. Two
           additional dE-E telescopes were placed at forward
           angles of +41 deg and -47deg for detection of
           elastically scattered particles.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT)Secondary beam produced by elastic scattering
           of primary He3 beam on Be foil was used in this
           experiment. Elastically scattered primary beams of
           16.5, 15.2, and 13.9 MeV, produced secondary beams
           with laboratory energies at the center of the target
           of 12.7, 11.5, and 10.2 MeV, respectively. This method
           was used, because it served the additional purpose of
           determining the contribution of the He3 contaminant
           beam to the proton yield in companion experiment.
CORRECTION Corrected for backward scattered proton from target
           holder and shielding.
