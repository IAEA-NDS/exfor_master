FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Irradiations at 200 MeV were performed
           at Alamos Neutron Science Center(LANSCE) facility
           using the dual-energy capability of the 800 MeV
           side-coupled cavity linac. Irradiations at 100 MeV
           were performed at the LANSCE Isotope Production
           Facility, using proton beam from a drift tube linac
SAMPLE     Natural Th target was used. A target stack comprised
           six foil packets,each packet containing two thorium
           foils and one aluminum monitor foil. Natural thorium
           foils were of 99.7% purity.The foils had the
           dimensions of approximately 2.5cm x 2.5 cm and had
           thicknesses ranging from 60.5 to 70.5 mg/cm2.
           A similar sized aluminum beam current monitoring foil
           of 99.9% purity with a thickness of approximately
           65 mg/cm2 was incorporated downstream of each set of
           thorium foils. All foils were sandwiched between
           single layers of 25 mu-m thick Kapton tape, which
           served as a catcher foil for recoil ions.
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE)The thorium foils were counted on an ORTEC
           GEM10P4-70 detector with a relative efficiency of 10%,
           while the aluminum foils were counted on a Princeton
           Gamma-tech lithium-drifted germanium Ge(Li)detector
           with a relative efficiency of 13.7%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were determined from analysis
           of gamma ray decay curves, followed over period of
           several months.

ANALYSIS   Cross sections were determined from analysis
           of gamma ray decay curves, followed over period of
           several months.
