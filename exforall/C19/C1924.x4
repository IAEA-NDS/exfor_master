FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Measurements were carried out at the
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at
           the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
SAMPLE     (42-MO-100,ENR=0.97) Enriched Mo target with
           thickness of 0.976mg/cm2.The beam passed through a
           0.286 mg/cm2 C degrader foil before striking the
           tilted (45deg) 100Mo target. All recoils formed were
           implanted in a single Al catcher foil of thickness
           8.1 mg/cm2 tilted an angle of 45deg with respect to
           the beam direction
