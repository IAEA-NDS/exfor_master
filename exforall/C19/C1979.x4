TITLE      N15(p,p2n)N13 Reaction Induced by Protons of Energy
           0.4 to 6.2 BeV

DETECTOR   (PROPC) An end window, methane gas-flow, proportional
           beta counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BSPEC,INTB,STTA) The boron nitride powder was
           held in place by two aluminum foils. Two additional
           aluminum foils were placed behind the target. All
           irradiation between 0.4 and 0.72 GeV were performed
           at the Berkeley 184-in synchrocyclotron while those
           between 2.0 and 6.2 GeV were carried out at Berkeley
           Bevatron.
DECAY-DATA (7-N-13,10.MIN,B+)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The number of counts per minute, at the end
           of bombardment, was obtained from the decay curve by
           resolution of the 10 min N-13 from the other
           activities (mainly 20.5-min C-11) detected. This was
           done by making the decay curve analysis first by hand
           and then with the aid of an IBM-704 least square
           program called "Frenic". The least square program
           gave the number of counts of each component and its
           standard deviation.
ERR-ANALYS The following systematic errors have been
           identified:
           (ERR-1) Al-27(p,3pn)Na-24 reaction at 6%
           (ERR-2) Overall detection coefficient at 2%.
           (ERR-3,1.,8.) Decay curve analysis
           (ERR-4,1.,10.) Target thickness uniformity and energy
           spread of proton beam: 10% for synchrocyclotron
           and 1% for bevatron.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG) reaction cross section is
           10.7 +- 0.6 mb from 0.4  to 6.2 GeV.

SAMPLE     Boron nitride target (B3N3). The thickness of the
           powder was 20 to 30 mg/cm2. The pellet target serves
           merely to  check the values of cross sections because
           a powder does not  provide as uniform a target and
           source for beta counting as a  pellet target.
