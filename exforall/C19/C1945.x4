TITLE      Cross section for the 27Al(p,2pi+)28Mg reaction at
           800 MeV

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Measurements were performed at the
           end of proton Line B of the Los Alamos Meson Physics
           Facility (LAMPF).
SAMPLE     High-purity (99.999%) Al foil sandwiched between one
           front and one back very thin Al monitor foil, each
           1.50-mg/cm thick, and then wrapped in an envelope of
           the thinner Al material.The three primary target
           foils were 7.20, 34.47, and 70.82 mg/cm2 thick, and
           were irradiated with 800-MeV protons for about 10, 5,
           and 1 pA h, respectively. This target packet design
           provided for complete compensation for recoil losses
           of Mg from the primary target foils of Na from the
           monitor foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,GELI) Induced gamma activities were measured
           using calibrated Ge(Li) or intrinsic Ge gamma-ray
           spectrometers.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Each primary Al target foil (having the
           identical area of the monitor foils) was dissolved
           with HCl in the presence of Mg carrier, and the
           solution was radiochemically processed to recover and
           purify the Mg fraction.
           (ACTIV) Only radiations from 21-h Mg and its daughter
           2.25- min Al were observed in the gamma-ray spectrum,
           and the yield of Mg was determined from the intensity
           of the 1779-keV gamma-ray that accompanies every
           decay of the Al in equilibrium with Mg.
