FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment conducted at Los Alamos
           National Laboratory using Los Alamos Neutron Science
           Center(LANSCE)accelerator facility
SAMPLE     Natural thorium foils of 99.7% purity were used. Two
           foils were used as targets for this experiment, each
           measuring 2.5cm x 2.5 cm and having thicknesses of
           48.1 and 52.8 mg/cm2. Aluminum beam monitoring
           foil with the same dimensions and a thickness of
           65.3mg/cm2 was incorporated downstream of the thorium
           targets. All foils were sandwiched between single
           layers of Kapton tape with a thickness of 25 mu-m,
           which served as a catcher foil for recoil ions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,GELI) One thorium foil was initially counted on
           a PGT Ge(Li) detector with a relative efficiency of
           13.7%. The HPGe detector used for additional
           measurement had efficiency of 10%
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,CUM,SIG)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were determined from analysis
           of gamma ray decay curves, followed over period of
           several months.
ANALYSIS   The 225Ac, 223,225Ra,and 227Th activities at EOB were
           calculated by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo
           analysis of the measured decay curves.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty obtained by summing in
                   quadrature following uncertainties
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in detector efficiency
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in counting geometry
           (ERR-3,2.0,10.0) Uncertainty in branching ratio
                            and peak area
