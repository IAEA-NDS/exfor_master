FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) The experiment was carried out at the
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF).
DETECTOR   (MCPLT,IOCH)Two carbon-foil-based microchannel plate
           timing detectors were used to monitor
           the beam and provide timing references. The
           evaporation residues were detected by a downstream
           MCP and a zero-degree ionization chamber.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight and energy loss were used to
           identify the evaporation residues using inverse
           kinematics.
INC-SOURCE Neutron rich radioactive Sn isotopes were produced by
           proton induced uranium fission, ionized, mass selected
           and accelerated. Highly enriched Sn beams were
           obtained by introducing sulfur to the ion source to
           make SnS+ molecular ions that were subsequently broken
           up in the charge exchange cell. Beams of 126,127,128Sn
           and 132Sn energies were accelerated
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
