TITLE      Interactions of 28-MeV Protons with Helium-4

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) Experiment was performed by admitting
           the linear accelerator proton beam directly into a
           cloud chamber filled with helium.
SAMPLE     Helium gass in the cloud chamber
DETECTOR   Cloud chamber was used to detect charged particles.
           Cloud-chamber technique was capable of associating
           the inelastic protons with the various types of
           reactions that produced them since particle ionization,
           momentum of charged particles, and the number of
           charged particles per event could be determined.
           The cloud chamber was mounted between a pair of
           pulse-operated Helmholtz coils that produced a magnetic
           field 7000 gauss transverse to the beam. The
           sensitive volume of the cylindrical cloud chamber was
            16 in. in diameter and 6 in. deep, and it contained
            13 atmospheres of helium with water vapor. Pictures
           were taken every 2 minutes.
