TITLE      Angular Distribution of 30.6 MeV Protons Elastically
           Scattered by Be, C, and Al
AUTHOR     (B.T.Wright)

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detector for the elastically scattered
           protons was a 12 mm stilbene crystal cube cemented
           onto the type 5819 photomultiplier with a cement
           polystyrene dissolved in xylene. A hemispherical dome,
           chromium plated and polished, was placed over the
           crystal.
METHOD     (PHD) A record on the film was made of the deflection
           on an oscilloscope due to the pulses caused by 30.6
           Mev protons elastically scattered at a small angle by
           a thin gold foil. The data for the scattering from Be,
            C, and Al were taken electronically. Eight scales
           were set at differing discriminator levels to form a
           seven channel pulse height analyzer with two volt
           windows for pulses in the neighborhood of 70 volts.
           For each observation, a pulse height analysis of this
           kind was made, and the inelastic events were thus
           separated from the elastic events.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Of the various sources of uncertainty in
           the above results i. e. the collected charge, the
           foil surface density, the foil composition, the
           geometry, the background counting rate, the
           statistics of counting, and the determination of the
           proper separation between the elastic and inelastic
           events; the last two mentioned are by far the most
           important. From the histograms, an estimate of the
           uncertainty in the separation of elastic from
           inelastic events was made. This estimate, combined
           with the total number of counts in the elastic peak,
           forms the basis for the uncertainties indicated for a
           number of points on each of the curves in Figures.
           The combined estimated uncertainty (probable error)
           ranges from 8% at small angles to 18% at some of the
           largest angles of scattering.
COMMENT    For each element for angles of scattering less than
           30 degrees, phi was set at 90 degrees, and the
           scattering was observed on both sides of the beam,
           Plus and Minus angles. For larger angles, phi was set
           at 45 degrees, and the observations were made on only
           one side of the beam.
