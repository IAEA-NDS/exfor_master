FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)
           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using the
           A1200 Fragment Separator(FRS).
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.

METHOD     (EDE,GSPEC,TOF,COINC,EXTB)
ANALYSIS   (PGS,INTAD) To determine excitation probabilities,
           GEANT simulations were performed for the g-rays that
           were expected to be observed in the experiment. To
           test the simulations, the efficiency of the array was
           measured with a standard 88Y source. The decay from a
           given state was modeled by taking the appropriate
           linear combinations of the simulated spectra using
           experimental branching ratios reported for 19Ne.
           These branching ratios themselves have measurement
           uncertainties, but the errors are correlated since
           the sum of the branching ratios must add up to 1. An
           error in the branching ratios, then, would
           simultaneously overpredict one branch and
           underpredict another, the net result being a
           second-order systematic effect which is much smaller
           than the statistical uncertainties in our
           measurement. The normalizations of these summed,
           simulated spectra for each state were then treated as
           free parameters in a MINUIT xi2 minimization to best
           fit the observed g-ray spectrum. A broad Gaussian near
           5.3 MeV was also required to fit the data; it may
           describe unresolved decay from Ex>5 MeV states for
           which little g spectroscopic information is known.
           All cross sections are corrected for photon angular
           acceptance bias by integrating the angular
           distributions calculated for the dominant peak in the
           deexcitation spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical and systematical uncertainties
           were reported separately in some cases.
           (ERR-1,,13.) insufficient knowledge of branching ratio
           for deexcitation of 1.536 MeV state.
COMMENT    Only positively identified transitions from the 1.536,
            1.616 and 4.6 MeV levels were compiled.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by authors.

COMMENT    Cross sections determined by measuring gammas at an
           angle(CM) between 0 and 5.0 deg. The gammas being
           produced by inelastic scattering of Ne-19 on Au-197,
           leaving Ne-19 at the excited level of 1536, 1616 and
           4600 keV.
FLAG       (1.) Luck of knowledge of mixing ratios for
           deexcitation of 1.536 MeV state may introduce a
           systematic +-13% cross section uncertainty.
