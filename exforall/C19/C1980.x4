PART-DET   (P,D)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Protons and deuterons were detected by
           scintillators and spark chambers.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF) The detection apparatus was a coincidence
           spectrometer. On the basis of the known spatial
           resolution of the spark chambers and the reaction
           kinematics it was expected that a sufficient
           criterion to reject inelastic events for proton
           angles greater than 95 degrees in the laboratory
           would be the angular correlation of the proton and
           deuteron. For proton laboratory angles smaller than
           95 degrees selection of the deuteron by time of
           flight and proton energy by range were considered
           necessary to reduce the inelastic contributions to
           manageable levels.
SAMPLE     A single CD2, target (hydrogen content less  than 2%)
           0.202 cm thick by 10 cm by 10 cm  was used throughout
           the experiment.
ANALYSIS   As soon as the information associated with each event
           was placed in buffer regions of the computer memory,
           an attempt at geometrical reconstruction was made
           directly on line, allowing a check of the progress of
           the experiment. To avoid the need of maintaining one of
           the c.m. solid angles larger than the other to
           minimize border and resolution effects, we classified
           the events in bins on the proton scattering angle
           thetap and displayed for each of these bins the
           complete correlation spectrum in the sum angles
            (thetap+thetad). The cross section for each proton
           bin of width delta thetap around thetap was
           calculated with standard formalism.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors in Tables I to IV are statistical
           only. Possible systematic errors are as follows: (a)
           at a given energy, over the angular range presented,
           5%, this number includes 3% uncertainty in the target
           areal density and 4% error in efficiency; (b) from one
           energy to any other, 8%; the latter number includes 5%
           for the 12C(p,pn)11C cross-section  uncertainty, 1.5%
           for statistics in the monitor calibration, and 5% for
           uncertainties on beam characteristics reproducibility
           beam-spot size, position at the monitor target, and
           divergence.
