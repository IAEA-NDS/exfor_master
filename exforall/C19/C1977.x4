FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Irradiations at the energy of 800 MeV
           were performed in the 'Blue Room' at the Los Alamos
           National Laboratory's Neutron Science Center
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER)Irradiations at the energy of 1.4 GeV
           were conducted at CERN ISOLDE facility using the
           RABBIT system. Exposures were also carried out in air
           with the 23 GeV beam at the IRRADIATION 1 Facility at
           the CERN PS East Hall.
SAMPLE     At 800 Mev the Te target was fabricated from 99.9999%
           pure Te Alpha Aesar metallic powder that was pressed
           into a 6.9-mm thick disk that had 93.4% of normal Te
           metal density.A stack consisted of 6.4 mm thick
           polyethylene in front of the Te target and then an
           aluminum backing of 2 mm thickness. Polyethylene and
           Al foils served for beam monitoring purposes.
           A telluride crystals TeO2 with mass of 0.457 g and
           irregular shape was irradiated at the 1.4 GeV beam of
           ISOLDE. At the energy of 23 GeV two samples were
           used. A crystal of TeO2 of irregular shape with a
           mass of 0.428 g and a larger TeO2 crystal of 23x22 mm
           sides and 1.6 mm thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Several HPGe detectors were used to measure
           induced activity of irradiated samples with
           efficiency from 25% relative efficiency n-type
           coaxial high purity germanium detector to 80%
           relative efficiency high purity germanium detector
           used at LBNL's Low Background Facility. Samples
           irradiated at CERN were measured using 40% efficiency
           detector in CERN and later using 30% to 60% relative
           efficiency detectors at the low- radioactivity
           laboratory of INFN and the University of
           Milano-Bicocca.
METHOD     (ACTIV)Samples were irradiated for several minutes.
           For measurement of short lived products the delay
           times between irradiation and activity measurements
           varied from 1200 sec to 10 hours and counting times
           from 1000 sec to 10 days. Long lived products were
           measured for period up to several days after delay
           varying from 16  days to several years for a period
           of several days up to 1 year.
