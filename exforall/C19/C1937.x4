                                                described.
FACILITY   (LASER,1USAROC) Measurement performed at the
           University of Rochester OMEGA Laser Facility.
SAMPLE     The target was a CH plastic shell of thickness 15 -
           30 mu-m and an outer diameter of approximately 1 mm,
           filled with 15 atm of gaseous D-T fuel in a ratio of
           D/T approx. 65/35.
METHOD     D-T reaction under condition of inertial confinement
           fusion (ICF) was used to determine n/gamma branching.
           To achieve D+T implosions, 60 laser beams at wavelength
           of 351 nm, with a total energy of 23 - 28 kJ, were
           focused on the target at chamber center (TCC) for a
           duration of 1 ns. Gamma rays produced in D+T->5He
           reaction and neutrons produced in D+T -> 4He + n
           were directly measured.
DETECTOR   Two gas Cherenkov detectors were used to detect high
           energy gamma rays. One of them used 1.5-cm-thick and
           7-cm-diameter beryllium disk to convert gamma rays to
           Compton electrons and pressurized CO2 (variable up to
           100 psi) as Cherenkov radiator. Cherenkov light was
           relayed via Cassegranian optics to a Photek ultrafast
           microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP). CO2 gas
           pressure was fixed at 100 psia corresponding to a
           Cherenkov production energy threshold of 6.3 MeV.
           The second Cherenkov counter used Al converter and SF6
           gas at pressure of 87 psia as Cherenkov radiator.
           Energy threshold was 5 MeV.
           (SCIN) Neutrons from D+T reaction were detected using
           ultrafast scintillators BC-422 and BC-422Q coupled to
           either a single-stage (gain up to 1E+3) MCP PMT and/or
           a two-stage (gain up to 1E+6) MCP PMT.
           Another neutron detector prototype was based on a
           synthetic diamond wafer produced by the chemical vapor
           deposition.
