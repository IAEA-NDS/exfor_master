TITLE      First determination of an astrophysical cross section
           with a bubble chamber: The 15N(alpha,gamma)19F reaction

REFERENCE  (J,PL/B,719,74,2013)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USATNL)Experiment performed at the HIgS
           facility at Duke University
SAMPLE     Sample was superheated C4F10 liquid. The length of
           the liquid target irradiated by the beam was
           determined to be 3.0+-0.1 cm.
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) The buble chamber was used for the first time
           for cross section measurement. The sample and at the
           same time the buble chamber medium - the C4F10 liquid
           was contained in a cylindrical glass vessel with a
           length of 10.2 cm and an outer diameter of 3.8 cm.
           Detector is insensitive to a gamma ray beam at least
           at a level of one part in 1E+9. Pictures of the
           superheated liquid were taken at 10 ms intervals by
           two CCD cameras mounted at 90deg relative to each
           other. The images were analyzed in real time by a
           computer and when a bubble was detected, the pressure
           in the glass vessel was increased within 40 ms of
           bubble formation from 160 to 900 kPa. This led to a
           quenching of the growing bubble thus preventing a
           boiling runaway of the liquid. The size of the
           bubbles was typically 1 to 2 mm and their location
           could be determined to a precision better than 1 mm.
METHOD     The 15N(alpha,gamma)19F reaction was studied via the
           time inverse 19F(gamma,alpha)15N process.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Narrow bandwidth photon beam was generated by
           intracavity Compton backscattering of
           free-electron-laser light from high-energy electron
           beam bunches circulating in electron storage ring.
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL) Cross sections were obtained using the
           reciprocity theorem for nuclear reactions, which
           relates the cross sections of forward and time-inverse
           nuclear processes.
