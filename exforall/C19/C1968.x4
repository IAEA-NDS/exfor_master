FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment was performed at the Nuclear
           Science Lab at the University of Notre Dame using
           FN tandem accelerator
SAMPLE     Helium gas cell target separated by a 2.5 mu-m thick
           Ni foil (99.95%) from the beamline. High-purity helium
           filled the gas cell at the pressure of 5 Torr. The
           pressure and flow was controlled by a gas handling
           system which held the gas cell at constant pressure.
           A 0.25 mm thick Al foil (99.999%) was placed 24 cm
           from the entrance foil to collect the 36Cl produced.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Inverse kinematics was used and forward going
           reaction products 36Cl were collected by a Al foil
           (AMS) Samples, chemicaly treated to form AgCl were
           measured using atomic mass spectroscopy with the
           Magnet for Astrophysical Nucleosynthesis studies
           Through Isobar Separation (MANTIS) AMS system at the
           Nuclear Science Lab
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) AMS used Browne-Buechner spectrograph in
           which the ions are bent in a 1 m radius in a single
           dipole magnet equipped with two detectors.
           (PGAC)Parallel-Grid Avalanche Counter was placed at
           the exit of dipole magnet and gives the magnetic
           rigidity of the beam
           (IOCH) A 4-way split anode Ionization Chamber was
           placed atop the PGAC
ANALYSIS   The number of 36Cl nuclei produced, Y = 5.78E+9 atoms,
           was found by taking the amount of chlorine added to
           the sample during chemical processing (55 mg) and the
           36Cl/Cl concentration determined from the AMS
           measurement. Energy interval represents energy loss
           of incident particles in the target.
