FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           Coupled-Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 376 mg/cm2
           mounted at the target position of the S800 magnetic
           spectrograph
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Outgoing 44S particles were momentum analyzed
           in S800 spectrograph and identified by detectors in
           S800 focal plane
           (SCIN,IOCH) Outgoing particles were identified by
           time of flight using scintillation detectors in focal
           plane and by energy loss in the S800 ionization chamber
           (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted by excited reaction
           products were detected with the Segmented Germanium
           Array (SeGA) of 32-fold segmented high-purity
           germanium detectors in coincidence with 44S particles
           detected in the focal plane of the S800 spectrometer
METHOD     (EDE,COINC,TOF)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) A cocktail beam including 16% 45Cl was
           produced by fragmentation of a 140 MeV/nucleon 48Ca
           primary beam incident on a 705 mg/cm2 9Be
           fragmentation target. Components of the secondary
           beam were separated in the A1900 fragment separator.
           Incoming 45Cl particles were identified using time of
           flight measured between scintillators mounted at the
           extended focal plane of the A1900 and at the object
           position of the S800 analysis line
