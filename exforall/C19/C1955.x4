           208Pb(3He,pi-)211At reaction

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU) Experiment performed using separated-
           sector isochronous cyclotron at the Indiana
           University Cyclotron Facility.
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.9914) Several enriched 208Pb targets
           with thickness of 10 - 200 mg/cm2 were used
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Several Si surface barrier detectors with
           efficiencies of 7 - 15 % were used to measure alpha
           activity of product nucleus 211At.
METHOD     (ACTIV,RCHEM) Activation method was used. Samples
           irradiated for periods from 2 to 8 hours were
           radiochemically separated and their alpha activity
           determined. The radiochemical yields were
           typically 35 %.
ANALYSIS   Two alpha decay branches at energies of 5.87 and
           7.45 MeV were measured, final result is the average
           value of both measurements
