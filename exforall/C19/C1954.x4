TITLE      Irradiation of strontium chloride targets at proton
           energies above 35 MeV to produce PET radioisotope Y-86
AUTHOR     (D.G.Medvedev,L.F.Mausner,S.C.Srivastava)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
REFERENCE  (J,RCA,99,755,2011)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABNL) Measurements were performed at
           Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Radioassays were carried out by counting an
           aliquot of the solution on an HPGe detector
METHOD     (CHSEP) Separation of produced Y isotope from
           irradiated SrCl2 targets was carried out using the
           radioactive tracer method
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No uncertainties given

SAMPLE     Thin Sr(Cl)2 sample was prepared from Strontium
           chloridehexahydrate by heating to 650 deg C. Salt was
           then pressed at 22.5 tons in a stainless steel target
           base into pellet with diameter of 3.18 cm A 0.3 mm
           inconel window was electron beam-welded onto the
           stainless steel base to seal the target.
