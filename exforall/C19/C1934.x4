FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiments were performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 188+-4 mg/cm2, placed at
           the object point of the S800 spectrograph
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Primary beam was selected by fragment
           separator A1900. Reaction product were momentum
           analyzed by the S800 spectrograph. Charged reaction
           products were identified using detector system in
           focal plane.
           (DRFTC) Cathode-readout drift chambers measured the
           coordinates in the S800 focal plane, which allowed
           reconstruction of momentum of outgoing reaction
           products.
           (IOCH) Energy loss was measured in the ionization
           chamber, which together with the time of flight
           information between A1900 and S800 focal planes
           allowed clear identification of the knockout residues.
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected with SeGa array,
           which surrounded the 9Be target. Array consisted of
           17 highly segmented HPGe detectors, which allowed for
           event by event Doppler effect correction.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in beam intensity
