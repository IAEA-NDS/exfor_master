INSTITUTE  (1USAMSU,1USARUT,1USAORL)
REFERENCE  (J,PRL,108,122501,2012)
FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           NSCL Coupled Cyclotron Facility
SAMPLE     Natural Li target with thickness of 5.5 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Photons emitted from excited states populated
           in the reaction were detected in the segmented
           germanium array (SeGA). Fifteen, 32-fold segmented
           high-purity Ge detectors were arranged in a closely
           packed configuration around the target, with crystal
           axes parallel to the beam axis and at a distance of
           13.2 cm, covering laboratory polar angles between
           40deg and 140deg.
           (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analysed in
           S800 spectrograph and identified on event by event
           basis by set of detectors in focal plane of the S800
           spectrometer
           (DRFTC,SCIN) Angles and positions in the dispersive
           and nondispersive planes were measured using two
           Cathode Readout Drift Counters. Thin plastic
           scintillators was used for time of flight measurement
           and a 5-mm thick plastic scintillator placed in the
           focal plane was used for energy loss measurement.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) A 120 MeV/u beam of 18-O was impinged upon a
           1904 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target. An 80 MeV/u 12B secondary
           beam (with purity exceeding 99%) was separated from
           other fragmentation products using a 405 mg=cm2 thick
           aluminum wedge placed at the intermediate image of the
           A1900 fragment separator. The momentum acceptance of
           the separator was 0.25%, resulting in a secondary 12B
           beam intensity of 3E+6 12B ions per second.
