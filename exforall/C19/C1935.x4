FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The scattered helions were detected using a
           dE-E telescope consisting of intrinsic germanium
           detectors of 1 cm thickness. A rectangular slit of
           0.4x1 cm2 placed in front of the detectors defined
           the angular acceptance of the detectors as 0.3
           degrees in Theta. An overall energy resolution of
           600-700 keV FWHM was achieved.
PART-DET   (HE3)
METHOD     (EDE) Using both hardware and software constraints,
           we restricted the measurements to cover the
           excitation-energy range of O-40 MeV in the nuclei
           studied. Whenever the elastic event rates were very
           high, signals corresponding to elastic events were
           electronically blocked before entering the data
           acquisition computer. Data were obtained in the
           angular range 7-20 degrees for 208Pb and 7.5-20
           degrees for 58Ni targets. Measurements were carried
           out in steps of 0.5-1.5 degrees, depending upon the
           angular region. In order to obtain clean inelastic
           spectra special care was taken to achieve a
           good-quality halo-free beam on target. This condition
           was periodically checked by replacing the target with
           an empty frame. The resulting background counting
           rate was minimized before data were obtained at every
           angle.
ANALYSIS   The broad Giant Resonances (GR) structures ride on a
           background continuum. In the present work we assumed
           the background shapes were obtained by joining
           smoothly the data points from the structure-free
           excitation region above Ex = 25-30 MeV to the region
           below the GR bump at Ex = 7-10 MeV, depending on the
           target nucleus.   At these helion-energies cross
           sections must be corrected for reaction losses in the
           Ge detectors. Rather than estimate the losses, we
           have normalized the sigma(theta) values obtained to
           earlier, precise measurements made using the IUCF
           magnetic spectrometer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main source of uncertainty in the cross
           section for GR excitation in the uncertainty with
           which continuum cross section can be specified. The
           error in cross sections for GR structures varies
           between 15-30% depending upon the relative strength of
           the GR structure compared to the continuum background.
           Besides, normalization procedure led to an uncertainty
           of 5 percent in sigma(theta) values obtained here. The
           data points have statistical errors of the order of 5%.
           (ERR-1) normalization procedure in 5% of sigma(theta).
           (ERR-S) of the order 5% and represent the overall
           errors from the fitting procedure.
