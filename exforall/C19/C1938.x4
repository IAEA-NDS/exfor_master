FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The measurements were performed at
           the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Scattered projectiles exiting the target were
           momentum analyzed in S800 spectrograph and identified
           with the focal plane detector system on an
           event-by-event basis.
           (IOCH) Energy loss of scattered ions was measured by
           the S800 ionization chamber
           (SCIN) Time-of-flight information was measured
           between two plastic scintillators
           (DRFTC) Two position-sensitive cathode readout drift
           chambers in the S800 focal plane provided xy
           information which, when combined with ray tracing in
           the spectrograph, allowed for an event-by-event
           determination of the projectile's scattering angle at
           the target position
           (HPGE) The segmented germanium array, consisting of
           17, 32-fold segmented, high-purity germanium
           detectors, surrounded the Coulomb excitation target
           in front of the S800 spectrograph to detect the
           de-excitation gamma rays. The high degree of
           segmentation of the gamma detectors enabled
           event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of gamma rays
           emitted in flight by the scattered projectiles with
           velocities approx. 40% of velocity of light.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between focal plane detector and
           gamma detector array was required.
           Mass and charge of scattered ions were measured using
           two-dimensional plot dE x TOF, where dE was measured
           by ionization chamber and time of flight by a pair of
           plastic scintillators. Coulomb excitation was selected
           by selection of events where the projectile scattering
           angle was lower than ANG-MAX
INC-SOURCE 58,60,62Cr beams were produced by projectile
           fragmentation of 76Ge beam with energy of 130 MeV/A on
           423 mg/cm2 9Be production target. The momentum
           acceptance of the separator was set to 0.5% for 58Cr
           and 3%for 60,62Cr
