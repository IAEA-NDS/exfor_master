FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiments were performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory on the
           campus of Michigan State University
SAMPLE     9Be foil with thickness of 188 mg/cm2 located at the
           target position of the S800 spectrograph
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Knockout residues were identified and tracked
           through the S800 spectrograph on an event-by-event
           basis and identified by detectors positioned in focal
           plane.
           (MWDC) Two position-sensitive cathode-readout drift
           chambers measured the residue position in the S800
           focal plane,
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber measured energy loss of
           charged particles
           (CSICR) The CsI(Na) gamma-ray spectrometer CAESAR was
           placed around the Be target position of the S800 to
           observe the gamma decay of any excited states formed
           in the knockout reaction
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillators located at the focal
           point of the A1900 fragment separator and at the
           object position of S800 spectrograph measured time of
           flight and provided separation of incoming isotones.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The proton-rich nucleus 36Ca with t1/2 = 102
           ms was produced by fragmenting a 140 MeV/nucleon 40Ca
           primary beam on a 9Be target and was filtered using
           the A1900 fragment separator. The 36Ca purity was 8%,
           and other beam constituents included 35K, 34Ar, 33Cl,
           and 32S.
ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined from several experimental
           runs, the RMS deviation between individual runs was
           0.7 mb i.e. 14%.
