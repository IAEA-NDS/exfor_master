SAMPLE     (4-BE-9,ENR=1.0) 228 mg/cm2 Be target.
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16
           cm thick lead shield.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) After selection in the A1200
           fragment separator, the secondary beam of 60
           MeV/nucleon (midtarget energy) was directed onto a
           228 mg/cm2 9Be reaction target surrounded by a
           position-sensitive NaI array. This array detected the
           gamma rays emitted by excited fragments, while the
           emerging 10Be fragments were measured and identified
           by the S800 spectrometer, operated in the
           dispersion-matched mode.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The response functions corresponding to the
           individual gamma rays were generated with the Monte
           Carlo code GEANT in a simulation procedure that took
           into account both the Doppler shift and the
           distortion of the shapes caused by the
           backtransformation. The experimental efficiencies
           measured with calibrated radioactive sources agreed
           with the simulations to within 5%. The calculated
           line shapes, together with an assumed smooth
           background arising from neutrons and debris from the
           target, give the excellent fit to the measured
           spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Only selected systematic errors are given.
           (ERR-1) the absolute gamma branching ratios in
           coincidence with projectile residue intensities are
           reliable to better than 10%.
           (ERR-2) The error in the cross sections includes a
           common 15% scale error.
