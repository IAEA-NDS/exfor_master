FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment was performed at the FN
           Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator at the Nuclear
           Science Laboratory, University of Notre Dame.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting aluminium target with thickness of
            74.7+-3.7mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Core of the SuN (Summing NaI(Tl)) is a
           cylinder,16in. in diameter and 16in. long,with a
           1.8in. diameter borehole along its axis. The cylinder
           comprised two separate halves enclosed in aluminium
           casings that allow for placing the detector around a
           beam line. Within the two aluminium casings, each of
           the halves is additionally divided into four
           optically isolated segments separated by 0.5mm
           aluminium plates covered with 0.25mm reflecting
           material.
