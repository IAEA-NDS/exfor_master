FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment was performed using the
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at
           ORNL.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT)Evaporation residues were detected using the
           CSSER (Compact System for Studies of Evaporation
           Residues) setup at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
            (ORNL). Two microchannel-plate timing detectors
           placed before the target were used to monitor the
           incident beam and provide a timing reference. A third,
            position-sensitive MCP after the target detected
           both the incident beam and the evaporation
           residues.The main trigger for the data-collection
           system was arranged so that only particles that were
           significantly slower than the beam (primarily the
           evaporation residues) were counted.
METHOD     (TOF)Time of flight method was used to identify the
           beam particles as well as the slow evaporation
           residues
CORRECTION Corrections for energy loss in the C foils,in the two
           upstream MCP detectors and the target backing
           were applied.

SAMPLE     (20-CA-40,ENR=0.9998)The nominal thicknesses of the
           targets were 251 and 628 mu-g/cm2 evaporated onto 15
           mu-g/cm2 C backings. Partially natural CaF2 target
           evaporated on 20 mu-g/cm2  C backing was used.
