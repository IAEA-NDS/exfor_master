REFERENCE  (J,PRL,108,142503,2012)
FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     Be target with thickness of 705 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (SPEC) After the reaction target a 4 Tm
           superconducting magnet was used to bend by 43 deg and
           analyse the emitted charged particles. Particles were
           identified by series of energy and position sensitive
           detectors in focal plane.
           (SCIN) Forward focused neutrons were detected using
           Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), placed 6.05 m from the
           target. MoNA consists of 144 individual detector
           modules. Each module is based on a block of BC-408
           plastic scintillator measuring 200 x 10 x 10 cm3.
METHOD     Charged particle detectors and MoNA array provided
           relativistic four-momentum vectors for 24-O nuclei
           and neutrons, which were used to calculate the decay
           energy of two- and three-body systems.
INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 140 MeV/A 48Ca bombarded a 1316
           mg/cm2 9Be production target. The secondary beam 27F
           with an energy of 82 MeV/A was separated from the
           other reaction products and the primary beam using
           the A1900 fragment separator. The 27F component of
           the secondary beam was 7%. The main contaminant was
           30Na. The 27F fragments were identified event by
           event through the time of flight
