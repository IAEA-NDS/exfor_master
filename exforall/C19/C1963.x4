TITLE      Measurement of total and partial charge changing and
           charge pick-up cross-sections for 300A MeV Fe26+ beam
           in Al with a new system of analysis

FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Samples were irradiated using beam of
           the AGS Booster synchrotron at the NASA Space
           Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven
SAMPLE     Natural Al sample with dimensions of 11.5 x 11.5 cm2
           and thickness of 3 mm
DETECTOR   (TRD) Stack of CR39 polymer track detectors with
           dimensions  of 11.5 x 11.5 cm2. In the stack there
           were two CR39 detectors upstream and 10 CR39 detectors
           downstream of the 3mm Al target. Detectors were covered
           during irradiations by a 45 mu-m plastic film to
           protect them from exposures to ambient radon and its
           progeny
ANALYSIS   Nuclear track detectors were etched after the
           irradiation. Charge of the passing ions was determined
           from track diameter. Cross section was determined
           from comparison of number of tracks in detectors
           placed in front of the Al target with number of tracks
           in detectors placed behind the Al target.
