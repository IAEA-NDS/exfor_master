TITLE      Study of the 11C(p,g) reaction via the indirect
           d(11C,12N)n transfer reaction

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the BEARS
           facility (Berkeley Experiments with Accelerated
           Radioactive Species) at Lawrence Berkeley National
           Laboratory's 88 inch cyclotron
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene CD2 target with
           thickness of 2.22 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SI) Detector telescope was composed of
           rectangular 7-strip dE  (60 mu-m thick) and E (1 mm
           thick) silicon detectors with a cooling system.
           A trapezoidal-shaped collimator in front of the
           detector telescope was necessary to define the
           angles of each detector strip.
           (SI) Additional single Si detector (1 mm thick) was
           located at 0deg to determine the 11C beam intensity

INC-SOURCE 11C is produced via 14N(p,a) reactions by bombarding
           40 mu-A of 10 MeV protons from LBNL's Life Sciences
           Division's medical cyclotron onto a nitrogen gas
           target. 11C is extracted from the target in the form
           of carbon dioxide (11CO2) and transported 350 m via a
           capillary line to the 88 inch cyclotron for injection
           into its advanced electron cyclotron resonance ion
           source
