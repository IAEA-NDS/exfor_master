FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)
           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using
           A1200 fragment separator.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.
METHOD     (EDE,GSPEC,TOF,COINC,EXTB)
ANALYSIS   (PGS,INTAD)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty includes root mean square from
           efficiency, statistical and geometrical uncertainties.
