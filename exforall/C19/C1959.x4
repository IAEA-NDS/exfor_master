FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Measurements were conducted at the
           ISAC facility at TRIUMF, using DRAGON recoil separator
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target was filled with 4He maintained
           at a central pressure of 7.7 Torr, the effective
           target length was 12.3+-5 cm
DETECTOR   (SPEC) 20Ne ions produced in the reaction were
           detected after separation from the beam using a
           two-stage electromagnetic separator with an angular
           acceptance of 21 mrad for reactions at the center of
           the target. The separator was tuned in such a way, that
           only the 4+ charge state was transmitted
           (IOCH) An ionization chamber placed in the focal
           plane of the electromagnetic separator was used to
           detect 20Ne recoils from the reaction.
           (MCPLT) Two microchannel plates upstream of the
           ionization chamber were used to measure the
           time-of-flight across the 59 cm distance between
           them. The transmission through the microchannel
           plates setup was 85+-5%.
           (BGO) An array of 30 bismuth germanate gamma-ray
           detectors in a tight geometry was used to detect
           capture gamma rays
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between recoiling 20Ne ions and
           gamma rays was used to reduce background
           (TOF) Time of flight was used to identify the
           recoiling nuclei.
           Inverse kinematics was used.
INC-SOURCE The Supernanogan off-line ion source was used to
           produce 16O beam.
CORRECTION Correction for transmission of 4+ charge state was
           made. Distribution of charge states of neon after
           passing through helium was measured for this purpose.
           20Ne beam was also produced in Supernanogun
