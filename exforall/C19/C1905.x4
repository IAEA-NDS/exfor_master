FACILITY   (CCW,1CANTMF) Measurements were performed in inverse
           kinematics at the DRAGON recoil separator, located at
           the ISAC facility at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with hydrogen maintained
           at a pressure within 3% of 7 Torr (measurement
           uncertainty of 2%), with an effective target length
           of 12.3 +- 0.5 cm
DETECTOR   (BGO) Windowless target was surrounded by an array of
           30 BGO (bismuth germanate) gamma detectors in a tight
           geometry. The resolution of the BGO array was about
           20% at 660 keV for the whole array.
INC-SOURCE The stable 17-O beam was produced by the Supernanogan
           off-line ECR ion source
