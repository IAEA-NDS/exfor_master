TITLE       (p,pd) reaction on 6Li at 590 MeV for high recoil
           momenta

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USASRE)
INC-SOURCE The 590 MeV proton beam of the NASA synchrocyclotron.
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.956) Lithium target 0.685 cm thick.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) A magnetic spectrometer was used to detect
           charged particles in coincidence with outgoing
           protons, which were stopped in a range telescope.
PART-DET   (P,D)
METHOD     (CHARG,MASSP,TOF) Spark chambers were used to
           determine the scattering angle and reconstruct the
           trajectories of the charged particles through the
           magnetic field. Plastic scintillator counters were
           used to trigger the spark chambers and to measure the
           time of flight of the charged particles. The mass
           separation of the spectrometer was 10%, enabling
           deuterons to be easily separated from other particles.
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Data were taken and analyzed under two
           different conditions: copper absorber thickness and
           magnetic field appropriate to an average value of
           transverse recoil momentum. The missing energy
           spectra for these two conditions were deduced. The
           transmission of the system, for a given recoil
           momentum, was calculated both by numerical
           integration over the solid angles and energy
           acceptance and by Monte Carlo simulation. A small
           correction for multiple scattering (5%) was
           calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation. These
           results were used to deduced cross sections.

COMMENT    The peak in the missing energy spectra was
           interpreted originating from the quasielastic
           interaction 6Li(p,pd)4He.
