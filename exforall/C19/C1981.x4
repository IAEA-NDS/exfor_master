METHOD     (COINC,TOF) The proton beam had a polarization PB of
           0.535 directed vertically upwards as it emerged from
           the cyclotron. A solenoid magnet in the experimental
           area was used to rotate the polarization through 90
           degrees into the horizontal plane. Scattered events
           were detected in the vertical plane, and asymmetries
           were measured by running with the solenoid in one
           polarity, and then reversing it. The
           scintillation-counter arrangement used to detect the
           p-d elastically scattered events.
SAMPLE     CD2 targets were 0.056, 0.761 and 0.331 g/cm2 thick.
ANALYSIS   Events due to elastic proton-deuteron scattering were
           separated from background events by means of three
           selection criteria: (1) coplanarity of the incoming
           proton and the two final-state particles; (2) angular
           correlation corresponding to the kinematics of P-d
           elastic scattering; (3) time of flight of either the
           final-state proton, or deuteron, or both. Once the
           number of elastic events was found for each defining
           bin and sign of solenoid polarity, rates per incident
           beam particle were computed. Solid angles were
           computed with the aid of a Monte Carlo program.
CORRECTION In computing the differential cross sections, nuclear
           absorption corrections of between 3% and 12% were
           applied for loss of beam particles in the HV
           hodoscope and target, and loss of final-state
           particles in the target, air, and theta and phi
           counters.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors in the cross sections include the
           statistical error and 5% errors in the target
           thicknesses and solid angles, typically 4%. In
           addition, there is a 10% normalization error due to
           uncertainties in beam monitoring and to some extent in
           the nuclear absorption corrections.
