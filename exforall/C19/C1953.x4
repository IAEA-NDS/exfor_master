FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment performed at the Holifield
           Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge National
           Laboratory
SAMPLE     Polyethylene foil (CD2)n with thickness of 80 mu-g/cm2
           The target surface was placed at 30deg with respect to
           the beam axis, so the effective areal density was
           160 mu-g/cm2. Inverse kinematics was used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SISD) The ORRUBA array consisted of ten
           1000 mu-m thick position sensitive silicon strip
           detectors, plus four thinner dE detectors that were
           used to form detector telescopes for the more forward
           angles
           (SISD,MCPLT) Annular silicon strip detector, a carbon-
           foil-microchannel plate detector, and a
           segmented-anode ion counter were placed at forward
           angle and used for beam diagnostic.
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification.
           (COINC) Coincidence signals from particles detected
           in the ORRUBA silicon arrays and the beamlike recoils
           striking the microchannel plate detector served to
           reduce the background from other, non-(d,p) processes
           Inverse kinematics was used
ANALYSIS   Cross section normalization was achieved by detecting
           elastically scattered deuterons with the ORRUBA at
           relatively small center-of-mass angles
            33deg-38deg, where the ratio to Rutherford
           scattering is in the range 0.92 - 0.99, and comparing
           to optical model calculations.
