CORRECTION Accuracy of fission cross-section ratio at thermal
           neutrons (less 0.2 per-cent), isotopic impurities (less
           4.0 per-cent), correction for angular anisotropy
           of fission (less 1.8 per-cent)
ERR-ANALYS Errors shown on the data are total and include
           statistical error (1.4 per-cent),isotopic impurities
            (less 0.2 per-cent), background of thermal neutrons
            (less 0.3 per-cent), error for multiply neutron
           scattering (less 0.4 per-cent),accuracy of fission
           cross-section ratio at thermal neutrons (less 0.2 per-
           cent for U-233/U-235 and less 0.5 per-cent for
           Pu-239/U-235)
