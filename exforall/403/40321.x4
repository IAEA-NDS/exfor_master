TITLE      Measurements of SIGf(239Pu)/SIGf(235U) and
           SIGf(233U)/SIGf(235U) fission ratios at 2 keV .
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSFEI)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Reactor.   2.0 keV energy neutron beam was
           obtained by transmission of reactor neutron spectrum
           through scandium filter
METHOD     Direct measurements.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Double fission chamber. Each chamber
            (239pu/235U and 233U/235U) had five aluminum-foil
           electrodes ~0.1 mm thick on two of which a layer of
           fissile material was deposited on both sides in the
           form of a spot 14 x 9 mm in size.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 1 of AE,38,(1),43,1975
CORRECTION For 1.5-2.3 keV energy interval correction on
           nonmonoenergetic spectrum of scandium neutron beam

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-squared error consists of
           statistical measurement error, uncertainties of
           calculated normalization constants and corrections

           1 mg of 239Pu dioxide (~99.8%)
INC-SPECT   "Signal" spectrum of Sc beam - average energy 2 keV.
METHOD      Calibration measurements with the double fis.chambers
           were made in the neutron beam from a crystal
           monochromator - energy 0.053 eV ( 0.051-0.056 eV) ;
           results were normalized to value of ratio 1.65+-0.03 .
