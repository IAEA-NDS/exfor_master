COMMENT    .Of authors: " Contribution of reaction C-12(N,n'+3A)
            (Q=-7.34 MeV) can be estimated in analysis of spectra
           and angular distributions of scattered neutrons in
           this energy range."
           . Of N.Otsuka (NDS,IAEA) 2020-05-08:
           uncertain if neutrons emitted from the processes other
           than inelastic scattering (e.g. three-body break-up
           12C(N,n+a)8Be) are excluded.

ANALYSIS    Average value of three measurements of
           non-elastically scattering neutrons.
           Elastic and inelastic (4.43 MeV) peaks were separated
           with  uncertainty < 2.%.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
COMMENT    Of authors.
            Measured angular distribution was fitted by Legendre
           polynomials in the form:
           SIG(COS(angle))=
           (1/(4*PI))*(a0+a1*P1(COS(angle))+a2*P2(COS(angle))).
           Coefficient a0 is emission total cross-section, what is
           cross-section of all reactions with excited level
           energy > 9.63 MeV.
