TITLE      KINETIC    ENERGY OF THE FRAGMENTS AT THE FISSION
           OF AM-241 AND PU-241 BY THERMAL NEUTRONS
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     THERMAL REACTOR
METHOD     (COINC)    COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE FRAGMENTS AT
                      THE FISSION OF AM-241 AND U-235 AND
                      PU-241 AND PU-239 RESPECTIVELY
DETECTOR   (SOLST)    SILICON DETECTOR
ANALYSIS   FOR DEFINITION OF ABSOLUTE VALUE OF AVERAGE KINETIC
           ENERGY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE USED DATA FROM ARTICLE
           BY MILTON J.,FRASER J.,CANAD.J.PHYS.,40,1624,(1962)
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,AKE,FF)

            MASS AND ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS
           OF FRAGMENTS AT THE FISSION OF PU-239 AND U-235
           BY THERMAL NEUTRONS WERE USED ON THE GRADUATION
           OF ENERGY SCALE OF THE ANALYSER AI-100-1
           FOR THE MEASUREMENTS OF PU-241 AND AM-241,RESPECTIVELY
