TITLE      Kinetic energies of fragments from thermal fission of
            Am-241 and Pu-241 .
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSFTI)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Thermal reactor , horizontal beam.
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence between the fragments at
                      the fission of Am-241 and U-235 and
                      Pu-241 and Pu-239 respectively
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)    Silicon surface barrier detectors
ANALYSIS   For definition of absolute value of average kinetic
           energy of fission fragments the data from article
           by Milton J.,Fraser J.,Canad.J.Phys.,40,1624,(1962)
           were used .
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,AKE,FF)
           (94-PU-239(N,F),,AKE,FF)
            Mass and energy distributions
           of fragments at the fission of Pu-239 and U-235
           by thermal neutrons were used on the graduation
           of energy scale of the analyzer AI-100-1
           for the measurements of PU-241 and Am-241,respectively
MONIT-REF  (,J.C.D.Milton+,J,CJP,40,1626,1962)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are not specified.
           The exp. error of the relative measurements was +-1.5%.
HISTORY    (19751007C)
           (20141020A) M.M. Ref.of Engl.translation was added.
           Article was checked, BIB information was updated.
           SF7 in reaction was corrected FF -> LF+HF.
            Year in ref. was corrected: 1975 ->
CORRECTION In results of measurements correction on emission of
           neutrons from fission fragments was introduced ;
           it was assumed that LF emitted on average 1.3 times
           more neutrons than HF did.
           Alpha-particle background was measured to be 3E+5 a/min
           for Am, 1.E+6 a/min for Pu .
