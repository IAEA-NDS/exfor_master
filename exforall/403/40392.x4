TITLE      Mean number of neutrons emitted in U235 fission induced
           by 14.8-MeV neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)  Thick T-Zr target. 175 keV deutrons.
INC-SPECT   Total neutron flux (1-2)E+9 n/sec .
           Neutron flux over area of U layers was uniform within
           4%.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between FF and neutrons.
DETECTOR   (COIN,FISCH,IOCH)
           U-235 layers on electrodes.
           The chamber was irradiated first by 14.8 mev neutrons,
           then by thermal neutrons.
CORRECTION Background due to fission induced by scattered neutrons
           - 3%.
