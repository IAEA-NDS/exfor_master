TITLE      Measurement of the capture - fission cross-sectional
           ratio alpha for U-235 in the filtered neutron beams
           of the Obninsk Nuclear Power Station reactor
METHOD     (COINC)    Gammas and neutron count quantities
            in coincidence with fissions were determined.
            Total gammas and neutron count quantities
            and count quantity of delayed irradiation gammas of
            fission fragments were also determined
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSFEI)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    Plutonium and uranium fission chambers were
            used at measurements on thermal neutron spectrum
           (SCIN)     scintillation detector with stilbene crystal
            was used for neutron and gammas registration
PART-DET   (N)      Neutrons
           (FF)     fission fragments
           (G)      gammas
CORRECTION  Calculated corrections were introduced on gammas and
            neutron absorption and scattering,
            neutron multiplication of sample,
            admixture of their isotopes,
            nonmonochromatic neutron beam

SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.90) Sample thickness was equal to about

MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,ABS),,ALF)     Normalization was made on

           Alpha value was calculated from evaluated capture and
           fission cross-sections.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)    Given mean-squared error consists of
           statistical measurement error, alpha-thermal-bar value
           uncertainty, uncertainty of nu-bar to nu-thermal-bar
           ratio and uncertainties of calculated corrections.
