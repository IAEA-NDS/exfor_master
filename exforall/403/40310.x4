TITLE      MEASUREMENTS OF ALPHA VALUES FOR U-235 ON
           FILTERED NEUTRON BEAMS OF OBNINSK AES REACTOR
METHOD     (COINC)    GAMMAS AND NEUTRON COUNT QUANTITIES
            IN COINCIDENCE WITH FISSIONS WERE DETERMINED.
            TOTAL GAMMAS AND NEUTRON COUNT QUANTITIES
            AND COUNT QUANTITY OF DELAYED IRRADIATION GAMMAS OF
            FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE ALSO DETERMINED
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    PLUTONIUM AND URANIUM FISSION CHAMBERS WERE
            USED AT MEASUREMENTS ON THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM
           (SCIN)     SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH STILBENE CRYSTAL
            WAS USED FOR NEUTRON AND GAMMAS REGISTRATION
PART-DET   (N)      NEUTRONS
           (FF)     FISSION FRAGMENTS
           (G)      GAMMAS
CORRECTION  CALCULATED CORRECTIONS WERE INTRODUCED ON GAMMAS AND
            NEUTRON ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING,
            NEUTRON MULTIPLICATION OF SAMPLE,
            ADMIXTURE OF THEIR ISOTOPES,
