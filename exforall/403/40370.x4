MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSKUR) Reactor 'RFT'
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Neutron spectrum in the reflector of the reactor
SAMPLE                      Two samples contains:
            1. U-232 (0.0002%), U-234 (0.15%), U-235 (9.4%),
                                    U-236 (0.61%), U-238 (89.8%)
               Obtained by chemical separation.
            2. U-235 (27%), U-236 (0.7%), U-238 (72.3%)
             Obtained by long-term irradiatioN of U in reactor.
DECAY-DATA (92-U-237,6.63D,B)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           The neutron current was determined from the activity
            of a gold foil irradiated together with the sample.
           (COINC) Beta-gamma coincidence.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Beta counter

            Data obtained with 2nd sample.
            Data obtained with 1st sample ( 26.4+-6 b) are
            considered as approximate due to some Beta-active
            impurities.
