           (J,AE,2,(1),68,195701)  Data are given
MONITOR     Absolute measurements
METHOD     (SHELT)  Shell transmission
DETECTOR   (THRES)  Threshold detectors (Cu-63(n,2n)Cu-62),
                    (Al-27(n,p)Mg-27)
DECAY-DATA (29-CU-62,9.9MIN)   9.9+-0.1 min
           (12-MG-27,10.25MIN) 10.25+-0.1 min
            To estimate energy disribution of the scattered
            neutrons, Cu63(n,2n)Cu62 and Al27(n,p)Mg27 with
           thresholds 3. and 12.5 MeV, respectively, were used.
FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRIFU)  Electrostatic accelerating tube,
                  deuteron energy 110 keV
INC-SOURCE (D-T)  Tritium-zirconium target , 14 mm diameter.
ANALYSIS     Cross section was defined as:
            = -1/(n*d) * ln(b/a), where
           n- number of nuclei in 1cm3 of scatterer,
           d - effective thickness of the scatterer, cm,
           b and a - activities of detectors irradiated with and
           without scatterer.
COMMENT    Multiple scattering was not taken into account.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of error is not explained in article
CORRECTION  On neutron flux attenuation in the sample ,
            on neutron path variation in the scatterer and
            in the detector, on neutron beam divergency
