            Nd-143 of 73.2% enrichment.
METHOD     For individual resonances alpha-particles and gammas
           are counted
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     Gas scintillation detector for (n,alpha)
           registration
           (SCIN)     liquid scintillation detector for (n,gamma)
           registration  from (N,G) reaction.
            Measurement time 131hr.
MONITOR    (60-ND-143(N,A),,WID)
            Alpha-widths of 127,136, 180, 705 keV resonances of
            values 8.5+-1.7, 33+-11, 1.7+-0.6, 16+-8 microeV ,
            respectively.
           (60-ND-143(N,G),,WID)
PART-DET   (G)        Gammas
           (A)        alpha-particles
ANALYSIS    Formula (2) was used:
           Galpha=Ggamma*(b/a)*((Galpha/Ggamma)*(Ngamma/Nalpha))k*
            (Nalpha/Ngamma) ,
           where a and b are correction factors,
           b was determined from measured ratio of gamma counting
           rates from Nd143 resonances and investigated element.
