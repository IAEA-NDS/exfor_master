TITLE       Relative measurements of the mean number of neutrons
            emitted in fission of U-233, U-235 and Pu-239 by
            thermal neutrons and by neutrons characteristic of a
            fission spectra
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSKUR) RFT reactor
SAMPLE     The material being studied was used in quantities
           varying from 10-30 mg and was deposited on a fine
           aluminum foil in a layer 0.3-0.5 mg/cm2 thick
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutrons (with a flux of
            ~ (2-3) x 10**3 neut./cm2/sec) and fast neutrons
              (with flux ~ 5 x 10**4 neut/cm2/sec) were used.
            Fast neutrons were obtained via 14 g U-235 converter,
            boron-carbide 3.76 g/cm2 filter, graphite rod of 6cm
           diameter, 42 cm long.
METHOD     (COINC) Fission neutrons and fragments.
DETECTOR   (BF3)  24 counters B-F3 in the paraffin  block.
            Neutron detection efficiency ~ 5% for fast neutrons.
STATUS     (TABLE)  Tbl.2 from AE,2,(1),18,1957
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type is not explained in the article.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-1,,1.) Systematic uncertainty due to detector
            efficiency .
