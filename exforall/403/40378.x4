SAMPLE      Cf-252 - 79.8%, Cf-251 - 3.8%, Cf-250 - 10.9%,
            Cf-249 - 5.5%.
METHOD     (FISCT) Method of direct registration of fission
           fragments was used.
           A Np-237 layer was irradiated simultaneously with
           Cf-252 layer.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Glass detector for fission fragments

            No numerical value in the articles.

ANALYSIS   It was assumed that the fission cross sections of
           Cf-249 and Cf-251 are 2.01+-0.13 b,
           cross sections of Cf-250 and Cf-252 are equal.

CORRECTION  Spontaneous fission background was estimated to be
           ~10.%.

REACTION   (98-CF-252(N,F),,SIG,,SPA)
INC-SPECT   Reactor neutron spectrum was close to the fission
           spectrum, somewhat softened as a result of inelastic
           scattering.
