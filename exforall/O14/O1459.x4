TITLE      Measurement of the 12-C(p,pn)11-C reaction from 95 to
           200 MeV

SAMPLE     Scintillation polystyrene targets in the form of discs,
           40 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick were irradiated in a
           proton beam.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSITE) The ITEP proton clinical facility.
METHOD     (EXTB) For the experiment, beams with initial  energies
           of 100, 130, 180 and 200 MeV were used without
           additional energy degradation.  The energy of the  beam
           incident on the target was determined more accurately
           by measuring the beam range in a water phantom.
           A small correction was applied to the incident energy
           to correct to the energy of protons at  the  center  of
           the target.
           (BCINT) A current monitor was used to monitor the
           intensity of the beam.  The monitor operates as a
           current transformer and measures a value proportional
           to the number of charged particles passing through  its
           aperture.
           (ACTIV,BGCT)
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Activated targets were placed in the detection
           assembly designed at ITEP.  This unit measures
           beta-gamma-coincidences:  one channel detects
           scintillations of positron decay, while the other is
           for gamma-ray detection.  The detecting element in the
           beta-channel consists of the target itself and a
           polystyrene scintillation assembly surrounding the
           target.  The walls of the assembly are thick enough to
           stop all positrons emitted from the target.  Thus, the
           geometry of the beta-detector is close to 4-pi.
           Annihilation gamma-rays are detected in the
           gamma-channel with a NaI(Tl) crystal.  The geometry of
           the gamma-detector is close to 2pi.
