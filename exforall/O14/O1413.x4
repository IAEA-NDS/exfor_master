FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB)
           The beam of accelerated He-6 ions was provided by the
            Dubna accelerator complex for radioactive beams.
SAMPLE     A stack of six Pb-206 targets, each 600-700-mug/cm**2,
           thick, with 20-mum Al-foils inserted in between so as
           to reduce the beam energy from 23-to 13-MeV.
METHOD     (STTA)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Magnetic spectrometer MSP-144.
           (MWPC) For beam diagnostics
COMMENT    -By authors. In spite of the rather large energy
           dispersion of the beam at the end of the stack
           [+-3-MeV, this is the FWHM of the energy distribution
           measured with the magnetic spectrometer after both (Au
           and Pb-) stacks of foils], the absolute value of the
           energy was determined with good accuracy (not worse
           than 1-MeV).
INC-SPECT   EN-RSL-FW The energy resolution.
CORRECTION Needed correction for the He-6 beam intensity and the
           target thicknesses was made.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.

COMMENT    -By authors. The energy resolution of the alpha-
           spectrometer was about 50-KeV and the total efficiency
           of registration of the alpha-particles was about 50%.
