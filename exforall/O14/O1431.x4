           branching ratio of low-energy d+d reactions within

SAMPLE     The targets were pure metal disks becoming self-
           implanted deuterium targets under the deuteron
           irradiation.
PART-DET   (P,T,HE3)
DETECTOR   (SI) Four Si-detectors (surface barrier probably) with
           an active surface diameter of 1-cm at a distance of
           10-cm and the laboratory angles of  90,  100,  130  and
           150-degrees  were used for the detection of all charged
           particles of the reactions H-2(d,p)t and  H-2(d,n)He-3.
           Grounded Al-foils of thicknesses from 120-150-mug/cm**2
           were placed in front of the detectors insulated from
           them.  The thickness is sufficient in order to stop
           backscattered deuterons up to 60 KeV.  The solid angles
           surveyed by the detectors were determined with a
           radioactive alpha-source.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The experimental results obtained for the
           transition metals Zr, Pd, Ta and also Al- do not differ
           from those known from gas-target experiments, an
           enhancement of the angular anisotropy in the neutron
           channel and an attenuation of the neutron-proton
           branching ratio have been observed for the alkaline
           metals Li, Sr and Na at deuteron energies below 20-KeV.
           *By authors*the results for proton and tritons are
           concordant. The anisotropy data for Sr (in table) was
           renormalized to the ones of Ta.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2GERTUB)  The experiment has been carried out at
           an electrostatic cascade accelerator at  beam  energies
           below  60 KeV maintained by a highly stabilized power
           supply.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (SITA) See sample.
           (EXTB) The deuterium beam ions with final currents at
           the target < 200 mua depending on the energy.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainties in the integral of the spectral lines
           are taken into account in the errors additionally to
           the counting statistic. The problems of integrating the
           overlapping spectral lines cannot be circumvented by
           the use of detector telescopes for particle
           identification. The delta-E detector of the usual
           semiconductor detector telescopes would already absorb
           the recoil nuclei.
           Another problem affecting the results comes from a
           property of Rf-ion source inherent to their design.
