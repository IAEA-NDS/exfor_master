DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two hyperpure germanium detectors, ORTEC,
           nominally 20% photopeak efficiency relative to a 3*3"
           NaI(Tl) scintillator)
           (SIBAR) A Si-surface barrier detector monitor was
           placed at 45-degree to the beam direction for
           normalization.
           The relative gamma-ray efficiencies were determined
           with a Eu-152 radioactive source.
SAMPLE     A self-supported 1-mg/cm**2 thick enriched Pd-110,
           more than 97%, foil was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).The error in the relative normalization
           between the lowest and highest energy measured to be
           no more than 15%. This is a systematic error that could
           not be evaluated very precisely and for this reason,
           has not been included in the uncertainties presented in
           the figures.
           (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors on fig.
           (ERR-DIG).Digitizing error of data.
           (EN-ERR-DIG).Digitizing error of incident energy.
CORRECTION  The angular distribution parameters, necessary for
           correcting the yields at the fixed gamma-detector
           angles, were calculated by the code considering upper-
           level feeding, the geometry and absorbers of the
           detectors, the integration over the beam-energy
           variation through the target and the deorientation due
           to the hyperfine interaction of the recoil in vacuum.
