PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A calibrated Si-detector for the beam energy
           measurement.
           (SPEC) To clearly identify the protons from the 7-Be+d
           reaction from those arising from reactions on the C
           content of the target, a stack of two 'Leda' silicon
           strip detector arrays were employed covering a
           laboratory angular range of 7.6-17.4 angular degrees.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
METHOD     (SITA) See sample.
           (EXTB) The measurements were performed using a post-
           accelerated 7-Be+ radioactive beam at a nominal energy
           of 5.8 MeV provided by the Cyclone-110 cyclotron.
           To suppress the contamination from the 7-Li isobaric
           beam, the 7-Be beam was completely stripped to 7-Be-4+
           by transmission through a thin 12-C foil, prior to
           analysis by a dipole magnet.
           (EDEG)
MONITOR    (6-C-12(4-BE-7,EL)6-C-12,,DA) The absolute
           normalization was obtained using events arising from
           the elastic scattering of the 7-Be on the C content of
           the target and assuming that the 7-Be+12-C elastic
           scattering follows the rutherford law. This assumption
           is realistic at energies below the coulomb barrier, as
           is the case here. (Comment by the authors)

COMMENT    -By authors. The average cross sections was calculated
           assuming full isotropy-7.5+-0.8(stat)+-2.6(sys)-mb at
           the effective energy of 0.37-meV and
            386+-7(stat)+-50(sys)-mb at 1.15-meV.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The summed contribution of the 0+ and
           2+-states was about 64% of average cross section at
           1.15-mev.  At 0.37-mev, average cross section inclides
           the  contribution of the ground and 2+-states and about
           50% of that of the 4+ broad state.
