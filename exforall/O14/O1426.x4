INSTITUTE  (2GERBER,2FR GAN,2GERJUL,3POLWWA,1USAROC)
DETECTOR   (SPEC)  The experiments utilised the 4pi-detector NESSI
            (Neutron Scintillator tank and Silicon ball) for an
           efficient and simultaneous detection of neutrons and
           charged particles.  In addition to the Berlin Neutron
            Ball (BNB), and the Berlin Silicon Ball (BSiB), the
           setup has been equipped with six threefold delta-E-E
           telescopes. Each telescope  consists  of  a stack of
           three delta-E Si detectors with thicknesses of 25-27
           mum, 80-90 mum and approximately 1000 mum, backed by a
           7-cm thick CsI(Tl) crystal of 4 cm in diameter.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) The Cooler Synchrotron Facility COSY.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (TOF) Particle identification with  BSiB  detectors was
           obtained by means of energy and time-of-flight
           measurements;
           (EDE) For the Si/CsI(Tl) telescopes.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Results of simulation calculations with the
           intra-nuclear cascade code INCL2.0 coupled to the
           statistical model GEMINI.
CORRECTION The cross sections are corrected for the counting
           losses.

CORRECTION Not corrected for the neutron energy dependent
           efficiency.
            The following corrections have been applied to the
           measured distributions-
            -the portion of background from reaction outside the
           target 1-2%,or He4.
            -events rejected by the double reactions inspection
             2-4% are accounted for, continuously monitored during
           the runs,
            -An off-line threshold was introduced into the
           measured BNB-light spectrum at 10 MeV to cut events
           from electrons observed at M(n) less than 3. The
           extrapolation to zero energy was estimated assuming
           similar spectra shapes as measured for M(n)=3-5,
            -A small portion of elastically scattered beam protons
           may enter the BNB scintillator thus simulating real
           events. This background of about 1-3% contributes to
           the peak observed in the BNB-light spectrum which is
           well pronounced for M(n) less or equal 5 at energies
           of about 50 MeV.
SAMPLE     A thin targets, thickness 0.1-1 g/cm**2 were used.

CORRECTION Not corrected for the neutron energy dependent
           efficiency.
            The following corrections have been applied to the
           measured distributions-
            -the portion of background from reaction outside the
           target 1-2%,or He4.
            -events rejected by the double reactions inspection
             2-4% are accounted for, continuously monitored during
           the runs,
            -An off-line threshold was introduced into the
           measured BNB-light spectrum at 10 MeV to cut events
           from electrons observed at M(n) less than 3. The
           extrapolation to zero energy was estimated assuming
           similar spectra shapes as measured for M(n)=3-5,
            -A small portion of elastically scattered beam protons
           may enter the BNB scintillator thus simulating real
           events. This background of about 1-3% contributes to
           the peak observed in the BNB-light spectrum which is
           well pronounced for M(n) less or equal 5 at energies
           of about 50 MeV.
SAMPLE     A thin targets, thickness 0.1-1 g/cm**2 were used.
