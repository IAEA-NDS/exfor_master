REACTION   (52-TE-123(N,A),,WID,,AV,DERIV) Average alpha-width of
           all resonances of the nuclei 50-Sn-120.
ANALYSIS     Upper limit of alpha-wide was derived from measured
            cross-section at 2 keV., compared with c-s calculated
           by Monte-Carlo method using average alpha-wide value of
            (10+-3) microeV. Calculated by this wide c-s is about
           10 times higer, than measured at this experiment.
ERR-ANALYS   no information about errors.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. EN-RES-MIN, EN-RES-MAX values (used in
           analysis) are not given in article.
           EN-RES-MAX=2.5 keV was assumed by compiler.
