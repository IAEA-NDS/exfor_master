FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Reactor IBR-30 in Booster Mode at an
              average thermal power 10 kWt, pulse repetition rate
              100 Hz, pulse duration 4 microsec .
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-of-flight, flight bases 60, 123 and 1006 m.
           (TRN)  Samples of different thickness were used.
                Open beam measurement was also carried out.
DETECTOR   (BF3  )  Three SNM-13 boron counters, and
           (PROPC)  26 helium counters SNM-18 were used as neutron
                    detectors for 123 and 1006 m flight paths .
            Energy resolution about 40% at 200 keV, 0.13% at 2 eV
            for shot flight path, 70% at 14 MeV and 0.2% at 1 keV
            for long flight path.
            Two SNM-12 counters to monitor power level of reactor.
CORRECTION -Corrections were made for background neutrons
            with the help of  five resonance neutrons filters -
            Ti, Al, Mn, Co, In.
            Admixtures  in samples were taken into account.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Doppler coefficients in transmission were
            measured on samples under 77 K and 293 K temperature
            conditions ( as ratio T(77k)/T(293K), and were
            compared with calculations by ENDF/B-6, BROND-2,
            JENDL-3 - Fig. of S,ISINN-3.
            Exp. cross-section were compared with effective
            calculated cross-sections using ENDF/B-6.
ERR-ANALYS               Max total error - 6 %.
                         Min total error - 2 %.
