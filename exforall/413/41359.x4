FACILITY   (REAC)  Critical Assembly KS-1
INC-SOURCE  Critical Assembly KS-1 (90% U-235).
INC-SPECT   Measured KS-1 leakage spectrum is presented on
            Fig.2.a of C,97TRIEST, Fig.6 of C,96MITO,2,E-338,1996.
            Unfolded by the measured in the center of critical
            assambley values of fission and activation integrals
            neutron spectrum in the center of critical assambly is
            given of Fig.4 of C,96MITO,2,E-338,1996.
            Energy spectrum was measured from 0.5 to 8 MeV.
            Cf-252 spontaneous fission neutron spectrum was
            measured for validation.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,PROPC) Proportional gas counter was used to
            meaasure the neutron leakage spectrum of KS-1.
            Length of cylinder-cathode - 1 m, internal diameter
            7.5 cm, wall thicness 1 mm, material -stainless steel.
            Tungsten wire-anode of 40 mcm diameter. High-purity
            methane as working gas at presure about 300kPa (3atm);
            0.4 volume % of He-3 added- for energy calibration by
            He-3(n,p)T exotermic reaction ( 0.764 MeV recoil
            protons energy peak). At voltage 2.5 kV the energy
            resolution 3.8 %, at 3 kV - 4 %. Efficiency of neutron
           registration high aas 1 %.
           (IOCH) Small-sized ionization chambers with
            metrololgically tested layers of U-235,U-238,Pu-239,
            Pu-240, Np-237 - for measurement of neutron spectra
            in the center of critical assemblies.
ADD-RES     Leakage spectra for critical assamblies
            KS-2(Pu-239 98%), KS-12 (U-235 36%), KS-1 (U-235 90%).

            EN-MEAN=0.5 MeV; MXW -> SPA;
            BIB information and reference C,97TRIEST were added
            according to comments of E.Fomushkin.
