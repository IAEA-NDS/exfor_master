            Experimental details of detection
METHOD     (TOF)   Flight path is 3.8 m. Time resolution 2.5 ns.
            Three series of measurements:
            - sample of 43 mm diameter, 17 mm thickness, in Al
           container of 2 mm wall thickness;
           - with the same sample and with Al container (for
           background);
           - with sample of two times more and with stainless
           steel container of 0.5 mm wall thickness.
           Each series contains 50 spectra with duration of one
           measurement about 18 hours.
           - Background was measured with empty sample.
           - Contribution of oxygen was defined by measured Al
           oxide sample and by calculation on base of total C-S
           from ENDF/B-6 and JENDL-3 .
