            setup and data acquisition system.
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Neutron Pulsed Booster IBR-30
             Mean Booster Power is 10 Kw, Multiplication Coeff.
            Is 200, Pulse Duration is 4 Microsec, Pulse Repetition
            Rate is 100 Hz, Resolution 4 Nsec/M
DETECTOR   (D4PI,NAICR) Multisectional 4pi detector, named
           'Romashka', consists of 16 independent  sections.
            These are Na-I(Tl) crystals 122*122*152 mm3,
            pulse threshold is 100 keV .
           (PROPC)  He-3 counters for neutron flux monitoring .
COMMENT     Use of the 'Romashka' detector allows simultaneous
            determination of neutron scatterins and capture cross
            sections.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-Of-Flight, Flight Base is 501.9 M
MONITOR    (50-SN-116(N,0),,EN)
MONIT-REF  (,S.F.Mughabghab+,B,NEUT.CS 1B,,1984) BNL-325 .
            BNL-325 data could be used for calibration of two
            kinds gamma-ray multiplicity distributions observed in
            experiment.

ANALYSIS    Spin assignment by gamma-cascade multiplicity method.
           Multiplicity observed of emitted gamma-rays per neutron
           capture could have strong dependence on the difference
           between the spins of the initial and final states.
