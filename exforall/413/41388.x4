                    Fast neutrons are moderated in a water
              moderator and then transmitted through a vacuum
              tube to the experimental installation .
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path is 13 m .
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Two chambers were used.
            -The first of them was filled with isobutane gas at
             pressure is 0.7 atm, total amount of U-235 is 2 gram.
            -The second chamber is a special multisectional
             chamber specially constructed for making these
             measurements. it had a 40 sections with right-angle
             (110*96 mm-sq) formed electrodes made of 0.15 mm
             thick aluminum   foil. Fissile layers had an average
             thickness o.35 milligram/cm2, such that the total
             amount of U-235 was the same as in first chamber
             (about 2 gram). The volume of this chamber was filled
             with argon + 5% methane at pressure 2.4 Atm.
