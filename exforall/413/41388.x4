              TUBE TO THE EXPERIMENTAL INSTALLATION
METHOD     (TOF)  FLIGHT PATH IS 13 M
DETECTOR   (FISCH) two chambers were USED.
            .THE FIRST OF THEM WAS FILLED WITH ISOBUTANE GAS AT
             PRESSURE IS 0.7 ATM, TOTAL AMOUNT OF U-235 IS 2 GRAM.
            .THE SECOND CHAMBER IS A SPECIAL MULTISECTIONAL
             CHAMBER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR MAKING THESE
             MEASUREMENTS. IT HAD A 40 SECTIONS WITH RIGHT-ANGLE
             (110*96 MM-SQ) FORMED ELECTRODES MADE OF 0.15 MM
             THICK ALUMINIUYM FOIL. FISSILE LAYERS HAD AN AVERAGE
             THICKNESS O.35 MILLIGRAM/CM2, SUCH THAT THE TOTAL
             AMOUNT OF U-235 WAS THE SAME AS IN FIRST CHAMBER
             (ABOUT 2 GRAM). THE VOLUME OF THIS CHAMBER WAS FILLED
             WITH ARGON + 5% METHANE AT PRESSURE 2.4 ATM.
