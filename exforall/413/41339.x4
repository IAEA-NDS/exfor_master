                    of Nuclear Reactions at JINR, Dubna.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation for 1 h.
            To take into account the contribution of resonance
            neutrons, similar exposures were performed with
            samples shielded by 2-mm-thick Cd foil.
            The measured intensities of gamma-lines made possible
           to determine the absolute yields of Eu nuclei in ground
           and isomeric states and isomeric ratios.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
             Normalization energy of Co-59 gamma 1332.keV.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)  Photoneutrons obtained by means of electron
                    irradiation of a converter consisting of
                    uranium cylinder surrounded by beryllium.
           (THCOL)  Uranium-beryllium converter was placed in a
                    120x120x120 cm**3 graphite cube which served
                    as a neutron moderator.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron with cadmium ratio 2.5 at position of
             sample irradiation.
            Thermal neutron flux at the center of cube was
            4.E+8 n/(s*cm**2) at electron energy 25 MeV and
            current 20 microA.
DETECTOR   (GELI)   Ge-lithium detector with fiducial volume
                    of 60 cm**3. Energy resolution is 3 keV for
                    gamma-line energy 1332 keV of Co-60.
