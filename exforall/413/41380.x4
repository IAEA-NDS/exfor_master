FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Pulse neutron booster IBR-2 of the
             Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics.
INC-SPECT  .Mirror neutron guide on  6th neutron channel of the
            reactor for measurements with 3 - 70 milli-eV neutron
            energy giving neutron flux 3.e+6 n/cm**2/sec
           .Neutron beam on 1st neutron channel of the reactor
            for measurements with 3 milli-eV - 2 eV neutron energy
            giving neutron flux 1.e+6 n/cm**2/sec
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight bases are 27 m and 34 m
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Detector volume 80cm**3.Used on 34m flight base.
               Surrounded by lead and boron carbide with paraffin
               placed on 15 cm distance from sample-radiator .
                Energy resolution 3 keV.
           (GELI) Detector volume 55cm**3.Used on 27m flight base.
                  Without shield placed on 15 cm distance from
                  sample-radiator.
                Energy resolution < 5 keV.

                 measurement.
            Relative detector efficiency was obtained by NaCl
            sample of 102 g weight using gamma yields for Cl-nat
            from  REL-REF.

CORRECTION .To measure recycled neutrons background beryllium
            (20 mm), indium(1 mm) and cadmium (2 mm) filters were
            used

SAMPLE     .Metallic disk samples-radiator with 90% 235U and
            10% 238U, 0.25 mm thickness, sample diameter 48 mm,
            weight 8 gram .
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Value of ALF was calculated as ratio of sum of
           areas for radiative capture lines( 642 and triplet 910,
           913, 915 keV) to the sum of areas for fission lines
            (707, 815, 1279 keV). Then was normalized to value for
            thermal neutrons 0.169.
