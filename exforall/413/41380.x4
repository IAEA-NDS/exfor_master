SAMPLE     .Metallic disk samples-radiator with 90% 235U and

            weight 8 gram .
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Value of ALF was calculated as ratio of sum of
           areas for radiative capture lines( 642 and triplet 910,
           913, 915 keV) to the sum of areas for fission lines
            (707, 815, 1279 keV). Then was normalized to value for
            thermal neutrons 0.169.
