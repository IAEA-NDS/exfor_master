                                            details
FACILITY   (REAC)  IBR-2 Fast Pulse Reactor. Pulse repetition
                   rate is 5 Hz, mean power of reactor 1.5 MW.
           (CHOPS)  Slow neutron chopper which modulates neutron
                    beam and allows cross-correlation analysis
                    of emitted delayed neutrons
INC-SOURCE (REAC)   Bent mirror neutron guide. Cadmium sheet
                    was used to cut slow neutrons
DETECTOR   (PROPC)  12 He-3 counters placed in 450*450*450 cm
                    poyethilene cube .
            Ratio of detector efficiencies of prompt to delayed
           neutrons was found in calibration procedure with U-235.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),PR,NU)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons. Mean value of thermal neutron flux
            at the sample 4.0E+4 n/s/cm**2

ANALYSIS    Ratio NUd/NUp was obtained from cross-correlation
            functions for three groups of neutrons reduced to one
            period - prompt, delayed, fast.
