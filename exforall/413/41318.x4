FACILITY   (REAC) Fast critical assembly BFS-1 with different
                  modifications of reactor core
MONITOR    .Absolute measurements
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)  For fission cross-section measurements
           (GELI)   For n-gamma cs measurements
           For calibration - standard sources of absolute activity
           with 1.2-1.4% uncertainty were used.
           Lead layer of 12.1 mm thickness to decrease
           gamma-counting rate.
           Without Pb - absolute efficiency was defined by Cs-137,
           Co-60, Eu-152 (779, 964 keV) and was straight line in
           double-logarithmic scale. With Pb - efficiency was
           almost independent from energy.
