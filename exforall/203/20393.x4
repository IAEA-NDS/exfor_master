FACILITY   (VDG  )    3 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF OF THE CBNM.
INC-SOURCE (D-N15)    N15(D,N)-REACTION AT E(D) = 1.8 MEV FOR E(N)
            FROM 10.26 TO 11.53 MEV. THE TARGET WAS 2 MILLIGR/CM2
            OF SI(3)-N(4) (N15 ENRICHED).

            FROM 12.61 TO 16.07 MEV USING THE TARGET OF 1 MILLIGR/
            CM2,AND AT E(D) = 3.0 MEV FOR E(N) FROM 16.18 TO
            19.59 MEV USING THE TARGET OF 2.8 MILLIGR/CM2 TI-T.
SAMPLE     .METALLIC SAMPLE OF 20 MM DIAMETER AND 5MM
            THICKNESS.
DETECTOR   (GELI )    TWO GE(LI) PLANAR DIODES OF THE ORDER OF
            1 CM**3 VOLUME FOR ACTIVATION MEASUREMENT.
           (TELES)    PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE COUNTER AT 0 DEG
            RELATIVE TO THE DEUTERON BEAM WAS USED TO MEASURE THE
            NEUTRON FLUX(ABSOLUTE).
           .THE RELATIVE N-FLUX FOR SAMPLE WAS DEDUCED FROM
            ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION MEASUREMENTS BY NEUTRON TOF
            SPECTROMETER FOR (D-N15) REACTION AND BY A PROTON
            RECOIL TELESCOPE COUNTER FOR (D-T) REACTION.

           .THE CALIBRATION SOURCES OF CO-58 AND NA-22 WERE USED
            TO MEASURE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH +- 1 PER CENT
            ACCURACY. THE SOURCES CONSISTED OF AN ACTIVE FOIL OF
            19 MM DIAMETER ENCLOSED IN A STAINLESS STEEL HAUSING
            OF 20 MM DIAMETER AND 1 MM THICKNESS.
           .THE CALIBRATION SOURCES WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO
            DISKS OF 20 MM DIAMETER AND 2 MM THICKNESS OF AG TO
            ADJUST THE GAMMA ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT OF THE SOURCES

COMMENT    .THE TOTAL EXPERIMENTAL (N,2N) CROSS-SECTION IS ABOUT
            30 PER CENT SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICAL ONE FROM THE
            STATISTICAL MODEL CALCULATION. THIS DISCREPANCY CAN BE
            EXPLAINED BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE LEVEL DENSITY

CORRECTION .A CORRECTION FACTOR OF GAMMA-DETECTION WAS DETERMINED
            FOR THE CENTER POSITION OF THE SOURCE BY VARYING ITS
            POSITION IN DIFFERENT SANDWICHES.
ERR-ANALYS .THE AVERAGE TOTAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE TOTAL CROSS-
            SECTION INCLUDING THAT ONE OF THE DECAY SCHEME IS
            ABOUT +- 8 PER CENT.
