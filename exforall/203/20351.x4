REACTION   (89-AC-227(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
SAMPLE     .AC-227 WAS PRODUCED BY IRRADIATION OF RA-226 IN THE
            BR-2 REACTOR AND PURIFIED TO BETTER THAN 99.95 PERCENT
            TO ELIMINATE ITS DESCENDENT, MOSTLY TH-227, FURTHER
            PURIFICATION WAS CARRIED OUT A FEW HOURS BEFORE
            MEASUREMENT.

ERR-ANALYS .EXPERIMENTAL ERROR IS LARGER THAN VALUE ITSELF,
            ONLY UPPER LIMIT OF VALUE IS GIVEN.
           .TWO RESULTS WERE OBTAINED, THEY ARE
            125 +- 164 MICRO-B  AND  335 +- 68 MICRO-B.
            50 MICRO-BARN SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED AS A SLIGHT
            CONTRIBUTION FROM TH-227.
