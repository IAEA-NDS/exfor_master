REACTION   (89-AC-227(N,F),,SIG,,MXW,DERIV)
SAMPLE     .Ac-227 was produced by irradiation of Ra-226 in the
            Br-2 reactor and purified to better than 99.95 percent
            to eliminate its descendant, mostly Th-227, further
            purification was carried out a few hours before
            measurement.
ANALYSIS   .Experimental error is larger than value itself,
            only upper limit of value is given.
           .Two results were obtained, they are
            125 +- 164 micro-B  and  335 +- 68 micro-B.
            50 micro-barn should be subtracted as a slight
            contribution from Th-227.

HISTORY    (20071121A)  Data value increased in 1000 times

SAMPLE     .Chemically separated Th-227 sample.
ANALYSIS   .From two values of the cross-sections, additional 5
            perc. Deviation assumed for systematic errors in both
            flux and weight measurements, and 5 perc. Deviation
            for detector efficiency.
           .Two results were obtained, they are
            215 +- 9.7 B  and  200.2 +- 4.5 B.
