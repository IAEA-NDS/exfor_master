TITLE      -ABSOLUTE RADIATIVE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION
            FOR FAST NEUTRONS IN U-238.-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) PULSED 3 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) THIN TARGET
SAMPLE     .SHAPE DETERMINATION, METALLIC DISK, 0.1 CM THICK, 9 CM
            DIAMETER, DEPLETED TO 0.4 PERCENT U-235.
           .ABSOLUTE 30 KEV VALUE, 2 METALLIC FOILS, 0.0066 CM
            THICK, 1.1 CM DIAMETER, DEPLETED TO 0.22 PERCENT U-235
METHOD     .CROSS SECTION SHAPE WAS DETERMINED BY RECORDING
            RESPONSE OF SCINTILLATOR TANK TO PROMPT CAPTURE GAMMAS
            RELATIVE TO GREY NEUTRON DETECTOR COUNTS. USE OF
            MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS WAS COMBINED WITH
           (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHOD TO DETERMINE BACKGROUND,
            NEUTRON ENERGY AND ITS SPREAD. 1.5 M FLIGHT PATH.
           .ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION WAS MEASURED AT 30 KEV WITH
            KINEMATICALLY COLLIMATED NEUTRONS AS FOLLOWS.
           (ACTIV) BE-7 ACTIVITY OF LI TARGET GAVE NUMBER OF NEU-
            TRONS PRODUCED, NP-239 ACTIVITY OF U SAMPLE GAVE NUM-
            BER OF CAPTURE EVENTS. THE LATTER WAS MEASURED BY 2
            METHODS. RESULT WAS ALSO CHECKED AGAINST AU(N,GAMMA).
DETECTOR   (STANK) 800L SCINTILLATOR TANK AS CAPTURE DETECTOR,
           (MTANK) GREY DETECTOR FOR FLUX SHAPE,
           (GELI ) FOR NP-239 278 KEV GAMMA RAY,
           (NAICR) FOR NP-239 106 KEV GAMMA RAY IN COINCID. WITH
            X-RAY (2 CRYSTALS) AND FOR BE-7 478 KEV AND AU-197
            411 KEV GAMMA RAYS (1 CRYSTAL). GELI AND NAI DETECTORS
            WERE CALIBRATED WITH AM-243 SOURCE OF KNOWN ACTIVITY.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
           .THE 30 KEV MEASUREMENT RELATIVE TO AU(N,GAMMA) YIELDS
               - 492+-17 MB FOR U, IF 599+-12 MB IS TAKEN FOR AU.
               - 473+-15 MB FOR U IS OBTAINED FROM THE ASSOCIATED
            BE-7 ACTIVITY. HENCE THE SHAPE DATA WERE NORMALIZED TO
            THE AVERAGE,
               - 479+-14 MB AT 30 KEV.
