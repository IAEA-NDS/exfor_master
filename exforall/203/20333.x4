TITLE       Studies of excitation cross sections of (n,n'gamma)
            reactions
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNJAE)  JAERI 5.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)    T(p,n)He-3, gas target 3 * 1 cm diameter.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-FW) Energy resolution 20 to 25 keV (HWHM).
            Neutron flux was measured by two independent methods:
             * by use of a proton recoil proportional counter and
             * by use of a long counter calibrated with a
               standard Ra-alpha-Be source.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    1 inch dia. x 1 inch NaI(Tl) crystal.
           (LONGC)    Long counter for neutron monitor calibrated
           by using the standard neutron source of 100 mCur
           Ra-alpha-Be. The long counter utilizes a paraffin
           cylinder having eight 2.54 cm holes at a depth of
           8.9 cm and a BF3 counter of 2.54 cm diam.
           (PROPC)    proportional counter filled with methane gas
            were used in the absolute measurements of flux.
           Different gas pressures of 50.05 cm Hg and 111.4 cm Hg
           were used in the flux measurements below 1.0 MeV and
           above 1.2 MeV, respectively. The effective volume of
           the counter was 4.98 cm in diam. x 15.6 cm in length.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
CORRECTION  * Correction of absorption of gamma-rays produced
            in the sample was experimentally determined.
            * Correction for finite angular resolution was not
            done except when indicated in Subents. For this goal
            the theoretical angular distributions of gamma rays
            calculated by using the generalized Hauser-Feshbach
            formula (see REL-REF), with Beyster's transmission
            coefficients (see REL-REF), are adopted  for
            calculation.

                                        transmission coefficients
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Standard errors.
           (ERR-1,,5.) The overall error of the neutron flux is
             less than 5% in standard deviation.
           (ERR-2,4.5,8.0) Uncertainty in photopeak efficiency
           ranged from 4.5 to 8.0% depending upon the energies of
           the gamma rays.
           (ERR-3,0.7,2.0) Uncertainty in the absorption factors
STATUS     (APRVD)    Approved by the authors.

COMMENT    The cross-section values listed without associated
           errors are those obtained by normalizing the
           preliminary data to the present results, which were
           measured at four neutron energies.
