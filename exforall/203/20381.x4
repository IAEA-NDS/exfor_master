FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)    Electron linear accelerator of CBNM.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)    Photo-neutron from mercury-cooled uranium.
INC-SPECT   Slowing down neutron by 2.8 cm thick polyethylene
            sheet.  Cd was used as overlap filter.
SAMPLE     .Highly enriched U-layer by electrospraying on both
            sides of a 0.1 mm thick aluminium disk.
           .Isotopic composition (in atomic percent) are,
            U-234 0.168 +- 0.002%, U-235 99.505 +- 0.004%,
            U-236 0.026 +- 0.001%, U-238 0.301 +- 0.002%.
METHOD     (TOF)    Time of flight, path = 8 m.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 4 Au-Si surface-barrier detectors (diam. 30 mm)
            on both sides of back-to-back target.  Detection of
            long-range alpha( Al absorber in) and fission fragment
            (absorber out).
MONITOR     Ternary to binary fission ratios were normalized to
            the value 100 for the 12.39 eV resonance
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Errors are statistical.
COMMENT     Two series of measurements. In 1st series, total
            discrimination level(aluminium absorption and
            electronic bias) for ternary alpha was fixed at about
            10 MeV, (preliminary results were reported in
            EANDC(E)-123). In 2nd series this bias level was
            increased to about 15 MeV.
