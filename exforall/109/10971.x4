FACILITY   (VDG,1USANBS) 3-MV positive-ion Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (D-T) ~250 keV deuteron beam on TiT (2.8 mg/cm2 thick)
INC-SPECT  Neutron beam energy, energy distribution
            and energy uncertainty were deduced from the reaction
            kinematics, deuteron beam energy loss in target, and
            measured spatial shape of neutron beam.
           (EN-RSL-FW) Energy spread (FWHM)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Parallel plate ionization chamber with 2pi
            geometry. Two sample deposits placed back-to-back.
           (SIBAR) Totally depleted surface barrier detector for
            associated alphas detection at 84 deg.
           (SCIN) NE-110 plastic scintillator (2.5 cm diam., 8 cm
            thick) operated in coincidence with alpha detector to
            measure the angular shape of the neutron beam.
SAMPLE     Two 8 mm radius deposits of UO2 (1042 ug/cm2)
            evaporated onto Ti backing (0.0063 mm thick).
           Extensive measurements of areal density made using
            thermal neutron induced fission counting and 235U
            reference deposit.

           (92-U-238,ENR=0.00069)
METHOD     (ASSOP) Time correlated associated particle method.
           Background due to scattered neutrons eliminated by
            coincidence requirement between fission event and
            alpha detector.
CORRECTION Corrected for
            - variation in uranium deposit thickness,
            - uncertainty in neutron beam profile,
            - fission events below discrimination level,
            - fission fragments absorbed in deposits,
            - fission by other than 235U,
            - neutron attenuation,
            - accidental coincident background contributions.
