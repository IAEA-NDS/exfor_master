TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE U-235 NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION
            CROSS SECTION AT 14.1 MEV.
FACILITY   (VDG) 3-MV VAN DE GRAAFF
N-SOURCE   (D-T). COLLIMATED TO 3-MM DIAMETER
INC-SPECT  NEUTRON BEAM ENERGY, ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND ENERGY
            UNCERTAINTY WERE DEDUCED FROM THE REACTION KINEMATICS,
            DEUTERON BEAM ENERGY LOSS IN TARGET, AND MEASURED
            SPATIAL SHAPE OF NEUTRON BEAM.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) PARALLEL PLATE IONIZATION CHAMBER WITH 2-PI
            GEOMETRY. TWO SAMPLE DEPOSITS WERE PLACED BACK
            TO BACK.
           (SOLST) TOTALLY DEPLETED SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR FOR
            ASSOCIATED ALPHAS. THIN NI FOIL MOUNTED OVER APERTURE
            FACE TO ELIMINATE LARGE BACKGROUND FROM SCATTERED
            DEUTERONS AND FROM ELECTRONS DUE TO DECAY IN TRITIUM
            TARGET.
           (SCIN) NE-110 PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR, 2.5-CM DIAMETER AND
            8-CM THICK FOR NEUTRON MONITOR. OPERATED IN
            COINCIDENCE WITH ALPHA DETECTOR TO MEASURE NEUTRON
            BEAM SPATIAL SHAPE.
SAMPLE     TWO 8-MM RADIUS DEPOSITS OF UO(2) EVAPORATED ONTO
            0.0063-MM THICK TITANIUM BACKING. EXTENSIVE
            MEASUREMENTS OF AREAL DENSITY MADE USING THERMAL
            NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION COUNTING AND U-235 REFERENCE
            DEPOSIT.
METHOD     (ASSOP) TIME CORRELATED ASSOCIATED PARTICLE METHOD.
            DETECTOR AND TARGET HOLDER MOUNTED IN 50-CM DIAMETER,
            SEMI-CIRCULAR BRASS SCATTERING CHAMBER. BACKGROUND DUE
            TO SCATTERED NEUTRONS ELIMINATED BY COINCIDENCE
            REQUIREMENT BETWEEN FISSION EVENT AND ALPHA DETECTOR.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS MADE FOR-
            -FISSION EVENTS BELOW DISCRIMINATION LEVEL
            -FISSION FRAGMENTS ABSORBED IN DEPOSITS
            -UNCERTAINTY IN NEUTRON BEAM PROFILE
            -VARIATION IN URANIUM DEPOSIT THICKNESS
            -ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENT BACKGROUND CONTRIBUTIONS
            -NEUTRON ATTENUATION
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) TOTAL ERROR
           (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERROR
           (ERR-1) RATIO OF NET COINCIDENCE YIELD TO ALPHA YIELD
           (ERR-2) NEUTRONS SCATTERED FROM BEAM
           (ERR-3) FISSION FRAGMENT ABSORPTION
           (ERR-4) FISSION SPECTRUM LOSS
           (ERR-5) NEUTRON BEAM SHAPE AND DEPOSIT UNIFORMITY
