TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PROMPT NEUTRONS
            EMITTED PER FISSION OF U-235 RELATIVE TO CF-252 FOR
            THE ENERGY REGION 500-EV TO 10-MEV
FACILITY   (LINAC) OAK RIDGE ELECTRON LINEAR ACCELERATOR
SAMPLE     U-235 DEPOSITED ON ALUMINIUM FISSION CHAMBER FOILS
DETECTOR   (FISCH) TWO FISSION CHAMBERS USING U-235 THICKNESSES
            OF 1 AND 20 GRAMS/SQ-METER. CF-252 FISSION CHAMBER
            USED AS MONITOR.
           (SCIN) GADOLINIUM LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TO DETECT
            FISSION NEUTRONS. THROUGH TUBE DIAMETER IS ABOUT
            13.3-CM, VOLUME IS 0.910 CUBIC METERS.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH 83.4-METER FLIGHT PATH.
            U-235 FISSION CHAMBER PLACED AT CENTER OF LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR. CF-252 FISSION CHAMBER PLACED OUTSIDE
            BEAM AT ONE END OF U-235 CHAMBER
CORRECTION DATA CORRECTED FOR-
            -DISPLACEMENT OF SAMPLE AND MONITOR FROM CENTER OF
             SCINTILLATOR
            -FALSE FISSIONS
            -BACKGROUNDS
            -PULSE PILE UP
            -FISSION SPECTRUM DIFFERENCES
            -MISSED FISSIONS
            -ANISOTROPY OF FISSION FRAGMENT EMMISSION
ERR-ANALYS QUOTED ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL PLUS FISSION UNCERTAIN-
            TIES. ERRORS INCLUDE UNCERTAINTY IN CORRECTIONS.
           SYSTEMATIC ERROR OF 0.25-PERCENT ASSIGNED DUE TO
            DIFFERENCES IN FISSION CHAMBER GEOMETRY. TOTAL
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR IS 0.3-PERCENT.
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY R.GWIN, 80/8/25.
