TITLE      Absolute fast fission cross section measurements on
            Np-237
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMHG) University of Michigan Ford nuclear
            reactor
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Photoneutron sources activated by reactor
            thermal neutrons. La-Be for 770-keV neutrons, Na-Be
            for 964-keV neutrons.
SAMPLE     Two platinum foils with 1-milligram/sq-cm deposit of
            NpO(2). Deposit radius was 1.375-cm.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Polyester track etch detector
MONITOR    Reference Cf-252 spontaneous fission source used to
            determine absolute photoneutron source strength.
METHOD     (MANGB) Manganese bath used to determine absolute
            photoneutron source strength.
           Two sample foils positioned in dual compensated beam
            geometry. Two runs with 10 and 14-cm spacing between
            foils averaged to obtain cross section. Fission
            targets, detectors, and neutron sources placed in
            evacuated containment package which was suspended in
            the center of a shielded low albedo room. Computer
            code used to calculate scalar neutron flux and
            aperture detection efficiency.
CORRECTION Three major corrections made:
            -Manganese bath corrected for:
              -source and dry well self-absorption
              -leakage of neutrons from bath
              -neutron streaming losses from dry well opening
              -photo-activation of natural deuterium content of
               bath
              -parasitic fast neutron capture by O-16,and S-32
             Corrections were -0.333% (770-keV) and
              -0.555% (964-keV)
            -Neutron inscattering from experimental apparatus,
              dependent upon foil spacing
               -10-cm spacing  +4.100% (770 keV) and
                +3.250% (964 keV)
               -14-cm spacing  +5.390% (770 keV) and
                +4.380% (964 keV)
            -Correction for finite neutron energy distribution of
              sources, +17.350% (770 keV) and +6.860% (964 keV).
