INC-SOURCE (P-T) Neutrons were produced in a 3H(p,n) 3He
           reaction using a proton beam pulsed every 500 ns with
           a width of 10 ns. The average beam current was 0.7
           microA, with typical runs requiring an accumulated
           charge of 10 mC per angle. The target consisted of
           tritium absorbed at about a 1:1 atomic ratio in a
           3.27 mg/cm2 layer of metallic erbium deposited on a
           tantalum backing.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-rays detected by 2 Ge(Li) detectors, 50
           cm from scatterer.
           (SCIN) Neutron flux monitored by NE213 liquid
           scintillator.
SAMPLE     The neutron scatterer consisted of a cylinder of
           natural Sb powder (57.2% 121Sb, 42.8% 123Sb) of
           height 1.59 cm, radius 0. 8l cm, and mass 13.5 g, and
           was contained in a thin-walled nylon tube. The
           scatterer was aligned axially with the beam at a
           distance of 0. 8 cm from the neutron production target.
METHOD     Gamma-ray angular distributions were determined using
           the small-sample technique of Davidson et al.
           Gamma-ray excitation curves were measured in order to
           select the appropriate neutron bombarding energies
           for the angular distribution measurements. The
           energies were chosen so that there was no appreciable
           feeding from higher excited states. Maximum neutron
           energies ranged from 1.5 to 2.7 MeV. The energy
           spread of the neutron beam due to the target
           thickness was typically 150 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No comprehensive explanation of
           uncertaities.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties in branching ratios are about 4%.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Data are given vs. cosine**2, to
           accommodate EXFOR rules cosine values were calculated.
