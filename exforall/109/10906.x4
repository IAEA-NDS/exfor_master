TITLE      APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES TO ORELA NEUTRON
           TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR UNCERTAINTY
           ANALYSIS-THE CASE OF NATURAL NICKEL FROM 2 KEV TO
           20 MEV.
FACILITY   (LINAC) ORELA
METHOD     (TOF)200-M FLIGHT PATH
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)REPETITION RATE OF 780 HZ AT ELECTRON BURST
                  WIDTH OF 7.5+-0.5 NS WITH 8KW ON THE TARGET.
MONITOR    235-U FISSION CHAMBER WITH 89 MG OF 235-U.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  1.9CM BY 10.2 CM DIAMETER NE110 PLASTIC
                   SCINTILLATOR, COUPLED TO A RCA-8854 PHOTOTUBE.
SAMPLE     1820-G NATURAL NICKEL CYLINDRICAL IN SHAPE WITH 10.2
             CM DIAMETER AND 2.54 CM LENGTH.
           SAMPLE THICKNESS=0.2304 ATOMS/BARN.
                  NATURAL NICKEL CONSISTED OF-
                  . NICKEL            99.97  PERCENT
                  . COBALT-LESS THAN   0.001 PERCENT
                  . CARBON-LESS THAN   0.02  PERCENT
                  . IRON               0.005
                  . OTHERS-LESS THAN   0.001 PERCENT
ANALYSIS   AFTER CORRECTING THE DATA FOR BACKGROUND EFFECTS -
            . REGIONS OF EACH BIAS SPECTRUM WERE SELECTED, BASED
              ON TOTAL COUNTS AND COUNT-TO-BACKGROUND RATIO,
              AND SUMMED TO FORM THE FINAL SPECTRA FOR BOTH
              SAMPLE-IN AND SAMPLE-OUT.
            . SAMPLE-IN AND SAMPLE-OUT SPECTRA WERE NORMALIZED TO
              THE HOUSE. MONITOR COUNTER. FINALLY THE RATIOS WERE
              CONVERTED TO CROSS SECTION AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY.
            . FINALLY SAMPLE-IN AND SAMPLE-OUT COUNTS WERE
              AVERAGED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DATA POINTS FROM
              60000 TO 13695.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY
           (ERR-1) SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY
                CHANNEL INDEPENDENT
                 .SAMPLE THICKNESS UNCERTAINTY = 0.18 PERCENT
                 .DUE TO MONITOR COUNTER = 0.3 PERCENT (SAMPLE IN)
                                           0.5 PERCENT(SAMPLE OUT)
                CHANNEL DEPENDENT-
                   . ENERGY SCALE UNCERTAINTY=SEE ORNL/TM-8880(84)
                   . DEADTIME UNCERTAINTY
                   . BACKGROUND UNCERTAINTIES.
           (ERR-T) TOTAL UNCERTAINTY
           AVERAGED OVER THE ENTIRE ENERGY RANGE THE STATISTICAL
           UNCERTAINTY IS 2.5 TIMES LARGER THAN THE SYSTEMATIC
           UNCERTAINTIES.
            . CROSS SECTION UNCERTAINTIES AND CORRELATIONS HAVE
              BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THE ORNL REPORT.
           AT LOW ENERGIES SOME OF THE ERRORS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE
            DUE TO LARGE BLACKING OUT RESONANCES.
CORRECTION FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE MADE -
             .  DEADTIME CORRECTION
                  LARGEST CORRECTION WAS AROUND 1 MEV
                    1.23 AND 1.56 FACTORS FOR SAMPLE-IN AND
                    SAMPLE-OUT SPECTRA RESPECTIVELY.
