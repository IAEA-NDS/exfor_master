TITLE      PROMPT NEUTRON MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTION IN THE
            SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CURIUM-242
SAMPLE     CM-242 FORMED FROM THE RADIOACTIVE DECAY OF AM-242.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) FISSION NEUTRONS COUNTED WITH 30 HELIUM-3
            DETECTORS, 2.5-CM DIAMETER, 60-CM LONG, 6-ATM
            PRESSURE, EMBEDDED IN A CYLINDRICAL PARAFFIN AND
            POLYETHYLENE MATRIX, 54-CM DIAMETER, 90-CM LONG.
           (FISCH) GAS FILLED COUNTER WITH HEMISPHERICAL GEOMETRY.
            ACTIVE SAMPLE DEPOSITED ON CONVEX SURFACE, ELECTRON
            CHARGE COLLECTED ON CONCENTRIC SURFACE 2-MM FROM
            SOURCE.
MONITOR    FISSION OF KNOWN CF-252 SAMPLE USED TO CALIBRATE HE-3
            COUNTERS
METHOD     FISSION CHAMBER INSERTED INTO A 10-CM DIAMETER HOLE
            THAT PENETRATES CENTRAL CORE OF PARAFFIN-POLYETHYLENE
            CYLINDER. HELIUM-3 COUNTERS PLACED PARALLEL TO
            CYLINDER AXIS, SPACED SYMETRICALLY INTO 3 CONCENTRIC
            RINGS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS MADE FOR BACKGROUND NEUTRONS AND
            ACCIDENTALS. CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPONTANEOUS FISSION
            RATES BY IMPURITIES NOT CORRECTED FOR.
ERR-ANALYS QUOTED ERROR INCLUDES COUNTING STATISTICS AND
            SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES.
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY J.HALPERIN, 81/2/12.
