REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F),,NU)
DETECTOR   (FISCH,SCIN) Fission chamber #4 produced best
           results. Double fission chambers to detect fission
           fragments. NE-213 scintillator with pulse shape
           discrimination to detect fission neutrons.
SAMPLE     Four fission foils were used. Foil #1 contains 0.052
           microg of 252Cf, foil #2 0.17 microg of 252Cf. These
           foils were mounted on nickel backings, approximately
           110 microg/cm2 thick, supported by copper layer of 3
           mg/cm2 thick. Both foils were coated with 26
           microg/cm2 of gold to suppress self-transfer of the
           Cf. Foils #3 and #4 were also prepared by
           self-transfer method. These foils also contained 249,
           250,251Cf with traces of 253,254Cf.
METHOD     (MANGB,COINC) The total emission rate of 252Cf was
           measured in the manganese bath (MnSO4 solution). The
           fission rate was determined by neutron-fission
           coincidence measurement on the same 252Cf source for
           which the neutron emission rate was measured.

           with its fission rate yields.
