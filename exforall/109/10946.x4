AUTHOR     (A.D.Carlson)
TITLE      New measurements of the ratio of 10B(n,alpha) to
            6Li(n,t) cross sections in the eV energy range
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USANBS) 20-m station
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Lithium glass scintillator (NE901) viewed on
            ends by 2 photomultiplier tubes.
           (IOCH) 10B plated parallel plate ionization chamber.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           - Self-shielding in Li glass and 10B plated detectors
           - Flux attenuation due to 10B detector which was in
             front of the Li glass detector
           - Deadtime
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic uncertainty
STATUS     (TABLE) Data received by electronic mail
