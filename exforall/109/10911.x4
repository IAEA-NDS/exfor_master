TITLE      PROMPT-FISSION-NEUTRON SPECTRA OF U-233,U-235,PU-239,
            AND PU-240 RELATIVE TO THAT OF CF-252.
N-SOURCE   (P-LI7) PULSED PROTONS ON LITHIUM-7.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) THICK ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR TO DETECT EMMITTED
            NEUTRONS. 12.7-CM DIAMETER, APPROXIMATELY 2-CM THICK.
            GAMMA RESPONSE REDUCED WITH PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION
            CIRCUITRY.
             FISSION FRAGMENTS FROM CF-252 DETECTED WITH A GAS
            OF 10-PERCENT NITROGEN AND 90-PERCENT ARGON WHICH
            FLOWED THROUGH AN 8-CM DIAMETER STEEL SPHERE.
            SCINTILLATION PULSES VIEWED WITH PHOTOMULTIPLIER
            TUBE IN A SIDE PORT.
SAMPLE     RIGHT CIRCULAR CYLINDERS APPROXIMATELY 2-CM LONG.
            PURITY GREATER THAN 94-PERCENT.
MONITOR    ELASTIC SCATTERING OF 550-KEV NEUTRONS TO VERIFY TIME
            SCALE.
METHOD     (TOF) FAST NEUTRON TIME OF FLIGHT WITH FLIGHT PATHS OF
            APPROXIMATELY 500 TO 510-CM. TEN MEASUREMENTS OVER AN
            ANGLE OF 140-DEGREES MADE CONCURRENTLY. SAMPLES WERE
            PLACED INSIDE SPHERES SIMILAR TO CF-252 FISSION
            FRAGMENT DETECTOR TO REDUCE SHELL INDUCED SPECTRAL
            PERTURBATIONS. THREE INDEPENDENT SETS OF EXPERIMENTS
            WERE CARRIED OUT, EACH WITH A SEPERATE CF-252
            DETERMINATION. CAREFUL ATTENTION GIVEN TO FISSION
            SPECTRUM BACKGROUND DETERMINATIONS. TIME CALIBRATION
            BASED ON USE OF CALIBRATED DELAY LINES. TIME ZERO
            WAS REFERENCED TO THE PROMPT FISSION GAMMA RAY PEAK.
CORRECTION CORRECTION MADE FOR MULTIPLE EVENTS DUE TO FINITE
            SAMPLE SIZE.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERRORS DOMINANT SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY.
            NEXT MOST SIGNIFICANT ERROR WAS IN DETERMINATION OF
            TIME ZERO. QUOTED UNCERTAINTY IS OBTAINED FROM THE
            AVERAGE DEVIATION OF THE THREE SETS DIVIDED BY THE
            SQUARE ROOT OF THREE. ERRORS FOR EACH SET WERE THE
            RMS DEVIATION FROM THE WEIGHTED MEAN FOR ALL TEN
            CONCURRENT MEASUREMENTS PER SET.
