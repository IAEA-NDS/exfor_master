FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI)
INC-SOURCE A primary beam of 40Ar was used to bombard a 4 g/cm2
           Be production target with an energy of 490
           MeV/nucleon. The products were selected by the
           fragment separator.
SAMPLE     To emulate reactions on a pure proton target, data
           were taken for both CH2 and C targets. In addition, a
           measurement with empty target was performed.
DETECTOR   R3B/LAND setup enables a kinematically complete
           measurement of QFS (p,2p) reactions in inverse
           kinematics.
