SAMPLE     (42-MO-96,ENR=0.96) Six 96Mo targets with an isotopic
           enrichment of (96+-0.1) % were prepared as self-
           supporting foils with a thickness of about 1 mg/cm2
           Isotopic contaminants of 95Mo, 97Mo, and 98Mo with each
           and 98Mo with each about 1% abundance.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Each target was irradiated for 5?20 hours.
           The waiting time between the end of bombardment and
           start of counting was between 50 and 100 minutes
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two clover-type Ge (high purity) detectors in
           a very close face-to-face geometry.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) The new branching ratio for the direct decay
           of 96mTc into 96Mo amounts to (4.1 +0.39 -0.34) %
           compared to previously reported (2 +- 0.5) %.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
