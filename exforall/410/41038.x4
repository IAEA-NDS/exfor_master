ANALYSIS  1 Data obtained from the analysis of the several gamma
            lines
          2 Data obtained from the 344-keV gamma line
INC-SOURCE (CF252) ~1.5E+7 n/sec +-8% .
METHOD     Two irradiations:
           - 112.67 hr ; 97.7% Eu-151 enrichment; Cf source inside
           cylindrical container of sample;
           - 284.17 hr ; Cf source placed close to the bottom of
           the sample container.
            Eu-153 samples ( 99.2% enrichment) irradiation
           duration 116.7 hr.
CORRECTION Eu-154 123.8 keV line contribution due to Eu-153
           presence in the sample was taken into account by
           irradiation of Eu-153 sample in additional measurement.
            Influence of self-absorption on isomeric ratio (IR)
           is less +1.%.
           Scattering of neutrons in oxygen existing in the sample
           and subsequent capture in Eu can increase IR by < 1.%.
COMMENT    Of authors.
            - If Cf-252 spectrum is described by Maxwellian
           distribution with average energy 2.13 MeV,
           and the energy dependence of Eu-151 capture c-s is
           described by Hauser-Feshbach formula,
           then the effective energy of interaction of Eu nuclei
           with the Cf SF spectrum neutrons is about 1.4 MeV.
           Of compiler M.M.
           On Fig.1 this data are plotted at energy EN=1.4 MeV
           with energy error bars - EN-MIN about 150 keV and
           EN-MAX about 9 MeV.
           - Of authors.
           The Cf broad energy spectrum does not permit
           unambiguous treatment of our results, but the increase
           of relative yield of the isomer may be due to two
           processes in the highly excited nucleus:
            1) inclusion of the channel of inelastic scattering
           with excitation of the Eu-151 level (196 keV) with
           presumed spin 3/2+ ( this level was observed in
            Eu-151(d,d') reaction by E.Bernstein+,
           J,PL/B,33,(7),465,1970;
           doi:10.1016/0370-2693(70)90218-2);
           2) the possibility of existence of processes in which
           enhancement of E2 transitions ar retardation of E1
           transitions occurs, decreasing the dependence of
           population of the ground and isomeric states on the
           spin of the highly excited states.
