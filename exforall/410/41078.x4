TITLE      Radiochemical determination of the yields of rare-earth
            elements in the fission of 239Pu And 241Pu by slow
            neutrons
           II. Yields of isotopes of the rare-earth elements with
           half-lives of more than ten days
           I.  Yields of isotopes of the rare-earth elements with
           half-lives less than ten days
FACILITY   (REAC)  Dry channel of WWR-M reactor (institute is not
            mentioned in the articles)
INC-SPECT   Slow neutrons.
           Fission on epicadmium neutrons were negligible as
           was determined in preliminary measurement.
SAMPLE      Purified Pu.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Irradiation time 40 min - 2 hr for HL< 10 d,
REL-REF    (R,13070001,H.Farrar+,J,CJP,42,2063,1964) Issue 11.
            HLs for isotopes (HL>10day), excluding Pm-149, Eu-157.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Flow-type 4PI beta counter to measure activity
           after chemical separation.
MONITOR     Relative measurement
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quadratic means.
