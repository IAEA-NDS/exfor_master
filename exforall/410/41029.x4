TITLE       Intermediate resonances in elastic scattering of
            neutrons by 82-Se
COMMENT     Of compiler M.M.
            - In title of BAS,53,(5),180,1989 there is a misprint
           85-Se -> 82-Se .
            - Fig.2 of BAS,53,(5),180,1989 is not good for
           digitization, because energy scale is of low quality.
