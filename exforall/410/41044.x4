INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutrons of reactor went through the multi-slot
           collimator and then were made monochromatic by
           two-disks mechanical selector.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight base is 3 m
           (COINC)
ANALYSIS    Spectrometry of multiplicity of the gamma-quanta
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 12-sections 4PI-detector on the base of NaI
           crystals - to detect gammas and neutrons.
           (SIBAR)  Surface-barrier detectors - to detect FF.
PART-DET   (G,N,FF)
SAMPLE      U-235 layers on both sides of Al foil (10microm),
           U-235 mass 20 milligram, thickness 2 milligram/cm**2,
           uranium enrichment > 99.9%.
