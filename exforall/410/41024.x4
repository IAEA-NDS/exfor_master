TITLE      Cross-section of the U-238(N,2N)U-237 reaction induced
            by neutrons from Cf-252 spontaneous fission

METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
            Measurement of induced activity was started a day
           after the end of radiation.
           (CHSEP) Measurement also was done after radiochemical
           purification of the irradiated sample from fragment
           elements and transuranium elements.
DETECTOR   (GELI)  For activation measurement .
            Calibrated by Ra-226 gamma sources.
           (FISCH) For neutron flux measurements .
            With U-238-F(4) thin layer.

INC-SOURCE (CF252)  Cf-252 spontaneous fission sources:
           -two neutron sources of about 9 microg each at
           distance 2 cm;
           -three sources of overall mass about 50 microg.
SAMPLE      Oxide U3-O8, powder in aluminum boxes, weight 2.5
            gram, U-238 content is 99.999 percent
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)  Error due to the detector efficiency and
           neutron flux density,
           (ERR-2)  Error in correction due differences in the
           sample dimensions and calibration sources;
           (ERR-3)  Error in the correction for self-absorption;
           (ERR-4)  Error due to the monitor errors
