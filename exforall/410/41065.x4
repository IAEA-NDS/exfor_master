SAMPLE      Po heat sources made in 1972-1973, containing at time
           of manufacture (1.5 - 2.8)*10**8 MBq (4000-7600 Ci) of
           Po-210.
METHOD      Irradiation during 200 days. 209Po/210Po activity
           ratio at the end of irradiation 1.3E-10.
ANALYSIS   Reaction threshold was estimated to be close to 7.7MeV.
           Effective flux density was 1.E+11 n/cm2/sec for this
           reaction may deviate by up to factor 10 from the value
           assumed. So with adequate accuracy the cross section
           for the formation of Po-209 in Po-210(n,2n) is in the
           range 0.1 - 0.001 b.
