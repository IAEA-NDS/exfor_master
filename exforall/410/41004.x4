FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSLIN)  Reactor WWR-M
MONITOR     Neutron flux was determined with 10% accuracy by
           monitors, irradiated together with samples.
INC-SPECT  1.1E+14 n/(cm2*sec) for 2hr irradiation,
           0.55E+14 n/(cm3*sec) for 40 hr irradiation,
            reduced to 2200 m/sec neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  2 hr and 40 hr irradiation times,
                    cooling time 3 days.
