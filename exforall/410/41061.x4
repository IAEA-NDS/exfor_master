TITLE       Energies of long-range particles in ternary fission of
            U-238 Fission isomer
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSKUR)  Pulsed-beam electrostatic accelerator
PART-DET   (FF,A) Fission fragments and long-range alphas.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two sections chamber filled by Xe at about 5 Atm
           pressure; equipped by four photomultipliers.
           FF detection efficiency about 90%, registration
           threshold energy about 6 MeV.
           Geometrical efficiency of alphas registration was
           calculated by Monte-Carlo method to be about 40%.
           Cm-244 source was used for calibration of alphas
           registration via 5.8 MeV alphas decay.
           Alphas registration threshold about 2 MeV.
MONITOR     No information
ERR-ANALYS  Errors are not specified
SAMPLE     .U-238 deposited on Al backing of 15 mm diameter,
                                             25 microm thickness.
            U-238 layer thickness is 3. milli-gram/cm2
            U-235 content is 200 times less than in natural U.
