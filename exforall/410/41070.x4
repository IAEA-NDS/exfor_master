METHOD       Irradiation time 7-10 hr, total flux ~5.E+14.
           (CHSEP) Isotopic carrier method to separate fragments.
            Six - ten independent measurements.
            For FF beta-activity measurement the probes were in
           the form of PbMoO(4), RuO(2), AgCl, Cd(2)P(2)O(7), Te,
           Cs(2)SO(4), BaCrO(4), CeO(2), SrSO(4).
SAMPLE      U-233 sample as U(3)O(3) ( see also COMMENT).
            Pu-239 sample as metal foils.
            Weight 120-150 mg.
COMMENT    .Of compiler. U-233 sample is mentioned in the articles
            as "U3O3". Probably there is an misprint,
           U3O3 -> U3O8 (most probable) or UO3 .
           .Of authors.
           Given yield values include the yields of all the
           members of the radioactive chain which precede the
           given isotope, and are practically total yields of
           isotopes of the given mass ( Te-129m and Cs-136 are the
           only exceptions).
PART-DET   (B) Fragments beta-activity was measured by a counter
           calibrated against 4PI-counter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
            article.
