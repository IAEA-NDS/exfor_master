           (M,,F.H.Read+,J,PPS,77,65,1961) the procedures for
                                 measuring absolute diff.cr.s.
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK MAN)
SAMPLE     The target was a self-supporting beryllium foil,
           25 mu-m thick
METHOD     (COINC)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The gamma ray detector was a NaI(Tl) Harshow
            (4.5 cm diam.,5.1 cm long) mounted on an RCA 6810A
           photomultiplier tube.
           (CSICR) The scintillator was a 2.5cm diam. by 0.16cm
           thick CsI(Tl) crystal, which was covered by a
           sufficient thickness of aluminium absorber.
           Both could be rotated independently through 360 degr.
           about the target as centre, in reaction plane.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation.
           (ERR-1) Absolute normalization error.
