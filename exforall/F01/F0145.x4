INC-SOURCE Magnetically-analyzed deuteron beam. The mean reaction
           energy calculated from the energy loss of the deuterons
           on appropriate foils of a sandwich target was taken to
           be Ed0-1/2DeltaEd0, Ed0 being the energy of deuterons
           which passed the first gold foil of the target block
           and DeltaEd the energy the energy thickness of the
            (CD2)n foil. For measurements covering the range of
           mean energies of 1200 t0 300 keV the DeltaEd thickness
           of the target ranged from 30 to 90 keV.
SAMPLE     Target consisted of a deuterated-polyethylene (CD2)n
           foil of thickness 0.5 mg/cm2 sandwiched between two
           gold layers. Thickness and homogenity of targets were
           determined with an accuracy of 0.01 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SI) Polarimeter consisted of two silicon
           detectors as a target and two silicon detectors for the
           detection of protons scattered to the left and right at
           95 degrees lab. angle. The analyzing power of the
           polarimeter was determined to an accuracy of 3%.
           The average detection efficiency of the polarimeter
           was 2.5*10-6.
METHOD     (DSCAT)
CORRECTION The correction of measured asymmetry data for a
           nonsymmetrical arrangment of the two "left" and "right"
           scattering planes in the present polarimeter was
           calculated to be less than 1% in the whole range of
           reaction angles.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors correspond to the statistical
           uncertainty and to errors in the background
           subtraction.
