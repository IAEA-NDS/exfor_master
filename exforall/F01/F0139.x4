           (20130221A) English translation in REFERENCE was
           added. ERR-ANALYS in 001 was added. In sub 002
           REACTION was corrected. In sub 002 COMMON was deleted.
           (20191219A) Data were redigitized. ERR-ANALYS was
           corrected. Digitized numbers were revised to conform
           to the degitization errors.
