TITLE      Absolute excitation function of the 9Be(d,t) reaction.

SAMPLE     For the 2- to 8-MeV deuteron energy range pieces of
           1.4-mil rolled beryllium foil were used as a target.
           This foil was sandwiched between five 4-mil
           thicknesses of aluminum backing and another of aluminum
           foils which was used to slow the beam to the desired
           energy. This sandwich was then covered by a 'hut' of
           three 4-mil thicknesses of aluminum foil.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACHI) The 37-inch 8-Mev cyclotron and
           (CCW,1USACHI) the 400-kev Cockroft-Walton accelerator
           supplied the deuterons.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Self-quenching G-M counters containing argon,
           alcohol, and up to two centimeters of hydrogen have
           been used.
METHOD     After a bombardment was completed, the beryllium and
           all the aluminum foils were placed in a alumina cup in
           porcelain furnace tube in a hydrogen atmosphere. This
           tube was heated for thirty minutes to 950 to 1000
           degr. After cooling to about 350 degr., the hydrogen,
           now containing the tritium, was pumped into a counter
           already containing 1.8 cm ethylene and 6 cm argon and
           was counted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Counting errors and local variations in
           thickness of the thin berryllium foils contributed to
           the errors in the individual mean cross-section
           determination.

           (20130625A) AUTHOR, REFERENCE, FACILITY, SAMPLE,
           DETECTOR were corrected. METHOD was introduced. ERR-T
           was replaced with DATA-ERR. REACTION record was
           corrected. In sub 002 data presentation was changed
           according to the table from the article.
