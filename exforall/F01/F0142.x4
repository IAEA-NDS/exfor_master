SAMPLE     The beryllium foil used as target was sandwiched
           between five 4-mil thicknesses of aluminum backing and
           another of aluminum foils which was used to slow the
           beam to the desired energy. This sandwich was then
           covered by a 'hut' of three 4-mil thicknesses of
           aluminum foil.
FACILITY   (CYCLO) The 37-inch 8-Mev cyclotron and
           (CCW) the 400-kev Cockroft-Walton accelerator supplied
           the deuterons.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) After a bombardment was completed,the beryllium
           all the aluminum foils were placed in a alumina cup in
           porcelain furnace tube in a hydrogen atmosphere.This
           tube was heated for thirty minutes to 950 to 1000 degr.
           After cooling to about 350 degr., the hydrogen,now
           containing the tritium,was pumped into a counter
           already containing 1.8 cm ethylene and 6 cm argon and
           was counted.
