SAMPLE     Targets of 8 and 13 keV thicknesses (for 1.5 MeV
           protons) were prepared by vacuum evaporation of
           metallic beryllium on outgassed tantalum backing
           of 0.3 mm thickness
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Of 4.5 inch in diam. and 4.inch in height.
           Another 1.5 x 2. inch NaI(Tl) crystal was used
           as a monitor.
