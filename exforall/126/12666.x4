TITLE      SPIN DEPENDENCE OF SLOW NEUTRON SCATTERING BY
           DEUTERONS.
FACILITY   (REAC) ANL HEAVY WATER PILE
METHOD     EPITHERMAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTION FOR DEUTERIUM WAS
             MEASURED FOR RESONANCE NEUTRONS OF INDIUM AND
             SILVER.
           THERMAL NEUTRONS WERE ABSORBED WITH THE HELP OF
             A CADMIUM FOIL.
INC-SOURCE BEO FILTER WAS USED TO REMOVE NEUTRONS WHOSE WAVE
             LENGTH IS LESS THAN 4.5A. THE AVERAGE WAVE LENGTH
             OF THE NEUTRONS WAS FOUND TO BE 5.43A.
DETECTOR   LONG BF3 COUNTER
SAMPLE     DETETERIUM GAS IN A HEAVY WALLED GAS TUBE.THE
             TEMPERATURE OF THE TUBE WAS MAINTAINED AT 77.5K.
ANALYSIS   TWO ABSORBERS (D2O,H2O,BE) AND (BEO,O2,N2) WERE USED
             IN TWO MEASUREMENTS. THE RATIO OF THE INTENSITY
             TRANSMITTED BY ABSORBER 1 TO THAT TRANSMITTED BY
             ABSORBER 2 WAS USED IN COMBINATION WITH CROSS
             SECTIONS FOR BE(6.1B),O(4.1B),H(21.B) AND N(10.B).

REACTION   (1-H-2(N,EL)1-H-2,,SIG)
ADD-RES    DEUTERIUM MOLECULE TOTAL CROSS SECTION WAS
             DETERMINED TO BE 21.3+-0.2B AT 77.5 KELVIN.
           THE RATIO OF THE TRIPLET TO SIGLET SCATTERING
             LENGTH WAS FOUND TO LIE BETWEEN THE LIMITS
             OF 0.5 TO 2.3.
METHOD     TRANSMISSION THROUGH ABSORBER CONTAINING D2O,H2O AND
             BE.COMPARED WITH ABSORBER CONTAINING BEO,O2 AND N2.
