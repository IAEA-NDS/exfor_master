TITLE      The Neutron-Proton Scattering Cross Section
INC-SOURCE (RN-BE) Radon-beryllium bulb in paraffin cylinder
INC-SPECT  Rhodium resonance neutrons used
SAMPLE     Paraffin scatterer
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Geiger-Mueller counter surrounded by four
            rectangles of nickel coated with Rh powder (0.1
            gm/sq-cm) and Zapon lacquer binder for total of
            45-sq-cm area.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,6-C-0(N,EL)6-C-0,,SIG) Used to compensate for C
            content of paraffin.
METHOD     (FNB) Beam defined with boron-carbide diaphram of 5-cm
            diameter. Source and detector shielded with cadmium to
            eliminate thermal neutron effects. Detector is jointed
            to allow it to be spread out during irradiation and
            folded over counter during measurements.
