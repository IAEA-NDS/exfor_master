TITLE      Determination of the 14-MeV Li-7(n,n'a)T cross section
           from sphere multiplication and transmission
           measurements

METHOD     (SHELT) The Sphere Multiplication Measurement: In
           this measurement, the ratio M of sphere-on to
           sphere-off counting rates of an external
           flat-response long counter is obtained, the neutron
           source being located at the sphere center. Sphere
           Transmission Measurements: Offhand it would appear
           possible to obtain cross sections by the subtraction
           of reaction channels from a value of inelastic
           derivable from a sphere transmission measurement.
           However, with a light scattering material such as Li7
           there is the complication that as a result of the
           energy degradation in scattering, those neutrons
           elastically scattered in backward directions cannot
           be distinguished from those inelastically scattered
           in forward directions after excitation of low levels.
           Fortunately, most of the elastic scattering occurs
           into the so-called forward diffraction cone.

ANALYSIS   By utilizing lithium spherical shell transmission and
           multiplication measurements, the Li7(n,n'g) Li7 and
           the He6-production cross sections, it is possible to
           deduce that the 14-MeV Li7(n,n'a) T cross section.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The authors mention always only
           "14 MeV neutrons" without giving details of the
           incident energy spectrum. It is quite likely that these
            "14 MeV neutrons" have an energy like 14.5 MeV or so
           as it is very usual with T(d,n) neutrons. Therefore it
           is probably better to give just a value of 14.
