TITLE      Total cross sections for 14-MeV neutrons
AUTHOR     (D.I.Meyer,W.Nyer)
REFERENCE  (R,LA-1279,1951)
INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (CCW,1USALAS) A Cockcroft-Walton accelerator operated
           at 250 kilovolts.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) If the reaction energy is taken as 17.60 MeV,
           the neutron energies range from 14.08 to 14.35 MeV at
           the angle (70 degrees to the beam) at which the
           measurements were made.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Copper spirals wrapped around Geiger tube to
           detect Cu(n,2n) reaction neutrons were used.
           Background was reduced by shielding the detector with
           cadmium.
SAMPLE     All samples were 1 inch in diameter except for
           Cu samples which were 1/2 inch and 1 inch diameter.
METHOD     (TRN) The transmission is defined as the ratio of the
           neutron flux as measured by the detector with a
           scattering sample in the path of the neutrons to the
           neutron flux with no scattering sample in the path of
           the neutrons. In general the length of the scattering
           sample was such as to give a transmission of
           approximately 0.5.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were evaluated by relation sigma =
            (1/nx)*log(1/T), where n is the number of atoms or
           molecules per cm3, x is the length of the scattering
           sample in centimeters, and T is the transmission
           corrected for the effect of room-scattered neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviations.
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors
           (ERR-1,0.25,1.) Small-angle scattering effects.
CORRECTION Error due to elastic neutron scattering was about
           0.25 to 1 percent. No correction for this effect was
           considered. Corrections due to room scattered
           neutrons were considered.
