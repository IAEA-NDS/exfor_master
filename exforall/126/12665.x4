TITLE      A THERMAL NEUTRON VELOCITY SELECTOR AND ITS
           APPLICATION TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE CROSS
           SECTION OF BORON.
FACILITY   (SELVE)
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) ANL GRAPHITE PILE.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.
ANALYSIS   BETHE'S CORRECTION METHOD WAS USED TO CALCULATE THE
             BORON CROSS SECTION SINCE BF3 WAS USED AS AN
             ABSORBER AND DETECTOR.
STATUS     RESULTS TAKEN FROM TABLE II OF THE JOURNAL ARTICLE.
