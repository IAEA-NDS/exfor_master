TITLE      The neutron-scattering cross section at the cadmium
           resonance
FACILITY   (SPECC,1USAANL) Single crystal monochromator
DETECTOR   Boron-lined counter for the scattered neutrons
SAMPLE     A sheet of cadmium 0.056 cm thick, at an angle of 24
           deg with the beam, and including 12.3% Cd-113 was used
ANALYSIS   Scattering cross section obtained by counting scattered
           neutrons
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the scattering of higher
           energy neutrons in the beam, for air scattering, and
           for absorption of scattered neutrons by the scatterer
           itself. Only the correction for absorption by the
           scatterer was large

ANALYSIS   Spin assignment made by using the assumed peak cross
            section to calculate a scattering cross section using
            a trial spin for comparison with the measured
            scattering cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The scattering was small compared to the
           fast neutron background in the pile room despite
           shielding. No other information given.
