TITLE      THE NEUTRON-SCATTERING CROSS SECTION AT THE CADMIUM
           RESONANCE
FACILITY   (SPECC) SINGLE CRYSTAL MONOCHROMATOR OF A REACTOR
DETECTOR   BORON-LINED COUNTER FOR THE SCATTERED NEUTRONS
SAMPLE     A SHEET OF CADMIUM 0.056 CM THICK, AT AN ANGLE OF 24
           ADEG WITH THE BEAM, AND INCLUDING 12.3 PER-CENT CD-113
           WAS USED
ANALYSIS   SCATTERING CROSS SECTION OBTAINED BY COUNTING SCATTERED
           NEUTRONS
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE SCATTERING OF HIGHER
           ENERGY NEUTRONS IN THE BEAM, FOR AIR SCATTERING, AND
           FOR ABSORPTION OF SCATTERED NEUTRONS BY THE SCATTERER
           ITSELF. ONLY THE CORRECTION FOR ABSORPTION BY THE
           SCATTERER WAS LARGE
ERR-ANALYS THE SCATTERING WAS SMALL COMPARED TO THE FAST NEUTRON
           BACKGROUND IN THE PILE ROOM DESPITE SHIELDING. NO OTHER
           INFORMATION GIVEN.
