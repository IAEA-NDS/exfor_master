TITLE       Lithium seven inelastic angular distribution
METHOD     (COINC) The angular distribution was determined
            indirectly by analyzing the DE-excitation G-rays from
             Li-7 that were in coincidence with the inelastically
            scattered neutrons.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)The gamma rays were detected by a sodium-iodide
            crystal and the neutrons were detected by a stilbene
             crystal.
