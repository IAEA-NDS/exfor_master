TITLE       LITHIUM SEVEN INELASTIC ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
METHOD     (COINC) THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION WAS DETERMINED
            INDIRECTLY BY ANALYZING THE DE-EXCITATION G-RAYS FROM
             LI-7 THAT WERE IN COINCIDENCE WITH THE INELASTICALLY
            SCATTERED NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)THE GAMMA RAYS WERE DETECTED BY A SODIUM-IODIDE
            CRYSTAL AND THE NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED BY A STILBENE
             CRYSTAL.
ERR-ANALYS  ESTIMATED ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION ERROR GIVEN.
HISTORY    (790731C)
