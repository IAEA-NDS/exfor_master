FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERKFK) 52+-0.3 MeV deuteron beam
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,BCINT,ACTIV,MOSEP,GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI,SOLST) 30cc Ge(Li) and 3mm thick Si(Li)
SAMPLE     Arsenic powder targets were made by deposition from an
           ethanol suspension. The thickness was calculated from
           the known weight of the arsenic powder and the
           diameter of the deposit. Thickness was about 60mg/cm2.
           An acetone-zapon solution was used to fix the arsenic
           deposit to the filter paper backing. The filter paper
           was glued to an aluminium frame which was as thick as
           the deposit and had a centered hole. The remaining
           open side was covered witha thin mylar foil to prevent
           any target material from sticking to the adjacent
           aluminium degrader foil.

ERR-ANALYS Errors in beam current from monitor reaction was 3%
           and from indirect current measurement by Al foils in
           each irradiation was 3%. Non-uniformity of arsenic
           targets was about 4%. Error in induced activity at EOB
           estimated from decay curve was less than 2% and that
           in efficiency curve about 2%. Overall relative
           standard deviation was about 7%. Errors due to the
           branching ratios were not included. Ssince the (d,4n)
           and (d,3n+p) cross sections were determined by
           subtraction method, errors for these excitation
           functions were expected larger.
