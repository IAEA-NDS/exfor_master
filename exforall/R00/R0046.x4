DETECTOR   (GELI,SOLST)30CC GE(LI) AND 3MM THICK SI(LI)
SAMPLE     ARSENIC POWDER TARGETS WERE MADE BY DEPOSITION FROM AN
           ETHANOL SUSPENSION. THE THICKNESS WAS CALCULATED FROM
           THE KNOWN WEIGHT OF THE ARSENIC POWDER AND THE
           DIAMETER OF THE DEPOSIT. THICKNESS WAS ABOUT
           60MG/CM-SQ. AN ACETONE-ZAPON SOLUTION WAS USED TO FIX
           THE ARSENIC DEPOSIT TO THE FILTER PAPER BACKING. THE
           FILTER PAPER WAS GLUED TO AN ALUMINIUM FRAME WHICH
           WAS AS THICK AS THE DEPOSIT AND HAD A CENTERED HOLE.
           THE REMAINING OPEN SIDE WAS COVERED WITHA THIN MYLAR
           FOIL TO PREVENT ANY TARGET MATERIAL FROM STICKING TO
           THE ADJACENT ALUMINIUM DEGRADER FOIL.
INC-SPECT  INCIDENT DEUTERON BEAM ENERGY IS 52 +- 0.3 MEV.

ERR-ANALYS ERRORS IN BEAM CURRENT FROM MONITOR REACTION WAS 3 PER-

           IN EACH IRRADIATION WAS 3 PER-CENT. NON-UNIFORMITY OF
           ARSENIC TARGETS WAS ABOUT 4 PER-CENT.ERROR IN INDUCED
           ACTIVITY AT EOB ESTIMATED FROM DECAY CURVE WAS LESS
           THAN 2 PER-CENT AND THAT IN EFFICIENCY CURVE ABOUT 2
           PER-CENT.OVERALL RELATIVE STANDARD DEVIATION WAS ABOUT
           7 PER-CENT.ERRORS DUE TO THE BRANCHING RATIOS WERE NOT
           INCLUDED.SINCE THE (D,4N) AND (D,3N+P) CROSS SECTIONS
           WERE DETERMINED BY SUBTRACTION METHOD,ERRORS FOR THESE
           EXCITATION FUNCTIONS WERE EXPECTED LARGER.
