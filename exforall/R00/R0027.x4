TITLE      The use of a 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator for the
           production of 13N-labelled ammonium and nitrate ions
           for biological experiments

SAMPLE     Prepared by pressing 75+-2 mg(1 mmol) samples of Unilab
           laboratory reagent grade lithium carbonate into 10 mm
           diameter discs using a pressure of about 20 tons in**-2
            (3*1e5 kPa)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS No analysis of the error is given by authors.
COMMENT    The aims of the work are to make labelled nitrate and
           ammonia solutions of higher 13N activity, to
           investigate their chemical and radiochemical purity,
           and to prepare carrier-free solutions suitable for use
           in biological systems. The main results were as
           follows. No unwanted isotopes were detected in 2.5-ml
           carrier-free labelled ammonia solutions but 1 part in
           1E+4 of the initial activity of the nitrate was 18F.
           The labelled nitrate solutions contained 13N in nitrate
           , nitrite and cyanide ions (85%, 3%, and 1%,
           respectively). Useable yields of 20 muCi oF 13N ammonia
           and 57 muCi of 13N nitrate were obtained.

COMMENT    The product yields shown below were those at the end
           of bombardment under the condition of 20 min
           irradiation. At 2.50 MeV of incident deutrons two data
           points were given by authors.
