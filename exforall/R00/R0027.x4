TITLE      THE USE OF A 3 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR FOR THE
           PRODUCTION OF N-13-LABELLED AMMONIUM AND NITRATE IONS
           FOR BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS

FACILITY   (VDG) HVEC 3 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
SAMPLE     PREPARED BY PRESSING 75+-2 MG(1 MMOL) SAMPLES OF UNILAB
           LABORATORY REAGENT GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE INTO 10 MM
           DIA. DISCS USING A PRESSURE OF ABOUT 20 TONS/IN**2(3E+5
           KPA)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS NO ANALYSIS OF THE ERROR IS GIVEN BY AUTHORS.
COMMENT    THE AIMS OF THE WORK ARE TO MAKE LABELLED NITRATE AND
           AMMONIA SOLUTIONS OF HIGHER N-13 ACTIVITY, TO
           INVESTIGATE THEIR CHEMICAL AND RADIOCHEMICAL PURITY,
           AND TO PREPARE CARRIER-FREE SOLUTIONS SUITABLE FOR USE
           IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THE MAIN RESULTS WERE AS
           FOLLOWS. NO UNWANTED ISOTOPES WERE DETECTED IN 2.5-ML
           CARRIER-FREE LABELLED AMMONIA SOLUTIONS BUT 1 PART IN
           1E+4 OF THE INITIAL ACTIVITY OF THE NITRATE WAS F-18.
           THE LABELLED NITRATE SOLUTIONS CONTAINED N-13 IN
           NITRATE,NITRITE AND CYANIDE IONS(85,3,AND 1 IN PER
           CENT RESPECTIVELY). USEABLE YIELDS OF 20 MUCI OF N-13
           AMMONIA AND 57 MUCI OF N-13 NITRATE WERE OBTAINED.
