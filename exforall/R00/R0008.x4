TITLE      PREPARATION OF CARRIER-FREE I-123 WITH A HIGH
           RADIONUCLIDIC PURITY.

METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF 53-I-127(46.7 PER-CENT) AND
           11-NA-I(28.6 PER-CENT) IN THICKNESS OF
           6 MM(10 MEV LOSS FOR 60 MEV PROTONS).
COMMENT    XE-123 WAS RECOVERED BY CIRCULATING HELIUM GAS CARRIER
           AND THEN TRAPPED ON A METALLIC SPIRAL. IT WAS ALLOWED
           TO DECAY INTO I-123 FOR A PERIOD EQUAL TO 3 HALF-LIVES
           OF XE-123. THE TRAP WAS RINSED BY SODIUM HYDROXYDE IN A
           CLOSED SYSTEM TO RECOVER THE I-123 ISOTOPE.
ERR-ANALYS NO ERROR IS GIVEN BY THE AUTHORS.

REACTION   (53-I-127(P,X)53-I-123,,TTY,,,EXP)
           IN THIS REACTION PRIMARILY XE-123 WAS PRODUCED THROUGH
            (P,5N) REACTION. THEN I-123 WAS PRODUCED
           VIA BETA-DECAY.
