COMMENT    ISOLATION PROCEDURES OF RADIOKRYPTON FROM TARGET MA-
           TERIALS IRRADIATED WITH 65 MEV PROTONS AND 40 MEV HE3
           PARTICLES WERE DISCUSSED. THICK TARGET YIELDS OF KR-76
           AND -77 THROUGH THE PARTICLE ENERGIES OF UP TO 40 MEV
           FOR THE 34-SE(HE3,XN) REACTION WERE GIVEN.

SAMPLE     THICK PELLETS OF ANHYDROUS POTASSIUM BROMIDE CONTAINING
           BROMINE OF NATURAL ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION (GREATER THAN
           5 G/CM**2 IN THICKNESS) WERE SEALED IN QUALTZ AMPOULES
            (1.8 CM IN DIA. AND ABOUT 8 CM IN LENGTH).
COMMENT    VALUES OF THE THICK TARGET YIELDS WERE THOSE CALCU-
           LATED FROM THE EXCITATION FUNCTIONS MEASURED PREVIOUS-
           LY BY AUTHORS. MAXIMAL YIELDS OF BR-77 AND -76 FROM
           DECAY OF KR-77 AND -76 WERE ALSO CALCULATED TO BE 1.6
           AND 0.5 MCI/MUAHR,RESPECTIVELY.
           /COMMENT BY COMPILERS/
           REACTION TYPES ARE THOSE GIVEN BY COMPILERS. AUTHORS
           ATTRIBUTED THE MEASURED ACTIVITIES OF KR-77 AND -76
           ONLY TO THE BR-79+P REACTION AND DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE
           CONSIDERED THE BR-81+P REACTION WHICH ALSO PRODUCES
           KR-77 AND -76.

SAMPLE     THICK PELLETS OF SODIUM SELENIDE CONTAINING SELENIUM
           OF NATURAL ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION (GREATER THAN 0.3
           G/CM**2 IN THICKNESS) WERE COATING WITH POLYETHYLENE
           LAYER AND ENCLOSED IN AN ALUMINIUM HOLDER WITH A COPPER
           FOIL (10 MG/CM**2) WINDOW.
           /COMMENT BY AUTHORS/
           SODIUM SELENIDE, NA2-SE, WAS THE MOST SUITABLE TARGET
           FOR THE PRODUCTION OF KR-77 AND -76.
