COMMENT    Isolation procedures of radiokrypton from target
           materials irradiated with 65 MeV protons and 40 MeV
           3He particles were discussed. Thick target yields of
           76Kr and 77Kr through the particle energies of up to
           40 MeV for the 34Se(3He,xn) reaction were given.

SAMPLE     Thick pellets of sodium selenide containing selenium
           of natural isotopic composition (greater than 0.3
           g/cm**2 in thickness) were coating with polyethylene
           layer and enclosed in an aluminium holder with a copper
           foil (10 mg/cm**2) window.
           /Comment by authors/
           Sodium selenide, Na2Se, was the most suitable target
           for the production of 77Kr AND 76Kr.
