COMMENT    Isolation procedures of radiokrypton from target
           materials irradiated with 65 MeV protons and 40 MeV
           3He particles were discussed. Thick target yields of
           76Kr and 77Kr through the particle energies of up to
           40 MeV for the 34Se(3He,xn) reaction were given.

SAMPLE     Thick pellets of anhydrous potassium bromide containing
           bromine of natural isotopic composition (greater than
           5 g/cm**2 in thickness) were sealed in qualtz ampoules
            (1.8 cm in diameter and about 8 cm in length).
COMMENT    Values of the thick target yields were those calculated
           from the excitation functions measured previously by
           authors. Maximal yields of 77Br and 76Br from decay of
           77Kr and 76Kr were also calculated to be 1.6 and 0.5
           mci/muahr, respectively.
           /Comment by compilers/
           Reaction types are those given by compilers. Authors
           attributed the measured activities of 77Kr and 76Kr
           only to the 79Br+p reaction and did not seem to have
           considered the 81Br+p reaction which also produces 77Kr
           and 76Kr.

SAMPLE     Thick pellets of sodium selenide containing selenium
           of natural isotopic composition (greater than 0.3
           g/cm**2 in thickness) were coating with polyethylene
           layer and enclosed in an aluminium holder with a copper
           foil (10 mg/cm**2) window.
           /Comment by authors/
           Sodium selenide, Na2Se, was the most suitable target
           for the production of 77Kr AND 76Kr.
