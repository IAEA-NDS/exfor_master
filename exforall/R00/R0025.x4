SAMPLE     Evaporated adenine onto backing of aluminum or carbon
           foils were used. The thicknesses of adenine were 1-2 mg
           per square cm. The thicknesses of aluminum backing were
           1.4 to 7 mg per square cm. The backing was served as
           catcher foil. The adenine surfaces were coated with a
           polystyrene film of about 0.1 mg per square cm thick.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,ACTIV,REC,COINC)
MONITOR    The number of counts in the 14N elastic peak was
           monitored by using a solid state detector. The cross
           sections were determined within about 4% uncertainty.

           (DATA-ERR) The estimated uncertainty in the absolute
                      cross sections is 9% up to 18 MeV of
                      incident energy. Above 19 MeV, the absolute
                      uncertainty is approximately 20%. For
                      details see reference.

DECAY-DATA (4-BE-7,53.6D,DG,478.,0.1032)
           The error of the gamma ray intensity was taken as
           0.0016. Compilers consider that the branching ratio to
           the 478 KeV state mentioned by the authors corresponds
           to the intensity of gamma ray emitted from the state.
ERR-ANALYS No analysis of the energy error is given by the
           authors.
           The absolute uncertainty of each data is about 7.5%
           which arises primarily from uncertainties of 5% in
           determining the normalization factor of beam flux
           multiplied by target thickness and 5% in the detector
           efficiency determination.
