SAMPLE     96.8 PER-CENT ENRICHED ZN-68 WAS ELECTROPLATED ONTO
           1-MIL GOLD FOIL OF 99.999 PER-CENT. TARGET THICKNESS
           WAS 3-7 MG/CM-SQ. ZN PLATED AU FOIL WAS PLACED ON TOP
           OF 2 PIECES OF 1 MIL AL FOIL AND AU FOIL ADJACENT TO
           THE AL FOILS. THE 1ST AL FOIL WAS A GUARD AND THE 2ND
           WAS A MONITOR. THIS TARGET-MONITOR STACK WAS PLACED IN
           THE CENTER OF A LARGER AL FOIL WHICH SERVED AS A
           CATCHER.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM THE AVERAGE FOR
           IDENTICAL BOMBARDMENTS.
           UNCERTAINTY FOR THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTIONS IS +-15
           PER-CENT WHICH INCLUDES UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ABSOLUTE
           ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS,CHEMICAL YIELD ESTIMATIONS AND
           THE RESOLUTION OF THE DECAY CURVES.
