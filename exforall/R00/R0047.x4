SAMPLE     96.8% enriched Zn-68 was electroplated onto 1 mm Au
           foil oF 99.999%. Target thickness WAS 3-7 mg/cm2. Zn
           plated Au foil was placed on top of 2 pieces of 1 mm
           Al foil and Au foil adjacent to the Al foils. The 1st
           Al foil was a guard and the 2nd was a monitor. This
           target-monitor stack was placed in the center of a
           larger Al foil which served as a catcher.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviations from the average for
                      identical bombardments. Uncertainty for the
                      absolute cross sections is +-15% which
                      includes uncertainties in the absolute
                      activity measurements, chemical yield
                      estimations and the resolution of the decay
                      curves.
