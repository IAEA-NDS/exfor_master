TITLE      Excitation of deep lying hole states in 11C,15O, 27Si,
           and 57Ni with the (3He,a) reaction at 216 MeV

FACILITY   (SYNCY)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,GELI) 2.3 mm Si for dE, 8 mm Ge(Li) for E
INC-SPECT  The energy resolution was limited to 500-800 KeV,
           due to the energy definition of the incident beam,
           target thickness, and kinematical effects.
ERR-ANALYS It was assumed that the angular distribution of
           background continuum lying under the broad peak of
           interest was similar to that observed near 50 MeV
           excitation energy.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error bars do not include the
                      systematic errors such as arising from the
                      treatment of the backgroudnd continuum.
                      The error bars of the figures indicated
                      were read by a compiler.
COMMENT    The angular distribution of the broad bump resting
           on a smooth continuum is measured. It is suggested
           that the bump arises from neutron pickup in the
           deeper shell 1p-3/2 for 28Si.
