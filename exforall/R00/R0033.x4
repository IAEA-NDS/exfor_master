TITLE      Production of 75Br and 77Br via the 75As(He3,3n)75Br
           and 75As(a,2n)77Br reactions using Cu3-As alloy as a
           high-current target material

COMMENT    Cu-As alloy as a high current target material was
           investigated.  The optimum As-content in the Cu3-As
           alloy lies between 29 and 31%. For target preparation
           see the text.
           For the external target, the total power density of 28
           MeV alpha beam at 30 micro-Amperes was 1400 Watts/cm2
           and that of 36 MeV He3 beam at 30 micro-Amperes was
           1800 Watts/cm2.
           For the internal target, the total power density of 36
           MeV He3 beam at about 100 micro-Amperes was about 400
           Watts/cm2.

COMMENT    Irradiations were carried out at 15 muA for 30 mins.
           77Br was separated by dry distillation of which yield
           is better than 90%. The yields at EOB are listed in
           data section.
           The maximum yield was achieved at about 150 micron
           thickness which corresponded to an energy degradation
           from 28 to 0 MeV.
