COMMENT    CU-AS ALLOY AS A HIGH CURRENT TARGET MATERIAL WAS
           INVESTIGATED.  THE OPTIMUM AS-CONTENT IN THE CU3-AS
           ALLOY LIES BETWEEN 29 AND 31 PERCENT. FOR TARGET
           PREPARATION SEE THE TEXT.
           FOR THE EXTERNAL TARGET,THE TOTAL POWER DENSITY OF 28
           MEV ALPHA BEAM AT 30 MICROAMPERES WAS 1400 WATTS/CM-SQ
           AND THAT OF 36 MEV HE3 BEAM AT 30 MICROAMPERES WAS
           1800 WATTS/CM-SQ.
           FOR THE INTERNAL TARGET,THE TOTAL POWER DENSITY OF 36
           MEV HE3 BEAM AT ABOUT 100 MICROAMPERES WAS ABOUT
           400 WATTS/CM-SQ.
