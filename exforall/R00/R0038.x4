DETECTOR   (SCIN)
SAMPLE     Argon:Contained in a cylindrical brass chamber with a
              thin aluminium window. The chamber was lined with
              1.8mg/cm2 aluminium foil. Over 90 percent of the
              chlorine activity settled on this liner and could
              be recovered by removing the liner after
              bombardment.
              Incident deuteron energy was degraded with iron
              foils of appropriate thickness placed immediately
              in front of the aluminium window.
           Zinc:Fine zinc oxide powder was settled on a 1.8
              mg/cm2 Al foil coated with about 0.2 mg/cm2 shellac
              the foil was heated briefly in an oven which soften
              the shellac and binds the target tightly to the Al
              foil. Zinc oxide thickness was 5-8 mg/cm2.
INC-SPECT  Undegraded incident beam energy was 15.5 +- 0.1 MeV.

           As a monitor, 0.25-mil copper foil was placed in front
           of the degrader foils. The monitor was stsndardized by
           bombarding similar foils in a faraday cup.

CORRECTION Argon bombardments: Reaction product Cl-38(37 min)
             contained Cl-39(55.5min) impurity and decay curve
             analysis was made to discriminate Cl-38 activity.
           Zinc bombardments: Reaction product consisted of Cu-61
             (3.32hr), Cu-64(12.8hr) and Cu-67(61.5hr). Decay
             curves were analyzed by least-squares method.
ERR-ANALYS Absolute errors were estimated from a consideration of
           all factors affecting the measurement, but this
           estimate is inevitably somewhat subjective.
           Uncertainty in deuteron beam energy is about 0.1 MeV
           at 15 MeV and about 0.15-0.2 MeV at 10 MeV. This
           uncertainty increases rapidly with decreasing energy
           below 5 MeV.
COMMENT    Bombarding natural zinc, three reactions Zn-66(d,a),
           Zn-67(d,n+a) and Zn-64(d,2p) are possible to produce
           Cu-64. In order to determine each component in the
           summed excitation function, Zn-68 enriched zinc
           targets (of different Zn-64:Zn-66:Zn-67 abundance
           ratios) was also bombarded. If reasonable estimates of
           cross sections for Zn-66(d,a) are obtained, cross
           sections for other two reactions can be deduced solving
           the simultaneous equations. Considering the Q-values
           and Coulomb barriers, data for Zn-0(d,X) reaction at
           deuteron energies below about 8 MeV is probably from
           only Zn-66(d,a)Cu-64 reaction. The shape of excitation
           function of Zn-66(d,a) at higher energies was assumed
           from (d,a) reactions on nuclei around this mass region
           experimental data for Zn-64(d,a+n)Cu-61 were also used
           to estimate the Zn-67(d,a+n) excitation curve.
