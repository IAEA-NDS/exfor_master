DETECTOR   (NAICR,PROPC,SCIN) PROPORTIONAL COUNTER AND LIQUID
           SCINTILLATOR WERE USED TO CALIBRATE ABSOLUTE
           EFFICIENCY OF WELL-TYPE SODIUM IODIDE SCINTILLATOR.
SAMPLE     NITOROGEN OF 99.999 PER-CENT WAS CONTAINED IN ALUMINUM
           GAS CELLS. THE THICKNESS OF ALUMINUM WAS
           21 MILLI-G/CM-SQ. THE PRESSURE OF NITROGEN WAS 1 ATM.
ERR-ANALYS THE ENERGY OF THE PROTON BEAM AT MIDWAY THROUGH THE
           NITROGEN TARGET WAS TAKEN AS THE ENERGY OF BOMBARDMENT.
           UNCERTAINTIES IN THE MEAN ENERGIES WERE ESTIMATED
           TO BE LESS THAN 50 KEV.
           UNCERTAINTIES IN THE CROSS SECTIONS INCLUDE
           COUNTING STATISTICS (LESS THAN 2 PER-CENT), CARBON-11
           RECOVERY (LESS THAN 4 PER-CENT), TARGET THICKNESS
            (LESS THAN 3 PER-CENT) AND CURRENT INTEGRATION
            (ABOUT 1 PER-CENT). THE OVERALL UNCERTAINTY IN THE
           ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTIONS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE +-6
           PER-CENT.
