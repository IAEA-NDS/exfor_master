TITLE      SOME TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF I-123
           VIA THE TE-124(P,2N)I-123 REACTION AT A COMPACT
           CYCLOTRON.

SAMPLE     52-TE-O2(TE-124 MORE THAN 99 PER-CENT ENRICHED) POWDER
           MELTED INTO THE CAVITY OF A PLATINUM PLATE. THICKNESS
           IS 2.4 MEV LOSS FOR 22.4 MEV PROTONS. TARGET MATERIAL
           DIRECTLY CONTACT WITH ISOLATED COOLING WATER. I-123 IS
           SEPARATED FROM THE IRRADIATED TARGET BY DRY
           DISTILLATION IN AN OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE WITH THE
           EFFICIENCY OF MORE THAN 90 PER-CENT.

COMMENT    AUTHORS REPORT THAT THE OBTAINED YIELD IS ABOUT 50
           PER-CENT OF THAT THEORETICALLY CALCULATED FROM KNOWN
           EXCITATION FUNCTION AND IT DECREASES AS A FUNCTION OF
           THE INTEGRATED CURRENT PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE
           OF RADIATION DAMAGE EFFECTS. A MAJOR PART OF THE LOST
           I-123 IS FOUND IN THE CLOSED COOLING WATER SYSTEM.
