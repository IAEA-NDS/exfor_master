COMMENT    AS FOR THE CROSS SECTIONS FOR MONITORING REACTIONS,
           THE EFFECTS OF SECONDARY BEAMS (LOW ENERGY PROTONS) AND
           OF NEUTRONS AND GAMMAS WERE DISCUSSED. THE BEAM CURRENT
           CALCULATED FROM NA-24 ACTIVITY WAS SOME 10-20 PER-CENT
           HIGHER THAN THAT FROM THE BE-7 ACTIVITY WHICH WAS
           CONSIDERED TO GIVE MORE ACCURATE VALUES.
           THE CURRENT CALCULATED FROM THE NA-22 DATA WAS ALSO
           HIGH, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT, 5-15 PER-CENT.
