METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV,CHSEP,GSPEC)
           Range-enery curves due to J.H.Atkinson JR et al.,
           UCRL 2426 rev, Vol 2, 35 (1957) for alpha particles
           and I.C.Northcliffe,Phys.Rev.,120,1744 (1960) and Ann.
           Rev.Nucl.Sci,13,67 (1963) for heavy ions.
           The range of alpha particles in zinc was determined
           relative to that in aluminium by experiments with
           combinations of zinc, aluminium and blue cellophane.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,GELI)
SAMPLE     Zinc: Natural zinc and enriched 94Zn4 of 99.85% for
              low bombarding energy, vacuum evaporated onto
              aluminium after deposition of 1 Angstrom silver.
              For higher bombarding energy, commercial 13 micro-
              meter foils when beam loss per foil < 1 MeV.
           Chromium: Natural chromium. Vacuum evaporated onto
              aluminium.
           Iron: Enriched 56Fe of 99.7% evapolated onto aluminium
              from basic tartrate solution at pH 9.5 natural iron
              evapolated onto aluminium. The uniformity of all
              foils was checked by the accurat weighing of
              segments of the foil, which had been cut with a die
              of known area. Thickness variation of foils used
              was within 3%.
INC-SPECT  The maximum incident alpha beam energies were measured
           via the observed range in stacks of aluminium plus
           blue cellophane foils in which ionization-induced
           bleaching indicates the depth of beam penetration.
           Heavy ion beams (12C and 16O) were magnetically
           analysed upstream of targets.

ERR-ANALYS Uncertainties in alpha particle energy in zinc were
           estimated by experiments as 0.8 MeV in average.
           Uncertainties in cross sections were from statistical
           uncertainties in radioassays and uncertainties in
           detector efficiencies. Absolute errors were less than
           +-20% and relative errors less than +-10%.
