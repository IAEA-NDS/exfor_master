FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The 60 in. cyclotron at the
           University of Washington.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Targets were bombarded with helium ions and
           the fission fragment cross section yields, for the
           formation of the various fission fragments were
           determined radiochemically. After bombardment, the
           aluminum catcher foils and Re powder were dissolved
           in a solution of HCl-HNO3 and carders of the isotopes
           to be separated.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
