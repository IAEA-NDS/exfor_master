FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the tandem
           cyclotron system at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory, East Lansing
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene target (CD2)n with thickness
           of (10.7+-0.8)mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Beam-like residues were collected and
           analyzed with the S800 spectro-graph positioned at
           0deg scattering angle.
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected by high resolution
           gamma ray array GRETINA (Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking
           In-beam Nuclear Array).GRETINA detectors were
           positioned in two rings at laboratory angles of 58deg
           and 90deg with respect to the beam direction.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between gammma rays from reaction
           products detected in GRETINA and reaction residue
           identified in S800 spectrograph was required
           (GSPEC) Level properties were determined with the help
           of gamma spetrometry
           Inverse kinematics was used.
INC-SOURCE Radioactive beam of 56Ni ions was produced by
           in-flight fragmentation of primary 58Ni beam with
           energy of 160MeV/A on 9Be production target. 56Ni
           ions were separated using A1900 fragment separator.
           The 56Ni beam had purity of 47% and average intensity
           of 3E+5 particles per sec.
