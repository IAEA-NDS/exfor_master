FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was carried out at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University.
SAMPLE     CD2 reaction target with thickness of (110+-5) mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using GRETINA array.
           GRETINA consists of 28 highly segmented coaxial
           germanium crystals. Each crystal is segmented into 36
           electrically isolated elements and four crystals are
           combined in a single cryostat to form a quad-crystal
           module. In present experiment 8 detctor modules were
           used.
           (SCIN) Neutrons were detected using LENDA array of 24
           plastic scintillator bars with dimensions 300 x 45 x
           25 mm3. Each bar is read out by two PM tubes. Array
           is located at a distance of 1 m from reaction target.
           Energy is determined by time of flight. Neutrons with
           energies 150 keV to 10 MeV can be detected with high
           efficiency.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidencce between LENDA and GRETINA arrays
           was required
INC-SOURCE Stable 24Mg beam with an intensity of 60 pnA at 170
           MeV/A impinged on a 1904 mg/cm2 thick 9Be production
           target at the entrance of the A1900 fragment
           separator. Resulting beam was purified in A1900
           resulting ina 23Al beam with purity of 13%. and
           intensity 8E+3 particles/s.
