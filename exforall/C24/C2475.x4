INSTITUTE  (1USAWWS)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88 in. cyclotron at the Lawrence
           Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California.
SAMPLE     (82-PB-207,ENR=0.924) Targets of enriched 207Pb (92.4
           percent) in their foil form.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Targets were bombarded by the 65 MeV helium
           ions in Berkeley, California. The targets were then
           flown to the laboratories in Bellingham where the
           fission fragments were separated by standard
           radiochemical techniques. The period of time between
           the end of bombardment to the time when counting of
           the radiochemically separated species began, was
           about l0 h.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) It was assumed that the beam currents of
           the Berkeley cyclotron were steady within a 10 per
           cent deviation and since the counting statistics were
           extremely good for the species separated (~5 percent
           error) , the values quoted in this table have an error
           of about +-20 per cent or less.

ANALYSIS   The summation of the cross-section for each fission
           fragment was determined from the curve and produced a
           total fission fragment cross section of 44.5+-5 mbarn.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
