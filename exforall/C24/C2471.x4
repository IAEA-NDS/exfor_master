SAMPLE     Approximately 100 mg of 235U foil (about 50 mg/cm2) ,
           surrounded by very pure one mil aluminum catcher foils
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWSU) The University of Washington 60-in.
           cyclotron
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 3in. x 3in. NaI(Tl) crystal - for 0.77 MeV
           gamma rays from the 35 day 95Nb.
           (NAICR) A thin 1/32in. x 1in. circular NaI(Tl) crystal-
           for the K X-ray accompanying the internal conversion
           decay mode of the 0.234 MeV level for 90 hr 95mNb.
METHOD     (CHSEP,GSPEC)
CORRECTION A correction was made for the growth of the 65 day 95Zr
           into 95Nb during and after bombardment before the first
           chemical separation. The correction due to 95Zr decay
           was 25 per cent of the total activity. In evaluating
           the absolute efficiency for the detection of the
           isomeric state corrections were made for the
           fluorescence yield (0.72), conversion in higher shells
             (K/[K + L + M]= 0.79), absorption in the detector
           window, and self-absorption in the sample itself.
