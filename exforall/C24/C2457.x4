FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at LANL IPF with
           an incident proton beam energy of 100.0 MeV
SAMPLE     Metallic 232Th target was encapsulated in Inconel
           cladding and loaded in the C-slot of the LANL-IPF
           production stack. Aluminium energy degraders occupied
           slots A and B and reduced beam energy to 15-30 MeV.
           In front of the Th target a natural Ni foil was placed
           for monitoring purposes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Reaction products were measured using HPGe
           detector Ortec Model GMX- 35200-S. Detector diameter
           was 50 mm and its length was 53.5 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method with chemical
           separation of reaction products was used
           Proton energy at the Th target was determined from
           activity ratio 57Ni/57Co
