REL-REF    (M,C2473001,E.F.Neuzil,J,JIN,27,3,1965) Chemical
           techniques.
INSTITUTE  (1USAWWS)
METHOD     (CHSEP) A radiochemical study. In each case the
           bombarded targets were flown and/or driven to our
           laboratories here in Bellingham for analysis where
           the fission fragments were separated and purified
           using standard radio chemical techniques.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Although error bars are not indicated,the
           systematic errors are about +-20 percent.

           (81-TL-205,ENR=0.0504) For the 31 and 42 MeV work,
           target weights were about 12 mg of Tl203. The Tl2O3
           to be bombarded was wrapped and pressed into a small

           bombardment.
