TITLE      Nuclear Transformations Produced in Copper by
           Alpha-Particle Bombardment

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The cyclotron in the Radiation
           Laboratory at the University of California.
SAMPLE     0.0001 in. thick copper foils.
DETECTOR   Cloud or Wilson chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Measurements were made for the purpose of
           determining the excitation function of copper. A
           preliminary experiment was made in which a pile of
           ten copper foils, each 0.0001 in. thick, were exposed
           so that the alpha-particle beam fell normally on the
           first foil. Only the first five foils were found to
           be active. A second experiment was performed with
           five 0.0001 in. copper foils and the activities were
           followed on an electroscope for 35 hours. The
           stopping power of the foils was determined by
           observing visually the decrease in range of the
           alpha-particle beam in air on introducing the five
           foils into its path. The range was found to be
           decreased by 5 cm and, accordingly, it was assumed
           that each foil was equivalent to 1 cm of air. The
           range of the beam in air was 11.5 cm.
CORRECTION The results for the short and long periods were
           corrected to infinite bombardment (after twenty
           minutes bombardment the first foil showed initial
           activities of 1.5 and 0.165 electroscope divisions
           per second for the short and long periods,
           respectively).
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: the original mean alpha particle
           range in cm of air was converted to energy using the
           classical assumption of 1 MeV per cm. It is
           reproducing 11 MeV cyclotron energy well. This
           article represents one of the first activation
           experiments associated with Professor J.R. Oppenheimer.
