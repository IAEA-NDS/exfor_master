FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 188 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected by SEGA array
           consisting of 16 32-fold segmented HPGe detectors.
           The detectors were arranged in two rings with central
           angles of 37deg and 90 deg.
           (MAGSP) Projectile-like reaction residues were
           momentum-analysed in S800 spectrometer and identified
           event-by-event in focal plane detector.
CORRECTION All gamma ray energies were Doppler corrected using
           information from HPGe detector segment and momentum of
           reaction residues.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The secondary 56Ni beam was produced by
           projectile fragmentation of 160 MeV/A 58Ni primary
           beam on a thick 610 mg/cm2 9Be target. The 56Ni
           secondary beam was analysed using A1900 fragment
           separator and was unambiguously distinguished from
           all contaminants via the time-of-flight difference
           measured between two plastic scintillators located at
           the exit of the A1900 and the object position of the
           S800 analysis beam line.
