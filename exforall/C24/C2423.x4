FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed using K150
           cyclotron at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M
           University.
SAMPLE     Active volume of the TPC. Target was methane gas CH4
           with purity of 99.999%. Pressure in TPC was adjusted
           to stop incoming 8Be beam before the last 16 rows of
           the central pads to 435 Torr.
DETECTOR   A time projection chamber (TPC) TexAT was used for
           identification and tracking of reaction products.
           TexAT has a planar geometry with Micromegas readout.
           Micromegas detector has active area 224 x 224 mm2.
           TPC allowed for complete kinematic reconstruction
           of each event
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber is integral part of
           TexAT, located close to the entrance window.
           Ionization chamber is used for beam particle
           identification and overal normalization.
           (TELES,SI,CSICR) Total nine Si-CsI(Tl) telescope
           detectors were positioned in the forward region of
           TexAT chamber. Si detectors with area 5cm x 5cm,
           700-1000 mu-m thick were divided into four 2.5cm x
           2.5cm square segments. Each Si detector was backed by
           5cm x 5cm x 4cm CsI(Tl) scintillation detector.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The 8B beam was produced in the reaction
           6Li(3He,n)8B. The primary 6Li beam made above
           reaction in a liquid nitrogen cooled 3He gas cell.
           Cell was 9.2 cm long with diameter of 19 mm and has 4
           mu-m thick Havar entrance and exit windows. Pressure
           of 3He gas was 810 torr. The energy of the primary
           6Li beam was 13.2MeV/A, resulting 8B beam has energy
            (60.8+- 1.2) MeV and intensity about 10E+3 pps.
