FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Berkeley 88-in. variable-energy
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     The gold targets were prepared by standard
           volatilization methods, using gold of the highest
           available purity. (Available from Cominco Products,
           Inc., Spokane, Washington.) Self-supporting foils of
           thickness ~3 mg/cm2 were obtained, and the thickness
           of the foils was measured by weighing a known area. A
           target thickness of ~3 mg/cm2 is roughly optimum for
           maximum sensitivity for detection of fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (TRD) The fission-fragment detectors were rectangular
           strips of mica of width 1 cm, length 1.25 cm, and
           convenient thickness (~10-2 cm) . The strips were
           cleaved along layer planes in order to obtain fresh
           surfaces.
METHOD     (EXTB) Upon completion of the bombardments the mica
           detectors were soaked in 27 M hydrofluoric acid for
           30 min and were washed and dried. Finally the strips
           were mounted between two microscope cover glasses.
           The density of fission tracks in a "standard area"
           was determined by scanning under a microscope with a
           suitable magnification.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The standard error listed as the uncertainty
           in the density of tracks per standard strip is purely
           statistical and does not take into account the
           possibility of systematic errors.
