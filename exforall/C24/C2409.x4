FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed using TwinSol
           facility at the 10MV UND FN-Tandem Accelerator at the
           Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre
           Dame
SAMPLE     (28-NI-58,ENR=0.99) Enriched Ni foil with thickness
           of 0.75 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Detector setup consisted of 3 telescope
           detectors with dE and E detector 20 mu-m and 1000
           mu-m thick at forward angles and 4 E detectors
           1000 mu-m thick at backward angles.
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification
           at forward angles.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(6-C-10,EL)79-AU-197,,DA,,RTH)
           It was assumed, that elastic scattering in this
           angular range is pure Rutherford scattering.
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The 10C secondary radioactive beam was
           produced in-flight using 3He(10B,10C) charge-
           exchange reaction. The 10B(5+) primary beam
            was accelerated to an energy of 54.0 MeV
           and had an intensity of typically 200 enA. Primary
           target was a 3He gas cell with pressure of 0.5 atm,
           sealed with 2 mu-m thick Ti foils. Two
           superconducting solenoids of the TwinSol system
           collected, selected and focused the secondary beam of
           10C produced in the forward direction.
