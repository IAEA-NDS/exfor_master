METHOD     (CHSEP) A radiochemical study. Bombardments were
           accomplished with either the 41 MeV helium ion beam
           of the cyclotron at the University of Washington in
           Seattle, or the 65 MeV helium ion beam of the
           cyclotron at the University of California at
           Berkeley. In each case the bombarded targets were
           flown and/or driven to our laboratories here in
           Bellingham for analysis where the fission fragments
           were separated and purified using standard
           radiochemical techniques.

SAMPLE     The zone-refined tantalum metal used in this work was
           purchased from Semi-Elements Inc and came in the form
           of a rod about 1 in. long and I/8 in. in dia. The
           composition of the rod was determined by the seller
           to be 99.993% tantalum and 0.007% impurities. The
           targets, which weighed about 50 mg for the 41 MeV
           bombardments.

ANALYSIS   The total fission cross-sections  were obtained
           in the usual manner by summing the individual fission
           fragment cross-sections over the resolved mass
           distribution curves.
