TITLE      Production of neutron-rich Bi isotopes by transfer
           reactions

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS,1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88-Inch Cyclotron at the Lawrence
           Berkeley Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Si(Au) surface barrier detectors.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,ASPEC) The chemical procedure used to
           separate bismuth isotopes after irradiation was similar
           for all of the targets. The targets were dissolved in
           ~0.5 ml warm acid containing a known quantity of
           38-yr 207Bi for chemical yield determination.
           Concentrated HC1 containing a few drops of 6M HNO3
           was used to dissolve the Pb and Tl targets, and aqua
           regia was used for the HgS targets. The
           radiochemically separated Bi samples were measured
           with an alpha-spectrometer system consisting of four
           independent Si(Au) surface barrier detectors allowing
           four samples to be counted simultaneously. Counting
           of a sample was typically started 20-30 min after the
           end of an irradiation and continued for a period of
           several hours.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,50.) Overall errors are estimated to be
           estimated <50% for all points.

           in Pb (98.7%) with thicknesses ranging from 3.4 to

           coatings of 0.4-0.7 mg/cm2 and thicker Al backings
            (2.17 mg/cm2) to stop the recoiling reaction products.
