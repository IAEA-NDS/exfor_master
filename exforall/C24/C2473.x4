TITLE      Helium ion-induced fission of 197Au from 41.1 MeV to
           26.8 MeV

INSTITUTE  (1USAWWS)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The 60 in. cyclotron at the
           University of Washington.
SAMPLE     The gold targets were arranged using the ordinary
           stacked foil technique. These stacked foils consisted
           of four pure gold foils sandwiched between two pieces
           of zone refined hyper-pure aluminum foil, which
           served as a catcher for any recoiling fission
           fragments escaping from the gold target itself. These
           gold sandwiches were placed at various positions
           within a stack. In front of each foil was placed a
           stainless steel or aluminum degrader.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (STTA,CHSEP) The various species to be separated were
           obtained using standard radio-chemical techniques. In
           each experiment the fission fragments were isolated
           and counted by the usual beta techniques.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) From the disintegration rates obtained at the
           end of the bombardment, the cross-section for the
           production of a particular fission product was
           calculated in the usual manner.
CORRECTION The disintegration rate was obtained by correcting
           the activity for absorption of the sample covering,
           scattering within the Geiger chamber, self absorption,
           absorption of air and window of the Geiger chamber,
           back scattering, dead time, and geometry.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Present day 201Tl(a) decay to
           197Au value is 1534.0 keV, it was ~0.9 MeV in the
           past. Consequently, alpha beam energies of 41.1, 34.2,
           28.8 and 26.8 MeV correspond to compound nucleus
           excitation energies of 40.2, 33.3, 27.9 and 25.9 MeV.
