REACTION  1(94-PU-240(D,F),PRE,AKE,LF)
          2(94-PU-240(D,F),PRE,AKE,HF)
SAMPLE     The 240Pu target was a 100 microg/cm2 deposit on 70
           microg/cm2 carbon backing.
METHOD     Fissions from the 240Pu(d,f) reaction were used for
           observing the energy spectra of fragments from prompt
           fission of 242Am. For these prompt fission
           measurements, the detector was placed at 150 degrees
           in a conventional scattering chamber, and various
           incident energies of deuterons were used to produce
           the fission events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Uncertainties in table 1 result from counting
           statistics. Uncertainties resulting from counter
           fatigue were negligibly small.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 1, page 693.
