           (82-PB-208,ENR=0.0348) Enriched isotopes of 204Pb
           were obtained in the form of Pb(NO3)2 crystals.
           Targets were prepared in the usual manner by using
           the lead nitrate crystals as received or in a few
           cases by using lead powder which was
           electrochemically reduced from an aqueous solution of
           the nitrate. The amount of lead in the prepared
           target usually ranged between 0.5 and 3.0 mg.
METHOD     (CHSEP,EXTB) Targets of the enriched 204Pb were
           bombarded with helium ions and the fission fragment
           cross sections determined radiochemically. The
           targets were then flown to our laboratories in
           Bellingham where the fission fragments were separated
           and purified by the standard radiochemical
           techniques. The period of time between end of
           bombardment and counting the purified samples was
           short enough (~15 hr.) and the fission cross sections
           high enough that even 2.7 hr 92Sr could be easily
           identified. Due to the expense of the target material,
           most of the bombardments were made using the 73
           percent enriched isotope (Sample #1). The value
           measured experimentally, however, was the total
           fission cross section for all the isotopes present.
           The value of the fission cross section for 204Pb
           alone was then resolved by subtracting the
           contributions from all the "impurity" isotopes.
