INC-SPECT  The total He3 current involved was 10-30 microA h and
           the incident He3 beam energy on the top of the
           stacked foil target was 32 MeV, giving an average
           bombarding energy in the target of 30.6 MeV.
SAMPLE     1-mil natural uranium foils.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Low-background (0.12-0.20 counts/min) gas-
           flow Geiger counters fitted with surrounding
           anticoincidence guard counters (manufactured by
           Tracerlab, Inc., Boston, Mass.) .
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Standard radiochemical techniques were
           modified for use in the separations, and were
           repeated many times for the lower-yield isotopes to
           obtain the required level of decontamination from the
           gross amounts of high-yield binary fission products.
           The low-yield binary and ternary products were
           counted in Geiger counters. Radiochemical purity was
           established by the characteristic decay and by
           constant specific activity tests. In many cases it
           was possible to follow the decay through 4-6
           half-lives; resolution of the decay curves from the
           always-present contaminates was accomplished in an
           objective manner by computer analysis.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted for the individual cross
           sections were estimated from replicate determinations
           and uncertainties in the corrections for
           contributions from spallation impurities, counting
           efficiency estimations, decay curve resolutions, and
           in chemical yield determinations.

ANALYSIS   The total binary-fission cross section of U238
           induced by 30.6-MeV He3 ions is estimated by
           integration of half the area under the mass-yield
           curve to be 750+-75 mb.

ANALYSIS   A preliminary mass-yield curve was constructed from
           those masses where the isotopic yields and isobaric
           yields were identical. This curve is independent of
           any charge distribution recipe. The other isobaric
           yields were then entered and the values of nubar, the
           average number of neutrons emitted per fission, were
           obtained.
