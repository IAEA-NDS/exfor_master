FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiments was performed at the
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     The secondary 9Be reaction target (188 mg/cm2 thick)
           was located at the target position of the S800
           spectrograph
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The projectile-like reaction residues were
           momentum-analysed in S800 spectrograph and identified
           on event-by-event basis from their energy loss and
           time of flight in S800 focal plane detector.
           (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted by reaction residues were
           detected by HPGe Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA)
           array. The 16 32-fold segmented high-purity germanium
           detectors were arranged in two rings with central
           angles of 37deg (7 detectors) and 90deg (9 detectors)
           relative to the beam axis. Gamma-ray energies were
           event-by event reconstructed from detector angle and
           beam velocity. Coincidence with reaction residues
           identified in S800 focal plane detector was required.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF,COINC)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The secondary 55Co beam was produced from a
           160 MeV/u 58Ni primary beam in projectile
           fragmentation on a thick 610 mg/cm2 9Be target. The
           secondary beam consisted of 55Co(27%) 56Ni (72%),
           54Fe (1%). The secondary beam of interest 55Co could
           be unambiguously distinguished via time of flight at
           the exit of the A1900 fragment separator.
