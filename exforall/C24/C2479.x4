TITLE      Search for Evidence of Ternary Fission Induced in
           Au197, Bi209, and Pu239 by Intermediate-Energy Helium

DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Gas-flow Geiger counters.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation procedures were
           developed and modified from existing techniques for
           the isotopes and target materials involved and
           purification procedures were repeated until
           sufficient decontamination of the ternary and
           binary-fission products was obtained. Counting was
           carried out in low-background (0.09-0.20-counts/min)
           gas-flow Geiger counters fitted with a surrounding
           anticoincidence guard counter.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Cross sections for 209Bi, 197Au,
           239Pu alpha absorptions are given as a function of
           compound nuclei excitation energies. Using the AME
           2016 the Q-values for 213At(a), 201Tl(a) and 243Cm(a)
           decays were deduced as 9254.0, 1534.0 and 6168.8 keV.
           These values could be used to reconstruct the alpha   C
           beam energies.

           vacuum evaporated onto Lexan strips which were
