TITLE      Mass distribution in the fission of 238U with 3He ions

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL)
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.999) Circular pieces of uranium foil,
           supplied by Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., Erwin,
           Tennessee, of 2-mil (96.8mg/cm2) thickness served as
           the target material. Isotopic analysis supplied by
           the manufacturer was given as 99.9% 238U. The target
           assembly consisted of three pieces of uranium
           "sandwiched" between l-mil aluminum catcher foils,
           i.e. a l-mil aluminum foil followed by a 2-mil
           uranium foil, two 1-mil aluminum foils, a uranium
           foil, etc.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,PROPC,NAICR) A calibrated GM counter or a
           windowless proportional counter of known geometry
            (Canberra Instruments). In some cases these
           measurements were supplemented by gamma-counting with
           a NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal in conjunction with a
           Nuclear Data 512 pulse-height channel analyzer.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Following irradiation the target
           assembly was dismantled and each uranium target
           dissolved in HCl and HNO3 together with its forward
           and backward recoil catcher foils. Final forms of the
           counting samples were solids mounted on small pieces
           of filter paper and aluminum discs and covered with
           Pliofilm. The final precipitates were generally
           counted with multiple detectors.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves were resolved into their
           components and a disintegration rate computed. The
           rate was then converted into an absolute cross
           section.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for chemical yield, intrinsic
           counting efficiency, back-scattering, self-absorption,
           and self-scattering.

INC-SPECT  Cyclotron irradiations, employing a total 3He current
           of 2.5 microamph, were carried out at Argonne
           National Laboratory. The energies quoted here refer
           to the average of the energy of the beam incident
           upon the face of the target and that emerging from
           the rear of the target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error limits in individual values were
           determined as standard deviations compounded from
           estimated errors in the disintegration rate, the
           various counting factors, and chemical yield
           determinations.
