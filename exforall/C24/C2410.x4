FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           Coupled-Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target located at the target position
           of the S800. The liquid hydrogen was contained by a
           cylindrical aluminum target cell, with a 125 mu-m
           Kapton entrance and exit windows. The nominal target
           thickness was 30 mm. The temperature and the pressure
           of the target cell were 17.0 K and 880 Torr.
           Variations of target thickness caused by pressure
           difference across Kapton entrance and exit windows
           were taken into account. Areal density of the target
           was (240+-2) mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Outgoing beam particles were identified by
           energy loss in the S800 ionization chamber and time
           of flight.
           (HPGE) The gamma rays emitted by the reaction products
           were detected by eight modules of the GRETINA
           gamma-ray tracking array, centered on the target.
           Eight modules housing four 36-fold segmented
           high-purity germanium crystals were installed on one
           of the GRETINA mounting hemispheres to accommodate
           the target. Two modules were centered at 58deg, four
           at 90deg, and two at 122deg with respect to the beam
           axis.
METHOD     (TOF) Particles in the secondary beam as well as
           reaction products were identified using time of flight.
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The secondary beams 42,44S and 41,43P were
           produced by fragmentation of a 140 MeV/nucleon 48Ca
           primary beam in a 1222 mg/cm2 9Be production target
           and separated by the A1900 fragment separator. Two
           magnet settings of the A1900 were used with momentum
           acceptance of 2%. Aluminium wedge was used to
           separate secondary beams by Z. The secondary beams
           were momentum analysed by S800 spectrograph.
           Particles were identified by time of flight using
           scintillation detectors in A1900 focal plane and
           object and focal plane of S800 spectrograph.
