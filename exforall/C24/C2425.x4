           low energy fission

INSTITUTE  (1USAWAU)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The University of Washington 60-in.
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Approximately 100 mg of 235U foil (~50 mg/cm2),
           surrounded by very pure one mil aluminum catcher foils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A Harshaw Integral Line Assembly 3 in. x 3 in.
           NaI(T1) crystal.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) A 235U foil, was bombarded by 10 MeV
           protons for two hours using the University of
           Washington 60-in. cyclotron with an average proton
           current of 35 microA. Several min after the end of
           bombardment the catcher foils were dissolved in 3 ml
           of concentrated HCL. The 0.77 MeV gamma rays from the
           35 day 95Nb were counted. The decay of the 90 hr
           95mNb isomer was observed by detection of the Nb K
           X-ray accompanying the nearly 100 per cent internal
           conversion decay mode of this 0.234 MeV level.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
