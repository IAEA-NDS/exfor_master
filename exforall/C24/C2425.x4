INSTITUTE  (1USAWAU)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The University of Washington 60-in.
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Approximately 100 mg of 235U foil (~50 mg/cm2),
           surrounded by very pure one mil aluminum catcher foils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A Harshaw Integral Line Assembly 3 in. x 3 in.
           NaI(T1) crystal.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) A 235U foil, was bombarded by 10 MeV
           protons for two hours using the University of
           Washington 60-in. cyclotron with an average proton
           current of 35 microA. Several min after the end of
           bombardment the catcher foils were dissolved in 3 ml
           of concentrated HCL. The 0.77 MeV gamma rays from the
           35 day 95Nb were counted. The decay of the 90 hr
           95mNb isomer was observed by detection of the Nb K
           X-ray accompanying the nearly 100 per cent internal
           conversion decay mode of this 0.234 MeV level.
CORRECTION A correction was made for the growth of the 65 day 95Zr
           into 95Nb during and after bombardment before the first
           chemical separation. The correction due to 95Zr decay
           was 25 per cent of the total activity. In evaluating
           the absolute efficiency for the detection of the
           isomeric state corrections were made for the
           fluorescence yield (0.72), conversion in higher shells
             (K/[K + L + M]= 0.79), absorption in the detector
           window, and self-absorption in the sample itself.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
