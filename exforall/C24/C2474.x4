METHOD     (MASSP,STTA) After a cooling period of greater than
           two months, the foils were melted in a closed,
           evacuated system to release the rare gases. The rare
           gas fraction was purified and introduced to the
           spectrometer for a mass analysis in the static mode.
           The mass spectrometer was an ultra-high vacuum 6-in.
           radius, 60-deg-sector, single direction focusing
           instrument which employed an electron multiplier ion
           detector for high sensitivity. The Kr yields in these
           experiments were measured relative to the 84Kr chain
           yield. The 85Kr (ten-year) relative to 84Kr was
           corrected for any decay of the ten-year Kr. From the
           relative chain yields of 83Kr, 84Kr, and 86Kr, it is
           possible to derive the chain yield for 85Kr by
           interpolation.

ANALYSIS   In order to derive information concerning the
           independent production of Kr isomers, we calculate
           the quantity sigmag/(sigmag+sigmam) from the
           independent fractional chain yield of 85Kr and the
           fraction (f) of the mass-85 chain which directly
           populates the 9/2 state: f=(R - b)/(1 - b) , where b
           is the branching from the spin 1/2 state (0.219) and
           R is the ratio of 85Kr (ten-year) to mass-85 chain
           yield.
