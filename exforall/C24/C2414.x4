DETECTOR   (SCIN,MWPC) PAGODA detector system: The apparatus
           consists of eight identical gas modules, six arrays
           of nine phoswich scintillator detectors behind the
           most forward six gas modules, and a 34 element
           phoswich projectile hodoscope.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are mainly due to uncertainties
           in the integrated beam.
