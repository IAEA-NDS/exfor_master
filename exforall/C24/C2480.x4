INC-SPECT  Beam currents were typically 100-400 nA and the
           measured beam width was 1.6 mm.
SAMPLE     The target was composed of 75 microg/cm2 enriched
           238UF4 which had been vaporized onto a 100 microg/cm2
           nickel foil.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Normal surface-barrier semiconductor detectors.
METHOD     Measurement of both in-plane and out-of-plane angular
           correlations for binary fission events.

ANALYSIS   The in-plane angular correlations are not symmetric.
           Reflection of the low-angle portion of the angular
           correlation selects the events which fall under this
           symmetrized curve that are assigned to compound
           nucleus formation reactions. The remaining events are
           attributed to non-compound-nucleus (NCN) fission
           events.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted here reflect
           experimental errors due to counting statistics and
           angular resolution as well as uncertainties
           originating in the method of integrating the angular
           correlation functions.

ANALYSIS   The average initial (i.e. before neutron evaporation)
           total kinetic energy release in the c.m. system is
           found to be 173.3+-5.4 MeV from the gross correlation
           events and 170.9 MeV and 173.5 MeV respectively for
           the 80 and 82 degrees out-of- plane correlation
           measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute errors for the total kinetic
           energy release range from +-4.0 MeV for the most
           probable angles to about +-6.0 MeV for angles on the
           wings of the angular correlation; however, the
           relative error between these points is considerably
           better than this. It is assumed that on the average
           3.5 neutrons per fragment are evaporated from the
           fragments for each fission.
FLAG      2(1.) Corrected for neutron evaporation assuming
           nubar=7.1 for compound nucleus events and nubar=3.5
           for NCN (Non-Compound Nucleus) processes.
