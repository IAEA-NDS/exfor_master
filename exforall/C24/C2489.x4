INSTITUTE  (1USAWAU)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The University of Washington 60-in.
           cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) A set of four end-window Geiger-Muller
           counters.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Mass-yield curves have been measured
           radiochemically.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were plotted and analyzed in
           the usual way, and the half-lives of the component
           species always agreed closely with the values for
           known fission product species of the elements being
           counted.
CORRECTION Corrections for absorption of the radiations by air,
           polystyrene, and counter window; and for scattering
           by Scotch tape, filter paper, polystyrene, air, and
           counter housing. Sample absorption and scattering
           corrections were made.

SAMPLE     Pure gold was readily available in 4 in.x4 in. sheets,
           ~2.6 mg/cm2 thick, as dental gold foil. The gold
           target consisted of several thicknesses of this foil
           cut into a strip approximately 1cm by 8cm. It was
           bombarded between two pure aluminum foils, each about
           3 mg/cm2 thick, which served to catch fission
           fragments escaping from the target foil.

           were bombarded with 41.9-MeV helium ions and the

           isotopic composition of each target it was possible
           to solve four simultaneous equations in four unknowns
           for the formation cross section of Y93 of each of the
