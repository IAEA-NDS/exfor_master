TITLE      Mass spectrometric determination of Rb fission yields
           from 3He and 4He induced fission of 238U and 232Th

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAS) 54-in sector-focused cyclotron at
           Washington University, St. Louis.
INC-SPECT  At 32-MeV, a 3He beam intensity of I microA gave a
           typical 91Rb counting rate of about I5,000 ions/s.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of 238U or 232Th powder (10
           microm size) intimately mixed with graphite powder
           and pressed into a small block about 100 mg/cm2
           thick. The ratio of metal-to-graphite was 4-to-1 by
           weight.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties are based only on the
           standard deviation of the mean values. Values with no
           uncertainty were used to normalize different runs.
CORRECTION The correction factor for growth, decay, and
           diffusion was implemented. The saturation factor
           corrected for those isotopes whose half-lives were an
           appreciable fraction of the total run time. The
           maximum corrections were 40% for mass 89 and 2% for
           mass 90 for a run with 34 MeV 3He on a 238U target.
           The correction for radioactive decay requires
           knowledge of the diffusion components.

METHOD     (MASSP) The relative cumulative yields of Rb isotopes
           were measured by scanning the mass spectrum rapidly
           while the cyclotron beam was on continuously. The
           mass spectrum was scanned by holding the magnetic
           field constant and imposing a triangular waveform to
           the accelerating voltage at a repetition rate of 25
           cycles/s. Sweep up and sweep down mass spectra were
           stored separately in 100 channel segments of a
           multiscaler.
