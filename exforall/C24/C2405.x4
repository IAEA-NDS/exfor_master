INSTITUTE  (1USAPEN)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAPEN) The University of Pennsylvania Tandem
           accelerator.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)
SAMPLE     (8-O-17,ENR=0.40) The target was prepared from 017
           gas of about 50% enrichment which was converted to
           tungsten oxide, the latter being evaporated directly
           onto a thin carbon film.
METHOD     A 40% enriched target of 017 was bombarded with 10 MeV
           deuterons from the University of Pennsylvania Tandem
           accelerator and the emitted protons were analyzed
           with a 65 cm radius broad-range magnetic
           spectrograph. Energy spectra were measured at 8
           angles in the range 7 to 70 degrees.
