TITLE      Reaction mechanism studies with 7-35 MeV/nucleon 4He
           ions incident on heavy target nuclei

DETECTOR   (SIBAR,TELES,SIBAR) Heavy-ion Si-surface-barrier
           detector. Particle telescope consisting of two
           totally depleted silicon-surface-barrier transmission
           detectors.
METHOD     (EDE) Fission-fragment angular-distribution
           measurements were performed at alpha-particle
           energies of 27.5, 33.5, 43.8, 49.9, 58.9, 70.5,
           and 140 MeV for the alpha+233U system and at 69.2 and
           140 MeV for the alpha+209Bi system. Measurements were
           performed in ten-degree steps from 10 to 170 degrees.
           In addition, finer angular steps of 2 to 4 degrees
           were taken near 10, 90, and 170 to define the shape
           of the angular distribution in these regions. The
           fragment angular distributions were measured with a
           particle telescope consisting of two totally depleted
           silicon-surface-barrier transmission detectors (a 4
           microm thick dE and a 25 microm thick E).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) The integrated beam current (with an error of
           +-5% due to the absolute accuracy of the Faraday cup)
           was used for absolute normalization of the data.
