TITLE      -HALF-LIFE OF U-238 SPONTANEOUS FISSION AND ITS
            FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGIES.-
FACILITY   .NO FACILITY USED.
INC-SOURCE (A-BE ) AN AM-BE NEUTRON SOURCE, THERMALIZED BY A
            PARAFFIN WALL OF 30 CM THICKNESS, USED FOR SATURA-
            TION CHARACTERISTICS AND ENERGY CALIBRATION.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL URANIUM OXIDE (MAINLY U3O8) FIXED ON THE
            CATHODE SUFACE OF THE IONIZATION CHAMBER, 458 MG
            IN WEIGHT AND 0.108 MG/CM2 IN THICKNESS.
METHOD     (PSD  ) PULSE-SHAPING CIRCUIT OF A SEMI-GAUSSIAN
            TYPE USED WITH THE IONIZATION CHAMBER.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) A CYLINDRICAL GRIDDED IONIZATION CHAMBER,
            WITH AN AREA OF 5000 CM2.
ANALYSIS   .THE ENERGY CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED BY USING THE
            FOLLOWING RELATION,
            E=AX+B
            WHERE E IS THE KINETIC ENERGY OF A FISSION FRAGMENT,
            X IS THE PULSE HIGHT AND A AND B ARE CONSTANTS.
           .THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE,
            THE CONSTANT A IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE MASS AND
            EQUAL TO A CONSTANT FOR ALPHA PARTICLES,
            THE MASS DISTRIBUTION OF U-238 SPONTANEOUS FISSION
            IS EQUAL TO THAT OF U-235 THERMAL NEUTRON INDUCED
            FISSION.
