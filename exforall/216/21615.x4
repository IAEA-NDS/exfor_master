TITLE       Half-life of U-238 spontaneous fission and its
            fragment kinetic energies
FACILITY   .No facility used.
SAMPLE     .Natural uranium oxide (mainly U3O8) fixed on the
            cathode surface of the ionization chamber, 458 mg
            in weight and 0.108 mg/cm2 in thickness.
METHOD     (PSD) Pulse-shaping circuit of a semi-Gaussian
            type used with the ionization chamber.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A cylindrical gridded ionization chamber,
            with an area of 5000 cm2.
ANALYSIS   .The energy calibration was performed by using the
            following relation,
            E=AX+B
            where E is the kinetic energy of a fission fragment,
            X is the pulse height and A and B are constants.
           .The following assumptions were made,
            the constant A is not dependent on the mass and
            equal to a constant for alpha particles,
            the mass distribution of U-238 spontaneous fission
            is equal to that of U-235 thermal neutron induced
            fission.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from Nucl.Instr.&Meth.154,335,1978
CORRECTION .For-
            - contribution from U-235 fission induced by cosmic-
              ray produced thermal neutrons (negligibly small),
            - pile-up pulses from alpha-particles, which
              above 25 MeV becomes negligibly small.
            - Electronic noise pulses from the external
              disturbances (no correction necessary),
            - effects of the self-absorption and cylindrical
              geometry of the cathode.

            thermal-neutron-induced fission.
           The kinetic energy spectrum of 235U thermalneutron-
           induced fission was measured, in order to check the
           saturation characteristics of pulse height and to
           calibrate the energies of fragments from
           238U spontaneous fission.
