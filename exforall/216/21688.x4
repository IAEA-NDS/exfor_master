TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE NUCLEAR SCATTERING AMPLITUDE
            OF URANIUM-235 BY NEUTRON DIFFRACTION.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2TUKCNA) TR-1 REACTOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH A
           (SPECC) CRYTAL SPECTROMETER.
            THE REACTOR HAS A POWER OF 1 MEGA-WATT.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE NEUTRONS ORIGINATING FROM THE REACTOR
            ARE SCATTERED ON THE (111) PLANE OF A COPPER CRYSTAL
            WHICH SERVES AS A MONOCHROMATOR. THE WAVELENGTH IS
            1.0824 ANGSTROM.
SAMPLE     .SEVERAL U SAMPLES ARE USED WITH DIFFERENT
            ENRICHMENTS. ALL SAMPLES WERE METALLIC BARS
            SHOWING THE POWDER CHARACTER. THEY ARE DESCRIBED
            IN TABLE 1 OF THE MAIN REFERENCE

            ORTHOROMBIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURE.
           .THE SAMPLE WERE OBTAINED FROM CBNM,GEEL (BELGIUM).
METHOD     (DIFFR) THE DIFFRACTED INTENSITY IS MEASURED.
DETECTOR   (BF3  ) PROPORTIONAL COUNTER, CONTAINING 96 PERCENT
            ENRICHED B-F(3). ITS SENSITIVE LENGTH IS 48.26 CM
            AND ITS PRESSURE 40.6 CM HG.
           (PROPC) A SMALL PROPORTIONAL COUNTER IS USED TO
            MONITOR THE NEUTRON FLUX.
