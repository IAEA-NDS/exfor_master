TITLE      -Determination of the nuclear scattering amplitude
            of uranium-235 by neutron diffraction.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2TUKCNA) Tr-1 reactor in conjunction with a
           (SPECC) Crytal spectrometer.
            The reactor has a power of 1 mega-watt.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) The neutrons originating from the reactor
            are scattered on the (111) plane of a copper crystal
            which serves as a monochromator. The wavelength is
            1.0824 angstrom.
SAMPLE     .Several U samples are used with different
            enrichments. All samples were metallic bars
            showing the powder character. They are described
            in table 1 of the main reference

           .The samples are at room temperature. They are
            metallic andin alpha-phase with a base-centered
            orthorombic crystal structure.
           .The sample were obtained from cbnm,geel (belgium).
METHOD     (DIFFR) The diffracted intensity is measured.
DETECTOR   (BF3  ) Proportional counter, containing 96 percent
            enriched B-F(3). Its sensitive length is 48.26 cm
            and its pressure 40.6 cm Hg.
           (PROPC) A small proportional counter is used to
            monitor the neutron flux.
