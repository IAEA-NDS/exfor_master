FACILITY   (REAC,2UK LON) Thermal research reactor
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal column
INC-SPECT  Thermal Maxwellian neutron spectrum
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9554)
            Metal foils of 7.5 mm diameter, 35 mg in weight.
METHOD     Samples transferred pneumatically to and from the
            irradiation position where a constant thermal flux
            was maintained.
           After each irradiation the delayed neutron emission
            rate was measured in a detector consisting of a water
            bath containing BF3 counters.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Water bath containing BF3 counters in cylindrical
            aluminium tubes of O.D. 26 mm, active length 310 mm
            filled with 96% B-10.
           The efficiency was calibrated with a standard Am/Li
            source from National Physical Laboratory which was
            itself calibrated to 0.5% using a manganese sulphate
            bath.
ANALYSIS   Measured neutron decay curve was fitted to the sum of
            five exponential decaying groups by a least square
            method.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F)57-LA-140,CUM,FY,,MXW)
           The number of fission in the U-235 source was monitored
            by measuring the activity of La-140 relative to a
            calibration foil in an absolute ionisation chamber.
           No value given.
CORRECTION Corrections made for
            - volume of Am/Li calibration source,
            - neutron self-absorption in calibration source
               (ANISN calc.),
            - anisotropy of neutron emission,
               of delayed neutrons (Table 1.).
            The total yield was corrected for the absence of the
             sixth group.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted error includes statistical
            uncertainty plus errors on corrections and in
            detector efficiency.

           Yields are normalised to a sum of unity.
HALF-LIFE  The half-life fitted to each delayed group is
            given in the table.
COMMENT    No 6th group was observed because of the transfer time
            of 380 ms before counting commenced.
COVARIANCE There are strong correlations between the yields for
            the five measured groups.
