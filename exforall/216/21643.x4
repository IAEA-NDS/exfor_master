TITLE      -DELAYED NEUTRON YIELD AND DECAY CONSTANTS FOR THERMAL
            NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-235 -.

INC-SPECT  THERMAL MAXWELLIAN NEUTRON SPECTRUM
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES WERE METAL FOILS OF 7.5 MM DIAMETER, 35 MG
            IN WEIGHT, ENRICHED TO 95.54 PERCENT U-235.
METHOD     .SAMPLES TRANSFERRED PNEUMATICALLY TO AND FROM THE
            IRRADIATION POSITION WHERE A CONSTANT THERMAL FLUX
            WAS MAINTIANED. AFTER EACH IRRADIATION THE DELAYED
            NEUTRON EMISSION RATE WAS MEASURED IN A DETECTOR
            CONSISTING OF A WATER BATH CONTAINING BF3 CONTERS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) WATER BATH CONTAINING BF3 COUNTERS IN
            CYLINDRICAL ALUMINIUM TUBES OF O.D. 26 MM. ACTIVE
            LENGTH 310MM. FILLED WITH 96 PERCENT B-10.
            THE EFFICIENCY WAS CALIBRATED WITH A STANDARD AM/LI
            SOURCE FROM N.P.L. WHICH WAS ITSELF CALIBRATED TO
            0.5 PERCENT USING A MANGANESE SULPHATE BATH.
ANALYSIS   .MEASURED NEUTRON DECAY CURVE WAS FITTED TO THE SUM
            OF FIVE EXPONENTIAL DECAYING GROUPS BY A LEAST SQUARE
            METHOD. NO SIXTH GROUP WAS OBSERVED BECAUSE OF THE
            TRANSFER TIME OF 380 MS BEFORE COUNTING.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F)57-LA-140,CUM,FY,,MXW) THE NUMBER OF
            IN THE U-235 SOURCE WAS MONITORED BY MEASURING THE
            ACTIVITY OF LA-140 RELATIVE TO A CALIBRATION FOIL
            IN AN ABSOLUTE IONISATION CHAMBER. NO VALUE GIVEN.
