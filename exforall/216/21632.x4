TITLE      -NEUTRON-NEUTRON EFFECTIVE RANGE FROM A COMPARISON
            OF N-N AND N-P QUASI-FREE SCATTERING AT 24. MEV.-
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERBON) ISOCHRONOUS CYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) 27 MEV DEUTERON BEAM (3 MICRO-AMPERES)
            ONTO A LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED HIGH PRESSURE
            (25 BAR) DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET.
            NEUTRONS EMITTED IN FORWARD DIRECTION WERE
            COLLIMATED TO PRODUCE A BEAM WITH
            AN INTENSITY OF 5.6E+06 NEUTRONS/S
            ON THE TARGET.
SAMPLE     .C-D(2) TARGET, 50 MG/CM*CM THICK IN THE FIRST,
            22. MM LONG * 20. MM DIAM IN THE 2ND EXPERIMENT.
METHOD     (TOF) TO DETERMINE THE PROTON ENERGY (DISCRIMINATION
            AGAINST DEUTERONS AND OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES).
           (PHD  ) PULSE-HEIGHT DISCRIMINATION TO DO THIS
            REJECTION OF OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES ON THE
            BASIS OF THEIR TOF.
           (REC  ) PROTON RECOILS ARE MEASURED TO MONITOR
            THE INCOMING NEUTRON FLUX.
           (PSD  ) PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION IS USED TO
            DISTINGUISH NEUTRONS FROM GAMMA-RAYS.
DETECTOR   (TELES) PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE TO MONITOR THE
            INCOMING NEUTRON FLUX.
           (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) BREAK-UP NEUTRONS ARE DETECTED AT
            50 DEGREES WITH A WELL SHIELDED NE213 SCINTILLATOR
            IN COINCIDENCE WITH BREAK UP PROTONS EMITTED AT
            -34.1 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE BEAM. THESE
            PROTONS ARE DETECTED IN A NE104 PLASTIC
            SCINTILLATOR (1ST EXP. - N-P QUASI FREE SCATTERING)
            IN THE 2ND EXPERIMENT (N-N QUASI-FREE SCATTERING)
            THE NE104 IS REPLACED WITH A NE213 SCINTILLATOR.
           (SCIN ) THE PROTONS PASS THROUGH A SCINTILLATION
            FOIL OF 1.5 MG/CM*CM TO PRODUCE THE TOF START
            SIGNALS FOR THE PROTON ENERGY MEASUREMENT.
ANALYSIS   .IS DONE BY FITTING THE RESULTS OF MONTE CARLO
            CALCULATIONS OF THE PROCESS
            FOR DIFFERENT POSSIBLE VALUES OF THE SCATTERING
            LENGTH AND THE EFFECTIVE RANGE TO THE
            EXPERIMENTAL DATA.
