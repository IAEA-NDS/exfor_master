           (J,EN,26,11,542,79) SPECTRUM DESCRIPTION.
AUTHOR     (A.CESANA,G.SANDRELLI,V.SANGIUST,M.TERRANI)
TITLE      -ABSOLUTE TOTAL YIELDS OF DELAYED NEUTRONS IN THE
            FISSION OF U-233, NP-237, PU-238,240,241, AM-241 -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) L54 REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATIONS IN A B4C FILTERED FLUX AT THE
            EDGE OF L54 REACTOR CORE.
INC-SPECT  .FAST REACTOR NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
            DETAILS OF SPECTRUM IN EN,26,11,542,1979.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES WERE ENCAPSULATED IN STAINLESS STEEL OR
            ZIRCALOY VIALS.
METHOD     .SAMPLES TRANSFERED PNEUMATICALLY FROM IRRADIATION
            POSITION TO NEUTRON COUNTERS.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) NEUTRON LONG COUNTER. THE NEUTRON EFFICIENCY W
            WAS MEASURED BY COUNTING THE DELAYED NEUTRON EMISSION
            FROM U-235 FOR WHICH THE FISSION RATE IN THE
            IRRADIATION POSITION HAD BEEN ACCURATELY DETERMINED.
           (GELI) GE(LI) DETECTOR FOR MONITORING ACTIVITY OF
            FISSION PRODUCTS AS A MEASURE OF THE SAMPLE FISSION
            RATES.
ANALYSIS   .DELAYED NEUTRON CURVES WERE FITTED BY FIVE GROUPS
            WITH HALF-LIVES OF 55,22,6,2,0.5 SECS USING A LEAST
            SQUARES UNFOLDING TECHNIQUE. A CORRECTION WAS MADE
            FOR A SIXTH, UNOBSERVED, GROUP WITH HALF-LIFE 0.2 SEC

CORRECTION .DELAYED NEUTRON INTENSITIES AND FISSION PRODUCT
            YIELDS WERE CORRECTED FOR IMPURITIES. AS THE TRANSFER
            TIME TO COUNTING POSITION WAS 0.6 SECS, DELAYED
            NEUTRONS WITH HALF-LIVES LESS THAN 0.5 SEC WERE NOT
            OBSERVED. A CORRECTION FOR A SIXTH GROUP WITH A HALF-
            LIFE OF 0.2 SECS WAS MADE BY EMPIRICAL CORRELATION
            BETWWEN THE YIELDS AND VALUES OF Z AND A OF EACH
            FISSIONING NUCLEUS.
ERR-ANALYS .ERRORS ARE QUOTED AS ONE STANDARD DEVIATION, AND ARE
            A COMBINATION OF ERRORS ON NEUTRON INTENSITIES AND
            THOSE ON FISSION RATES IN SAMPLES.
