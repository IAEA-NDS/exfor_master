AUTHOR     (J.FREHAUT)
TITLE      -THE C-13(N,2N) CROSS SECTION -.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) VAN DER GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) DEUTERIUM BEAM ON DEUTERIUM TARGET.
SAMPLE     .NO DETAILS.
METHOD     (ASSOP) DETECTION OF EMITTED NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),,NU) SPONTANEOUS FISSION USED FOR
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION.
STATUS     (UNOBT) BECAUSE OF THE LARGE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED
            WITH THE NEUTRON EFFICIENCY CORRECTION, THE AUTHOR
            DOES NOT WISH TO ISSUE NUMERICAL DATA. THE GRAPH IN
            NEANDC(E)-194 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A
            QUALITATIVE ILLUSTRATION OF THE CROSS SECTION
            EXCITATION FUNCTION.

CORRECTION .NO CORRECTION WAS MADE IN DETECTOR EFFICIENCY FOR
            THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION SPECTR
            AND THE C-13(N,2N) NEUTRON EMISSION SPECTRUM. THERE
            IS CERTAINLY A LARGE DIFFERENCE BUT AS THE C-13
            NEUTRON SPECTRUM IS UNKNOWN AND THE CORRECTION COULD
            BE AS LARGE AS 50 PERCENT AND COULD DEPEND ON THE
            INCIDENT ENERGY THE MEASUREMENT IS NOT CONSIDERED
            AS QUANTITATIVELY RELIABLE.
