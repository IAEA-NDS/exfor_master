           (P,NEANDC(J)-56U,17,197809) preliminary report
            on Co-59.
AUTHOR     (T.Sekine,H.Baba)
TITLE      -Cross sections of the (n,2n) reaction of Co-59,
            Ni-58, Ge-70, Zr-90 and Tl-203 with fission
            neutrons.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) Swimming pool type reactor JRR-4.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) Thermal flux 4.0 x 10.**13 n/cm**2/sec.
INC-SPECT  .Fast neutron spectrum, slightly different
            from a fission neutron spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation, 2 or 6 hr.
DETECTOR   (COIN,GELI,NAICR) Ge(Li) detector equipped with
            a compton suppression system. The coaxial Ge(Li)
            had an efficiency of 15% and a resolution
            of 2.1 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.
            The Compton suppression system consists of an
            8 in diam.*8 in annular NaI(Tl) detector
            surrounding the Ge(Li) and a 2.5 in diam*2.5
            in NaI(Tl) detector on the top hole of the
            annular crystal, both in anticoincidence with the
            Ge(Li) detector.
PART-DET   (DG   ) Decay gammas.
CORRECTION .For losses under the gamma peak by coincidences
            with annihilation gammas.
           .For accidental coincidences.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).Contains photo peak efficiency uncertainty
            and statistical error.
