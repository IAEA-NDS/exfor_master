INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL FLUX 4.0E+13 N/CM**2/SEC.
INC-SPECT  .FAST NEUTRON SPECTRUM, SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
            FROM A FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION, 2 OR 6 HR.
DETECTOR   (COIN,GELI,NAICR) GE(LI) DETECTOR EQUIPPED WITH
            A COMPTON SUPPRESSION SYSTEM. THE COAXIAL GE(LI)
            HAD AN EFFICIENCY OF 15 PERCENT AND A RESOLUTION
            OF 2.1 KEV FWHM AT 1.33 MEV.
            THE COMPTON SUPPRESSION SYSTEM CONSISTS OF AN
            8 IN DIAM.*8 IN ANNULAR NAI(TL) DETECTOR
            SURROUNDING THE GE(LI) AND A 2.5 IN DIAM*2.5
            IN NAI(TL) DETECTOR ON THE TOP HOLE OF THE
            ANNULAR CRYSTAL, BOTH IN ANTICOINCIDENCE WITH THE
