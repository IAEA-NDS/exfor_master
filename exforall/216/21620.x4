TITLE      -ABSOLUTE FISSION CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENTS OF U-235
            AT 2.5 AND 4.45 MEV, AND AM-241 AT 14.6 MEV NEUTRON
            ENERGIES. (IN FRENCH)-
FACILITY   (VDG) 4 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) PROTON-TRITIUM FOR 2.5 MEV NEUTRONS AND
           (D-D  ) DEUTON-DEUTERIUM FOR 4.45 MEV NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .URANIUM OXID (U3O8), THICKNESS 103.2 MICROGRAM
            PER CM2, ENRICHED TO 97.663 PERCENT IN U-235,
            SPUTTERED ONTO A 0.3 MM THICK TANTALUM BACKING.
            THE NUMBER OF U-235 ATOMS WAS DETERMINED BY LOW
            GEOMETRY ALPHA-COUNTING.
           .A POLYETHYLENE RADIATOR WAS USED FOR THE MONITOR
            REACTION.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) ONE FISSION CHAMBER AND
           (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) ONE COUNTER TELESCOPE TOGETHER
            IN A HYBRID DETECTOR WITH THE FISSION FOIL AND
            A POLYETHYLENE FOIL MOUNTED BACK-TO-BACK. THE
            POLYETHYLENE FOIL IS USED FOR NEUTRON FLUX DETER-
            MINATION.
           (LONGC) A DIRECTIONAL LONG COUNTER IS ALSO USED FOR
            NEUTRON FLUX MONITORING AT 2.5 MEV.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) NO VALUES GIVEN.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS

CORRECTION .THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT,
            -FISSION DETECTOR,
              EXTRAPOLATION TO ZERO SPECTRUM AMPLITUDE,
              LOSS OF FISSION EVENTS,
              FISSION EVENTS DUE TO OTHER ISOTOPES,
              FISSION EVENTS DUE TO SCATTERED NEUTRONS,
              FISISON EVENTS WITHOUT NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET.
            -TELESCOPE,
              EVENTS WITHOUT POLYETHYLENE RADIATOR,
              EVENTS WITHOUT NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET,
              NEUTRON ATTENUATION IN BACKING MATERIALS.
            -LONG COUNTER (ONLY AT 2.5 MEV),
              BACKGROUND WITHOUT NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET,
              BACKGROUND FROM SHADOW-BAR,
              NEUTRON ATTENUATION IN AIR AND IN THE HYBRID
               DETECTOR.
