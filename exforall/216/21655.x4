AUTHOR     (T.Sekine,H.Baba)
TITLE       The isomeric cross section ratio in double neutron
            capture of Nb-93
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) JRR-3 (thermal reactor).
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  .Thermal Maxwellian from JRR-3.
SAMPLE     .30 milli-grams Nb(2)-O(5), chemically processed
            to remove Ta-183 from the sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation, irradiation of 216 hours.
DETECTOR   (GELI) coaxial Ge(Li) detector with the detection
           efficiency of 8% at 1332 keV relative
           to the 3. x 3. inch NaI(Tl) detector
ANALYSIS    Area of gamma peaks.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG,,MXW) A cobalt-aluminum
            alloy wire, containing 0.425% cobalt is used as flux
            monitor.
PART-DET   (DG) Decay gammas.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Compared with results of other authors in
            table 3 of JIN,40,1973 and INDC(JPN)-153,210
            Isomeric cross section ratio compared with the
            theory of Vandenbosch and Huizenga in table 4
            of INDC(JPN)-153,210.
CORRECTION  Gamma ray self shielding of the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors quoted were estimated by taking
           into consideration:
           (ERR-1,1.,1.5) the uncertainty in the counting
           efficiency (-+ 1.5% for the 236-keV gamma-ray or
           -+ 1.0% for the others) and
             * the standard deviation of the peak area.
           However, the errors contained in the reported values of
           the branching ratio of the gamma-ray were not included.
HISTORY    (19800930C) A.H.
           (19840106U) A.P.T. Japan code changed to JPN
           (20161001A) SD:Updated to new date formats,lower case.
           Refs corrected. Ref. JIN,40,1973 was mentioned as the
           first ref. DATA-ERR -> ERR-T.
