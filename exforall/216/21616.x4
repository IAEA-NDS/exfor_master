AUTHOR     (R.B.GALLOWAY,A.WAHEED)
TITLE      -POLARIZATION OF 16 MEV NEUTRONS DUE TO ELASTIC
            SCATTERING.-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE PULSED VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR IBIS.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-T) 16.1 MEV NEUTRONS PRODUCED WITH THE T(D,N)-
            REACTION USING A TRITIUM GAS TARGET 1 CM LONG AND
            FILLED TO A PRESSURE OF 1 ATM.
           .POLARIZED NEUTRONS OBTAINED FROM THE ABOVE
            MENTIONED REACTION AT 75 DEGREES TO THE 2.8 MEV
            DEUTRON BEAM.
SAMPLE     .SCATTERING SAMPLE OF CU AND PB OF ABOUT 5 CM
            DIAMETER BY 10 CM HIGH AT A DISTANCE OF 166 CM FROM
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
           (PSD  ) PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAMMA-
            RAYS WAS APPLIED TO THE DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) SIX NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATORS, 5 CM IN
            DIAMETER BY 15 CM HIGH AND VIEWED BY FAST PHOTO-
            MULTIPLIERS.
           (SCIN ) ONE NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATOR, 12.7 CM
            DIAMETER BY 3.8 CM THICK TO MONITOR THE NEUTRON
            BEAM.
           .ONE LII(EU) CRYSTAL SURROUNDED BY 10 CM OF
            PARAFFIN  ALSO TO MONITOR THE NEUTRON YIELD FROM
            THE TARGET.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,POL)  POLARIZATION OF THE
            NEUTRON PRODUCING REACTION.
COMMENT    .THE MEASURED DATA ARE COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS OF
            THE OPTICAL MODEL CALCULATION MADE USING THE COMPUTER
            PROGRAM RAROMP.
