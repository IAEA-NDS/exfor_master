TITLE       Polarization of 16 MeV neutrons due to elastic
            scattering
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK EDG) The pulsed Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-T) 16.1 MeV neutrons produced with the T(d,n)-
            reaction using a tritium gas target 1 cm long and
            filled to a pressure of 1 atm.
           .Polarized neutrons obtained from the above
            mentioned reaction at 75 degrees to the 2.8 MeV
            deuteron beam.
SAMPLE     .Scattering sample of Cu and Pb of about 5 cm diam. by
            10 cm high at a distance of 166 cm from the neutron
            source.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight techniques.
           (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination against gamma-rays
                 was applied to the detectors.
           (LRASY)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Six NE213 liquid scintillators, 5 cm in diam.
            by 15 cm high and viewed by fast photomultipliers.
           (SCIN) One NE213 liquid scintillator, 12.7 cm diam.
            by 3.8 cm thick to monitor the neutron beam.
           .One 6LiI(Eu) crystal surrounded by 10 cm of paraffin
            also to monitor the neutron yield from the target.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,POL)  Polarization of the
            neutron producing reaction.
ANALYSIS   .The polarization of elastically scattered neutrons
            were calculated assuming that the inelastic compo-
            nent have zero asymmetry.
COMMENT    .The measured data are compared with the results of
            the optical model calculation made using the computer
            program RAROMP.
CORRECTION .For-
            - differences in detector efficiencies or scatterer-
             to-detector distances,
            - time correlated background,
            - finite-geometry and multiple scattering effects by
              a Monte-Carlo program.
