TITLE      -THE U-238/U-235 FISSION CROSS SECTION RATIO OVER THE
            ENERGY RANGE 1.2 TO 2 MEV -.
FACILITY   (SYNCY) HARWELL SYNCHROCYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) PULSED NEUTRON BEAM FROM SYNCHROCYCLOTRON
            TARGET, 140 MEV PROTONS, 4 MICRO-A, 800HZ, 10 NS PULSE
            WIDTH. NEUTRONS TAKEN AT 180 DEGREES TO PROTON BEAM.
            NO MODERATOR.
SAMPLE     .ENRICHED FOILS OF U-238 AND U-235, DEPOSITED TO A
            THICKNESS OF 0.5 MG CM-2 ON THIN AL BACKINGS OVER AN
            AREA OF 7.6 CM DIAMETER.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT, 25 METER FLIGHT PATH, EVACUATED
            OVER A DISTANCE OF 14 METERS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) GAS SCINTILLATION FISSION FRAGMENT DETECTOR,
            THROUGH WHICH ARGON FLOWED CONTINOUSLY. THE FISSILE
            FOILS WERE PLACES BACK TO BACK IN THE CENTRE OF
            THE CHAMBER WHICH WAS OPTICALLY DIVIDED IN THE
            PLANE OF THE FOILS, EACH HALF VIEWED THROUGH QUARTZ
            WINDOWS BY TWO EMI 9816QKB PHOTOMULTIPLIERS.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS.
STATUS     (UNOBT) GRAPH ONLY.

CORRECTION .NO CORRECTION WAS MADE FOR THE U-235 CONTENT OF THE
            U-238 FOIL (0.036 PERCENT) OR FOR THE U-238 CONTENT
            OF THE U-235 FOIL (6.06 PERCENT). IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
            TO MEASURE DIRECTLY THE BACKGROUNDS, HOWEVER AN
            ENERGY DEPENDENT BACKGROUND GIVING A ZERO CROSS
            SECTION FOR U-238 AT 0.2 AND 0.4 MEV WAS SUBTRACTED.

COMMENT    .THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO ESTABLISH AN ACCURATE
            ENERGY FOR THE U-238 FISSION CROSS SECTION THRESHOLD.
            THIS WAS DONE BY CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE ENERGY
            SCALE OF THE TIME OF FLIGHT SYSTEM, SEE AERE-7919.
            THE MONITORED CARBON RESONANCE ENERGY WAS 2074+-3KEV.
STATUS     (UNOBT) BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH
            BACKGROUND THE DATA ARE CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHORS
            TO BE UNRELIABLE IN MAGNITUDE, AND WERE ONLY USED
            AS A VERIFICATION OF THE DATA OF BEHRENS AND THE
            REVISED DATA OF COATES.
