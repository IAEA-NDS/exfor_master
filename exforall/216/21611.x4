TITLE       The U-238(gamma,alpha) and U-238(n,alpha+n) reactions
            - have they really been observed?
FACILITY   (NGEN,2UK HAR) Intense neutron generator,
                          A.W.R.E. Aldermaston.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Low energy deuterium beam on rotating
            tritium target. The irradiation was performed over
           two days with a total output from the accelerator of
           2.65 x 10**16 neutrons
SAMPLE      U-238 foil sandwiched between two nickel foils
            as neutron flux monitors. The complete package
            was covered with cadmium to eliminate thermal
            neutron capture. The sample package was 35 mm
            from the d-t neutron source.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) 80 cm*3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58-G,,SIG) Value measured in
            associated experiment, reported in AERE-R-9390.
