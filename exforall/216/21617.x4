AUTHOR     (Amena Begum,R.B.Galloway)
TITLE       Polarization of 14 MeV neutrons in forward angle
            scattering by Cu and Pb
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK EDG) Van de Graaff accelerator providing a
            350 keV deuteron beam.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The T(d,n)He-4 reaction using a water cooled
            T-Ti target.
SAMPLE     .Two natural Cu and two natural Pb samples, the first
            scattering sample was 25 mm in diameter by 46 mm
            high and the second scattering sample 50 mm in diam.
            by 150 mm high, the second placed 92 cm from the
            first.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight techniques.
           .As the T(d,n)He-4 reaction gives unpolarized neutrons
            the experiment was done as a double scattering expe-
            riment, where the first sample scattered the neutrons
            20 degrees and the second sample scattered the neu-
            trons 20 or 34 degrees.
           (DSCAT) scattering to 20 deg
           (LRASY) scattering to 20 or 34 deg
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Four NE213 liquid scintillators, efficiency
            calibrated with a Co-60 source and with an energy
            discrimination level of 10 MeV to reduce the in-
            fluence of inelastically scattered neutrons.
           (SCIN) Three plastic scintillators to monitor the
            neutron flux, one to measure the alpha particles
            in the neutron producing reaction, one to monitor
            the singly scattered collimated neutron beam, and
            one below the neutron producing target served to
            monitor the neutron yield directly from the target.
ADD-RES     .The measured data were compared with polarization
            values obtained from optical model calculations,
            using the computer program RAROMP.
CORRECTION .For-
            - instrumental asymmetry due to differences in detec-
             tor efficiencies,
            - background,
            - multiple scattering, using a Monte-Carlo program.
FLAG       (1.) value arbitrarily taken to be positive
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
