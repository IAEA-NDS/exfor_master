TITLE      -EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF SPIN DEPENDENT NUCLEAR
            SCATTERING LENGTHS OF SLOW NEUTRONS.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR SAC) CHANNEL H2 OF EL3 PILE OF CENS.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) POLARIZED NEUTRON SOURCE. MONOCHROMATIC
            AND POLARIZED NEUTRON BEAM OBTAINED BY BRAGG
            REFLECTION ON A FE-CO CRYSTAL USING A (2,0,0)
            REFLECTION. THE POLARIZATION IS 0.995 +- 0.004.
            THE FLUX IS 1.0E+06 N/CM**2/SEC. A FLIPPING
            MAGNET IS USED WITH AN EFFICIENCY OF 99.1 +-
            0.7 PERCENT.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF THE CHANGE OF PRECESSION OF THE
            NEUTRONS DUE TO THE (NEUTRON SPIN)-(NUCLEUS SPIN)
            -INTERACTION WHICH GIVES RISE TO A PSEUDO-MAGNETIC
            FIELD.
