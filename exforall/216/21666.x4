TITLE       Determination of the capture width of the 27.7 keV
            S-wave neutron resonance in iron-56
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3 MV pulsed Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The accelerator voltage was adjusted to pro-
            duce Li-7(p,n) neutrons only with energies between
            10 and 60 keV, all of them emitted into a cone with
            60 degrees opening angle.
SAMPLE     .Three metallic, uncanned disc samples of Fe-56 (99.93%
            pure in Fe-56) were used. The thicknesses were
            0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mm.
           .The reference sample was a gold disc, 0.25 mm thick.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight techniques were used to
            distinguish between neutrons and captured photons.
            The primary flight path was 7.6 to 8 cm long and
            about half as long as the distance between the
            sample and the detector.
DETECTOR   (MOXR) A Moxon-Rae detector. The detector response
            to a pure scatterer was checked with a graphite
            sample.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The least-squares shape fit analysis code FANAC
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G+M,,SIG) ENDF/B-IV
                       gold cross section used for normalization.
PART-DET   (G) Gamma rays.
CORRECTION .For,
            - electronic drift,
            - multiple scattering and self-shielding,
            - photon self-absorption in the sample,
            - deviations from the ideal linear relationship
              between Moxon-Rae detector efficiency and excitation
              energy.
