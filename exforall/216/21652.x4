TITLE      -A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THE THERMAL NEUTRON
            INDUCED TERNARY FISSION OF U-235.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) HIGH FLUX REACTOR, INCLINED
            BEAM HOLE IH1, THERMAL FLUX 5.E+09 N/CM**2/S.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  THERMAL MAXWELLIAN FROM REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .1 CM**2 CIRCULAR U TARGET, 150 MICRO-GRAMS/CM**2
            U-F(4), 97 PERC ENRICHED IN U-235, EVAPORATED
            ONTO A 20 MICRO-GRAMS/CM**2 GOLD-COATED
            50 MICRO-GRAMS/CM**2 VYNS BACKING. MUCH THINNER
            TARGETS (7-8 MICRO-GRAMS/CM**2) WERE USED TO
            CALIBRATE THE DETECTORS IN ENERGY.
METHOD     (TOF  ) BETWEEN THE DETECTION OF THE TERNARY
            ALPHA PARTICLE AND THE DETECTION OF THE
            ASSOCIATED FISSION FRAGMENT, TO DETERMINE THE
            MASS OF THE FISSION FRAGMENT.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A RECTANGULAR 1CM * 3CM SI(AU) SURFACE
            BARRIER DETECTOR FOR THE DETECTION OF THE LRA.
            ITS DEPLETED LAYER WAS ADJUSTED AROUND 500 MICRONS.
           (SOLST) 7 SI(AU) SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS FROM
            ORTEC AT 50 CM FROM THE TARGET AT DIFFERENT ANGLES
            (68,73,78,83,88,93, AND 98 DEGREES WITH RESPECT
            TO THE ALPHA PARTICLE). THEY ARE COVERED WITH
            2 CM DIAM TA COLLIMATORS TO PREVENT EDGE EFFECTS.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS,
           (A    ) AND LONG RANGE ALPHA PARTICLES.
