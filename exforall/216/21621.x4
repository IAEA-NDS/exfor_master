TITLE      -ABSOLUTE FISSION CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENTS OF U-235
            AT 2.5 AND 4.45 MEV, AND AM-241 AT 14.6 MEV NEUTRON
            ENERGIES. (IN FRENCH) -
FACILITY   (VDG) 550 KEV VAN DE GRAAFF .
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION. THE NUMBER OF
            NEUTRONS WAS DETERMINED BY ASSOCIATED ALPHA PAR-
            TICLE COUNTING.
SAMPLE     .AM-241 -ACETATE, 12.32 MICRO-GRAMS/CM2 ON
            VYNS FOIL OF 20 MICRO-GRAMS/CM2, ELECTROSPAYED.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT BETWEEN ALPHA PARTICLES FROM
            NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET AND FISSION FRAGMENT DETEC-
            TOR, COMBINED WITH
           (COINC) FAST COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOMULTI-
            PLIERS ON THE FISSION FRAGMENT DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) GASEOUS SCINTILLATOR FILLED WITH XENON GAS IN
            TWO OPTICALLY INDEPENDANT HALFS, EACH VIEWED BY A
            PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE.
           (SOLST) ONE SOLID-STATE DETECTOR FOR DETECTING ALPHA
            PARTICLES FROM THE NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET.
