TITLE      --VERIFICATION OF TRITIUM ACTIVATION MEASUREMENTS BY
            LI-6(N,A+T) CROSS-SECTION DETERMINATION-.
FACILITY   (REAC ) THE GLEEP REACTOR AT HARWELL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM THE GLEEP REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  .MAXWELLIAN AVERAGE THERMAL NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .DIFFERENT LI-6/LI-7 ISOTOPIC RATIOS, MANUFACTURED BY
            DISSOLVING THE ORIGINAL LIOH MATERIAL AND DRYING AT
            120 DEGREES TO GIVE HOMOGENEOUS MATERIAL.
METHOD     .THE CADMIUM RATIO METHOD.
DETECTOR   .NO INFORMATION GIVEN.
COMMENT    .THIS MEASUREMENT WERE CARRIED OUT AS A CHECK ON THE
            TRITIUM COUNTING SYSTEM, WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO
            MEASURE THE LI-7(N,N+T) REACTION (SEE EXFOR ENTRY
            20986).
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM NEANDC(E)-212.

           (821124A) REACTION STRING IN SUBWORK 2 CORRECTED.
           (830111E)
CORRECTION .THE TWO HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF LI-6 REQUIRED
            CORRECTIONS FOR SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS OF 17 AND
            23 PERCENT.
           .THE EFFECT OF SELF-SHIELDING ON THE LOWEST CONCENTRA-
            TION WAS NEGLIGIBLE.
ERR-ANALYS .THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ERROR ARE,
            - TRITIUM COUNTING (2.2 PERCENT),
            - REACTOR FLUX (2 PERCENT),
            - THE LI-6/LI-7 RATIO FOR THE LOWEST CONCENTRATION
              PELLET (5 PERCENT),
            - AND FOR THE TWO HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS THE
              CORRECTION FOR SELF-SHIELDING (3 PERCENT).
