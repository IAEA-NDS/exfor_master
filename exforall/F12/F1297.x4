FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-400 accelerator
INC-SOURCE The beam currents were 10-20 nA.
SAMPLE     180-270 mu-g/cm2 layers of lead evaporated onto
           carbon backings (50 mu-g/cm2 thickness).
DETECTOR   (SPEC,MCPLT) CORSET double-arm spectrometer consisted
           of Start and Stop microchannel plate detectors. Start
           detectors were installed at a distance of 4 cm from
           the target. The size of each MCP-detector in the stop
           assembly was 6*4 cm2. The distance between the target
           and Stop detectors was 15.5 cm. The solid angle of
           the spectrometer was 360 msr. Two semiconductor
           detectors placed at angles -+11 deg. in the
           horizontal plane were used as monitors for the
           cross-section normalization.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF,MASSP)
ADD-RES    (A-DIS)Distributions of binary fragments were obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainties is given.
