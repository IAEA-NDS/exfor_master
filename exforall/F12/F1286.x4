FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSTPI) Pulsed plasma Hall accelerator was
           used.
METHOD     (BCINT,GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma rays with the energy Eg=(1484+ -11)keV
           were recorded by eight NaI(Tl)-based detectors
            (10*10*40 cm) placed around the target. Total weight
           of all detectors was 117 kg.

REACTION   (1-H-2(A,G)3-LI-6,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Titanium deuteride was used as a target. It was
           deposited on the stainless-steel backing by magnetron
           sputtering. Titanium deuteride layer was 1.5-2 mu-m
           thick. The target diameter was 98 mm and the thickness
           was 0.1 mm.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)Additional NaI(Tl) detector was used (150 mm
           diam., 100 mm thickness).
INC-SOURCE There were 5*10**14 He-4 ions per pulse. Total number
           of He-4 ions was 1.187*10**19.

SAMPLE     Zirconium deuteride was used as a target.
DETECTOR   (TELES,HE3SP) 10 tubes with 3 cm diameter and 50 cm
           length were used as the counters. They were filled in
           3He+Ar+CO2 mixture at 4 atm pressure.
INC-SOURCE Total number of He-4 ions was 1.211*10**19.
