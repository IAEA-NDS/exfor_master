FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-200 cyclotron was used.
INC-SOURCE Irradiation time was 1 h. Beam current was 15 mu-A.
REL-REF    (R,,B.Syngh,J,NDS,114,1,2013)
SAMPLE      A thick target (14.5 mg/cm2 thickness) containing
           125 mg of Sr(nat)O was used. Target was prepared
           by dissolution of Sr(NO3)2 in ethanol. High purity
           aluminium was used as the target holder.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-ray spectrometry with HPGe detector was
           used.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,GSPEC)
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by authors.
HISTORY    (20141010C)
           (20190722U) SD: Small correction in SAMPLE.
