FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSTPI) Pulsed plasma Hall accelerator was
           used.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Eight 10*10*40 cm3 NaI(Tl) detectors with
           total weigh about 117 kg. Detectors recorded
           gamma-rays with the energy Eg=(1485.5+ -4.5) keV.
           Additional detector (diam. 150 mm, thickness 100 mm)
           was also used at the end of aluminum target chamber.
SAMPLE     Zirconium deuteride ZrD2. Aluminum target chamber was
           used.
INC-SOURCE During the experiment 1.211*10**19 ions of He-4
           impinged on the target. The energy spread of the
           He-4+ beam was 19.9%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from the text, p.24.
