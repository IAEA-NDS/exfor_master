ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error of the absolute cross section
           determination consisted of the errors of deuteron
           beam current measurements, facility geometry
           determination and measuring apparatus uncertainty.
           (EN-ERR) Energy error was due to uncertainty of
           initial deuteron beam energy. Error value varied:
            (+ -0.3) MeV for E=8 MeV; (+ -0.5) MeV for E=4 MeV.
