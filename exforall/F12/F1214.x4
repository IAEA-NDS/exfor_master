           translation)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFEI) 1.5-m cyclotron was used.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 100-channel scintillation detector with
           NaI(Tl) crystal was used.
SAMPLE     Metallic disks with diameter of 10 mm were used as
           targets.
METHOD     (EDEG)
           (BCINT)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error of yield and cross section
           determination.
