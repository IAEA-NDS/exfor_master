SAMPLE     The target was prepared by depositing of PuO(2) onto
           Ti foil (0.71-0.72 mg/cm2 thickness).
INC-SOURCE The maximum intensity was 1.3 particle mu-A.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWPC) For nucleus separation Dubna Gas-Filled
           Recoil Separator was used. Recoil nucleus passed
           through time-of-flight system consisted of multiwire
           proportional counters. The distance between them was
           65 mm.
           (SI) For registration of alpha-particles of residual
           nucleus focal-plane detector was used. The system
           included a 0.3-mm-thick double-sided silicon detector
            (DSSD) which has 1-mm-wide strips, 48 on the front
           side and 128 on the back side. The recoil implantation
           counter was surrounded by six single Si detectors, each
           500 microns thick and having an active area of 65 mm by
           by 120 mm.
