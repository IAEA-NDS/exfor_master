FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSTPI) Pulsed plasma Hall accelerator was
           used.
SAMPLE     The layer of the TiD was deposited on a stainless-
           steel backing by magnetron sputtering. The thickness
           of the TiD layer was 1.5-2 mu-m. The target diameter
           was 97 mm.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma rays with the energy 5.5 MeV from
           reaction were measured by eight NaI(Tl)-based
           detectors (100*100*400mm) placed around the target.
           The energy resolution measured with the Co-60 source
           and averaged over all eight detectors was 4.3% for
           the 2.5 MeV total absorption peak line.
METHOD     (BCINT)
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by authors.

COMMENT    *By author* S-factor is determined as a function
           of average value of proton-deuteron collision energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties of the obtained values
           of S-factor were calculated as a superposition of the
           uncertainties of measurement of gamma quanta yield,
           the number and energy dependence of the incident
           protons, the distribution of depth concentration of
           deuterons in the target and the uncertainties of the
           calculation of the registration efficiency of gamma
           quanta and the specific ionization losses of proton
           energy in TiD in the range of ultralow energy
           collisions.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Proton-deuteron collision energy averaged in
           accordance with the distribution function of
           probability of the pd-reaction.
