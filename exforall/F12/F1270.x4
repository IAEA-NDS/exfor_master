INC-SOURCE Beam intensity was in the range 2-3 pnA.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,PS,MCPLT) Time-of-flight double-arm spectrometer
           consists of start and stop four position sensitive
           detectors based on microchannel plates. The start
           detectors were placed at a distance of 4 cm from the
           target. The distance between start and stop detectors
           was 14 cm.
