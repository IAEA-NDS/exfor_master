REL-REF    (R,,,B,FIRESTONE,,1998) Decay-data are given.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB) Nuclotron of the Laboratory of High
           Energy Physics.
SAMPLE     The target was a stack of gold foils with the size
           2*2 cm2. There were 15 foils with the thickness of
           39.13 mg/cm2 each.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Energy resolution of detector was 2 keV (Co-60
           at 1332 keV).
INC-SOURCE The irradiation time was 28.6 hours. The total beam
           intensity was (6.43+ -0.71)*10**12 deuterons.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,STTA)
ADD-RES    (COMP) DEIMOS32 code was used for gamma-spectra
           evaluation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error of cross section measurement
           depended on statistical errors of experimental result,
           the accuracy of determination of target thickness,
           the accuracy of tabulated constants data, detector
           efficiency error.
           (ERR-S,,3.) Errors of experimental result
           (ERR-1,,3.) Error consists of accuracy of target
           thickness measurement and accuracy of tabulated data
           (ERR-2,,10.)Error of detector efficiency measurement
