SAMPLE     Stacks of Mylar, aluminium, tantalum foils of high
           purity were used. Diameter of target discs was 5 mm.

DETECTOR   (GELI) The resolution of two detectors (28 cm3 and
           45 cm3) was 2.8 keV and 2.3 keV at 1332.9 keV,
           respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)
           (STTA)
INC-SOURCE Irradiation period was equal to 10**13 total flux
           particles.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The spectra were analyzed by computer program.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Counting statistics, detector efficiencies,
           target thickness.
           (ERR-1,,10.) Systematic uncertainty resulting from
           the beam flux monitor was not included into tabulated
           values.
