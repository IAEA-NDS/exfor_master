COMMENT    The excitation function is presented as a mean of two
           run of measurements.
SAMPLE     The stack of 32 Cu foils with 15.5 mg/cm2 thickness of
           each foil was used.
METHOD     (STTA)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation gamma spectrometer
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR-DIG) Energy digitizing error
           (ERR-DIG)    Data digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR)   The accuracy of excitation function was
           defined taking into account the errors of beam current
           measurement and the errors of Zn-65 standard.
STATUS     (CURVE) Figure from the reference, page 184.
