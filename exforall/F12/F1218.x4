SAMPLE     There were three runs of measurements with different
           targets. At the first stage 2.54 cm thick graphite
           block was used. At the second stage 0.16 cm thin
           polystyrene target was used. At the third stage
           nuclear emulsion was used as a target. Resulting cross
           section is a sum of three runs.
DETECTOR   (BAF2)
           (NAICR) The C-11 activity produced an the first and
           second stages was measured by NaI(Tl) large-diameter
           detector (15*15 cm) and BaF2 detector
            (3.2*3.2*15.0 cm3).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are only of statistical nature.
           They are almost entirely from counting statistics of
           the C-11 activity measurements in thick graphite
           blocks and beam particles counting.
