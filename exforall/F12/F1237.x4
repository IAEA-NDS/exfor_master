SAMPLE     Metallic uranium installed in stainless steel hermetic
           container was used.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Boron counter (radiator with B-10 enriched to
           95%) filled by gas He-4 (97%) and Ar (3%).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time was 15 sec and 180 sec.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves of delayed neutrons were analyzed.
           Average half-life of delayed neutron precursors was
            (7.13+ -0.12)sec.
