SAMPLE     (92-U-239,ENR=0.9999) The target, placed in the
           center of a scattering chamber (diameter 100 cm),
           was evaporation of U(238)F(4) (100 mu-g/cm2) on
           carbon backings (28-50 mu-g/cm2).
DETECTOR   (SI) Four silicon detectors monitored continuously the
           beam intensity and position. The detected Ni-64 ions
           elastically scattered on the target. The detectors were
           placed above and below, and to the left and right of
           the beam at scattering angles 13-16 degrees.
           (SPEC,PS) Binary reaction products were detected by
           the two-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET. Each
           arm of spectrometer consisted of a compact start
           detector and a position-sensitive 9*7 cm stop
           detector, both based on microchannel plates. The
           angular acceptance for both arms was (+ -12.5) degr.
           in-plane and (+ -10) degr. out-of-plane. The arms of
           the spectrometer were positioned at angles 60 degr. and
           -60 degr. to the beam axis.
METHOD     (TOF)
ANALYSIS   Events excluding scattering events on the MASS-TKE plot
           are counted.
ADD-RES    (A-DIS)Distributions of binary fragments were obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)     The accuracy of the beam energy
           (EN-ERR-DIG) Energy digitizing error
           (ERR-DIG)    Data digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR)   No source of uncertainties for the graphic
           bars is given.
CORRECTION Small corrections to the measured cross sections were
           made according to observed variations of the relative
           yields in the monitors, changes of beam focusing
           and position.
