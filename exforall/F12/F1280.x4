FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 tandem
INC-SOURCE Intensity of Si-28 beam was 15-20 pnA.
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.999) A target 5 mm in diameter and
           200 mg/cm2 in thickness from lead enriched in the
           isotope 208Pb was evaporated onto a carbon-foil
           backing of 30 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Solid state track detectors were used.
           (SI) Two detectors oriented at angles of 20 degr.
           with respect to the beam axis were used to monitor
           Rutherford scattering and to provide a normalization
           of the fusion cross section. Additional two detectors
           arranged at angles of 170 degr. ensured the
           monitoring of fission fragments.
