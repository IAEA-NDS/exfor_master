REACTION   (2-HE-3(D,G)3-LI-5,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   The absolute cross section for production of the
           high-energy capture gamma radiation at Ed=0.45 MeV has
           been computed from the observed yield of gamma-rays
           in two ways:
            (1) The first method was based on a comparison with
           the yield of gamma-rays from the 7Li(p,gamma) reaction.
            The 3He(d,gamma) radiation was assumed to be
           isotropic, in accordance with our rough measurements.
            On this basis, the total cross section for production
           of high energy He3(d,gamma) capture radiation at the
           peak of the excitation curve is calculated to
           be (0.057+-0.010) mb.
            (2) As a check on the first method, a calculation was
           also made of the absolute sensitivity of the NaI
           crystal for 16.6-MeV gamma-rays. This calculation was
           based on the gamma-ray cross sections contained in
           ref. (see REL-REF, C.M.Davisson+). A Calculation was
           made of the absolute sensitivity of the NaI crystal for
           16.6 MeV gamma rays (=0.037 +-0.010 mb)
