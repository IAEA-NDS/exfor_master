TITLE      Measurements of the proton-induced reaction

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3KORKRM) MC50 cyclotron
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC)
SAMPLE     A high-purity (>99.99 %) molybdenum foil (100-um thick)
            with a natural isotopic composition.
           Monitor foils of Cu (100-um thick) and Al (100-um -
            1.2-mm thick) with  known cross-sections were also
            included in the stack.
           These three types of foils were stacked together as
            Al-Cu-Mo, and 5 groups were set together in an Al
            holder for the irradiation.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties were derived from
           (ERR-S,1.,13.) statistical error, mainly depended on
            the gamma peak areas due to the different beam
            energies in the sample             (1-13%),
           (ERR-1,2.,4.)  monitor flux          (2-4%),
           (ERR-2,2.,4.)  beam flux energy      (2-4%),
           (ERR-3,0.5,2.) detector efficiency (0.5-2%),
           (ERR-4,1.,2.)  gamma-ray intensity   (1-2%).
COMMENT    M.U.Khandaker, 2009-07-10:
            The results from another measurement (EXFOR D0446)
            are recommended.

COMMENT    M.U.Khandaker (2019-11-29):
            It is uncertain if the precursor contribution was
            subtracted.
