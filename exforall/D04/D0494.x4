TITLE      Evaluation of an internal cyclotron target for the
           production of 211At via the 209Bi(alpha,2n)211At
           Reaction

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USADKE) CS-30 cyclotron
SAMPLE     The target face consists of ? curved depression of
           approx. 10.2 x 2.1 cm, the surface of which was
           coated with bismuth. Target backing plates
           fabricated of aluminum and copper were evaluated.
           Aluminum-backed targets were prepared by heating the
           aluminum on a hot plate and adding bismuth metal
           powder (99.9% purity). After melting, the bismuth
           was distributed as evenly as possible with a
           porcelain spatula.
           The copper-backed bismuth targets were prepared by
           electro-deposition of bismuth using a SIFCO SPL-30
           electroplating apparatus
DETECTOR   (GELI) a Ge(Li) detector by determining the counting
           rates for the three most abundant gamma-rays emitted
           in the decay of 211At and its daughter, 211Po.
