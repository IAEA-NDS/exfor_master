SAMPLE     The Pd/TiTx/Al sample was prepared by a conventional
           hydrogenation method, using however an apparatus
           which enables tritium gas to be handled. A uniform
           Ti film of 2.44x10**17 atoms/cm2 was first sputtered
           onto a 3mm Al foil, and then a Pd overlayer of
           4.4x10**16 atoms/cm2 was deposited onto the Ti film.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The Au/Si surface barrier detector was
           placed at the laboratory backward angle of 165.
           degr., set by a defining slit of 3x4 mm.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainty associated with the
           determination of absolute tritium concentration
           (ERR-2) The measuring error of the areal density
                   is less than 4%.
           (ANG-ERR) Uncertainties in the scattering angle
           (ERR-T) The total error associated with the measured
           cross section is less than 7.5% icluding ERR-1, ERR-2,
           statistical errors and background subtraction
           uncertainties in the determination of T and Pd peak
           areas which are typically +-2-3%, and in all cases
           less than +-4%.
