FACILITY   (CYCLO) The separated sector cyclotron of iThemba LABS.
SAMPLE     The NaCl(> 99%, Merck) target discs had thicknesses of
           nominally 870, 540 and 425 mg/cm2, respectively, in
           the 200, 100 and 66 MeV stacks. The individual NaCl
           discs were separated by relatively thin monitor foils
            (99.9%, Goodfellow, U.K.): 65 mg/cm2 Al in the 200
           and 100 MeV stacks and 44 mg/cm2 Cu in the 66 MeV
           stack.

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,STTA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) An accurately calibrated HPGe detector with a
           relative efficiency of 13% and a resolution of 1.8
           keV at 1.33 MeV, connected to a Silena EMCAPLUS
           multi-channel analyser, was used for all activity
           measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties of the measured
           activity values were obtained by summing all the
           contributing uncertainties in quadrature and are
           expressed with a sigma(68%) confidence level. The
           statistical uncertainties were insignificant
           compared to the systematic uncertainty, except near
           threshold, the latter of which was estimated to be
           about 7%:
           (ERR-1) beam current integration(3%),
           (ERR-2) detector e ciency (5%),
           (ERR-3) counting geometry (1%),
           (ERR-4) decay corrections (2%) and
           (ERR-5) target thickness (3%).
