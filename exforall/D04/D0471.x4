SAMPLE     TiN targets with a thickness of about 280 mu-g/cm2
           were used. These TiN were prepared by evaporation on
           high-purity Cu foils with a thickness of about 20
           lm. The produced 26Al nuclei were implanted into the
           Cu foil.The Cu foils were tightly attached to a beam
           dump which was used as Faraday cup. Watercooling was
           used to decrease the target temperature, so that the
           targets could withstand 16O beam (16O4+ or 16O3+)
           intensities of 3 mu-A.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (AMS)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties of the cross section
           values are quadratic summation of uncertainties in:
             *  26Al/27Al ratio,
           (ERR-1) target thickness (~8%),
           (ERR-2) carrier weight (~4%)
           (ERR-3) 16O beam charge (2%).
