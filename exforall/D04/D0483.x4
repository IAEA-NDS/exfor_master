FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP)secondary beam facility of the HI-13
           tandem accelerator, Beijing.
SAMPLE      (C2H2)n target in thickness of 1.5 mg/cm2 to study
           the 2H(13N,14O)n reaction.A carbon target in
           thickness of 1.5 mg/cm2 served as the background
           measurement.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A 300 mu-m thick multi-ring semiconductor
           detector (MRSD) with a center hole was used as a
           residue energy Er detector which composed a d-E-Er
           counter  telescope together with a 21.6mu-m thick
           silicon d-E detector and a 300 mu-m thick silicon
           center Er detector.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE (D-C12) An 84 MeV 12C primary beam from the tandem
           pressure of impinged on a 4.8 cm long deuterium gas
           cell at a 1.6 atm. The front and rear windows of the
           gas cell are Havar foils, each 1.9 mg/cm2 thick. The
           13N ions were produced via the 2H(12C,13N)n
           reaction. After the magnetic separation and focus
           with a dipole and a quadruple doublet, the secondary
           beam was further purified with a wien filter. The 69
           MeV 13N secondary beam was then delivered with
           typical purity of 92%.The accumulated quantity of
           incident 13N is approximately 3.54 x 10**8 for the
            (C2H2)n target measurement, and 1.18 x 10**8 for
           background measurement with the carbon target.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)The uncertainties in the differential
           cross section mainly arise from the statistics, the
           assignment of 14O kinematics regions, and the
           uncertainties of the target thickness and the solid
           angle.
           (ANG-ERR) The angular uncertainties include the
           random reaction point in the target, the angular
           uncertainty of the secondary beam, the angular
           straggling of 13N and 14O in the target, and the dE
           detector. The total angular error for each ring is
           about 0.6., less than the width of each ring.
