SAMPLE     The bismuth targets were made from highly Specpure
           bismuth metal of thickness 3.56 mg/cm2 deposited
           onto an aluminium backing of thickness 6.75 mg/cm2
           by vacuum evaporation technique. Bismuth foil was
           cut into pieces of 1.5 x 1.5 cm and each glued to an
           aluminium frame, having a circular hole of diameter
           1.2 cm in its center. Energy-degrading aluminium
           foils of different thickness were sandwiched between
           the bismuth foils whenever required, 50 as to get
           the desired alpha-particle energy incident on each
           foil.
DETECTOR   (GELI) High 100 cm3 Ortec Ge(Li) detector (FWHM 2keV
           at 1.33 MeV) coupled with a pre-calibrated 4096
           channel Camberra 88 analyser.
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,ACTIV) Faday cup. Two independent
           measurements have a large overlapping energy region
           which enabled to check the consistency of the
           measurements.
MONITOR    The activation cross-section for the same reaction has
           been calculated from the intensities of the various
           identified gamma-rays emitted from the same residual
           nucleus. The reported value has been taken as the
           weighted average of these individual values.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy loss in the actual thickness of foils.
           (ERR-S) The statistical error shown in the results
           is the larger of the internal and external errors.
           These errors are found to be less than 10%.
