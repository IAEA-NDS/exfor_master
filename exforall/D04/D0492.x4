SAMPLE     The bismuth targets were made from highly Specpure
           bismuth metal of thickness 3.56 mg/cm2 deposited
           onto an aluminium backing of thickness 6.75 mg/cm2
           by vacuum evaporation technique. Bismuth foil was
           cut into pieces of 1.5 x 1.5 cm and each glued to an
           aluminium frame, having a circular hole of diameter
           1.2 cm in its center. Energy-degrading aluminium
           foils of different thickness were sandwiched between
           the bismuth foils whenever required, 50 as to get
           the desired alpha-particle energy incident on each
           foil.
DETECTOR   (GELI) High 100 cm3 Ortec Ge(Li) detector (FWHM 2keV
           at 1.33 MeV) coupled with a pre-calibrated 4096
           channel Camberra 88 analyser.
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,ACTIV) Faday cup. Two independent
           measurements have a large overlapping energy region
           which enabled to check the consistency of the
           measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy loss in the actual thickness of foils.
           (ERR-S) The activation cross-section for the same
           reaction has been calculated from the intensities of
           the various identified gamma-rays emitted from the
           same residual nucleus. The reported value has been
           taken as the weighted average of these individual
           values. The statistical error shown in the results
           is the larger of the internal and external errors.
           These errors are found to be less than 10%.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Decay-data were measured in the same experiment
