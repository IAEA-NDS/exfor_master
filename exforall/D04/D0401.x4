SAMPLE     The target used was natSn, which was prepared by
           rolling. The stack  was formed by positioning the
           aluminum foils immediately after the Sn  target foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Al foils were used as energy degraders and
           also as catcher  foils. Al-catcher foil thickness was
           chosen to stop all the recoiling evaporation  residues.
           In the stack, there were five target-catcher
           combinations each consisting of nat.Sn target of
           thickness 2.2 mg/cm2 and Al-foil of
           thickness 2.1 mg/cm2.
FACILITY   (VDGT) UB beam of energy 52 MeV from NuD BARC-TIFR
           Pelletron accelerator
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 60cm3 HPGe detector(FWHM approx.2keV at 1.33MeV)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in measured cross-sections
           arise mainly due to the statistical errors, errors in
           the estimation of the number of target nuclei in the
           sample, the beam current, detector efficiency/solid
           angle, nuclear data such as branching ratio and decay
           constant.
