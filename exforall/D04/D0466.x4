TITLE      28Si + alpha as an Example of Novel Methods for
           Elastic Scattering Experiments

FACILITY   (VDGT,2SF ABA)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Seven detectors were used. An eight h detector
           was used to monitor the total charge, since the
           thickness of the target prevented from monitoring the
           current in a Faraday cup.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           Thick target backscattering technique.
ANALYSIS   (INTED)
SAMPLE     Natural Si plate with a thickness of 300 mu-m.
COMMENT    At the moment data gathered with this method is being
           analyzed for the reactions 28Si + alpha, 30Si + alpha,
           36Ar + alpha and 40Ar + alpha.
