FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP) The Scanditronix MC-40 cyclotron of
           the Joint Research Centre (Ispra,  Italy).
SAMPLE     The targets were prepared by cutting a 1 cm x 1 cm
           piece of high purity (99,99%) bismuth foil supplied by
           Goodfellow, with a thickness of 0.25 mm, which
           corresponds to a thick target. The target was enveloped
           in  aluminum foil (14 mu-m thickness) to avoid loss of
           activity by recoil or evaporation, due to the fact
           that astatine is very volatile.

           (29-CU-0(A,X)30-ZN-65,,SIG) Measuring the activity of
           these products and using the recommended cross
           section values of IAEA  it is possible to calculate
           the current of the beam and then using it to determine
           the thick target yields of 211At and 210At.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,SI) A HPGe gamma spectrometer was utilized to
           detect 211At, 211Po and  210At, while a Si (ion
           implanted) alpha detector was used for the detection
           of 211At,  211Po and 210Po.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The absolute uncertainty on the yield
           measurement is estimated to 9%  for all the yields
