FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The radioactive nuclear beam facility
           of the HI-13 tandem accelerator, China Institute of
           Atomic Energy, Beijing 102413
INC-SOURCE A 44-MeV 7Li primary beam from the tandem
           accelerator impinged on a 4.8-cm- long deuterium gas
           cell at the pressure of 1.55 atm, and the 8Li
           secondary beam was produced via 2H(7Li,8Li)1H reaction.
           The energy of the 8Li secondary beam was 39.8 MeV, w
           ith the intensity of 3000 pps and purity of 78%~86%.
SAMPLE     A 1.93-mg/cm2-thick (CH2)n foil and a
           1.9-mg/cm2-thick carbon foil were used to measure
           the 8Li(p,d)7Li reaction in inverse kinematics and
           to evaluate the background, respectively.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SISD) A set of dE-E telescope
           consisting of a 63-mu-m-thick double sided silicon
           strip detector (DSSSD) and a 982-mu-m-thick quadrant
           silicon detector(MSQ). Both the detectors have 50mm
           x 50mm active area. The DSSSD is divided into 16 strips
           with 3mm width  on the front face by 0.1mm gaps and 16
            similar orthogonal strips on the back face, making up
           256 pixels of 3mm x 3mm each, to provide quasi-pixel
           two dimensional position information.
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors of differential cross section are
           mainly from the statistics, and the uncertainties of
           beam normalization and areal density of hydrogen
           atoms in the (CH2)n target (ERR-S,ERR-1,ERR-2).
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors
           (ERR-1) The uncertainties of beam normalization
           (ERR-2) The uncertainties of areal density of
                   hydrogen atoms in the (CH2)n target
