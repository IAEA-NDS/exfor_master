TITLE      Comparison of 3He-, 4He-, and 12C-Induced Nuclear
           Reactions in Heavy-Mass Targets at Medium Excitation
           Energies. II. Reaction Model Calculations

SAMPLE     The target stacks were constructed with the targets
           and interspersed aluminum degrader foils.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The Ge(Li) detector used in this study had a
           resolution of 2.7 keV full width at half maximum
            (FWHM) at 1332 keV and a peak-to-Compton ratio of 14
           to 1 at 1332 keV.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) The stacked-foil technique was
           employed during the course of this investigation.
           The beam current was monitored by measuring the
           charge corrected on the target holder, which acts as
           a Faraday cup.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors come from a variety of sources:
            * the integration of gamma-ray peaks,
            * detector efficiency measurements,
            * attenuation factors,
            * branching ratios of the gamma-rays of interest,
            * charge integration,
            * chemical yields,
            * recoi1 losses, etc.
           The absolute errors in the cross sections are difficult
           to determine because of possible errors in the decay
           schemes of the isotopes produced in the bombardments.
           Assuming an error in the branching ratios, the
           errors in the cross sections are approximately 20%.

SAMPLE     The bismuth metal of 99.8% elemental purity was
           placed in a graphite boat and inserted into the
           electron gun assembly. The vacuum depositions were
           conducted unti1 a layer of 100 to 1000 mu-g of the
           bismuth metal, monoisotopic in nature, had been
           deposited onto a 0.002-cm-thick aluminum backing
           foil of 99.9999% purity.
ANALYSIS   The yield of the bismuth was confirmed by direct
           current polarography.

SAMPLE     The bismuth metal of 99.8% elemental purity was
           placed in a graphite boat and inserted into the
           electron gun assembly. The vacuum depositions were
           conducted unti1 a layer of 100 to 1000 mu-g of the
           bismuth metal, monoisotopic in nature, had been
           deposited onto a 0.002-cm-thick aluminum backing
           foil of 99.9999% purity.
ANALYSIS   The yield of the bismuth was confirmed by direct
           current polarography.

SAMPLE     The rhenium metal had been enriched to an isotopic
           abundance of 92.8% in 187Re. The enriched rhenium
           metal was dissolved in a small amount of
           reagent-grade concentrated nitric acid. Finally rhenium
           metal was electrodeposited onto a 0.002-cm aluminum
           backing foil which had been previously weighed.
           Typically 2 mg of the 187Re had been deposited over
           an area of 3.1 cm2.
ANALYSIS   The gold and the rhenium yields were determined by
           neutron-activation analysis months after the
           cyclotron irradiations.

SAMPLE     The rhenium metal had been enriched to an isotopic
           abundance of 92.8% in 187Re. The enriched rhenium
           metal was dissolved in a small amount of
           reagent-grade concentrated nitric acid. Finally rhenium
           metal was electrodeposited onto a 0.002-cm aluminum
           backing foil which had been previously weighed.
           Typically 2 mg of the 187Re had been deposited over
           an area of 3.1 cm2.
ANALYSIS   The gold and the rhenium yields were determined by
           neutron-activation analysis months after the
           cyclotron irradiations.

           neutron-activation ana1ysis months after the
           cyclotron irradiations.
