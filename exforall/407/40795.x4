REACTION   (26-FE-0(N,ABS),,SIG,,MXW)
INC-SPECT   Thermal spectrum
METHOD     (PLSED)    Pulse die-away
            Slowing down time in an iron prism.
ANALYSIS   Capture cross section was determined from measured
           neutron lifetime in iron 21.30+-0.30 microsec and
           the density of the iron prism.
CORRECTION  For impurities in the iron,
            for effect of the measuring channel.
