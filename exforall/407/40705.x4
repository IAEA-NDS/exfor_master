ANALYSIS    Neutron spectrum analysis on the basis of the statis-
            tical theory of nuclear reactions and Hauser-Feshbach
            formalism.
HISTORY    (19840411C) Compiled at the CJD
           (19861211A) Secondary neutron spectrum data are trans-
                     ferred into  ENTRY 40851
           (20110812A) M.M. COREL was added.
           Reference J,YK,1977,(5/19),34,1977 was deleted as wrong
           coded - right ref. is given in REL-REF as free text.
CORRECTION  Corrections were made on multiple scattering and
            neutron flux attenuation by Monte Carlo method.

           neutrons from the measured neutron emission spectrum.
