INC-SPECT   Reactor spectrum
ANALYSIS     Boron capture cross-section (710. b) was used for
           normalization.
           Additional standards are graphite (capture cross
           section 3.4+-0.5 mb) and heavy water ( absorption cross
           section 1.5+-1.0 mb).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative error was determined by formula (3)
           on page 16.
