TITLE      Measurements of the average number of neutrons emitted
           in the fission of some uranium and plutonium isotopes.
COMMENT    This article contains three parts:
           Part I. Page 123.
           Relative measurements of the average number of
           neutrons emitted in the thermal fission of U233, U235,
           Pu239, and Pu241.

           at 55GENEVA it was reported by M.S.Kozodaev at
