           with a mean energy of 24 keV by transmission in a
           spherical geometry

INC-SOURCE   Sb-Be neutron source of 30 mm diameter, Be thickness
            2-4 mm, intensity ~10**8 n/sec.
           Mean neutron energy 24 keV.
SAMPLE      Spherical layers
METHOD     (SHELT) Spherical shell transmission.
            Independent measurements by
           1) long counter and
           2) fission chambers in water tank.
            To search resonance blocking of fast neutrons,
            the samples deluted by Pb-Bi alloy ( volume content
            in sample ~ 70 %) and samples of different thickness
            were used.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) System of long counters was used for neutrons
           detection.
           (FISCH) Water tank with little fission chambers
           containing U-235 layer was used for neutrons detection.
ANALYSIS    Monte-Carlo method to calculate transmissions.
            Table 2 contains resulting data obtained from
            measurements by long counter and water tank with
            fission chambers.
MONITOR     Absolute measurements
CORRECTION  . For
            non-monoenergetic neutrons;
            neutron source dimensions and absorption in the
            neutron source;
            attenuation of neutrons in the water tank;
            absorption in Pb-Bi alloy;
            fission of U-235 admixture in natural U-238.
            Total correction was in a range 5 - 25 %.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error.

COMMENT    Of authors. Data of Table 2 in 66PARIS,I,455(96),1966

           Of compiler.
           Data for U-238 were revised in A.A.Van'kov+,
           R,YK-9,44,1972, and are given in 40072.019 -
           misprint in U-235 admixture was corrected and resonance
           structure was taken into account.
