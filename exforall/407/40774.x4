TITLE      Measurement of the effective cross section for the
           Li6(n,alpha) reaction for 2.5-MeV neutrons.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSLEB)   Cascade generator
EXP-YEAR   (1953)
INC-SOURCE (D-D)  Heavy ice target were bombarded by D2+ ions of
           370 keV energy.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)    Ionization chamber filled with Ar with
           0.03-0.1 % oxygen and 0.2-0.3 % nitrogen.
            19-channel pulse-height analyzer.
            Cd sheets of 0.5 mm thickness to protect from thermal
           neutrons.

REACTION   (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)
SAMPLE      Li6F layers of 0.12-0.32 mg/cm2 thickness (+-5%) were
           deposited by vacuum evaporation on Au foil of
           0.2 mg/cm2 thickness . The sample shape - square of
           6.5 x 6.5 cm with rounded corners.
ANALYSIS    Mean value of 12 measurements.
CORRECTION For the gaps between analyzer channels,
           for particle absorption in the layer,
           for backgrounds of neutrons from d-d reaction.
           Degradation of the beam by the front wall and the
           electrodes of the chamber ( 1-7 %) are compensated by
           neutron scattering in the sample, hence the correction
           for scattering was not introduced.
