INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal column
INC-SPECT   Effective energy of the filtered neutrons in Be (26 cm
            of metallic beryllium powder) 0.0047 eV was
            determined in special absorption measurements.
            Number of neutrons with E > 0.0093 eV was < 0.5%.
SAMPLE     .Gaseous samples with various ortho- and para-deuterium
            composition:
            - 66.7% ortho- and 33.3 % pare-deuterium,
            - 97.79 of ortho- and 2.21 % para-deuterium,
             in inner tube of 200 cm long, 5 cm diameter;
            contents were measured with accuracy up to 0.1 %.
            The gas contained 99.2+-0.05 % of deuterium.
           . Liquid hydrogen in space between inner and outer
           tubes.
METHOD     (TRN) 19 independent series:
           - nine with gas containing 2/3 ortho- and 1/3
           para-deuterium, mean cross-section 16.00+-0.03 b;
           - ten with gas containing 97.7 % ortho- and 2.21 %
           para-deuterium, mean cross-section 16.41+-0.02b.
           Errors are determined by statistical errors and by
           errors in pressure measurement.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) BF3-filled proportional counter, enriched in
            B-10 - for scattered neutrons counting.
           . Primary intensity of the beam was controlled by two
           monitor counters.
MONITOR     No information
ADD-RES      Scattering cross-section were measured by
           transmission method (neutron energy 0.0047 eV) to be
           - for deuterium :
            SIGortho = 15.95+-0.03 b (even rotational quantum
           number I, even spin),
            SIGpara = 14.63+-0.1 b (add rotational quantum
           number I, odd spin);
           - for hydrogen :
            SIGortho = 104.1+-0.7 b (even rotational quantum
           number I, even spin),
            SIGpara = 3.91+-0.1 b (add rotational quantum
           number I, odd spin)
