TITLE      Determination of the neutron-neutron scattering length

METHOD     (ASSOP) For absolute yield of neutrons.
DETECTOR   (TELES)  Consists of three Cs-I(Tl) crystals of 80 mu,
           100 mu, 1.8 mm thickness.
ANALYSIS    Channel width for energy analysis was 90 keV.
CORRECTION Background was measured without sample - 5-10 % of
           the total effect.
           Background due to recoil protons in neutron scattering
           from residual hydrogen in the sample was subtracted.
           Number of random coincidences was negligible.
