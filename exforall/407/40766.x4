            Er(2)O(3) enriched in Er-162:
           Er-162 - 25.8 % , Er-164 - 8.1  % , Er-166 - 33.1% ,
           Er-167 - 14.7 % , Er-168 - 12.8 % , Er-170 - 5.5 % ;
              in 10**20 at/cm2 -

           Er-167 - 6.99,  Er-168 - 6.09, Er-170 - 2.62.
           Er-162 sample admixtures ( % of Er-162 content):
           Yb < 0.05%, Ho < 0.05%, Dy - 1%, Eu - 0.1%,
           Gd < or = 0.1% ( Gd-154 < 7E-4 %, Gd-155 <0.5E-2 %,
           Gd-156 <0.7E-2 %, Gd-157 <0.5E-2 %, Gd-158 < 1.7E-2 %,
           Gd-160 < 6.6E-2 %).
CORRECTION Admixtures of Gd ( according to passport data for
           Er-162 sample) decrease Er-162 c-s from 315 to 200 b,
           so accuracy of Er-162 c-s definition depends also from
           reliability of this analysis.
COMMENT    Of authors.
            Measured Er-162 total c-s is essentially higher than
           Er-162 activation c-s ( HL=75min) = 2.03+-0.20 from
           I.V.Gordeev+, Yaderno-fizicheskie konstanty,
           Gosatomizdat, 1963.
           Authors assume existence of other (isomeric) activities
           of Er-163.
