TITLE      Measurements of the average number of neutrons emitted
           in the fission of some uranium and plutonium isotopes.
COMMENT    This article contains three parts:
           Part I. Page 123.
           Relative measurements of the average number of
           neutrons emitted in the thermal fission of U233, U235,
           Pu239, and Pu241.

           Part II. Page 127.
           Dependence of the number of neutrons emitted
           in the fission of heavy nuclei on the excitation
           energy of the fissionable nucleus.

           Part III. Page 131.
           Absolute evaluation of the average number of
           neutrons emitted in the fission of some isotopes of
           uranium and plutonium.

            This article was presented at 55MOSCOW ( candidates to
           55GENEVA were discussed),
           and as mentioned in R,UCRL-50400,v.2,rev.2,1976,
           at 55GENEVA it was reported by M.S.Kozodaev at
           discussion of P/592 - see 55GENEVA,vol.2,

COMMENT    Of authors. In coincidence method the delayed neutrons
           were naturally excluded from the count.
