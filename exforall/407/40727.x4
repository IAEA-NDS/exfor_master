           Measurement of wave-length of neutrons - 0.962 Angstrom
INC-SPECT   The previously measured wave-length of neutrons
           0.962 Angstrom.
SAMPLE      Gallium arsenid of 99.99 % purity as powder in
           cylindrical Al capsule of 0.1 mm wall thickness.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) End-window counter, 80% efficiency.
            The incident beam produced 1.5E+5 counts/min.
MONITOR     Metallic nickel
CORRECTION  For absorption correction - values M*R were measured
            by transmission for Ni and GaAs to be 0.310 and 0.144,
            respectively ; M - is linear absorption coefficient,
            R- radius of cylindrical sample.
            Temperature correction .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
            article.
