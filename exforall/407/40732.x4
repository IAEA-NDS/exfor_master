ANALYSIS   Spectra were transformed from lab.system in C.M.S.,
           relation between angles is given in Table 1. Finally,
           angles in C.M.S was taken as angles values in
           lab.system, uncertainty due to this transformation was
           introduced in data error.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) relative error includes (see fromula on p.6
           of FEI-923 for calculation):
           - Statistical uncertainty of time spectra measurement,
           - Uncertainty of time-of-flight (+-1 channel,
           TAU=1.034 nsec) = TAU/t,
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty due to channel width definition,
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty due to differential no-linearity,
           average for energy range,
           (ERR-3,,1.) Uncertainty due to time-of-flight
           determination,
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty of detection efficiency,
           (ERR-5) Uncertainty of monitoring,
           (ERR-6) Uncertainty due to correction for attenuation
           and multiple scattering,
           (ERR-7,,0.3) Uncertainty due to transformation in
           C.M.S.
