TITLE      Photoneutron cross sections for He4.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD) Positron annihilation in flight.
           Photon energy resolution is typical for livermore
            facility experiments.
SAMPLE     The 5.55-mole helium gas sample was contained at a
            pressure of 30.61 mpa (about 300 atm).
DETECTOR   (BF3) An efficient paraffin-and-BF3-tube neutron 4pi
            detector.
METHOD     (EXTB)
ANALYSIS   After the recorded neutron events were corrected for
            pileup in the detector, the neutron backgrounds
            (annihilation target removed) were substracted for
            both the positron and electron measurements.
           Because the energy spectrum of the annihilation-plus-
            Bremsstrahlung radiation differs from that of purely
            Bremsstrahlung photons, a measured correction was
            applied to the ion-chamber (beam monitor) response to
            normalize the electron data to the positron data.
           The normalized electron data then were substracted from
            the positron data, leaving the neutron counts which
            result only from the annihilation radiation.
           The measured sample-blank data, normalized to equal
            photon flux, were substracted from the target data to
            give the net target results.
           After a small correction for the neutron multiplicity
            in each ring, the data were corrected for the energy-
            dependent efficiency of the neutron detector using the
            ring-ratio result for each energy.
           The data were converted to photoneutron cross sections
            by applying the measured ion-chamber response per
            photon, the known number of target nuclei in the beam
            and a small correction for the photon attenuation in
            the sample.
           A multiplicity analysis of the number of neutrons
            recordered in each beam burst allows the (gamma,n) and
            (gamma,2n) yields to be extracted simultaneously and
            independently.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) Statistical errors only.
           (DATA-ERR2) There are several possible sources of
            systematic errors:
            - uncertainty in the photon flux calibration: no
              greater than 5% at 22 MeV, but rises to about 10%
              at 45 MeV.
            - uncertainty in the neutron-detector efficiency
              >3% for neutrons of 2 MeV (E(gamma) about 23 MeV),
              rising to about 5% for E(n) = 14 MeV, and, perhaps,
              to 8% for E(n) = 18 MeV (E(gamma) about 45 MeV).
            - uncertaintiy arising from the Bremsstrahlung yield
              substraction: never more than 2% of the yield, WHIC
              translates into about 10% of the cross section at
              35 MeV.
            - uncertainty arising from the sample-blank yield:
              could be as much as 15% above 42 MeV.
           The data points at 25.3, 26.3 MeV, and, perhaps, at
            28.3 MeV, have systematic uncertainties as large as
            15%.
COMMENT    Results agree with earlier monoenergetic-photon and
            certain photoneutron time-of-flight (liquid-sample)
            results at the lower energies, and consequently
            disagree with the results of other experiments at
            these energies. At the higher energies, however, the
            present results are essentially in agreement with all
            previous results.
