TITLE      Photoneutron cross sections for 16O.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD) Positron annihilation in flight.
           Energy resolution (FWHM) ranged from about 200 keV at
            E(gamma) = 17 MeV to around 400 keV at 33 MeV.
SAMPLE     97.3-g SiO2 sample in a thin-walled Lucite container.
           Measurements also performed with 51.3 g of metallic
            silicon in a nearly identical container and with an
            empty container.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Neutron 4pi detector, consisting of a 61-cm cube
            of paraffin containing 48 BF3 tubes arranged in four
            concentric rings of 12 tubes each.
METHOD     (EXTB,RINGR) Direct photoneutron detection.
           Ring-ratio neutron multiplicity measurement.
ANALYSIS   The oxygen yield was determined by substracting the
            yield of the silicon metal sample from that of the
            silicon dioxide sample after sample mass correction.
           After the recorded neutron events were corrected for
            pileup in the detector, the neutron backgrounds
            (annihilation target removed) were substracted for
            both the positron and electron measurements.
           Because the energy spectrum of the annihilation-plus-
            Bremsstrahlung radiation differs from that of purely
            Bremsstrahlung photons, a measured correction was
            applied to the ion-chamber (beam monitor) response to
            normalize the electron data to the positron data.
           The normalized electron data then were substracted from
            the positron data, leaving the neutron counts which
            result only from the annihilation radiation.
           The measured sample-blank data, normalized to equal
            photon flux, were substracted from the target data to
            give the net target results.
           After a small correction for the neutron multiplicity
            in each ring, the data were corrected for the energy-
            dependent efficiency of the neutron detector using the
            ring-ratio result for each energy.
           The data were converted to photoneutron cross sections
            by applying the measured ion-chamber response per
            photon, the known number of target nuclei in the beam,
            and a small correction for the photon attenuation in
            the sample.
           A multiplicity analysis of the number of neutrons
            recordered in each beam burst allows the (gamma,n) and
            (gamma,2n) yields to be extracted simultaneously and
            independently.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors only.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           - pileup of counts in the detector,
           - ion-chamber response to electron and positron,
             produced radiation,
           - neutron multiplicities in each ring,
           - photon attenuation in the sample,
           - silicon and silicon dioxide sample masses.
COMMENT    Present cross section results agree with the mean of
            several previous measurements with monoenergetic
            photons, and resolve a prior discrepancy at 22.1-MeV
            peak.
           The measured average photoneutron energy is quite large
            in the photon energy region from 26 to 28 MeV,
            signifying that ground-state transitions dominate the
            (gamma,n) cross section in this region.
