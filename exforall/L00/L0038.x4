TITLE      C12(g,n)C11 giant resonance with gamma rays
AUTHOR     (W.A.Lochstet, W.E.Stephens)
INSTITUTE  (1USAPEN)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,141,1002,196601)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAPEN) For proton energies above 2.5 MeV
           (VDG,1USACOL) For lower energies
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(1-H-3(P,G)2-HE-4))
            Resolution (FWHM) of the gamma-ray energy distribution
             calculated from the Doppler angle and the target
             thickness and varies from about 100 keV at 22 MeV to
             about 250 keV at 26 MeV.
SAMPLE     The disk samples were made of A.G.O.T. reactor grade
            graphite of 99.93% purity.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Direct measurement of positron activity
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 5 inch by 2 inch NaI crystals measured
            annihilation radiation from positrons emitted from
            11C.
PART-DET   (AR) Positron annihilation radiation
COMMENT    The peak cross section is 7.8 mb at both 22.15 and
            23.0 MeV, and additional structure is observed at
            25.6 MeV.
HISTORY    (19891206C)
           (20090323A) Deleted by V.Varlamov because duplication
            with M0241.
