AUTHOR     (W.A.LOCHSTET,W.E.STEPHENS)
TITLE      C12(gamma,n)C11 giant resonance with gamma rays.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAPEN) For proton energies above 2.5 MeV.
           (VDG,1USACOL) For lower energies.
INC-SOURCE (MPH=1-H-3(P,G)2-HE-4) Resolution (FWHM) of the gamma-
            ray energy distribution calculated from the Doppler
            angle and the target thickness and varies from about
            100 keV at 22 MeV to about 250 keV at 26 MeV.
SAMPLE     The disk samples were made of agot reactor grade
            graphite of 99.93% purity.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Direct measurement of positron activity.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 5 inch by 2 inch NaI crystals measured
            annihilation radiation from positrons emitted from
            11C.
PART-DET   (AR) Positron annihilation radiation.
COMMENT    The peak cross section is 7.8 mb at both 22.15 and
            23.0 MeV, and additional structure is observed at
            25.6 MeV.
HISTORY    (19891206C)
           (20090323A) Deleted by V.Varlamov because duplication
             with M0241.
