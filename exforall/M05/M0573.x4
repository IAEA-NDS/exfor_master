TITLE      The absolute forward photodisintegration cross section
            of the deuteron at low excitation energies.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) 90 MeV electron linac the Gent State
            University.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (MAGFR) Magnetic spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two large area Si surface barrier detectors:
             for 10 MeV - 300 mu-m thick, 2000 mm2 area
             for 15.MeV - 2000 mu-m thick, 1250 mm2 area
SAMPLE     As a target a 94.2 % deuterated polyethylene foil was
            used with a total thickness of 9.76 mg/cm**2.
ANALYSIS   The experimental data were analyzed using Monte Carlo
            simulation of the entire reaction process, taking
            into account the energy loss and the multiple
            scattering of the protons in the target, the angular
            distribution of the emitted particles, and the energy
            dependence of the cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
COMMENT    The 2H(gamma,p)n cross section was measured absolutely
            at 0 degree for the outgoing proton, for photon
            energies between 8 and 18 MeV. The rising trend
            observed in the cross section in this energy region
            indicates the existence of the theoretically predicted
            minimum. The results obtained at Egamma about 10 MeV
            are well described by recent relativistic
            calculations, the data around 15 MeV, on the contrary,
            are commonly underestimated.
HISTORY    (19990316C) data were compiled at the USA BNL NNDC by
            V.V.Varlamov.
