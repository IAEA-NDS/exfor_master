TITLE      THE ABSOLUTE FORWARD PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION
            OF THE DEUTERON AT LOW EXCITATION ENERGIES.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) 90 MEV ELECTRON LINAC THE GENT STATE
            UNIVERSITY.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (MAGFR) MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (SILI) LARGE AREA SI-DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     AS A TARGET A 94.2 % DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE FOIL WAS
            USED WITH A TOTAL THICKNESS OF 9.76 MG/CM**2.
ANALYSIS   THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MONTE CARLO
            SIMULATION OF THE ENTIRE REACTION PROCESS, TAKING
            INTO ACCOUNT THE ENERGY LOSS AND THE MULTIPLE
            SCATTERING OF THE PROTONS IN THE TARGET, THE ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION OF THE EMITTED PARTICLES, AND THE ENERGY
            DEPENDENCE OF THE CROSS SECTION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS.
COMMENT    THE 2H(G,P)N CROSS SECTION WAS MEASURED ABSOLUTELY AT
            0 DEGREE FOR THE OUTGOING PROTON, FOR PHOTON ENERGIES
            BETWEEN 8 AND 18 MEV. THE RISING TREND OBSERVED IN
            THE CROSS SECTION IN THIS ENERGY REGION INDICATES THE
            EXISTENCE OF THE THEORETICALLY PREDICTED MINIMUM. THE
            RESULTS OBTAINED AT EG ABOUT 10 MEV ARE WELL
            DESCRIBED BY RECENT RELATIVISTIC CALCULATIONS, THE
            DATA AROUND 15 MEV, ON THE CONTRARY, ARE COMMONLY
            UNDERESTIMATED.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 2.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
