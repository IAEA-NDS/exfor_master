TITLE      INTERFERENCE BETWEEN RAYLEIGH, DELBRUCK, AND
            NUCLEAR RESONANCE SCATTERING PROCESSES.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERMNZ)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(26-FE-0(N,G)))
SAMPLE     RING TARGETS OF NATURAL PB (6 CM OUTER DIAMETER
            AND 4.56 G/CM**2 THICK) AND BI (6 CM OUTER
            DIAMETER AND 4.51 G/CM**2 THICK).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT SCATTERED PHOTON DETECTION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO INFORMATION ABOUT SOURCES OF
            UNCERTAINTIES.
COMMENT    THE FORWARD SCATTERING CROSS SECTION AT THETA
            ABOUT 1.O AND 1.7 DEGREE OF E = 4 - 10 MEV
            MONOENERGETIC PHOTONS FROM PB AND BI TARGETS HAS
            BEEN MEASURED. THE PHOTON BEAM WAS OBTAINED FROM
            FE(N,G) REACTION. THE ELASTIC CROSS SECTION AT
            SUCH ANGLES, BEING DOMINATED BY RAYLEIGH AND
            DELBRUCK SCATTERING PROCESSES, WAS MEASURED
            RELATIVE TO THE COMPTON CROSS SECTION. THE FACT
            THAT ONE OF THE G-LINES OF FE(N,G) REACTION
            HAPPENS TO OVERLAP THE 7.28 MEV LEVEL IN 208PB,
            YIELDING A STRONG NUCLEAR RESONANCE FLUORESCENCE
            SIGNAL, ENABLED TO OBSERVE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
            AN INTERFERENCE EFFECT WITH THE SCATTERING
            AMPLITUDE FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE OF THE RANDOM
            PHOTOEXCITATION PROCESS IS DERIVED. THE
            INTERFERENCE EFFECT OF THIS LATTER PROCESS WITH
            RAYLEIGH AND DELBRUCK SCATTERING WAS CALCULATED
            AND AN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH MEASURED VALUES
            WAS OBTAINED.
FLAG       (1.) THE SUM OF LINES WITH ENERGIES EG = 7.631 AND
            7.645 MEV.
