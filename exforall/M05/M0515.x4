DETECTOR   (TRD) Photofission fragments were detected by fission
            track registration technique in MAKROFOL KG (8 micron)
           (HE3SP) Neutrons from (g,f) and (g,n) reactions were
            detected simultaneously with fission fragments by 4pi
            long-counter consisting of 60 He-3 detectors
            conventionally distributed inside a moderator
            material (polyethylene).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT)
SAMPLE     The Pu-239 samples contained 51.4 mg deposited in the
            form of PuO-2 on four titanium disks each with an
            active diameter of 40 mm was used:

ANALYSIS   The direct measurements of number of fission fragments
            using the scanning of the MAKROFOL sheets by means of
            conventional optical microscopy.
           The direct measurements of photoneutrons from a total
            neutron production reaction (g,n-tot) and
            photofission reaction (g,f) - sig (g,n-tot) = sig
            (g,n) +  nu * sig (g,f), where nu(e) is the value of
            the prompt neutron multiplicity (the average number
            of prompt neutrons per fission).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total errors.
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in the photopeak
            efficiency determination - 10%.
           (ERR-2) Systematic error in the calibration for
            fission counting - 3%.
           (ERR-3) Systematic error in the calibration of neutron
            counting - 3.6%.
           (ERR-4) Systematic error from sample atom content -
            2.0%.
COMMENT     The error sources  were:
            Gamma flux - 10% of the systematic uncertainty in the
            photopeak efficiency determination plus 1.5 to 3%  of
            statistical error; photofission events - 3% of the
            systematic error in the calibration for fission
            counting plus 2 to 5% of the statistical uncertainty;
            photoneutron events - 3.6% of the systematic error in
            the calibration for neutron counting plus 6 to 10% of
            the statistical uncertainty; sample atom content - 2%
            of the  systematic error. The experimental errors in
            nu(e) and in the relative intensity of the  gamma-ray
            lines were not included in any error analysis. These
            values resulted in overall uncertainties of about 15%
            for the final photofission cross sections and about
            20%  for the final total neutron cross sections. The
            overall uncertainties for the final photoneutron
            cross sections ranged from 20 to 60%.
           The photofission and photoneutron cross sections of
            Pu-239 have been measured by using monochromatic and
            discrete photons produced by thermal neutron capture
            gamma-rays in several targets placed at the core of
            the IAA-R1 reactor in the energy interval from 5.43
            to 9.72 MeV. From the photofission cross sections
            obtained and according to the liquid drop model, the
            height of the simple fission barrier was determined -
            f.b.  = 5.7 (0.2) MeV. The relative fissionability to
            U-238 was also determined and shown to be energy
            independent - f.r. = 3.32(0.41). The total
            photoabsorption cross sections were calculated as
            well as the photofission branching ratio or fission
            probability pf = 0.70 (0.06).
