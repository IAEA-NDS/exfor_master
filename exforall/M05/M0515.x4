DETECTOR   (TRD) PHOTOFISSION FRAGMENTS WERE DETECTED BY FISSION
            TRACK REGISTRATION   TECHNIQUE  IN  MAKROFOIL  KG  (8
            MICRON).
           (HE3SP)  NEUTRONS FROM (G,F) AND (G,N) REACTIONS WERE
            DETECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH FISSION FRAGMENTS BY 4PI
            LONG-COUNTER CONSISTING    OF   60   HE-3   DETECTORS
            CONVENTIONALLY DISTRIBUTED   INSIDE    A    MODERATOR
            MATERIAL (POLIETHENE).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT)
SAMPLE     THE PU-239 SAMPLES CONTAINED 51.4 MG DEPOSITED IN  THE
            FORM OF PUO-2 ON FOUR  TITANUM  DISKS  EACH  WITH  AN
            ACTIVE DIAMETER OF 40 MM WAS USED:
                MASSES       ISOTOPE     ISOTOPIC PERCENTAGE

ANALYSIS   THE DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF NUMBER OF FISSION FRAGMENTS
            USING THE SCANNING OF THE MAKROFOL SHEETS BY MEANS OF
            CONVENTIONAL OPTICAL MICROSCOPY.
           THE DIRECT MEASUREMENTS  OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM A TOTAL
            NEUTRON PRODUCTION     REACTION     (G,N-TOT)     AND
            PHOTOFISSION REACTION (G,F) -  SIG  (G,N-TOT)  =  SIG
            (G,N) +  NU * SIG (G,F),  WHERE NU(E) IS THE VALUE OF
            THE PROMPT NEUTRON MULTIPLICITY (THE  AVERAGE  NUMBER
            OF PROMPT NEUTRONS PER FISSION).
REL-REF    (R,,B.L.BERMAN+,J,PR/C,34,2201,86)  THE DATA FOR NU(E)
            VALUES.
ERR-ANALYS THE TOTAL ERRORS  ARE GIVEN.  THE ERROR SOURCES  WERE:
            GAMMA FLUX - 10% OF THE SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE
            PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY DETERMINATION PLUS 1.5 TO 3%  OF
            STATISTICAL ERROR;   PHOTOFISSION EVENTS -  3% OF THE
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR  IN  THE  CALIBRATION  FOR   FISSION
            COUNTING PLUS 2 TO 5% OF THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY;
            PHOTONEUTRON EVENTS - 3.6% OF THE SYSTEMATIC ERROR IN
            THE CALIBRATION FOR NEUTRON COUNTING PLUS 6 TO 10% OF
            THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY; SAMPLE ATOM CONTENT - 2%
            OF THE  SYSTEMATIC ERROR.  THE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS IN
            NU(E) AND IN THE RELATIVE INTENSITY OF THE  GAMMA-RAY
            LINES WERE  NOT  INCLUDED IN ANY ERROR ANALYS.  THESE
            VALUES RESULTED IN OVERALL UNCERTAINTIES OF ABOUT 15%
            FOR  THE  FINAL PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS AND ABOUT
            20%  FOR THE FINAL TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS.  THE
            OVERALL  UNCERTAINTIES  FOR  THE  FINAL  PHOTONEUTRON
            CROSS SECTIONS RANGED FROM 20 TO 60%.  RANGED FROM 20
            TO 50% FOR THE FINAL PHOTONEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS.
COMMENT    THE  PHOTOFISSION  AND PHOTONEUTRON  CROSS SECTIONS OF
            PU-239 HAVE  BEEN MEASURED BY USING MONOCHROMATIC AND
            DISCRETE PHOTONS PRODUCED BY THERMAL NEUTRON  CAPTURE
            GAMMA-RAYS  IN  SEVERAL TARGETS PLACED AT THE CORE OF
            THE IAA-R1 REACTOR IN THE ENERGY INTERVAL  FROM  5.43
            TO  9.72  MEV.  FROM  THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS
            OBTAINED ANBD ACCORDING TO THE LIQUID DROP MODEL, THE
            HEIGHT OF THE SIMPLE FISSION BARRIER WAS DETERMINED -
            F.B.  = 5.7 (0.2) MEV. THE RELATIVE FISSIONABILITY TO
            U-238  WAS  ALSO  DETERMINED  AND  SHOWN TO BE ENERGY
            INDEPENDENT  -  F.R.  =  3.32   (0.41).   THE   TOTAL
            PHOTOABSORPTION  CROSS  SECTIONS  WERE  CALCULATED AS
            WELL AS THE PHOTOFISSION BRANCHING RATIO  OR  FISSION
            PROBABILITY PF = 0.70 (0.06).
