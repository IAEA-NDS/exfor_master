TITLE      The 7Li(gamma,n) and 7Li(e,n) reactions at
            intermediate photon energies.

SAMPLE     The six targets used were all self-supporting
            natural lithium foils with thickness ranging from
            0.4 - 0.6 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (REC,MAGFR,BCINT)
            Cross sections for single-photonucleon emission from
            7Li have been measured for photon energies in the
            range 60 - 120 MeV by detecting the recoiling
            residual nuclei following excitation with
            bremsstahlung radiation of end-point energies 140
            and 155 MeV.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Particles ejected from the target were
            detectedin a well-shielded array of ten surface
            barrier detectors mounted in the focal plane of a
            double-focusing magnetic spectrometer vacuum coupled
            to the scattering chamber.
ANALYSIS   For the bremsstrahlung-induced data each measured
            double-differential cross section for a particle of
            energy E-r detected at angle theta-r was reduced to
            a centre-of-mass (c.m.) Photoreaction cross section
            at laboratory photon energy Egamma and c.m. angle by
            appropriate formula where the Jacobian was
            determined using two-body kinematics of the reaction.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The quoted uncertainties are compounded
            from the statistical errors in the pulse-height
            spectra and the uncertainties in the in the
            charge-state correction and the target thickness.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties estimated to total
            about 7% for photon induced data. These arise from
            the uncertainty in the
             * calculated bremsstrahlung spectrum (about 4 %) and
             * smaller uncertainties in the spectrometer solid
               angle and charge monitor calibration.
ADD-RES     Measurements of the 7Li(e,6Li)e'p and 7Li(e,6Li)e'n
            cross sections were also made at the same electron
            energies. A significant difference  between the ratio
            of electron- and bremsstrahlung-induced yields for
            proton and neutron emission was observed. The results
            were compared to a modified quasi-deuteron model and
            a simple direct-knockout model in which recoil terms
            were included.
