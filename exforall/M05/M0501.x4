FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND)  LUND UNIVERSITY RACETRACK MICROTRON.
SAMPLE     THE  TARGET  CONSISTED  OF  DISTILLED  WATER  HELD  IN
            A CYLINDRICAL ALUMINIUM CELL OF DIMENSIONS 90 MM X 50
            MM IN   DIAMETER.  ENTRANCE  AND  EXIT  FOILS  HAD  A
            THICKNESS OF  0.25  MM  WHICH   WAS   NEGLIGIBLE   IN
            COMPARISON TO THE WATER.
           THE (D-2)-0 TARGET FOR D(G,N) REACTION MEASUREMENTS.
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213A LIQUID SCINTILLATOR.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION VALUES WERE OBTAINED
            FROM INTEGRATED AREAS OF PEAKS IN PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY
            TOF SPECTRA.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE  TOTAL - STATISTICAL   PLUS   SYSTEMATIC -
            ERRORS ARE GIVEN.  SYSTEMATIC ERRORS  AMOUNT TO ABOUT
            12.5 - 15 %.
STATUS     (CURVE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
COMMENT    MEASUREMENTS OF REACTION  O-16(G,N),  MADE WITH TAGGED
            PHOTONS AT  EG  NEAR 58 MEV,  ARE PRESENTED.  NEUTRON
            ENERGY DETERMINATION WAS  MADE  BY  TIME  OF  FLIGHT,
            GIVING A  RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 2 MEV WHICH ENABLED THE
            GROUND-STATE EXCITATION IN O-15 TO BE  RESOLVED  FROM
            STATES AT   5.2   AND  6.2  MEV.  DIFFERENTIAL  CROSS
            SECTIONS WERE MEASURED IN THE ANGULAR RANGE 30 -  110
            DEG AND   ARE   COMPARED   WITH  THE  PREDICTIONS  OF
            MICROSCOPIC, SELF-CONSISTENT   HARTREE-FOCK,   RANDOM
            PHASE APPROXIMATION  MODEL  OF  (G,N) REACTIONS.  THE
            IMPLICATIONS FOR  THE  THEORETICAL  DESCRIPTION   ARE
            DISCUSSED, NOTABLY  THE DEPENDENCE OF THE (G,N) CROSS
            SECTION ON MESON EXCHANGE  CURRENTS  AND  FINAL-STATE
            RESCATTERING.
