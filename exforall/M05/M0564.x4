SAMPLE     The deuterium target consisted of a 50 ml cell of
            liquid. Target operated at a pressure of 1.3 atm.,
            The maximum target thickness was 33 mm along the
            beam axis.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) A large solid angle, position sensitive
            plastic scintillator telescope consisted of 3 layers
            of NE110 plastic scintillators. These were two thin
            transmission layers (dE detectors) and a stopping
            layer (E detector), of thicknesses 1 mm, 3 mm, and
            110 mm, respectively. The total frontal area of the
            E elements was 1000.mm x 405. mm.
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors
            were amounted to 5 % by adding in quadrature the
            uncertainties from the following sources:
           (ERR-1) target thickness                           3%;
           (ERR-2) detector geometry and position calibration 3%;
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency                        2%;
           (ERR-4) photon flux                                1%.
COMMENT    The cross section for the reaction 2H(gamma,p)n has
            been measured at laboratory photon energies
            Egamma = 133 - 158 MeV and c.m. angles between 30 and
            150 degr. The reaction was induced by the tagged
            bremsstrahlung photon beam incident on a liquid
            deuterium target.
           There is now reasonable agreement between recent
            measurements in this energy region and the overall
            data set now defines the cross section sufficiently
            well to provide a test of current models of the
            reaction.
