TITLE      THE FORWARD, BACKWARD AND 90 DEGREE DEUTERON
            PHOTODISINTEGRATION BETWEEN 7 AND 19 MEV PHOTON
            ENERGY.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) THE GENT UNIVERSITY ELECTRON
            LINEAR ACCELERATOR.

METHOD     (MAGFR) MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (SILI)
SAMPLE     THE TARGETS WERE DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE FOILS: A
            CD-2 FOIL HAS A WEIGHT OF 4.88 (0.09)MG/CM**2, A
            CH-2 FOIL - 4.56 (0.03) MG/CM**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS. SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED TO BE NOT MORE THAN 3 %
            FOR THE FOLLOWING SOURCES:
            - BREMSSTRAHLUNG SHAPE;
            - BEAM MONITORING;
            - TARGET THICKNESS;
            - GEOMETRY EFFECTS;
            - ANALYSIS (ENERGY LOSS, MULTIPLE SCATTERING, ETC.).
COMMENT    THE 0, AND 180 DEGREE, AS WELL AS THE 90 DEGREE
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE 2H(G,P)N REACTION
            HAVE BEEN MEASURED AT LAB PHOTON ENERGIES BETWEEN 7
            AND 19 MEV. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE
            ACCURACY, IN PARTICULAR BY MEASURING THE FORWARD
            COMPTON ELECTRON YOELD. FOR THE EXTREME ANGLES, THE
            STATISTICAL ERROR ON THE RESULTS AMOUNTS 4 - 5 % (AT
            0 DEGREE) AND 7 - 8 % (180 DEGREE), RESPECTIVELY,
            WHILE THE SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY WAS AT MOST 3 %. THE
            DATA CONFORM THE EXISTENCE OF A MINIMUM IN THE
            FORWARD CROSS SECTION AND INDICATE BEYOND ANY DOUBT
            THAT THE FORE/AFT RATIO IS LARGER THAN UNITY.
            COMPARISON SHOWS REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE
            RESULTS FROM RECENT "CONVENTIONAL" THEORETICAL
            APPROACHES, INCLUDING MEASON EXCHANGE AND
            RELATIVISTIC CORRECTIONS, ALTHOUGH THE DESCRIPTION
            OF THE C-COEFFICIENT, APPEARING IN THE PARTOVI
            EXPANSION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION,
            REMAINS UNSATISFACTORY. A POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR THIS
            DISCREPANCY COULD BE THE INADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF
            THE E1 AND/OR THE E2 TRANSITION OPERATOR.
