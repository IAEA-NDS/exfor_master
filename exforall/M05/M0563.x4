TITLE      The forward, backward and 90 degree deuteron
            photodisintegration between 7 and 19 MeV photon
            energy.

METHOD     (MAGFR) Magnetic spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (SI) Si detector with an area of 2000 mm2 and a
            thickness of 300 mu-m was used. In the case of the
            forward 15 MeV measurement, a thicker detector
            (2 mm/1250 mm2) was mounted.
           (SIBAR) The energy calibration of the surface barrier
            detector was performed with the help of a Th-228
            alpha-source, yielding peaks with energies between
            5.4 and 8.8 MeV.
SAMPLE     The targets were deuterated polyethylene foils: a
            CD-2 foil has a weight of 4.88 (0.09)mg/cm**2, a
            CH-2 foil - 4.56 (0.03) mg/cm**2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors. For the extreme angles,
            the statistical error on the results amounts 4-5% (at
            0 degr.) and 7-8 % (180 degr.), respectively,
            while the systematic uncertainty was at most 3 %.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties were estimated
            to be not more than 3% for the following sources:
            - bremsstrahlung shape;
            - beam monitoring;
            - target thickness;
            - geometry effects;
            - analysis (energy loss, multiple scattering, etc.).
COMMENT    The 0, and 180 degree, as well as the 90 degree
            differential cross sections for the 2H(gamma,p)n
            reaction have been measured at lab photon energies
            between 7 and 19 MeV. Special attention was paid to
            the accuracy, in particular by measuring the forward
            Compton electron yield. The data confirm the
            existence of a minimum in the forward cross section
            and indicate beyond any doubt that the fore/aft ratio
            is larger than unity. Comparison shows reasonable
            agreement with the results from recent "conventional"
            theoretical approaches, including meason exchange and
            relativistic corrections, although the description of
            the C-coefficient, appearing in the Partovi expansion
            of the differential cross section, remains
            unsatisfactory. A possible source for this
            discrepancy could be the inadequate description of
            the E1 and/or the E2 transition operator.
