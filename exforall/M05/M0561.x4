INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
FACILITY   (MICRT,1USAUI)  The  100 %  duty  cycle  microtron  at
            Nuclear Physics laboratory,  University  of Illinois,
            Urbana-Champaign.
INC-SOURCE (BRST,KINDT)   The  energy   and  angle   of  the  3He
            photodisintegation  neutron  and proton were used  to
            reconstruct  the   photon  energy,   making  this   a
            kinamatically complete experiment.
PART-DET   (N,P)
METHOD     (COINC,EDE) Coincident neutron-proton pairs
            measurement.
DETECTOR   (TELES,NAICR,SCIN)  Array of  12 long  (282.9 x 15.2 x
            2.5 cm**3)  scintillators   for  neutrons  and   E-dE
            telescopes: thin (0.025 cm thick and 5.1 cm in diam.)
            - plastic  scintillator  dE-counter;  thick  (2.5 cm)
            - NaI crystal E-counter for protons.
SAMPLE     The target  was a cryogenic system which kept  the 3He
             gas at liquid-4He temperature (4.2 K).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors
            Systematic uncertainties were estimated for the
            following effects:
           (ERR-1) proton identification                2.0 %;
           (ERR-2) target thickness                     2.6 %;
           (ERR-3) accidentals subtraction              3.0 %;
           (ERR-4,3.2,10.0) depascale normalization 3.2 - 10.0 %;
           (ERR-5,5.0,10.0) neutron efficiency      5.0 - 10.0 %.
COMMENT    Coincident neutron-proton pairs were measured from the
            reaction 3He(gamma,Np)p  with 100-MeV bremsstrahlung
            beam. The energy and angle of the neutron and  proton
            were  used  to reconstruct  the photon energy, making
            this    a    kinamatically    complete    experiment.
            Quasi-deuteron   breakup   was   observed  for photon
            energies from 45 to 95 MeV.  The angular distribution
            of the Np pairs was measured  for opening angles from
            122 to 202  degreees  in the  laboratory  frame.  The
            single-differential  cross   section  in  omega-p was
            determined  at  theta-p  =  81 degree,  relative   to
            deuterium,  to range  from 2.4 at 55 MeV to 1.7 at 95
            MeV.
ADD-RES    The  angular  distributions   of  the  Np  pairs   for
            opening  angles  from  122  to  202 degreees  in  the
            laboratory frame.
