TITLE      3HE(G,NP)P REACTION IN QUASI-DEUTERON KINEMATICS.
FACILITY   (MICRT,1USAUI) THE 100 % DUTY CYCLE MICROTRON AT
            NUCLEAR PHYSICS LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF
            ILLINOIS, URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.
INC-SOURCE (BRST,KINDT) THE ENERGY AND ANGLE OF THE 3HE
            PHOTODISINTEGATION NEUTRON AND PROTON WERE USED
            TO RECONSTRUCT THE PHOTON ENERGY, MAKING THIS A
            KINAMATICALLY COMPLETE EXPERIMENT.
PART-DET   (N,P)
METHOD     (COINC) COINCIDENT NEUTRON-PROTON PAIRS MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,TELES) ARRAY OF 12 LONG (282.9 X 15.2 X
            2.5 CM**3) SCINTILLATORS FOR NEUTRONS AND EDE
            TELESCOPES (THIN (0.025 CM THICK AND 5.1 CM IN
            DIAMETER) PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR DE-COUNTER,
            THICK (2.5 CM) NAI CRYSTAL) FOR PROTONS.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A CRYOGENIC SYSTEM WHICH KEPT THE
            3HE GAS AT LIQUID-4HE TEMPERATURE (4.2 K).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS. SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED FOR THE FOLLOWING
            EFFECTS:
            - PROTON IDENTIFICATION                2.0 %;
            - TARGET THICKNESS                     2.6 %;
            - ACCIDENTALS SUBTRACTION              3.0 %;
            - DEPASCALE NORMALIZATION       3.2 - 10.0 %;
            - NEUTRON EFFICIENCY            5.0 - 10.0 %.
COMMENT    COINCIDENT NEUTRON-PROTON PAIRS WERE MEASURED FROM
            THE REACTION 3HE(G,NP)P WITH 100-MEV BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            BEAM. THE ENERGY AND ANGLE OF THE NEUTRON AND
            PROTON WERE USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE PHOTON ENERGY,
            MAKING THIS A KINAMATICALLY COMPLETE EXPERIMENT.
            QUASI-DEUTERON BREAKUP WAS OBSERVED FOR PHOTON
            ENERGIES FROM 45 TO 95 MEV. THE ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION OF THE NP PAIRS WAS MEASURED FOR
            OPENING ANGLES FROM 122 TO 202 DEGREEES IN THE
            LABORATORY FRAME. THE SINGLE-DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
            SECTION IN OMEGA-P WAS DETERMINED AT THETA-P = 81
            DEGREE, RELATIVE TO DEUTERIUM, TO RANGE FROM 2.4
            AT 55 MEV TO 1.7 AT 95 MEV.
ADD-RES    THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NP PAIRS FOR
            OPENING ANGLES FROM 122 TO 202 DEGREEES IN THE
            LABORATORY FRAME.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 2.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
