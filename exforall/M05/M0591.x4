TITLE      TWO-BODY PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF 3HE AND 4HE IN THE
            DELTA (1236) REGION.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR SAC) 600 MEV SACLAY LINAC (ALS).
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (COINC,MAGFR)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN)
           DEUTRONS/TRITONS WERE ANALYSED IN THE FOCAL PLANE OF
            THE SPECTROMETER USING A LADDER COUNTER CONSISTING
            OF FOUR 90 MM X 220 MM X 2 MM PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS
            IN COINCIDENCE WITH A LARGE 460 MM X 240 MM X 5 MM
            PLASTIC DETECTOR.
           PROTONS WERE DETECTED USING TELESCOPE CONSISTED OF
            TWO 200 MM X 220 MM X 5 MM PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS.
ANALYSIS   TO EXTRACT THE GOOD EVENTS, A ST OF CONDITIONS WAS
            IMPOSED ON THE SPECTRA: BROAD CUTS ON THE
            SPECTROMETER PULSE-HEIGHT HISTOGRAM DEFINE THE
            SELECTED KINDOF PARTICLE (DEUTERON OR TRITON); THEN
            THE TIME INTERVAL HISTOGRAMS FOR TRUE AND RANDOM
            COINCIDENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SELECTED EVENTS
            WERE ESTABLISHED. THE NUMBEROF GOOD EVENTS WAS
            DEFINED AS THE NUMBER OF EVENTS IN THE PEAK OF THE
            TRUE COINCIDENCE PLOT, CORRECTED BY THE AVERAGE
            NUMBER OF RANDOM COINCIDENCES READ IN THE DELAYED
            COINCIDENCE PLOT.
CORRECTION THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS WERE CONSIDERED:
            - PROTON ABSORPTION IN THE COPPER ABSORBER SITUATED
              IN FRONT OF TELESCOPE; THIS CORRECTION NEVER
              EXCEEDED 15 %;
            - COUNTING LOSSES DUE TO THE HIGH COUNTING RATE IN
              THE TELESCOPE SCINTILLATORS: THEY WERE ESTIMATED
              FROM THE SINGLE RATES FOR EACH RUN AND CORRECTIONS
              WERE MADE RANGING FROM 2 - 8 %;
            - EVENTS ORIGINATING IN THE TARGET WALLS: THE
              CORRECTION AMOUNTED TO 1.5 % IN THE WORST CASE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) ONLY STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES ARE GIVEN.
COMMENT    DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE REACTIONS
            3HE(G,P)D AND 4HE(G,P)T WERE MEASURED AT PROTON C.M.
            ANGLES OF 60 AND 90 DEGREE FOR PROTON ENERGIES
            RANGING FROM 150 - 450 MEV WITH AN AVERAGE RESOLUTION
            OF 8 MEV. BREMSSTRAHLUNG WAS USED AS A PHOTON SOURCE;
            DEUTRONS/TRITONS WERE ANALYZED IN A MAGNETIC
            SPECTROMETER WHEREAS COINCIDENT PROTONS WERE DETECTED
            IN A PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR TELESCOPE. THE EXPERIMENTAL
            METHOD INCLUDES A CALIBRATION BY MEANS OF 1H(G,PI)P
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT AT 90 DEGREE
            C.M. IN THE SAME PHOTON ENERGY RANGE. THE 3H AND 4HE
            TWO-BODY PHOTODISINTEGRATION DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
            SECTIONS SHOW A MONOTONICALLY DECREASING VARIATION
            WITH PHOTON ENERGY. IN ADDITION, PARTIAL DATA ON THE
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION OF THE REACTION
            4HE(G,N)3HE AT 90 AND 120 DEGREE NEUTRON C.M. ANGLE
            ARE GIVEN
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLES 4 - 6.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
