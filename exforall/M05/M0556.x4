SAMPLE     The liquid-helium target-cell consisted of 6 mm thick
            elliptical aluminium frame with 125 micron thick
            Kapton windows and an internal aperture with major
            and minor axes of 109 and 500 mm, respectively. The
            effective number  of target nuclei was to be
            4.27 (+-0.08) x 10**22/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors about 22.4 % (for Eg =
            = 80 - 131 MeV) were obtained by adding in quadrature
            the systematic uncertainties from the folowing
            sources:
           (ERR-1,10.5,35.4) Uncertainty in detector thresholds
                                  (Eg = 80- 97 MeV)    35.4 %;
                                  (Eg = 97 - 115 MeV)  18.8 %;
                                  (Eg = 115 - 131 MeV) 10.5 %;
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in detector efficiencies 10.0 %;
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in tagging efficiency     2.9 %;
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in target thickness       1.9 %;
           (ERR-5) Uncertainty in tagger multiplicity correction
           (ERR-6) Uncertainty in T.O.F. multiplexing correction
           (ERR-7) Uncertainty in deadtime correction    0.2 %.

            4He(gamma,pp)nn reactions.
COMMENT    The results of tagged-photon measurements of the
            4He(gamma,pn)D, 4He(gamma,pn)pn and 4He(gamma,pp)nn
            reactions, carried our with photons of energies 80 -
            131 MeV, are presented. The (gamma,pn)D
            three-body-breakup cross section dominates the
            four-body-breakup cross section.
           The three-body-breakup cross section and the
            corresponding deuteron recoil-momentum spectrum are
            reasonably accounted for by a mechanism of photon
            absorption on correlated proton-neutron pairs.
           In contrast the four-body-breakup mechanism appears to
            have two components: absorption on correlated
            proton-neutron pairs and a more complex additional
            component which has a distribution similar to phase
            space. The data rule out substantial photon
            absorption on proton-proton pairs.
