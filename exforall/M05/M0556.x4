TITLE      THE 4HE(G,2NUCLEONS) REACTION MEASURED WITH TAGGED
            PHOTONS.
FACILITY   (MICRT,2GERMNZ) 180 MEV ELECTRON MICROTRON MAMI-A AT
            MAINZ.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD)
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN)
SAMPLE     THE LIQUID-HELIUM TARGET-CELL CONSISTED OF 6 MM THICK
            ELLIPTICAL ALUMINIUM FRAME WITH 125 MICRON THICK
            KAPTON WINDOWS AND AN INTERNAL APERTURE WITH MAJOR
            AND MINOR AXES OF 109 AND 500 MM, RESPECTIVELY. THE
            EFFECTIVE NUMBER  OF TARGET NUCLEI WAS TO BE
            4.27 (0.08) X 10-** CM-**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
            SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ABOUT 22.4 % (FOR EG = 80 - 131 MEV)
            WERE OBTAINED BY ADDING IN QUADRATURE THE SISTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTIES FROM THE FOLOWING SOURCES:
            - DETECTOR THRESHOLDS (EG = 80- 97 MEV)    35.4 %;
                                  (EG = 97 - 115 MEV)  18.8 %;
                                  (EG = 115 - 131 MEV) 10.5 %;
            - DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES                    10.0 %;
            - TAGGING EFFICIENCY                        2.9 %;
            - TARGET THICKNESS                          1.9 %;
            - TAGGER MULTIPLICITY CORRECTION            0.9 %;
            - T.O.F. MULTIPLEXING CORRECTION            0.9 %;
            - DEADTIME CORRECTION                       0.2 %.

            REACTIONS.
COMMENT    THE RESULTS OF TAGGED-PHOTON MEASUREMENTS OF THE
            4HE(G,PN)D, 4HE(G,PN)PN AND 4HE(G,PP)NN REACTIONS,
            CARRIED OUR WITH PHOTONS OF ENERGIES 80 - 131 MEV,
            ARE PRESENTED. THE (G,PN)D THREE-BODY-BREAKUP CROSS
            SECTION DOMINATES THE FOUR-BODY-BREAKUP CROSS
            SECTION. THE THREE-BODY-BREAKUP CROSS SECTION AND
            THE CORRESPONDING DEUTERON RECOIL-MOMENTUM SPECTRUM
            ARE REASONABLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY A MECHANISM OF
            PHOTON ABSORPTION ON CORRELATED PROTON-NEUTRON
            PAIRS. IN CONTRAST THE FOUR-BODY-BREAKUP MECHANISM
            APPEARS TO HAVE TWO COMPONENTS: ABSORPTION ON
            CORRELATED PROTON-NEUTRON PAIRS AND A MORE COMPLEX
            ADDITIONAL COMPONENT WHICH HAS A DISTRIBUTION
            SIMILAR TO PHASE SPACE. THE DATA RULE OUT
            SUBSTANTIAL PHOTON ABSORPTION ON PROTON-PROTON
            PAIRS.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
