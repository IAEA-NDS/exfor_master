TITLE      Fission of Al, Ti, Co, Zr, Nb, Ag, In, Nd, Sm and Ta
            nuclei induced by (0.8 - 1.8) GeV photons

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
ANALYSIS   Optical microscopy track number counting after the
            track etching procedures in order to make fission
            tracks visible for track analysis under optical
            microscopy.
           The Cr-39 plates were submitted to a 6.25 N NaOH
            etching at 60 C degree during two or three periods
            of 1.hr each.
           In the case of Makrofol sheets a 6.25 N NaOH etching
            solution was used, this time at 70 C degree during
            three periods of 20 min each.
           For mica detectors, after removing of the Nd and Sm
            films, they were submitted to an etching procedure
            consisting of 40 % hydrofluoric acid at 23 C degree
            during 2.hr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors represented a
            combination of the errors associated to all
            quantities needed for the cross section estimation.
COMMENT     Samples of Al, Ti, Co, Zr, Nb, Ag, in, Nd, Sm and Ta
            elements in contact with solid-state nuclear track
            detectors were exposed to (0.8 - 1.8) GeV
            bremsstrahlung beams at the 2.5 GeV electron
            synchrotron of the Bonn University. The detectors
            were processed to produce visible fission tracks for
            track analysis with optical microscopes. Absolute
            mean cross sections per photon and fissility were
            evaluated. Results are discussed and compared with
            other photofission data as well as with estimates
            from the current fission models. A broad minimum
            found for nuclear fissility of 10**(-4) - 10**(-3)
            covering the range Z**2/A = 15 - 25 seems to confirm
            the predictions from the models. For Al and Ti
            nuclei the probability of fission amounts to about
            10**(-1).
