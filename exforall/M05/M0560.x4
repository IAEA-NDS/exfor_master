TITLE      Compton scattering by mesons in nuclei: experiment on
            Pb-208.
FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND) MAX stretcher ring in LUND.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) Tagged photons.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA))
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Three high-resolution NaI(Tl)  detectors, two
            having dimensions of 10" diameter by 10" and  one  -
            10" diameter by 14".
SAMPLE     A block of 918 g of Pb containing 87 % 208Pb.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The quated experimental errors  take  into
            account  the statistical errors based on the numbers
            of scattered photons,  the errors due to the tagging
            efficiency  and  errors  due  to  the electron count
            rates of the focal-plane detectors.
COMMENT    Using 58  and  73  MeV  tagged photons and scattering
            angles from 60 to 150 degree,  it was shown that  it
            is possible to observe compton scattering by "mesons
            in nuclei" through an incomplete cancellation of the
            mesonic   (eschange-current)  seagull  amplitude  by
            parts of the nuclear resonance amplitude related  to
            the giant-dipole resonance of 208Pb. This phenomenon
            is a property of an extended nucleus and, therefore,
            cannot  be  studied on the deuteron.  Predictions of
            the  exchange  form  factor  which  determines   the
            angular   distribution   of   the  exchange  Seagull
            amplitude are compared with experimental data.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the Table 1.
            Data were   compiled   at   the   USA  BNL  NNDC  by
