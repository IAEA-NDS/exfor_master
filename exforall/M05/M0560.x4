TITLE      COMPTON SCATTERING BY MESONS IN NUCLEI: EXPERIMENT
            ON PB-208.
FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND) MAX STRETCHER RING IN LUND.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) TAGGED PHOTONS.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA))
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THREE HIGH-RESOLUTION NAI(TL) DETECTORS, TWO
            HAVING DIMENSIONS OF 10" DIAMETER BY 10" AND ONE -
            10" DIAMETER BY 14".
SAMPLE     A BLOCK OF 918 G OF PB CONTAINING 87 % 208PB.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE QUATED EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS TAKE INTO
            ACCOUNT THE STATISTICAL ERRORS BASED ON THE NUMBERS
            OF SCATTERED PHOTONS, THE ERRORS DUE TO THE TAGGING
            EFFICIENCY AND ERRORS DUE TO THE ELECTRON COUNT RATES
            OF THE FOCAL-PLANE DETECTORS.
COMMENT    USING 58 AND 73 MEV TAGGED PHOTONS AND SCATTERING
            ANGLES FROM 60 TO 150 DEGREE, IT WAS SHOWN THAT IT IS
            POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE COMPTON SCATTERING BY "MESONS IN
            NUCLEI" THROUGH AN INCOMPLETE CANCELLATION OF THE
            MESONIC (ESCHANGE-CURRENT) SEAGULL AMPLITUDE BY PARTS
            OF THE NUCLEAR RESONANCE AMPLITUDE RELATED TO THE
            GIANT-DIPOLE RESONANCE OF 208PB. THIS PHENOMENON IS
            A PROPERTY OF AN EXTENDED NUCLEUS AND, THEREFORE,
            CANNOT BE STUDIED ON THE DEUTERON. PREDICTIONS OF THE
            EXCHANGE FORM FACTOR WHICH DETERMINES THE ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION OF THE EXCHANGE SEAGULL AMPLITUDE ARE
            COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
