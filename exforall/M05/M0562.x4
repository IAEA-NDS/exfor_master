METHOD     (COINC,EDE)
DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,SCIN) The large  solid-angle  LASA detector
            which  consists  of three concentric levels  of wires
            multiwire  proportional chambers,  surrounded  by two
            layers  of plastic scintillators  the inner  of which
            was 3-mm thick  dE-counter  and  the outer  was 25 mm
            thick E-counter.
SAMPLE     The target gas, no additional details.
COMMENT    Results  are presented from a  4He photodisintegration
            experiment performed with quasi-monochromatic photons
            using    a    large    solid-angle   detector.    The
            target-bremsstrahlung  technique   gave   a  reliable
            absolute mormalization.  In addition,  an unambigious
            separation  of the proton-triton channel  from  other
            photodisintegration channels was achieved.

ANALYSIS   Discrimination  between two-body and multibody  events
            was achieved  by  exploiting cuts based upon two body
            kinematics  for which  the events  with  one  and two
            tracks were analyzed separately.
