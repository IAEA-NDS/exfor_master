TITLE      ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
            SECTION FOR THE REACTION 4HE(G,P)3H FROM 63 TO
            71 MEV.
FACILITY   (MICRT,1USAUI) THE 100 % DUTY CYCLE ACCELERATOR
            MUSL-2 AT NUCLEAR PHYSICS LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY
            OF ILLINOIS.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD)
METHOD     (COINC,EDE)
DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,SCIN) THE LARGE SOLID-ANGLE LASA
            DETECTOR WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE CONCENTRIC
            LEVELS OF WIRES MULTIWIRE PROPORTIONAL CHAMBERS,
            SURROUNDED BY TWO LAYERS OF PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS
            THE INNER OF WHICH WAS 3-MM THICK DE-COUNTER AND
            THE OUTER WAS 25 MM THICK E-COUNTER.

SAMPLE     THE TARGET GAS, NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS.
COMMENT    RESULTS ARE PRESENTED FROM A 4HE
            PHOTODISINTEGRATION EXPERIMENT PERFORMED WITH
            QUASI-MONOCHROMATIC PHOTONS USING A LARGE
            SOLID-ANGLE DETECTOR. THE TARGET-BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            TECHNIQUE GAVE A RELIABLE ABSOLUTE MORMALIZATION.
            IN ADDITION, AN UNAMBIGIOUS SEPARATION OF THE
            PROTON-TRITON CHANNEL FROM OTHER
            PHOTODISINTEGRATION CHANNELS WAS ACHIEVED. A
            TOTAL CROSS SECTION OF 218 (8) MICROB WAS MEASURED AT
            MEAN ENERGY OG 67 (4) MEV AND LEGENDRE
            COEFFICIENTS UP TO A5 WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE
            ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS.

STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 2.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
