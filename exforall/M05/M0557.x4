TITLE      THE (G,P) REACTION AT EG ABOUT 60 MEV.
FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND) UNIVERSITY OF LUND MAXLAB RACETRACK
            MICROTRON FOLLOWED BY THE STRETCHER RING.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) THE MAGNETICALLY TAGGED PHOTONS.
DETECTOR   (TELES,TRD,HPGE) TWO TELESCOPES EACH CONSISTING OF
            TW0 SILICON STRIP DETECTORS (SSDS) AND ONE HYPERPURE
            GERMANIUM DETECTOR (HPGE).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA))
ANALYSIS   (AREA) ENERGY SPECTRA CORRESPONDING TO SEVERAL ANGULAR
            BINS WERE GENERATED, AND THE YIELD FOR A SPECIFIC
            TRANSITION OBTAINED BY INTEGRATION THE NUMBER OF

            REACTION FOR DATA ABSOLUTE NORMALIZATION.
COMMENT    A STUDY OF THE (G,P) REACTION ON 12C, 14N, 27AL,
            AND 51 V TARGETS, AT PHOTON ENERGIES EG ABOUT 60 MEV,
            WAS REPORTED. ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE RANGE
            THETA-P = 60 - 120 DEGREE WERE PRESENTED FOR
            TRANSITIONS LEADING TO THE GROUND STATE AND SEVERAL
            LOW-LYING STATES IN EACH RESIDUAL NUCLEUS. THE
            RELATIVE POPULATION OF THE RESIDUAL NUCLEUS STATES
            IS SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN (E,E'P) AND (D,3HE)
            EXPERIMENTS, APART FROM THE WELL-KNOWN EXCEPTION OF
            THE PEAK AT 6.8 MEV IN THE 12C(G,P) REACTION.
            DIRECT-KNOCKOUT CALCULATIONS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
            MAGNITUDE OF THE (G,P) RESULTS, WHICH INDICATES THE
            NEED FOR CALCULATIONS THAT INCLUDE EFFECTS SUCH AS
            MESON EXCHANGE OR SHORT-RANGE CORRELATIONS. STRENGHT
            SEEN AT HIGHER EXCITATION ENERGIES IS ATTRIBUTED TO
            INCLISIVE (G,P) EVENTS. THE EXCITATION-ENERGY SPECTRA
            HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH QUASI-DEUTERON MODEL
            CALCULATIONS WHICH ASSUME A (G,NP) REACTION WHERE THE
            NEUTRON GOES UNDETECTED. THE SHAPE OF 51V EXCITATION
            SPEXTRUM IA COMPARED TO A PRE-EQUILIBRIUM MODEL
            CALCULATION. THE RESULTS APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT
            TWO-NUCLEON ABSORPTION OF THE PHOTON IS IMPORTANT.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLES 1 - 3.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
