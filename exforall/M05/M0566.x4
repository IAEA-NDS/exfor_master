TITLE      SEARCH FOR THE MINIMUM IN THE FORWARD 2H(G,P)N CROSS
            SECTION.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) THE GENT UNIVERSITY ELECTRON
            LINEAR ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (MAGFR) MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (SILI) LARGE AREA (2000 MM**2) SI-DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     THE TARGETS CONSISTED OF CD-2 AND CH-2 FOILS WITH THE
            TOTAL THICKNESS OF 4.88 AND 4.56 MG/SM**2,
            RESPECTIVELY.
ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION VALUES WERE OBTAINED BY COMPARING
            THE SIMULATED USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
            PHOTOPROTON ENERGY DISTRIBUTION WITH THE
            EXPERIMENTAL NET SPECTRUM.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS. SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED TO BE OF ORDER OF 3 %.
COMMENT    THE FORWARD 2H(G,P)N CROSS SECTION WAS MEASURED AT 7.2
            AND 8.5 MEV PHOTON ENERGY. THE NEW ABSOLUTE VALUES
            CONFIRM THE THEORETICALLY PREDICTED PRESENCE OF A
            MINIMUM IN THIS CROSS SECTION. A DISCRIMINATION WAS
            MADE BETWEEN THE RESULTS FROM VARIOUS THEORETICAL
            DESCRIPTIONS.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
