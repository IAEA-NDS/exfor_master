FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) The Gent University electron  linear

METHOD     (MAGFR) Magnetic spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (SI) Large area (2000 mm**2) Si-detector.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of CD-2 and CH-2 foils with the
            total thickness of 4.88 and 4.56 mg/cm**2,
            respectively.
ANALYSIS   The cross section values were obtained by comparing
            the simulated using Monte Carlo simulation
            photoproton energy distribution with the
            experimental net spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties were estimated to
            be of order of 3 %.
COMMENT    The forward 2H(gamma,p)n cross section was measured at
            7.2 and 8.5 MeV photon energy. The new absolute values
            confirm the theoretically predicted presence of a
            minimum in this cross section. A discrimination was
            made between the results from various theoretical
            descriptions.
