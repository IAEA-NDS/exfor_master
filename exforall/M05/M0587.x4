TITLE      ABSOLUTE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF 209BI IN
            THE ENERGY RANGE FROM 40 TO 65 MEV.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERMPM)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD)
SAMPLE     BISMUTH TARGET LAYER WITH THE PURITY OF THE
            BISMUTH METAL 99.99995 % AND AVERAGE THICKNESS
            2.34 (0.06) MG/CM**2.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT SCATEERED PHOTON DETECTION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO INFORMATION ABOUT SOURCES OF
            UNCERTAINTIES.
COMMENT    THE ABSOLUTE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF 209BI
            HAS BEEN MEASURED WITH MONOENERGETIC G-RADIATION
            BETWEEN 40 AND 65 MEV PHOTON ENERGY. CROSS SECTION
            DATA HAVE BEEN OBTAINED WITH AN ACCURACY BETWEEN 9
            AND 20 %. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT WAS COMPARED
            WITH THE EXCITATION FUNCTION CALCULATED ON THE
            BASIS OF THE STATISTICAL MODEL. IN ORDER TO
            REPRODUCE THE MEASURED DATA ON (G,F) SIGMA,
            THE (G,N) CROSS SECTION MUST DECREASE WITH
            INCREASING PHOTON ENERGY FASTER THAN THE
            EXPERIMENTAL TOTAL (G,N) CROSS SECTION. THIS
            BEHAVIOUR CAN POSSIBLY BE EXPLAINED BY ASSUMPTION
            THAT AFTER PHOTON ABSORPTION A COMPOUND NUCLEUS
            IS FORMED ONLY FOR A SMALL, WITH PHOTON ENERGY
            DECREASING, FRACTION OF ALL DECAYS.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
