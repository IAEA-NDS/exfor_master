SAMPLE      Bismuth target layer with the purity of the
            bismuth metal 99.99995 % and average thickness
            2.34 (0.06) mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)

ANALYSIS   Direct scattered photon detection.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Cross section data have been obtained with
            an accuracy between 9 and 20 %.
COMMENT    The absolute photofission cross section of 209Bi
            has been measured with monoenergetic gamma-radiation
            between 40 and 65 MeV photon energy. The experimental
            result was compared with the excitation function
            calculated on the basis of the statistical model.
            In order to reproduce the measured data on
            sigma(gamma,f), the (gamma,n) cross section must
            decrease with increasing photon energy faster than
            the experimental total (gamma,n) cross section. This
            behavior can possibly be explained by assumption
            that after photon absorption a compound nucleus
            is formed only for a small, with photon energy
            decreasing, fraction of all decays.
