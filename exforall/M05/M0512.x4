TITLE      Absolute  C-12(gamma,p-0)  cross  section in the giant
            dipole resonance region.

INC-SOURCE (BRST,HARD)    The  bremsstrahlung   photon  beam  was
            hardened by a 19.5 cm thick graphite cylinder, placed
            about half-way    between   the   Au   bremsstrahlung
            converter target with thickness 90 mg/cm**2  and  the
            reaction chamber.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) Ghent State University linac.
SAMPLE     THE 3.39 MG/CM**2 Thick polystyrene target.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (SILI)  Uncooled solid state detectors  with an active
            area of 200 mm**2 and a thickness of 3 mm.
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR)  Photoprotons  were detected  at  seven angles
            simultaneously, varying between 37  and  143  degree.
            The photoproton  spectra  measured  were converted to
            the differential cross section data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
           (ERR-SYS) The  total  systematic  error to be  smaller
            than 12 %.
COMMENT    The  absolute  C-12(g,p-0)B-11  reaction cross section
            was measured in the energy range of the giant  dipole
            resonance. The    magnitude    of    the    90-degree
            differential cross section,  which  has  an  absolute
            uncertainty of  about 12% ,  is  in disagreement with
            the one obtained by detailed balance  from  a  recent
            measurements of  (p,g-0) reaction cross section,  but
            is in reasonable  correspondence  with  the  combined
            data from Argonne and Stanford groups.
