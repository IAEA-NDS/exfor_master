TITLE      ABSOLUTE C-12(G,P-0) CROSS SECTION IN THE GIANT DIPOLE
            RESONANCE REGION.

INC-SOURCE (BRST,HARD)    THE  BREMSSTRAHLUNG   PHOTON  BEAM  WAS
            HARDENED BY A 19.5 CM THICK GRAPHITE CYLINDER, PLACED
            ABOUT HALF-WAY    BETWEEN   THE   AU   BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            CONVERTER TARGET WITH THICKNESS 90 MG/CM**2  AND  THE
            REACTION CHAMBER.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) GHENT STATE UNIVERSITY LINAC.
SAMPLE     THE 3.39 MG/CM**2 THICK POLYSTYRENE TARGET.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (SILI)  UNCOOLED SOLID STATE DETECTORS  WITH AN ACTIVE
            AREA OF 200 MM**2 AND A THICKNESS OF 3 MM.
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR)  PHOTOPROTONS  WERE DETECTED  AT  SEVEN ANGLES
            SIMULTANEOUSLY, VARYING BETWEEN 37  AND  143  DEGREE.
            THE PHOTOPROTON  SPECTRA  MEASURED  WERE CONVERTED TO
            THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION DATA.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)   STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN. THE SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 12 %.
STATUS     (CURVE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
COMMENT    THE  ABSOLUTE  C-12(G,P-0)B-11 R EACTION CROSS SECTION
            WAS MEASURED IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF THE GIAND  DIPOLE
            RESONANCE. THE    MAGNITUDE    OF    THE    90-DEGREE
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION,  WHICH  HAS  AN  ABSOLUTE
            UNCERTAINTY OF  ABOUT 12%  ,  IS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH
            THE ONE OBTAINED BY DETAILED BALANCE  FROM  A  RECENT
            MEASUREMENTS OF  (P,G-0) REACTION CROSS SECTION,  BUT
            IS IN REASONABLE  CORRESPONDENCE  WITH  THE  COMBINED
            DATA FROM ARGONNE AND STANFORD GROUPS.
