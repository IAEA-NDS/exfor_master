SAMPLE     The samples  of natural zirconium.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li)-detector.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Isomer yield and ratio  measurement  using  the
            gamma-quanta energy spectrum lines data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
COMMENT    The isomeric  yield  ratios  Y-m/Y-g were measured for
            reaction Zr-90(gamma,n)Zr-89-m,g using the
            bremsstrshlung in the energy  region 13 - 21 MeV with
            step 0.5 MeV. Experimental isomeric ratios were
            compared  with the values reported  by other  authors
            and  results  of calculations  within  the  framework
            of statistical theory and  on  model  of  the
            "semidirect" decay of giant dipole resonance.
