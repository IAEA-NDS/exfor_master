SAMPLE     The samples  of natural zirconium.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li)-detector.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Isomer yield and ratio  measurement  using  the
            gamma-quanta energy spectrum lines data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
STATUS     (TABLE)
COMMENT    The isomeric  yield  ratios  Y-m/Y-g were measured for
            reaction Zr-90(gamma,n)Zr-89-m,g using the bremsstrshl
            in the  energy  region 13 - 21 MeV with step 0.5 MeV.
            Experimental isomeric ratios were compared  with  the
            values reported  by  other  authors  and  results  of
            calculations within  the  framework  of   statistical
            theory and  on  model  of  the  "semidirect" decay of
            giant dipole resonance.
HISTORY    (19980319C) Data  were  prepared  in the MSU INP CDFE
