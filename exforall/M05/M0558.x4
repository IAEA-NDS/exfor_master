DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,SCIN) The LASA detector consists of a
            cylindrical multiwire proportional chanber
            surrounded by E-dE- plastic scintillator pairs. The
            wire chanmer consisted of three concentric levels
            of wires which run parallel to the detector axis.
            The gas mixture used consisted of 90% argon and
            10% methane. dE-detector of each pair was 3.2 mm
            thick and E-detector was a 25.4 mm thick.
SAMPLE     The target bag contained deuterium gas, enriched to
            the 99.74% level. The target gas was at room
            temperature and pressure, which averaged 22.5C degr.
            and 744.1 mm Hg. The resultant number density for
            2H was 4.86 x 10**19 nuclei/cm**3.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors were estimated to be 3.7%,
            the sources of which are the following:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty due to the impurity corrections;
           (ERR-2) uncertainty due to data cuts            0.3 %;
           (ERR-3) uncertainty due to tagging efficiency   1.0 %;
           (ERR-4) uncertainty due to geometric acceptance 1.0 %;
           (ERR-5,0.2,4.5) uncertainty due to track efficiency
                           for angles from 100 upto 160 degree.
COMMENT    The absolute differential cross section for the
            2H(gamma,p)n reaction has been measured using a large
            solid angle detector, with a tagged photon beam of
            mean energy 67 MeV. The data have been compared with
            nine different theoretical calculations of the cross
            section, which account for the data to varying
            degrees. Best agreement is obtained for models
            utilizing the nonrelativistic impulse approximation
            with a realistic nuclear potential, meson-exchange
            currents and relativistic corrections.
