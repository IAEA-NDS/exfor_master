TITLE      Photon scattering from 12C and 208Pb in the
            delta-region.

METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) detector, 35.6 cm in length and
            25.4 cm in diameter.
ANALYSIS   Direct scattered photon detection.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The standard deviations based on
            the number of counts.
           (EN-ERR) Energy band over which the cross section was
            measured.
COMMENT    The photon scattering cross sections at 115 degree
            for 12C and 208Pb have been measured using
            Bremsstrahlung energies Egamma of 150, 200, 250, 300,
            350, and 400 MeV. Scattered photons having
            energies in the range 0.9E to E were accepted
            by the detector. The measured cross sections are
            much larger than the prediction of a simple model
            relating the scattering cross section at a large
            angle to the forward scattering cross section and
            the form factor for elastic electron scattering.
            This discrepancy was discussed in terms of
            collective effects, inelastic scattering, or
            exchange-current distributions.
