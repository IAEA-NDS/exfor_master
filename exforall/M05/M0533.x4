FACILITY   (LINAC,3BZLUSP)
SAMPLE     Natural UO-2   target   with   172   microgramm/cm**2
            thickness prepared  by electrodeposition on 7 micron
            aluminium backing.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Mica foils.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The  unfolding  of the reaction cross section
            using  the  photon  difference   method   from   the
            experimental  reaction  yield measured using the the
            direct fission fragment counting.
REL-REF    (N,,L.Katz+,J,CJP,29,518,1951) The  photon difference
            method for the  cross  section  unfolding  from  the
            experimental reaction yield.
ERR-ANALYS No information on source of uncertainties.
COMMENT    Experimental results    are    presented    for   the
            electrofission and  photofission  of  U-238  in  the
            energy range  6  to  60  MeV.  The importance of the
            inclusion of  the   Coulomb   corrections   in   the
            calculation of   the   virtual  photon  spectrum  is
            emphasized and the relative E1 contribution  to  the
            electrofission process  has been evaluated using the
            distorted-wave Born-approximation  analysis  of  the
            experimental data.
