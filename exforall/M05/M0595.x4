DETECTOR   (COIN,MWDC,SCIN)
ANALYSIS   The (gamma,p) cross sections leading to the 39K ground
            state were extracted by fitting the measured
            photoproton energy spectra with a calculated spectrum
            containing the (unknown) cross sections and the
            (known) bremsstrahlung spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted are the statistical
            uncertainties combined with those systematic errors
            which vary from run to run. These include
             *  uncertainty in the dead time correction and an
                energy dependent error, which varies from 1.7%
                for Egamma < 151 MeV to 5.4 % at Egamma = 302
                MeV,
             * uncertainty in the correction for nuclear
               interactions of the protons in the detector
               system.
           (ERR-1) systematic uncertainty of about 4% arising
            fromt he uncertainty in the incident photon flux.
CORRECTION The corrections for dead time and for nuclear
            interactions of the protons in the detector system.

COMMENT    The experiment features were taken from the paper of
            REL-REF.
           The differential cross section of the
            40Ca(gamma,p0)39K process has been measured in the
            energy range Egamma = 100 - 300 MeV at laboratory
            angles of 45, 90, and  135 degree. The cross section
            for the (gamma,p) reactions leaving 39K in its ground
            state was extracted from the tip region of the proton
            spectra measured at a series of bremsstrahlung
            end-point energies. The data were compared with a
            distored-wave impulse-approximation calculation based
            on a direct, single-particle knockout mechanism.
