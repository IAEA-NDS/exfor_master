TITLE      40CA(G,P-0)39K REACTION FOR EG = 100 - 300 MEV.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAMIT)

DETECTOR   (COIN,MWDC,SCIN)
ANALYSIS   THE (G,P) CROSS SECTIONS LEADING TO THE 39K GROUND
            STATE WERE EXTRACTED BY FITTING THE MEASURED
            PHOTOPROTON ENERGY SPECTRA WITH A CALCULATED SPECTRUM
            CONTAINING THE (UNKNOWN) CROSS SECTIONS AND THE
            (KNOWN) BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS QUOTED ARE THE STATISTICAL
            UNCERTAINTIES COMBINED WITH THOSE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
            WHICH VARY FROM RUN TO RUN. THESE INCLUDE A 1 % - 5 %
            UNCERTAINTY IN THE DEAD TIME CORRECTION AND AN ENERGY
            DEPENDENT ERROR, WHICH VARIES FROM 1.7 % FOR EG <
            151 MEV TO 5.4 % AT EG = 302 MEV, DUE TO THE
            UNCERTAINTY IN THE CORRECTION FOR NUCLEAR INTERACTIONS
            OF THE PROTONS IN THE DETECTOR SYSTEM. IN ADDITION,
            THERE IS AN OVERALL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY OF ABOUT
            4 % ARISING FROM THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE INCIDENT
            PHOTON FLUX.
CORRECTION THE CORRECTIONS FOR DEAD TIME AND FOR NUCLEAR
            INTERACTIONS OF THE PROTONS IN THE DETECTOR SYSTEM.

COMMENT    THE EXPERIMENT FEATURES WERE TAKEN FROM THE PAPER OF
            REL-REF.
           THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION OF THE 40CA(G,P-0)39K
            PROCESS HAS BEEN MEASURED IN THE ENERGY RANGE EG =
            100 - 300 MEV AT LABORATORY ANGLES OF 45, 90, AND
            135 DEGREE. THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE (G,P)
            REACTIONS LEAVING 39K IN ITS GROUND STATE WAS
            EXTRACTED FROM THE TIP REGION OF THE PROTON
            SPECTRA MEASURED AT A SERIES OF BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            END-POINT ENERGIES. THE DATA WERE COMPARED WITH A
            DISTORED-WAVE IMPULSE-APPROXIMATION CALCULATION BASED
            ON A DIRECT, SINGLE-PARTICLE KNOCKOUT MECHANISM.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
