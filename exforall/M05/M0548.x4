TITLE      PHOTOEMISSION OF PROTONS FROM 4HE IN THE
            DELTA-RESONANCE REGION.
FACILITY   (MICRT,2GERMNZ) 855 MEV ELECTRON MICROTRON MAMI AT
            MAINZ.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) GLASGOW TAGGED PHOTON FACILITY AT THE MAMI
            CONTINUOUS WAVE ACCELERATOR OF MAINZ.
SAMPLE     THE LIQUID HELIUM TARGET CELL WAS MADE OF KAPTON.
            IT HAD A CYLINDRICAL SHAPE WITH AN AXIS LENGTH OF
            102 MM AND A DIAMETER OF 30 MM. ITS EFFECTIVE
            THICKNESS WAS 1.83 X 10**23 NUCLEI/CM**2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,NAICR,SCIN) THE MAINZ 48 CM X 64 CM NAI(TL)
            DETECTOR AND PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) AREA ANALYSIS OF THE PHOTOPROTON ENERGY
            SPECTRA FOR SEPARATION OF REACTION CHANNELS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS. SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
            WERE AMOUNTED TO 6 %.
ADD-RES    DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE QUASIFREE PION
            PHOTOPRODUCTION PROCESSES 4HE(G,P)PI (G + P -> P
            + PI-O AND G + N -> P + PI-).
COMMENT    HIGH RESOLUTION PROTON ENERGY SPECTRA FROM THE
            4HE(G,P) REACTION HAVE BEEN MEASURED WITH THE
            TAGGED PHOTONS IN THE RANGE EG = 130 - 525 MEV
            USING THE LARGE MAINZ NAI(TL) SPECTROMETER AT
            THETA-P-LAB = 37.1 DEGREE. THREE SEPARATE
            REACTION CHANNELS WERE IDENTIFIED, VIZ.

            PHOTODISINTEGRATION VIA TWO-NUCLEON PHOTON
            ABSORPTION PROCESSES AND THE QUASIFREE PION
            PRODUCTION CHANNEL. DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS
            ARE PRESENTED FOR EACH OF THESE CHANNELS AS A
            FUNCTION OF PHOTON ENERGY. THE SUM OF THE
            TWO-NUCLEON PHOTON ABSORPTION AND THE QUASIFREE
            PION PRODUCTION DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS, IN
            THE CM SYSTEM, RESEMBLES THAT OF THE CORRESPONDING
            FREE-NUCLEON DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION WHEN FERMI
            MOTION IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
