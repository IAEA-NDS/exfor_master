SAMPLE     The liquid helium target cell was made of Kapton.  It
            had a cylindrical shape with an axis length  of  102
            mm and a diameter of 30 mm.  Its effective thickness
            was 1.83 x 10**23 nuclei/cm**2.

ADD-RES    Differential cross section  for  the  quasifree  pion

            pi-O and g + n -> p + pi-).
COMMENT    High resolution   proton   energy  spectra  from  the
            4He(gamma,p) reaction have been  measured  with  the
            tagged photons in the range Eg = 130 - 525 MeV using
            the large Mainz NaI(Tl) spectrometer at  theta-p-lab
            = 37.1 degree. Three separate reaction channels were
            identified, viz. 4He(gamma,p)T two-body breakup, 4He
            photodisintegration     via    two-nucleon    photon
            absorption  processes   and   the   quasifree   pion
            production channel.  Differential cross sections are
            presented for each of these channels as  a  function
            of photon energy.  The sum of the two-nucleon photon
            absorption  and  the   quasifree   pion   production
            differential  cross  sections,  in  the  cm  system,
            resembles that  of  the  corresponding  free-nucleon
            differential  cross  section  when  fermi  motion is
            taken into account.
