SAMPLE     The N-14 target consisted of a 4 l metal dewar flask,
            of  inside  diameter  4  in.  filled   with   liquid
            nitrogen.
METHOD     (TOF) Photoneutron    energy    distributions    were
            determined at an angle of 90 degrees to  the  photon
            beam  using conventional time-of-flight system.  The
            photoneutron time-of-flight distributions  from  the
            photodisintegration   of   N-14   were  obtained  at
            bremsstrahlung  end-point  energies  increasing   in
            steps of 2 MeV from 15.5 to 29.5 MeV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 10 in. diameter, 1 in. thick cylinder of
            NE102 plastic scintillator.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The  bremsstrahlung  end-point   energy   was
            increased  in 2 MeV steps from 15.5 to 29.5 MeV.  At
            each energy, photoneutron t-o-f spectra were measured
            from N-14 and from additional deuterium target. Each
            such spectrum was  converted  to  a  neutron  energy
            distribution.  Using  the  information  about photon
            spectrum these energy distributions  were  converted
            into cross section. Since the first excited state in
            N-13  lies  at  energy  2.37  MeV  there  exists  an
            unambiguous  region  in each spectrum extending back
            2.37 MeV from the maximum allowed energy,  which can
            only  be  reached  by  neutrons leaving the residual
            N-13 nucleus in its ground state.  The  ground-state
            cross   section   throughout  this  region  is  then
            obtained simply by  dividing  this  portion  of  the
            neutron  spectrum  by  corresponding  portion of the
            associated photon spectrum. The photon distributions
            were   obtained   by   measuring   the  photoneutron
            distributions  from  deuterium  -   the   difference
            between    spectra   obtained   from   geometrically
            identical targets of heavy  and  light  water.  This
            gave  the possibility for a ratio measurement of the
            90-degrees differential ground-state  cross  section
            for the N-14(g,n0)N-13 reaction relative to H-2(g,n)
            differential cross  section  (Weissman  and  Schultz
            1971).

COMMENT    Photoneutron distributions   from   N-14   have  been
            obtained    by    time-of-flight    methods,     for
            bremsstrahlung  end-point  energies  increasing in 2
            mev steps from 15.5 to 29.5 MeV. A large part of the
            neutron  yield  is  associated  with  the sequential
            decay  of  N-14  to   C-12,   through   well-defined
            intermediate states of C-13, at 7.55, 8.86, and 11.8
            MeV,  which are unstable against  neutron  emission.
            the (g,n0) cross section for neutron emission to the
            ground state of N-13 is found to agree very  closely
            with   the   corresponding   (g,p0)  cross  section,
            implying a high degree of  isospin  purity  for  the
            giant dipole resonance of N-14.  It is observed that
            the decay of the  giant  resonance  proceeds  freely
            through  those  odd-parity excited states of the A =
            13 nuclei which are single hole states formed by the
            removal  of  a p-shell nucleon from the parent N-14.
            the    integrated    cross    section    for     all
            neutron-producing interactions was also found.
