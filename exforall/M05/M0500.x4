SAMPLE     THE N-14 TARGET CONSISTED OF A 4 L METAL DEWAR FLASK,
           OF INSIDE DIAMETER 4 IN. FILLED WITH LIQUID NITROGEN.
METHOD     (TOF) PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS WERE
           DETERMINED AT AN ANGLE OF 90 DEGREES TO THE PHOTON
           BEAM USING CONVENTIONAL TIME-OF-FLIGHT SYSTEM. THE
           PHOTONEUTRON TIME-OF-FLIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF N-14 WERE OBTAINED AT
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT ENERGIES INCREASING IN
           STEPS OF 2 MEV FROM 15.5 TO 29.5 MEV.

ANALYSIS   THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT ENERGY WAS INCREASED IN
           2 MEV STEPS FROM 15.5 TO 29.5 MEV. AT EACH ENERGY,
           PHOTONEUTRON T-O-F SPECTRA WERE MESURED FROM N-14
           AND FROM ADDITIONAL DEUTERIUM TARGET. EACH SUCH
           SPECTRUM WAS CONVERTED TO A NEUTRON ENERGY
           DISTRIBUTION. USING THE INFORMATION ABOUT PHOTON
           SPECTRUM THESE ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS WERE CONVERTED
           INTO CROSS SECTION. SINCE THE FIRST EXCITED STATE IN
           N-13 LIES AT ENERGY 2.37 MEV THERE EXISTS AN
           UNAMBIGIOUS REGION IN EACH SPECTRUM EXTENDING BACK
           2.37 MEV FROM THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED ENERGY, WHICH CAN
           ONLY BE REACHED BY NEUTRONS LEAVING THE RESIDUAL
           N-13 NUCLEUS IN ITS GROUND STATE. THE GROUND-STATE
           CROSS SECTION THROUGHOUT THIS REGION IS THEN OBTAINED
           SIMPLY BY DIVIDING THIS PORTION OF THE NEUTRON
           SPECTRUM BY CORRESPONDING PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED
           PHOTON SPECTRUM. THE PHOTON DISTRIBUTIONS WERE
           OBTAINED BY MEASURING THE PHOTONEUTRON DISTRIBUTIONS
           FROM DEUTERIUM - THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPECTRA
           OBTAINED FROM GEOMETRICALLY IDENTICAL TARGETS OF
           HEAVY AND LIGHT WATER. THIS GAVE THE POSSIBILITY FOR
           A RATIO MEASUREMENT OF THE 90-DEGREES DIFFERENTIAL
           GROUND-STATE CROSS SECTION FOR THE N-14(G,N0)N-13
           REACTION RELATIVE TO H-2(G,N) DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
           SECTION (WEISSMAN AND SCHULTZ 1971).

COMMENT    PHOTONEUTRON DISTRIBUTIONS FROM N-14 HAVE BEEN
           OBTAINED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHODS, FOR BREMSSTRAH-
           LUNG END-POINT ENERGIES INCREASING IN 2 MEV STEPS
           FROM 15.5 TO 29.5 MEV. A LARGE PART OF THE NEUTRON
           YIELD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEQUENTIAL DECAY OF
           N-14 TO C-12, THROUGH WELL-DEFINED INTERMEDIATE
           STATES OF C-13, AT 7.55, 8.86, AND 11.8 MEV, WHICH
           ARE UNSTABLE AGAINST NEUTRON EMISSION. THE (G,N0)
           CROSS SECTION FOR NEUTRON EMISSION TO THE GROUND
           STATE OF N-13 IS FOUND TO AGREE VERY CLOSELY WITH
           THE CORRESPONDING (G,P0) CROSS SECTION, IMPLYING A
           HIGH DEGREE OF ISOSPIN PURITY FOR THE GIANT DIPOLE
           RESONANCE OF N-14. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE DECAY OF
           THE GIANT RESONANCE PROCEEDS FREELY THROUGH THOSE
           ODD-PARITY EXCITED STATES OF THE A = 13 NUCLEI
           WHICH ARE SINGLE HOLE STATES FORMED BY THE REMOVAL
           OF A P-SHELL NUCLEON FROM THE PARENT N-14. THE
           INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION FOR ALL NEUTRON-PRODUCING
           INTERACTIONS WAS ALSO FOUND.
