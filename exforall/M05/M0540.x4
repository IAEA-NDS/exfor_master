TITLE      ABSORPTION OF G-QUANTA BY FERRUM NUCLEI NEAR THE
            GIANT RESONANCE.
AUTHOR     (B.S.DOLBILKIN,A.I.ISAKOV,V.I.KORIN,L.E.LAZAREVA,
            N.V.LINKOVA,B.A.TULUPOV)
INSTITUTE  (4RUSLEB)
REFERENCE  (J,YF,9,675,19690000)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSLEB)
SAMPLE     NATURAL MIXTURE FERRUM SAMPLE, 90 G/CM**2.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (BPAIR) NINE-CHANNEL MAGNETIC PAIR SPECTROMETER.
ANALYSIS   PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS   SECTION   WAS   OBTAINED   BY
            SUBTRACTION OF THE ATOMIC ABSORPTION  CROSS  SECTION
            FROM   THE  MEASURED  SUM  OF  ATOMIC   AND  NUCLEAR
            ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS.
REL-REF    (R,,K.SIEGBAHN,B,SIEGBAHN,,,1955) ATOMIC ABSORPTION
            CROSS SECTION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL    ERRORS    ARE   GIVEN.   NO
            INFORMATION ON -DATA-ERR  AND  +DATA-ERR  VALUES FOR
            INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION DATA.
STATUS     (CURVE) DATA WERE PREPARED IN THE  MSU  INP  CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
COMMENT    THE TOTAL   NUCLEAR   CROSS   SECTION   OF   G-QUANTA
            ABSORPTION IN  FE IN THE ENERGY REGION 10 - 26.5 MEV
            WAS MEASURED   BY   THE   ABSORPTION   METHOD.   THE
            MEASUREMENTS WERE  PERFORMED WITH THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            SPECTRUM OF G-EMISSION (EG-MAX =  260  MEV)  ON  THE
            PIAN SYNCHROTRON.  PHOTONS  WERE   DETECTED   BY   A
            NINE-CHANNEL  MAGNETIC  PAIR  SPECTROMETER  WITH THE
            RESOLUTION ABOUT 1 %.  THE INTEGRAL CROSS SECTION AT
            10 -  26.5  MEV  WAS FOUND TO BE 735 +12 -50 MB*MEV.
            THE INTEGRAL CROSS SECTION AT 10 - 26.5 MEV IS EQUAL
            TO 735   (-50,+120)  AND  EXHAUSTS  ABOUT  65  %  OF
            CLASSICAL DIPOLE SUM RULE VALUE.
