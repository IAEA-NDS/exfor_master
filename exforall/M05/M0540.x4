FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSLEB)
SAMPLE     Natural mixture ferrum sample, 90 g/cm**2.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (BPAIR) Nine-channel magnetic pair spectrometer.
ANALYSIS   Photoabsorption cross   section   was   obtained   by
            subtraction of the atomic absorption  cross  section
            from   the  measured  sum  of  atomic   and  nuclear
            absorption cross sections.
REL-REF    (R,,K.Siegbahn,B,SIEGBAHN,,1955) Atomic absorption
            cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Root-mean-squared  errors  are   given. No
            information on -data-err  and  +data-err  values for
            integrated cross section data.
COMMENT    The total nuclear cross  section   of   gamma-quanta
            absorption in  Fe in the energy region 10 - 26.5 MeV
            was measured   by   the   absorption   method.   The
            measurements were  performed with the bremsstrahlung
            spectrum of gamma-emission (Eg-max=260 MeV)  on  the
            Pian synchrotron.  Photons  were   detected   by   a
            nine-channel  magnetic  pair  spectrometer  with the
            resolution about 1%.  The integral cross section at
            10 -  26.5  MeV  was found to be 735 +12 -50 mb*MeV.
            The integral cross section at 10 - 26.5 MeV is equal
            to 735   (-50,+120)  and  exhausts  about  65%  of
            classical dipole sum rule value.

COMMENT    Because the Fe-56 isotope abundance is 91.7 % the
