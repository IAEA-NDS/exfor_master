TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE 50CR(G,N)49CR CROSS SECTION
            WITH MONOCROMATIC G-RAYS.
FACILITY   (VDG,1CANMON)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(1-H-3(P,G)))
SAMPLE     CHROMIUM METAL SAMPLES WERE USED WITH A PURITY OF
            99.9 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV) RESULTING 49CR POSITRON ACTIVITY
            MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR) DETECTOR CONSISTING OF TWO 7.62 CM X
            7.62 CM NAI(TL) CRYSTALS.
PART-DET   (B+)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT POSITRON ACTIVITY MEASUREMENT.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN. THE
            SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED FOR THE
            FOLLOWING SIURCES:
            - POSITRON DETECTOR ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY     10.0 %;
            - POSITRON DETECTOR RADIAL EFFICIENCY        4.0 %;
            - ANGLE NAI CRYSTAL - PHOTON BEAM            1.5 %;
            - ABSORPTION IN PARAFFIN BETWEEN NAI CRYSTAL
              COLLIMATOR AND TARGET                      2.0 %;
            - SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED BY NAI CRYSTAL
              COLLIMATOR  TO TARGET                      4.0 %;
            - EXTRAPOLATION OF G-RAY SPECTRUM     4.0 - 20.0 %.
COMMENT    THE 50CR(G,N)49CR CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN MEASURED
            OVER THE ENERGY RANGE EG = 20.43 TO EG = 22.22 MEV
            USING MONOCHROMATIC G-RAYS FROM THE 3H(P,G)4HE
            REACTION AND DETECTING THE RESULTING 49CR POSITRON
            ACTIVITY. THE G-RAYS WERE MONITORED BY 12.7 CM X
            15.2 CM NAI(TL) CRYSTAL. THE POSITRON ACTIVITY WAS
            WAS DETERMINED BY A COINCIDENCE DETECTOR CONSISTING
            OF TWO 7.62 CM X 7.62 CM NAI(TL) CRYSTAL SET ON THE
            ANNIHILATION RADIATION PHOTOPEAKS. THE G-RAY ENERGY
            RESOLUTION WAS LESS THAN 110 KEV OVER THE WHOLE
            ENERGY RANGE. STRUCTURE IN THE CROSS SECTION WAS
            NOT OBSERVED.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
