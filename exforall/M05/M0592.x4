TITLE      Measurement of the 50Cr(g,n)49cr cross section
            with monocromatic gamma-rays.
FACILITY   (VDG,1CANMON)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(1-H-3(P,G)))
SAMPLE     Chromium metal samples were used with a purity of
            99.9 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Resulting 49Cr positron activity
            measurement.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR) Detector consisting of two 7.62 cm x
            7.62 cm NaI(Tl) crystals.
PART-DET   (B+)
ANALYSIS   Direct positron activity measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties  for positron detector absolute
            efficiency 10.0 %;
           (ERR-2) Uncertainties  for  positron  detector radial
            efficiency 4.0 %;
           (ERR-3) Uncertainties  for angle NaI crystal - photon
            beam 1.5 %;
           (ERR-4) Uncertainties   for  absorption  in  paraffin
            between NaI crystal collimator and target - 2.0 %;
           (ERR-5) Uncertainties  for  solid  angle subtended by
            NaI crystal collimator to target 4.0 %;
            The systematic  uncertainties  for  extrapolation of
            g-ray spectrum was estimated as 4.0 - 20.0 %.
COMMENT    The 50Cr(g,n)49Cr cross section has been measured
            over the energy range Eg = 20.43 to Eg = 22.22 MeV
            using monochromatic g-rays from the 3H(p,g)4He
            reaction and detecting the resulting 49Cr positron
            activity. The g-rays were monitored by 12.7 cm x
            15.2 cm NaI(Tl) crystal. The positron activity was
            was determined by a coincidence detector consisting
            of two 7.62 cm x 7.62 cm NaI(Tl) crystal set on the
            annihilation radiation photopeaks. The g-ray energy
            resolution was less than 110 keV over the whole
            energy range. structure in the cross section was
            not observed.
