TITLE      Photodisintegration of the deuteron by linearly
            polarised photons.
AUTHOR     (K.-H.KRAUSE,J.SOBOLEWSKI,J.AHRENS,J.M.HENNEBERG,

INSTITUTE  (2GERMPM)
FACILITY   (MICRT) The Mainz race-track microtron.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) The  photon  beam  was  produced  by   tagging
            off-axis  bremsstrahlung  photons  using the tagging
            system of Max Planck Institut fuer Chemie  in  Mainz
            installed at the electron beam. The initial electron
            beam energy of 184 MeV  can  simultaneously  produce
            tagged photons of energy 14 to 144 MeV.
INC-SPECT  The source  of  photons  was  a   quasi-monochromatic
            linearly polarised photon beam.  Tagged photons from
            53  to  71 MeV and 84 to 104 MeV were simultaneously
            provided using a tagging detector  system  based  on
            set of  silicon  surface  barrier detectors (Si(Sb),
            Micron Semiconduvtor MSX5-450-C)  detectors  grouped
            into  two  separate  arrays,  each array contains 16
            detectors mounted in two adjacent parallel rows. The
            detector  width  corresponds to an energy resolution
            of about 1 MeV.  The detectors have sensitive area 5
            x  5  mm**2  and  depletion  layer 450 micro-m.  The
            tagging efficiency was measured with high  precision
            using an NaI detector in coincidence with the Si(Sb)
            tagging   detectors.   The    degree    of    linear
            polarisation,  considerably  enhanced  by  means  of
            kinematic  selection,  was  measured  using  photons
            emitted  from  the resonance excitation of the 15.11
            MeV level (1+) C-12.  The tagging efficiency  values
            TE for different Eg are the following:
                Eg (MeV)    54        60        68        88
                TE (%)   24.35(27) 25.54(26) 27.66(28) 33.78(32)
            In the photon energy range from 50 to  100  MeV  the
            corrresponding   degree   of   linear   polarization
            decreases from 47 to 35 %.
METHOD     (EXTB) Photoprotons were detected  using  a  detector
            system based on an array of Si(Sb) detectors.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 4 silicon surface barrier detectors (Si(Sb)),
            Micron Semiconductor MSX3-450-C, with sensitive area
            1 x 1 cm**2 and depletion  layer  450  micro-m  were
            mounted  on  an  arrangement  of  4  rings,  320  mm
            diameter. The   detectorc   are  arranged  at  seven
            reaction angles (40 - 160 degrees) both parallel and
            perpendicular to the polarisation plane. With regard
            to the target center each of the detectors covers  a
            solid angle   of   about  28  msr  corresponding  to
            delta (theta-p) = +- 5 degree. An energy loss signal
            is provided   because   the  range  of  the  protons
            expected is bigger than the depletion depth  of  the
            detectors.
PART-DET   (P)
SAMPLE     Along the  beam direction the cryotasrget consists of
            three successive cells separated by 2 micron-m Mylar
            foils.  The  two  outer  volumes  are separated from
            vacuum by 100 micro-m Kapton windows. Only the inner
            volume  (84 mm diameter x 10 mm),  the actual target
            cell,  is filled with boiling liquid deuterium.  The
            outer  volumes are connected with the target cell by
            a pressure-compensation  capillary.  The  number  of
            target  nuclei  per  cm**2  was  8.7  x 10**22 (with
            systematic error of +- 2.5 %).
COMMENT    The photodisintegration  of  the  deuteron  has  been
            studied using   a    quasi-monochromatic    linearly
            polarized photon beam at energies of 54, 60, 68, and
            88 MeV.  The photon beam  was  obtained  by  tagging
            off-axis   bremsstrahlung   photons.   The   angular
            distribution  of   the   azimuthal   cross   section
            asymmetry  and  the polarization-independent part of
            the  differential  cross   section   were   measured
            simultaneously  at  seven reaction angles between 40
            and 160 degree.
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Time difference spectra analysis.
