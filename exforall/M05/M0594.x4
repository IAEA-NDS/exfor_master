TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR
            PROCESSES GD -> PN, PI-0D, AND PX IN THE ENERGY
            RANGE OF DIBARION RESONANCES.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNTOK) 1.3 GEV ELECTRON SYNCHROTRON AT THE
            INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR STUDY (INS), UNIVERSITY OF
            TOKIO.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD)
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS LIQUID DEUTERIUM CONTAINED IN A
            CYLINDRICAL VESSEL OF MYLAR. THE TARGET LENGTH WAS
            198 MM WHILE THE DIAMETER WAS 50 MM.
METHOD     (MAGFR,TOF) HADRON SPECTROMETER CONSISRED OF
            LARGE-GAP ANALYZER MAGNET, FOUR SETS OF MULTIWIRE
            PROPORTIONAL CHAMBERS AND THREE SETS OF TRIGGER
            SCINTILLATION COUNTERS.
DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,SCIN)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT REACTION PROTON COUNTING.
CORRECTION VARIOUS CORRECTIONS HAD TO BE APPLIED TO THE DATA:
           - THE LARGEST CORRECTION WAS DUE TO AN INEFFICIENCY
             IN TRACK RECONSTRUCTION: IT WAS ABOUT 10 % FOR
             ANGLES > 20 DEGREE, WHILE IT INCREASED UP TO 20 %
             FOR SMALLER ANGLES;
           - BEAM NORMALIZATION CORRECTION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
             LESS THAN 1 %;
           - LOSS OF OUTGOING PARTICLES MAINLY DUE TO NUCLEAR
             INTERACTIONS WITH TARGET DEUTERIUM: FOR PROTONS
             IT WAS RATHER SMALL, 2 % TO 3 %, WHILE FOR DEUTERONS
             IT AMOUNTED FROM 7 % TO 12 %.
           THE TOTAL RESULTED CORRECTION FACTOR WAS 1.24 TO 1.4.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN. THE TOTAL
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR WAS 15 % AT THE SMALLEST ANGLE,
            WHILE IT WAS 11 % AT OTHER ANGLES.
COMMENT    THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTIONS
            GD -> PN, GD - > PI-0D, AND GD -> PX HAS BEEN
            MEASURED BY USING A TAGGED PHOTON BEAM IN THE ENERGY
            RANGE OF DIBARYON RESONANCES. THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC
            FEATURE OF THE DATA FOR GD -> PN IS A FORWARD
            NONPEAKING ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION. THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN
            COMPLETE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE EXISTING PREDICTIONS
            WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIBARYON RESONANCES. A
            PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS WAS MADE BY SLIGHTLY
            MODIFYING THE MODEL OF THE TOKIO GROUP, BUT NO
            SATISFACTORY RESULTS WAS OBTAINED. THE DATA FOR
            GD -> PI-0D AT LARGE ANGLES SHOW THAT THE
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION DECREASES EXPONENTIALLY
            AS A FUNCTION OF PION ANGLE. A COMPARISON WAS MADE
            WITH A GLAUBER MODEL CALCULATION. THE RESULT SEEMS
            TO BE RATHER IN FAVOR OF THE EXISTANCE OF DIBARYON
            RESONANCES, BUT A CLEAR CONCLUSION WAS NOT POSSIBLE
            BECAUSE OF A LACK OF MORE ACCURATE DATA. IN THE
            PROCESS GD -> PX, A BROAD PEAK DUE TO QUASIFREE PION
            PRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED, BUT THE LIMITATION OF
            EXPERIMENTAL SENSITIVITY DIDN'T ALLOW TO HAVE A
            DEFINITE CONCLUSION FOR THE DIBARYON RESONANCE
            OF MASS 2.23 GEV CONJECTURED BY THE SACLAY GROUP.
