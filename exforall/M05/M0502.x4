TITLE      Fission yields of Bi-209 and Pb-nat nuclei induced by
            photon  beams of 226 mev maximum energy from compton
            backscattered laser light.

INC-SOURCE (LCS)  The    quasimonochromatic     photon     beams
            obtained  by  laser  light  backscattering   against
            high-energy  2.5  GeV  electrons  on  USA  BNL  LEGS
            facility.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABNL) Laser electron gamma source LEGS.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) 100  Microns  thick MACROFOL fission-track-etch
            detectors.
ANALYSIS   The direct fission fragment track counting.
CORRECTION The overall attenuation effect of a typical  300  MeV
            photon  beam  going through the stack has been found
            out to be 1.3 %.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The  total - statistical  plus systematic -
            errors are given.
COMMENT    The yields   of  photofission  reactions  induced  in
            Bi-209 and Pb-nat by quasimonochromatic photon  beam
            of  226  MeV  maximum  energy  have been measured by
            using Makrofol plates  as  solid-state  detector  of
            fission tracks.
