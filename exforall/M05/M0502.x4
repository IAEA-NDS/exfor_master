TITLE      Fission yields of Bi-209 and Pb-nat nuclei induced by
            photon beams of 226 MeV maximum energy from Compton
            backscattered laser light.

REFERENCE  (J,NC/A,105,197,1992)
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The quasimonochromatic photon beams obtained by
           laser light backscattering against high-energy 2.5
           GeV electrons on USA BNL LEGS facility.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABNL) Laser electron gamma source LEGS.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) 100 microns thick MACROFOL fission-track-etch
            detectors.
ANALYSIS   The direct fission fragment track counting.
CORRECTION The overall attenuation effect of a typical 300 MeV
           photon beam going through the stack has been found
           out to be 1.3%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total - statistical plus systematic -
           errors are given.
COMMENT    The yields of photofission reactions induced in
           Bi-209 and Pb-nat by quasimonochromatic photon beam
           of 226 MeV maximum energy have been measured by using
           Makrofol plates as solid-state detector of fission
           tracks.
