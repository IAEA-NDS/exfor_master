INC-SOURCE (COMPT,LASER)  THE  QUASIMONOCHROMATIC  PHOTON   BEAMS
            OBTAINED BY   LASER   LIGHT   BACKSCATTERING  AGAINST
            HIGH-ENERGY  2.5  GEV  ELECTRONS  ON  USA  BNL   LEGS
            FACILITY.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABNL) LASER ELECTRON GAMMA SOURCE LEGS.
SAMPLE     THIN BI-209 AND PB-NAT TARGETS WERE PREPARED BY VACUUM
            EVAPORATION OF  NATURAL  BISMUTH  AND  LEAD METALS ON
            THIN FOILS OF MYLAR OF THICKNESS 1.72  MG/SM**2  USED
            AS SUPPORTS. THE SAMPLE THICKNESS RESULTED TO BE 4.82
            AND  1.92  MICRONS  FOR  BISMUTH  AND  LEAD  TARGETS,
            RESPECTIVELY.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD)  100 MICRONS  THICK  MACROFOL FISSION-TRACK-ETCH
            DETECTORS.
ANALYSIS   THE DIRECT FISSION FRAGMENT TRACK COUNTING.
CORRECTION THE  OVERALL ATTENUATION  EFFECT OF  A TYPICAL 300 MEV
            PHOTON BEAM  GOING  THROUGH  THE   STACK   HAS   BEEN
            FOUND OUT TO BE 1.3 %.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE  TOTAL - STATISTICAL   PLUS   SYSTEMATIC -
            ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
STATUS     (TABLE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
COMMENT    THE YIELDS OF PHOTOFISSION REACTIONS INDUCED IN BI-209
            AND PB-NAT BY QUASIMONOCHROMATIC PHOTON BEAM  OF  226
            MEV MAXIMUM   ENERGY  HAVE  BEEN  MEASURED  BY  USING
            MAKROFOL PLATES AS SOLID-STATE  DETECTOR  OF  FISSION
            TRACKS.
