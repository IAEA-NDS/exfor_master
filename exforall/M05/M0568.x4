TITLE      Analysis of fission and fragmentation events produced
            in Ag and Br nuclei by interaction of bremsstrahlung
            beams in the energy range (1.0 - 5.5) GeV.

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD,PLATE) Nuclear-track emulsion plates ILFORD-K0.
SAMPLE     Nuclear-track emulsion plates ilford-K0 with A
            number of Ag and Br nuclei of about 10**20/cm2.
ANALYSIS   Special technique allowed to register tracks produced
            by fragments with high ionization power only.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about sources of
            uncertainties.
COMMENT    Nuclear emulsion plates Ilford-K0 exposed to (1.0 -
            5.5) GeV bremsstrahlung beams in order to study
            photoinduced break-up of Ar, Br nuclei have been
            processed to produce visible fission tracks for
            track analysis with optical microscope. Track-length
            distributions, angular distributions and angular
            correlations of the produced fragments obtained at
            six end-point bremsstrahlung energies are presented
            and discussed. The analysis of the data shows that
            the recorded events are produced by two different
            reaction mechanisms, namely fission and fragmentation.
            The absolute mean cross section per photon for
            fragmentation, binary and ternary fission of Ag, Br
            targets in the energy range investigated have been
            measured. Absolute mean cross sections per photon and
            corresponding fissilities have been evaluated for
            binary fission of Ag and Br and compared with
            literature data.
