TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC
            POLARIZABILITIES OF THE PROTON.

INSTITUTE  (1USAUI,1CANSAS,4RUSJIA)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,52,2097,95)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANSAS)    300 MEV ELECTRON LINAC COUPLED TO A
            PULSE STRETCHER RING.
SAMPLE     THE SCATTERING TARGET WAS LIQUID HYDROGEN.  THE TARGET
            ASSEMBLY WAS   A   CLOSED-LOOP  RECIRCULATION  SYSTEM
            CONSISTING OF  A  TWO-STAGE  REFRIGERATOR,  A  TARGET
            FLASK AND RESERVOIR,  AND TRANSFER TUBES. THE 0.25-MM
            THICK MYLAR TARGET FLASK WAS A CYLINDER 10.16  CM  IN
            DIAMETER AND ABOUT 13 CM LONG.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     TWO  LARGE-VOLUME  HIGH-RESOLUTION  NAI(TL)
            SPECTROMETERS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)   STATISTICAL   ERRORS   ARE   GIVEN.   THE
            SYSTEMATIC ERRORS  ARE  4.4  %  BELOW  350  MEV,  6 %
            BETWEEN 350 AND 380 MEV, AND 8 % ABOVE.
COMMENT    THE COMPTON SCATTERING CROSS SECTION ON THE PROTON HAS
            BEEN MEASURED AT LABORATORY ANGLES 90 DEGREE AND  135
            DEGREE USING  TAGGED PHOTONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 70 -
            100 MEV AND SIMULTANEOUSLY USING UNTAGGED PHOTONS  IN
            THE RANGE  100 - 148 MEV.  WITH THE AID OF DISPERSION
            RELATIONS, THESE CROSS SECTIONS WERE USED TO  EXTRACT
            THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC POLARIZABILITIES, ALPHA AND
            BETA RESPECTIVELY,  OF  THE  PROTON.  IT WAS OBTAINED
            THAT ALPHA + BETA =  15.0  ((2.9),  (1.1),  (0.4))  x
            10**(-4) FERMI**(-3),    IN    AGREEMENT    WITH    A
            MODEL-INDEPENDENT DISPERSION SUM RULE,  AND  ALPHA  -
            BETA   =   10.8   ((1.1),  (1.4),  1.0))  x  10**(-4)
            FERMI**(-3),  WHERE THE ERRORS SHOWN ARE STATISTICAL,
            SYSTEMATIC, AND MODEL-DEPENDENT, RESPECTIVELY.
STATUS     (TABLE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
