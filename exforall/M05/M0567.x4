TITLE      Probability of ternary fission of 93Nb and natAg
            nuclei induced by (0.8 - 1.8) GeV photons.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD,PLATE) 100 micron thick macrofol polycarbonate
            2pi-forward geometry track detectors.
ANALYSIS    Optical microscopy track number counting after the
             track etching proceeded by usual way (6.25 N NaOH
             etching solution at 70 degree C during 1.hr), and
             scanning of the detector surfaces and the
             measurements of the geometrical quantities of etched
             tracks. Apart from a large number of single etched
             tracks observed, a number of double divergent tracks
             from a point inside the target materials has been
             also observed. These double tracks were related to
             the occurrence of ternary fission.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about sources of

COMMENT    The yields of ternary fission of Nb and Ag nuclei
            induced by bremsstrahlung photons of 0.8, 1.0, 1.4
            and 1.8 GeV end-point energies have been measured by
            using the 2pi-forward geometry with thick target
            metal foils in contact with makrofol polycarbonate
            sheets as fission-track detectors. Absolute mean
            cross sections  per photon in the range (0.8 - 1.8)
            GeV have been obtained as 0.3+-0.3 and 0.5+-0.4
            microbarn, respectively, for Nb and Ag nuclei.
            These  correspond to a probability of ternary
            fission of about 10**(-5) for both nuclei. Results
            were discussed and compared with previous ternary
            fission data obtained for nuclei of A < 90.
