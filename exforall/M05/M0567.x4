TITLE      PROBABILITY OF TERNARY FISSION OF 93NB AND NATPB
            NUCLEI INDUCED BY (0.8 - 1.8) GEV PHOTONS.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERBON) THE BONN 2.5 GEV ELECTRON SYNCHROTRON.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD,PLATE) 100 MICRON THICK MACROFOL POLYCARBONATE
            2PI-FORWARD GEOMETRY TRACK DETECTORS.
SAMPLE     STACKING METAL FOILS OF NIOBIUM (0.058 (0.007) MICRON
            THICKNESS, 0.32 (0.04) X 10**18 NUCLEI/CM**2) AND
            SILVER (0.093 (0.09) MICRON THICKNESS, 0.55 (0.05) X
            10**18/CM**2 NUCLEI/CM**2) TARGET ELEMENTS PLACED IN
            CONTACT WITH SHEETS OF MACROFOL FOILS.
ANALYSIS   OPTICAL MICROSCOPY TRACK NUMBER COUNTING AFTER THE
            TRACK ETCHING PROCEEDED BY USUAL WAY (6.25 N NAOH
            ETCHING SOLUTION AT 70 DEGREE C DURING 1 H), AND
            SCANNING OF THE DETECTOR SURFACES AND THE
            MEASUREMENTS OF THE GEOMETRICAL QUANTITIES OF ETGHED
            TRACKS. APART FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SINGLE ETCHED
            TRACKS OBSERVED, A NUMBER OF DOUBLE DIVERGENT TRACKS
            FROM A POINT INSIDE THE TARGET MATERIALS HAS BEEN
            ALSO OBSERVED. THESE DOUBLE TRACKS WERE RELATED TO
            THE OCCURANCE OF TERNARY FISSION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO INFORMATION ABOUT SOURCES OF
            UNCERTAINTIES.
COMMENT    THE YIELDS OF TERNARY FISSION OF 93NB AND NATAG NUCLEI
            INDUCED BY BREMSSTRAHLUNG PHOTONS OF 0.8, 1.0, 1.4
            AND 1.8 GEV END-POINT ENERGIES HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY
            USING THE 2PI-FORWARD GEOMETRY WITH THICK TARGET
            METAL FOILS IN CONTACT WITH MAKROFOL POLYCARBONATE
            SHEETS AS FISSION-TRACK DETECTORS. ABSOLUTE MEAN
            CROSS SECTIONS  PER PHOTON IN THE RANGE (0.8 - 1.8)
            GEV HAVE BEEN OBTAINED AS O.3 (O.3) AND 0.5 (0.4)
            MICROBARN, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 93NB AND NATAG NUCLEI.
            THESE  CORRESPOND TO A PROBABILITY OF TERNARY
            FISSION OF ABOUT 10**-5 FOR BOTH NUCLEI. RESULTS
            WERE DISCUSSED AND COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS TERNARY
            FISSION DATA OBTAINED FOR NUCLEI OF A < 90.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
