ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error. The statistical uncertainty
            on the individual results was about 2.5%
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty. It mainly stems
            from   the   Compton   normalization  and  from  the
            background subtraction procedure.
COMMENT    Absolute differential cross sections for the forward
            deuteron disintegration have been determined at
            photon laboratory energies between 20 and 100 MeV.
           Several experiments were done in two years.
           The new cm-frame cross sections were in  fair
            agreement with the predictions from recent
            theoretical calculations.
