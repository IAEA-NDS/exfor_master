TITLE      FORWARD PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF THE DEUTERON
            BETWEEN 20 AND 100 MEV PHOTON ENERGY.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2BLGGHT) THE GENT UNIVERSITY ELECTRON
            LINEAR ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (MAGFR) MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 12 CHANNEL DETECTOR ASSEMBLY.
SAMPLE     LIQUID DEUTERIUM TARGET.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS. SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 3 %.
COMMENT    ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE FORWARD
            DEUTERON DISINTEGRATION HAVE BEEN DETERMINED AT
            PHOTON LABORATORY ENERGIES BETWEEN 20 AND 100 MEV.
            THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY ON THE INDIVIDUAL
            RESULTS WAS ABOUT 2.5 %, WHILE THE OVERALL SYSTEMATIC
            ERROR AMOUNTED TO 3 %; THE ANGULAR RESOLUTION EQUALS
            1.5 DEGREE. THE NEW CM-FRAME CROSS SECTIONS WERE IN
            FAIR AGREEMENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS FROM RECENT
            THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
