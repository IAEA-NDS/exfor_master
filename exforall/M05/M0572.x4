TITLE      TWO-NUCLEON PHOTON ABSORPTION ON 3HE IN THE
            DELTA (1232) REGION.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR SAC) THE SACLAY LINAC.
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD)
METHOD     (MAGFR) "700" MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
SAMPLE     THE REACTION TARGET CONSISTED OF LIQUID 3HE IN A
            THIN-WALLED CYLINDRICAL CONTAINER OF DIAMETER 7 CM
            AND HEIGHT 4.5 CM.
           TWO OTHER IDENTICAL VESSELS CONTAINED LIQUID 2H AND
            1H (THE LATTER WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE SMALL
            BACKGROUND CONTRIBUTION).
ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION WERE OBTAINED BY COMPARING THE
            SIMULATED USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PHOTOPROTON
            ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRA.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO INFORMATION ABOUT SOURCES OF
            UNCERTAINTIES.
COMMENT    CROSS SECTIONS WERE DETERMINED IN THE DELTA (1232)
            EXCITATION REGION FOR THE REACTIONS 3HE(G,P)PN AND
            2H(G,P)N AT SEVERAL PHOTON ENERGIES AND PROTON
            EMISSION ANGLES. INCLUSIVE PROTON SPECTRA WERE
            MEASURED WITH A MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER, USING A
            QUASIMONOCHROMATIC E+ - ANNIHILATION PHOTONS. THE
            3HE DATA CAN BE MAINLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY PREDICTIONS
            ASSUMING PHOTON ABSORPTION  BY A PAIR OF NUCLEONS,
            EXCEPT IN THE HIGH-MOMENTUM PARTS OF THE PROTON
            SPECTRA. THEY CLEARLY INDICATE THE NEED FOR
            ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS THREE-BODY
            ABSORPTION MECHANISM.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA FROM THE TABLE 1.
            DATA WERE COMPILED AT THE USA BNL NNDC BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
