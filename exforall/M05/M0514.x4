SAMPLE     The lead target,  containing 91 % of Pb-208 and 7 % of
            Pb-207, had   a   thickness   of   4.38  g/cm**2  for
            messurements in the energy region from 8 to 10.5  MeV
            and  of 2.17 g/cm**2 above 10.5 MeV.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) The reaction yield curve measurement.
DETECTOR   (BF3) 4PI Halpern-type detector.
ANALYSIS   (PLA)  The  yield curve  has been analysed  using  the
            variable bin  Penfold-Leiss  method for cross section
            unfolding together with  the  Thies's  criterion  for
            decorrelation of the cross section errors.

            criterion.
           (N,,L.I.Schiff,J,PR,83,252,1951) The  Schiff's
            integrated-over-angles bremsstrahlung spectral shape.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-root-squared uncertainties.
COMMENT    The  total  photoneutron  cross section  of Pb-208 was
            measured between    8    and   13   MeV   using   the
            bremsstrahlung photon facility  from  35  MeV  linac.
            Considerable resonance  structure was observed in the
            cross section,  of which the peak around  9  MeV,  as
            well as  the  structure around 10.8 mev may be due to
            E2 excitations.
