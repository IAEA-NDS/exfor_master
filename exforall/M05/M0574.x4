ANALYSIS   Optical microscopy track number counting after the
            track etching procedures in order to make fission
            tracks visible for track analysis under optical
            microscopy.
           The Cr-39 plates were submitted to a 6.25 n NaOH
            etching at 60 C degree during two or three periods
            of 1 hr each.
           In the case of makrofol sheets a 6.25 n NaOH etching
            solution was used, this time at 70 C degree during
            three periods of 20 min each.

COMMENT    A research on ternary fission of Al, Ti, Co, and Zr
            nuclei induced by bremsstrahlung photons of 0.8, 1.0,
            1.4, and 1.8 GeV end-point energies has been carried
            out using makrofol polycarbonate and Cr-39 polymer as
            fission-track detectors. Thick target metal foils
            were used in contact with the plastic detectors. From
            the observation and analysis of double divergent,
            etched fission tracks from a common point inside the
            target the number of events of ternary fission has
            been evaluated. Absolute mean cross sections per
            photon of ternary fission in the range (0.8 - 1.8)
            GeV have been obtained as 0.3+-0.7, 1.7+-1.5,
             0.5+-0.5, and 1+-1 microbarn, respectively, for Al,
            Ti, Co, and Zr nuclei. A probability of ternary
            fission of about 10**4 has been deduced. Results are
            discussed and compared with other ternary fission
            data.
