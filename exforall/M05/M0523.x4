TITLE      SIMULTANEOUS  MEASUREMENT  OF  THE  (G,P)/(G,N)  CROSS
            SECTION RATIO IN  HE-4 AS A TEST OF CHARGE SYMMETRY.

INSTITUTE  (1CANSAS,1USALAS)
REFERENCE  (J,PRL,72,3476,94)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANSAS)    300 MEV ELECTRON LINAC COUPLED TO A
            PULSE STRETCHER RING.
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) ELECTRON TAGGED BREMSSTRAHLUNG.
SAMPLE      A  SEALED  TARGET  CHAMBER LOCATED ABOUT 3 DOWNSTREAM
            FROM THE    BEAM    RADIATOR    WAS    FILLED    WITH
            HELIUM/HYDROGEN  (85  %  /15  %)  GAS MIXTURE AT ROOM
            TEMPERATURE AT EITHER 20.0 OR 53.3 KPA PRESSURE.
FLAG       (1.) DATA FOR LOW PRESSURE 20.0 KPA.
METHOD     (REC,EDE) THE  H-3  AND  HE-3  RECOILS  DISTINGUISHING
            BY STANDARD  PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES BASED
            ON ENERGY LOSS IN 2 ELEMENTS EDE TELESCOPES.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,SOLST)  EACH  OF  4  IDENTICAL  EDE  TELESCOPES
            CONSISTS OF A  GAS  PROPORTIONAL  COUNTER  AND  THICK
            SOLID STATE DETECTOR.

            AVAILABLE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION DATA.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)   STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
COMMENT    THE (G,P) AND (G,N) DIFFERENTIAL YIELDS  AT  90 DEGREE
            HAVE BEEN MEASURED FOR  TWO-BODY  PHOTODISINTEGRATION
            OF HE-4  USING  TAGGED PHOTONS OF ENERGY EG = 25 - 60
            MEV. DATA   FOR   BOTH   CHANNELS    WERE    OBTAINED
            SIMULTANEOUSLY USING  WINDOWLESS  EDE  TELESCOPES  TO
            DETECT THE  H-3  AND  HE-3  RECOILS.  THE  RATIO   OF
            ANGLE-INTEGRATED YIELDS   WHICH   IS  INSENSITIVE  TO
            SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES DUE TO THE  SIMULTANEITY  OF
            THE MEASUREMENTS,  AGREES WITH CALCULATIONS EMPLOYING
            ONLY CHARGE-SYMMETRIC  NUCLEAR  INTERACTIONS.  WITHIN
            THE PRESENT  ERRORS  THE  DATA  SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF A
            SIGNIFICANT CHARGE-SYMMETRY  VIOLATION  IN  HE-4   IN
            ENERGY RANGE STUDIED.
STATUS     (CURVE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
