TITLE       U-238(N,2N)U-237 reaction cross-section induced by
            the Cf-252 spontaneous-fission neutrons

METHOD     (ACTIV)  Gamma spectra measurements were started after
           1 day cooling .
DETECTOR   (GELI) For U-237 gamma activity.
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber with U-238-F(4) layer was
           used for neutron flux in case of activation by two Cf
           sources.
            In case of activation by three Cf sources the neutron
           flux was defined by Na-24 accumulation in
           Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24 reaction.

           article. Value of Maxwellian spectrum temperature
           T=1.42 Mev was used by compiler in compilation.
CORRECTION For sample self-absorption, for geometry and other
           factors.
