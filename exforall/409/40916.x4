             Neutron emission spectrum
SAMPLE      Hollow metallic cylinder containing  0.727 moles
            of Th-232.
            Carbon  hollow cylinder of outer diameter 3.0 cm,

            13.27 moles of C-12.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)6-C-0(N,EL)6-C-0,,DA)
             Th-232 neutron emission differential spectrum was
             defined by normalization to carbon elastic spectrum
             measured at 90 degrees.

ANALYSIS   (4PI1A)
            After subtraction of elastic scattering component,
           spectra were analyzed in energy range 2-10 MeV, where
           there are only fissions neutrons.

           INDC(UK)-23/L, Harwell. See ADD-RES.
ADD-RES     Approximation by Maxwell spectrum as
            N(E)=A*sqrt(E)*exp(-E/T) , A=0.151+-0.006 MeV**-1.5,
             T=1.27+-0.04 MeV .
           Ratio of neutrons emitted at 150 deg to neutrons
           emitted at 90 degrees was defined to be 1.004+-0.04 -
           value agrees with value of S.Nair+.
CRITIQUE   Of compiler M.M.
           Spectrum given in table of J,YK agrees with data of
           Fig.2 (at 90 deg, B/MEV/SR) of J,YK multiplied by 4PI.
           But integration of spectrum (given in table of J,YK)
           leads to the integral value 0.755 b, what is 10 times
           higher than fission c-s ( 0.077 b, A.D.Carlsson, 1982),
           and higher than neutron emission c-s defined in this
           experiment to be 0.185+-0.021 b (see Subent 003).
           Also there are disagreements (and misprints ) in given
           values of carbon monitor:
           in J,YK,1986,(3),34           - dif.el.c-s 0.2033  b/sr
           in MONIT-REF R,INDC-36,1981   - el.c-s     0.2033+1 b
           in J,AE,71,67,1991            - dif.el.c-s 0.152    sr
            In the article J,AE,71,(1),67,1991  :
           Fig.1 data are 10 times lower than Fig. 2 of J,YK,
           Fig.2 data are 10 times lower than 410916.002.
           Conclusion:
           1) data of Table of J,YK have to be divided
           by factor 10. according to Fig.2 of J,AE,67,
           2) carbon monitor c-s is 0.152 b/sr .
