TITLE       Total neutron cross-sections measurements
            for Gd-152 and Gd-153 (half-life 242 days)
AUTHOR     (V.A.Anufriev,S.I.Babich,S.M.Masyanov)
REFERENCE  (C,87KIEV,2,225,1987) Table of the resonance
                parameters is given
INSTITUTE  (4RUSNIR)
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSNIR)  Reactor SM-2 .
            Mechanical chopper.
METHOD     (TOF,TRN) Flight base is 91.76 m
DETECTOR   (PROPC) He-3-filled proportional counters

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE,SLA) Single-level Breit-Wigner formula was used
           for transmission spectra analysis.
SAMPLE      Four samples of various thicknesses were used
ADD-RES      Effective burn-up cross sections were determined for
            Gd--152 - 680+-200 b, for Gd-153 -  22000 b.
