MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
            U-235 c-s was used to check spectrometer resolution
           function approximation by Pearson distribution with
           parameters a=1.65, a0=0.978, w=0.101, mu=0.82 obtained
           by the resonances of Np-237 subbarrier fission in
           energy range 26-60 eV.
            U-235 fission cross-section from ENDF/B-V was
           smoothed by spectrometer resolution function and
           compared with measured point-wise c-s in
           4.65 eV -2.5 keV energy range
           - average deviation 5 %.
            Also U-235 average fission c-s (from experimental)
           was compared with BNAB-78 group c-s - deviation < 3.%.
