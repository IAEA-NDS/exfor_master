            Details of Monte-Carlo calculations of slowing-down
           spectrometer characteristics.
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSKUR) Accelerator 'FAKEL' (TORCH). Electron
           energy 50 MeV, pulse duration 50 nsec, frequency 275Hz.
            Tungsten converter cooled by compressed air.
INC-SPECT   Neutron beam was measured by Li-6(n,a)H-3 reaction
           using LiF layer on Ni foil of thickness < 1 microm.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Avalanche-type counters .
            Ni electrodes of 1 microm thickness, 2.5 cm**2 working
           square, 2 mm distance between electrodes, filled by
            heptane to pressure 20 Torr.
           Channel wide of 50 nsec, dead time 1.5 microsec.
METHOD     (SLODT) Neutron slowing-down time in lead (99.99%) cube
            of 1.6m size.
SAMPLE      High purity samples.
ANALYSIS    U-235 c-s was used to check spectrometer resolution
           function approximation by Pearson distribution with
           parameters a=1.65, a0=0.978, w=0.101, mu=0.82 obtained
           by the resonances of Np-237 subbarrier fission in
           energy range 26-60 eV.
            U-235 fission cross-section from ENDF/B-V was
           smoothed by spectrometer resolution function and
           compared with measured point-wise c-s in
           4.65 eV -2.5 keV energy range
           - average deviation 5 %.
            Also U-235 average fission c-s (from experimental)
           was compared with BNAB-78 group c-s - deviation < 3.%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from the reference, Table 2.
