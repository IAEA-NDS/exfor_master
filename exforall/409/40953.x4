TITLE       Polarization and angular correlation in the
            Sn-117(n,gamma) Reaction near the 1.33 eV p-wave
            resonance
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB) Fast Pulse Reactor IBR-30
SAMPLE      Enriched tin, Sn-117 content is 92%  , weight
            from 8 to 400 gram
METHOD     (TOF) 35 m and 58 m flight paths.
            TOF spectra were registered with 8.5 MeV threshold.
            Amplitude spectra were also measured in 3.5-10 MeV
           region in 8 time windows.
           Background was determined by Sn sample and black boron
           filter as well as with an equivalent scatterer in the
           place of sample.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,REAC) Polarized neutrons.
           Polarizer was installed at 32 m distance from reactor
           core. Neutron polarization 0.5 - 0.6 .
           Polarization reversal was made each 40 sec.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal of 200 mm diameter, 200 mm
            thick. As gamma detector.
PART-DET   (G)
MONITOR     No Information
CORRECTION  For background.
COMMENT    . All measurements are made for gamma-energy 9.32 MeV
