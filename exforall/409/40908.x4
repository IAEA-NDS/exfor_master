DECAY-DATA (79-AU-198-M,2.30D) 811.7 keV gamma-line was not used
           for C-S calculation due to very low it's intensity.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Experimental Au-198-G decay curve was compared
           with theoretical calculation, taking into account
           decay of Au-198-M isomeric state and using results of
           V.K.Maydanyuk+, see REL-REF.
