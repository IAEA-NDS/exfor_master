MONITOR     Absolute measurements of the cross-sections ratio.
           Energy normalization of cross-section ratio was done by
           method of isotopes admixtures; normalization
           coefficients were defined from ratios U6/U8 measured by
           highly enriched samples and samples with other isotopes
           admixtures to be
           1.142+-0.008, 1.157+-0.008, 1.138+-0.008 for energies
           7.34 MeV,     8.10 MeV,     8.91 MeV, respectively.
