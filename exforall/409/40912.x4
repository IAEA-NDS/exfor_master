           (20111021A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
            Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
            BIB information  was added.
            Subent 002 was superseded.
           (20160602U) SD: Year of the ref. 85SANTA corrected :
           1986 -> 1985.
           (20170710U) M.M. Previous correction of SD was
           checked at CJD.
            COREL was deleted for 40888002, 40913002,40921002,
            40831003, 40861004 acording to a comment of N.Otsuka

COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. 20111021. Source of data is not clear,
            probably from authors. Subent is superseded by newer
            publication, data differs only in one first point
            (errors values).
