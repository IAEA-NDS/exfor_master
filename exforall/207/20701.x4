             PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION.
AUTHOR     (K.KOBAYASHI,Y.FUJITA,T.OOSAKI,R.C.BLOCK)
TITLE      -NEUTRON TOTAL CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT OF THORIUM
            AVERAGED NEAR 24 KEV WITH AN FE-FILTERED BEAM-
FACILITY   (LINAC)   46 MEV ELECTRON LINAC OF THE RESEARCH
            REACTOR INSTITUTE FROM KYOTO UNIVERSITY.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)   WATER COOLED PHOTONEUTRON TARGET MADE OF
            TANTALUM PLATES WITH A 5 CM THICK POLYETHYLENE
            MODERATOR.
           .A PURE IRON FILTER OF 30 CM THICKNESS WAS USED FOR
            FILTERING THE NEUTRON BEAM.
INC-SPECT  .IRON FILTERED NEUTRON SPECTRUM PEAKED AT 24.3 KEV
            WITH AN ENERGY WIDTH OF ABOUT 2 KEV.
SAMPLE     .SIX THORIUM METALIC PLATES OF DIFFERENT THICKNES
            WERE USED RANGING FROM 0.0273 TO 0.1551 ATOMS/BARN.
METHOD     (TOF  )  22.2 M FLIGHT PATH.
           .IRON FILTERED BEAM.
           .TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    FOR NEUTRON DETECTION A BARE 12.7 CM
            DIAM. BY 5.08 CM THICK NAI(TL) CRYSTAL WAS USED.
           (GLASD)    A LI-6 GLASS SCINTILLATOR WAS USED FOR
            DETERMINING INTERFERENCE EFFECTS IN RESONANCE CROSS
            SECTIONS BETWEEN IODINE IN DETECTOR AND THORIUM
            SAMPLE.
           (PROPC)   A BF3 PROPORTIONAL COUNTER WAS USED FOR
            MONITORING THE NEUTRON INTENSITY.
ANALYSIS   .CROSS SECTION OBTAINED BY EXTRAPOLATIONS OF
            TRANSMISSION FACTOR TO ZERO SAMPLE THICKNESS.
COMMENT    .CROSS SECTION MEASURED WITH GREAT ACCURACITY.
           .CALCULATIONS OF POTENTIAL AND RESONANCE CROSS
            SECTIONS WERE MADE WITH DATA TAKEN FROM LITERATURE,
            SEE DETAILS IN REFERENCE.
           .RECOMENDED AVERAGE PARAMETERS ARE GIVEN.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM TABLE 3 OF REFERENCE.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND,DEAD TIME CORRECTIONS IN TIME ANALYZER.
           .AIR SCATTERING CORRECTIONS OF NEUTRONS IN THE
            FLIGHT PATH.
ERR-ANALYS .EXPERIMENTAL ERROR IS MAINLY STATISTICAL,THE OTHER
            ERRORS ARE SMALL ONES DUE TO WEIGHT AND THICKNESS
            VARIATIONS IN SAMPLES AND THE METHOD OF DETERMINING
            THE BACKGROUND.
