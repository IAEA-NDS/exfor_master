TITLE       Neutron capture and total cross-section measurements
            on fast reactor structural materials
FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK HAR) 45 MeV electron Linac with an electron
            burst length of 150 ns and a repetition frequency of
            192Hz for the capture experiment.
           (SYNCY,2UK HAR) 160MeV synchrocyclotron (75Kiev) at
            3-10ns pulse width for the total cross-section
            experiment.
INC-SOURCE (EVAP) The synchrocyclotron protons were fired into
            a thick tungsten target. The fast neutrons were
            moderated in an adjacent volume of water 25mm in
            thickness.
           .For the Linac measurements a neutron booster source
            was employed. See M.J.Poole and E.R.Wiblin,proc.

SAMPLE     .The samples were based at 13m from the neutron
            source in the total cross section experiment.
           .The capture samples were placed inside the liquid
            scintillator tank.
METHOD     (TOF,TRN) Time-of-flight method, transmission
            measurements. For specific details of the experiments,
            regarding detector calibration, background reduction,
            beam filtering etc. See Gayther's private
            communication.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE110 plastic scintillator coupled to a low
            noise photomultiplier (RCA type 4522) at flight
            paths 50 and 100 m used in the total cross-section
            measurement.
           .A large liquid scintillator with an efficiency of
            nearly 100% (230 l of NE211), viewed by 12
            photomultipliers, was used in the capture measurement.
            A detailed description is given in Gayther's private
            communication. It was placed at 97.5m flight path.
           (MOXR) The Moxon-Rae detector was used at 32m flight
            path in the low energy part of the capture
            measurement. Its nominal TOF-resolution was 5 ns/m.
ANALYSIS   (MLA) For both capture and total data.
           (AREA) Additionally for transmission data.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG) Normalization at low energies.
           (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) Normalization at high energies.
           .The total measurement was a transmission.
CORRECTION .For background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) .Relative uncertainties in liquid
            scintillator efficiencies was 10%.
           .Absolute uncertainty was larger but unspecified.
