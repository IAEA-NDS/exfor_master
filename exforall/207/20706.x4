TITLE      -NEUTRON CAPTURE AND TOTAL CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENTS
            ON FAST REACTOR STRUCTURAL MATERIALS-
FACILITY   (LINAC) 45MEV ELECTRON LINAC WITH AN ELECTRON BURST
            LENGTH OF 150NS AND A REPETITION FREQUENCY OF 192HZ
            FOR THE CAPTURE EXPERIMENT.
           (SYNCY) 160MEV SYNCHROCYCLOTRON (S.75KIEV) AT 3-10NS
            PULSE WIDTH FOR THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION EXPERIMENT.
INC-SOURCE (EVAP ) THE SYNCHROCYCLOTRON PROTONS WERE FIRED INTO
            A THICK TUNGSTEN TARGET.THE FAST NEUTRONS WERE
            MODERATED IN AN ADJACENT VOLUME OF WATER 25MM IN
            THICKNESS.
           .FOR THE LINAC MEASUREMENTS A NEUTRON BOOSTER SOURCE
            WAS EMPLOYED.SEE M.J.POOLE AND E.R.WIBLIN,PROC.
            SECOND CONF. ON PEACEFUL USES OF ATOMIC ENERGY 14
            (1958) 266.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE BASED AT 13M FROM THE NEUTRON
            SOURCE IN THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION EXPERIMENT.
           .THE CAPTURE SAMPLES WERE PLACED INSIDE THE LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR TANK.
METHOD     (TOF  ) FOR SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTS,
            REGARDING DETECTOR CALIBRATION, BACKGROUND REDUCTION,
            BEAM FILTERING ETC. SEE GAYTHERS PRIVATE
            COMMUNICATION.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) NE110 PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR COUPLED TO A LOW
            NOISE PHOTOMULTIPLIER (RCA TYPE 4522) AT FLIGHT
            PATHS 50 AND 100M USED IN THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION
            MEASUREMENT.
           .A LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR WITH AN EFFICIENCY OF
            NEARLY 100PC (230L OF NE211), VIEWED BY 12
            PHOTOMULTIPLIERS, WAS USED IN THE CAPTURE MEASURMENT.
            A DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN IN GAYTHERS PRIVATE
            COMMUNICATION.IT WAS PLACED AT 97.5M FLIGHT PATH.
           (MOXR ) THE MOXON-RAE DETECTOR WAS USED AT 32M FLIGHT
            PATH IN THE LOW ENERGY PART OF THE CAPTURE
            MEASUREMENT.ITS NOMINAL TOF-RESOLUTION WAS 5NS/M.
