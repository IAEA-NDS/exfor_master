TITLE      -NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS-SECTION RATIOS OF PU-240 AND
            PU-242 VERSUS AU-197 IN THE ENERGY RANGE FROM 50
            TO 250 KEV-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) KARLSRUHE 3 MV PULSED ACCELERATOR PROVIDED
            PROTONS WITH PULSE WIDTH OF 700 PSEC,WITH A REPETITION
            RATE OF 5 MHZ,WITH AN AVERAGE CURRENT OF 15 MICROA.
           .THE PROTON ENERGY WAS CHOSEN 100 KEV ABOVE THE
            N-SOURCE REACTION THRESHOLD AT 1019 KEV.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) THE WATER-COOLED NEUTRON TARGET CONSISTED OF
            A TRITIUM LOADED TITANIUM LAYER(12.5MM DIAM,2.1MICRON
            THICK),EVAPORATED ONTO A 0.3 MM THICK TUNGSTEN
            BACKING AND PROTECTED BY AN EVAPORATED LAYER OF
            50 MICROGRAMS/CM**2 ALUMINIUM.
           .THE SPECIFIC TARGET ACTIVITY WAS 0.8 CI/CM2.
           .THE ENERGY RANGE OF NEUTRONS WAS UP TO 250 KEV.
           .ALL NEUTRONS WERE EMITTED FROM THE TARGET INTO A
            CONE IN FORWARD DIRECTION WITH AN OPENING ANGLE
            OF 120 DEGREES.

METHOD     (TOF  ) WITH KINEMATICALLY COLLIMATED NEUTRONS DUE TO
            THE CENTER-OF-MASS MOVEMENT OF THE COMPOUND NUCLEUS.
           .THE FLIGHT PATH WAS 65 MM LONG.
           .A SET OF FOUR SAMPLES WERE MOUNTED ON A SAMPLE CHANGER
            AND CYCLED AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE MEASURING POSITION.
            THE CYCLE TIME WAS DETERMINED BY INTEGRATING THE BEAM
            CURRENT TO A PRESELECTED CHARGE.
           .A DUMMY SAMPLE WAS USED TO CORRECT FOR BACKGROUND
            EVENTS AND A U-235 SAMPLE SERVED FOR NORMALIZATION
            OF THE FISSION CORRECTION.
           .THE CAPTURE CROSS-SECTION RATIOS OF PU VERSUS AU-197
            HAVE BEEN MEASURED TWICE FOR EACH ISOTOPE.IN THE
            FIRST MEASUREMENT A METALLIC AU-197 DISC WAS USED
            WHILE IN THE SECOND ONE IT WAS CANNED IN A
            POLYETHYLENE FOIL TO AVOID AGAINST NEUTRON SCATTERING
            IN THE ENVELOPE OF PU SAMPLES.
