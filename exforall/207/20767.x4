TITLE      -Neutron capture cross-section ratios of Pu-240 and
            Pu-242 versus Au-197 in the energy range from 50
            to 250 keV-
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) Karlsruhe 3 MV pulsed accelerator
           provided  protons with pulse width of 700 psec,with a
           repetition  rate of 5 MHz,with an average current of
           15 microA.  The proton energy was chosen 100 keV
           above the  n-source reaction threshold at 1019 keV.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) The water-cooled neutron target consisted of
            a tritium loaded titanium layer(12.5mm diam,2.1micron
            thick),evaporated onto a 0.3 mm thick tungsten
            backing and protected by an evaporated layer of
            50 micrograms/cm**2 aluminium.
           .The specific target activity was 0.8 Ci/cm2.
           .the energy range of neutrons was up to 250 keV.
           .All neutrons were emitted from the target into a
            cone in forward direction with an opening angle
            of 120 degrees.

METHOD     (TOF  ) With kinematically collimated neutrons due to
            the center-of-mass movement of the compound nucleus.
           .The flight path was 65 mm long.
           .A set of four samples were mounted on a sample changer
            and cycled automatically into the measuring position.
            The cycle time was determined by integrating the beam
            current to a preselected charge.
           .A dummy sample was used to correct for background
            events and a U-235 sample served for normalization
            of the fission correction.
           .The capture cross-section ratios of Pu versus Au-197
            have been measured twice for each isotope.In the
            first measurement a metallic Au-197 disc was used
            while in the second one it was canned in a
            polyethylene foil to avoid against neutron scattering
            in the envelope of Pu samples.
           .The parameters of the individual measurements are
            as follows,I to IV runs for 1st meas,V and VI for 2nd,

DETECTOR   (MOXR ) With a 25 mm thick graphite converter used for
            registration of gamma-rays from capture and fission
            events
           (SCIN ) fission neutron detector using a NE-213
            liquid scintillator with pulse-shape discriminator
            equipment,used to correct data for fission events.
           .Both detectors were shielded with lead and were
            located at backward angles of 120 deg with respect
            to the beam axis.They were completely outside the
            neutron cone.
ANALYSIS   .See NSE,66.
COMMENT    .Curves were given too.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Authors made a comparison with other
            experimental or evaluated data.Discrepancy were found
            with ENDF/B-IV evaluation files.
FLAG       (1.) Data refer to the first measurement.
           (2.) Data refer to the second measurement.
CORRECTION .Corrected for multiple scattering,self shielding,
            time spread,time-dependant and constant background,
            fission events in the Pu samples,and neutron beam
            intensity.
           .The assumption that the shape of the capture gamma-
            ray spectra of the heavy nuclei from Au-197 to
            Am-241 do not differ too much has been shown to
            be wrong and the authors have therefor sent new
            correction factors as private communication. Data
            have been recalculated using these factors.
