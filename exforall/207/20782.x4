TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON BINDING ENERGY OF THE
            DELAYED NEUTRON EMITTER XE-137 -
FACILITY   .ILL HIGH FLUX REACTOR IN GRENOBLE.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) VERY PURE THERMAL BEAM WITH A FLUX OF ABOUT
            10**9 N/CM2.5,COLLIMATED TO A 2CM DIAM.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLE OF XE GAS ENRICHED TO 91.2 PC IN XE-136,
            CONTAINED IN A 3X3X1 CM3 BUBBLE MADE OF 4 MG/CM2
            AL FOIL AND PLACED IN THE N-BEAM.
METHOD     (SITA )
           .TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS.
           .TWO BACKGROUND RUNS WITH EMPTY GAS CONTAINERS MADE
            AS WELL AS RUNS WITH NATURAL XE GAS AND ENERGY
            CALIBRATION RUNS USING A CO-56 SOURCE.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE GAS CONTAINER WAS VIEWED BY A 80 CM3
            GE(LI) DETECTOR THROUGH A 15 CM LONG LEAD COLLIMATOR.
ANALYSIS   .EVALUATION OF GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA.
COMMENT    .BINDING ENERGY WAS DEDUCED FROM THE SPECTRUM AND
            DETERMINED TO 4025.2+-0.6 KEV.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM ZP/A 281.
HISTORY    (780428C)
           (781213E)
CORRECTION .DATA CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND.
ERR-ANALYS .ERRORS ARE +-10 PERCENT.
