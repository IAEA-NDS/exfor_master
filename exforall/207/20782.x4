INSTITUTE  (2FR ILL,2SWDSWR)
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) ILL high flux reactor in Grenoble.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) Very pure thermal beam with a flux of about
            10**9 n/cm2.5, collimated to a 2cm diam.
SAMPLE      Sample of Xe gas enriched to 91.2 pc in Xe-136,
            contained in a 3x3x1 cm3 bubble made of 4 mg/cm2
            Al foil and placed in the n-beam.
METHOD     (SITA,TRN)
            Transmission measurements.
            Two background runs with empty gas containers made
            as well as runs with natural Xe gas and energy
            calibration runs using a Co-56 source.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) The gas container was viewed by a 80 cm3
            Ge(Li) detector through a 15 cm long lead collimator.
ANALYSIS    Evaluation of gamma-ray spectra.
COMMENT     Binding energy was deduced from the spectrum and
            determined to 4025.2+-0.6 keV.
CORRECTION  Data corrected for background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainty

REACTION   (54-XE-136(N,G)54-XE-137,,SPC)
ANALYSIS   An extra calibration point at low energy was provided
           by the 455.490keV line following the decay of 137Xe.
           This decay reaches equilibrium with the neutron
           capture rate within a few minutes of irradiation. The
           intensities of the neutron capture lines could thus
           be normalized using the known intensity of 32%/decay
           for the 455.490 keV line.
