           .THE FIRST TWO AND THE LAST ONE ARE FROM ATOMINSTITUT
            DER OSTERREICHISCHEN HOCHSCHULEN IN WIEN,WHILE THE
            OTHERS ARE FROM INSTITUT FUR PHYSIK DER UNIVERSITAT

TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF SCATTERING LENGTHS AND MAGNETIC SPIN
            ROTATIONS BY NEUTRONS INTERFEROMETRY-
FACILITY   .EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT A RADIAL BEAM HOLE
            OF THE HIGH FLUX 250KW TRIGA REACTOR IN THE L-L INST.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) 34.5 MIN OF ARC COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM FROM
            ILL REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .FIVE 6*3*1 CM3 SAMPLES OF HIGH PURITY NATURAL ELEMENT
            WERE USED CONSTITUTED BY SN(99.9995),AL(99.996),V
            (99.95),BI(99.9995),NB(99.99) RESPECTIVELY.
METHOD     .PERFECT CRYSTAL INTERFEROMETRY USING DYNAMICAL
            DIFFRACTION THEORY PROPERTIES,OF A MONOCHROMATIC
            COHERENT SLOW NEUTRON BEAM.
           .A (200)-REFLECTION OF AN ORIENTED GRAPHITE
            MONOCHROMATOR WITH A MOSAIC SPREAD OF 3DEG,WAS USED
            IN A FIRST ARRANGEMENT GIVING A DISPERSION PARAMETER
            TAN(TETHA1)/(TAN(TETHA2)=1.954,THEN A MONOCHROMATIC
            NEUTRON BEAM WAS COLLIMATED WITHIN 16.5 MIN OF ARC.
           .A PERFECT SILICON CRYSTAL WAS CUT AND POLISHED TO
            GIVE THE E-SHAPED LAUE-TYPE INTERFEROMETER WITH A
            SYMMETRICAL (220)-REFLECTION.THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
            THE THREE CRYSTAL PLATES WERE 27.2936+-0.0009 MM,AND
            THEIR THICKNESSES WERE 4.3954+-0.0008 MM (WITHIN A
            HORIZONTAL PLANE).
           .THE INTERFEROMETER COULD BE ROTATED BY A SUITABLE
            GONIOMETER WITH A 0.5 SEC OF ARC ACCURACY.
           .THE WIDTH OF THE INTERF.ROCKING CURVE WAS 27MIN ARC.
           .BEHIND THE INTERFEROMETER,DEVIATED AND FORWARD BEAMS
            WERE COLLIMATED WITHIN 27.5 MIN OF ARC,AND REACHED
            EACH A HE-3 TYPE DETECTOR WITH A VERTICAL DIVERGENCY
            OF 45 MIN.
           .SAMPLES OF SHIFTING MATERIAL WERE PLACED BETWEEN TWO
            OF THE CRYSTAL PLATES.
           .CONTINUOUS VARIATION OF THE PHASE SHIFT WAS OBTAINED
            BY ROTATING THE SAMPLE WITHIN THE E-TYPE CRYSTAL.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) HE-3 DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   .EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WERE FITTED TO A CURVE A+B*COS(C)
            WHERE C CONTAINED REFRACTIVE INDEX,NUMBER OF NUCLEI
            PER UNIT VOLUME AND THE BOUND COHERENT SCATTERING
            LENGTH.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM 76LOWELL.
HISTORY    (780301C)
           (780705E)
CORRECTION .VARIOUS SHIELDINGS AROUND THE INTERFEROMETER PART
            INHIBITED TEMPERATURE INHOMOGENEITIES WITHIN THE
            CRYSTAL.
           .FINITE WAVE LENGTH RESOLUTION,ERRORS FROM DENSITY
            AND THICKNESS DETERMINATION,INDEX OF REFRACTION OF
            AIR AND LONG TERM DRIFTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
