TITLE      -SCATTERING OF SLOW NEUTRONS BY THE ISOTOPES OF
            CHLORINE-
FACILITY   .FRM RESEARCH REACTOR,AT 4 MW THERMAL POWER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) NEUTRON BEAM COMING OUT OF A NEUTRON GUIDE
            TUBE OF FRM REACTOR.
           .FOR TOTAL C.S. MEASUREMENTS,NEUTRONS WERE SELECTED
            FROM THE REACTOR BEAM ENERGY SPECTRUM BY MEANS OF
            SPECIAL CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING RESONANCE DETECTORS
            BUILD UP WITH ROTATING FOILS.NEUTRON RESONANCE MEAN
            ENERGY WAS ASSUMED TO BE 1.257 EV FOR RHODIUM FOILS,
            AND 5.19 EV FOR SILVER FOILS.
INC-SPECT          NOT EXPLICITLY STATED BY AUTHORS,WHO JUST GAVE
            THE MEAN NEUTRON WAVE LENGTH,THAT WAS 13 ANGSTROMS.

            2.147 FOR NA-CL35,
            2.219 FOR NA-CL37,
            0.94835 FOR C6-D6,
            1.59403 FOR C-CL4,
            1.62264 FOR C2-CL4,
            0.86154 FOR C8-H10(CHEMICAL PURITY 99.95 PC),
            0.68372 FOR C7-H16.
           .FOR TOTAL C.S. MEAS.,SAMPLES OF PURE(99.92 AND 99.98

            (1.176E+22 MOLE./CM2),OF WHICH MEASURED SCATTERING
            DENSITIES WERE RESPECTIVELY 28.071E+9 1/CM2 AND
            30.414E+9 1/CM2.
            SAMPLE TEMPERATURE WAS 20 DEGREES CELSIUS.

            METHOD OF SMALL ANGLE SCATTERING OF VERY SLOW NEUTRON
            BEAM BY MEANS OF CHRISTIANSEN FILTERS WAS USED.

HISTORY    (771229C)
           (780705E)
CORRECTION .IN THE TOTAL C.S.MEASUREMENTS SMALL IMPURITIES AND
            AIR DESPLACED BY THE SAMPLE WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
ERR-ANALYS .STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS.
           .IN THE CASE OF TOTAL C.S.,UNCERTAINTY OF RESULTS IS
            MAINLY DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES OF THE DATA FOR LENGTH
            AND TEMPERATURE OF THE SAMPLE.
