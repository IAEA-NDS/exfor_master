TITLE      -ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS OF FRAGMENTS FROM FISSION OF
            U-238 INDUCED BY MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS FROM 1.5 TO
            18.2 MEV-
INC-SOURCE (D-C12) GAVE MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS WITH 1.5 MEV.
           (D-D  ) GAVE MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS WITH 5.2 MEV.
           (D-T  ) GAVE MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS WITH 18.2 MEV.
           .THESE REACTIONS WERE INDUCED BY 2 MEV DEUTERONS.
SAMPLE     .THIN LAYER OF URANYL-NITRATE DEPOSITED
            ELECTROLITICALLY ON AN ALUMINIUM DISC.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SILICON DETECTOR OF THE SURFACE BARRIER TYPE
            BUILT FOR THE DETERMINATION OF HEAVY-ION ENERGIES AND
            HAVING NOMINAL RESISTIVITY EQUAL TO 350 OHMS/CM,
            ACTIVE AREA = 1 CM2,OPERATING BIAS VOLTAGE 70 VOLTS.
ANALYSIS   .THE FISSION PULSES WERE PROCESSED WITH STANDARD
            ELECTRONIC AND REGISTERED BY MEANS OF A LADEN
            CHANNEL ANALYSER.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),,DE,FF) ENERGETIC SPECTRUM OBTAINED
            BY CF-252 SOURCE IS REPORTED IN CURVE.
