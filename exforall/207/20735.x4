TITLE      -Research of radioisotope production with fast
            neutrons(VII) . Production of several radioisotopes
            of high specific activity in JRR-1 reactor.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC) JRR-1 water-boiler type reactor, operated with
            output 40 kW. Several exp.holes(1,2,3,9,12) were used.
INC-SPECT         Thermal and fast neutron fluxes:
            Hole          (n/cm**2/sec)
            1      1.3E+12      1.5E+12

           Fast neutron flux was estimated by Ni-58(n,p)Co-58
           reaction assuming cross-section for fission neutrons
           to be 90 mb.
SAMPLE      Ni metal, impurity of Co > 0.15ppm. Small pieces of
            gold foil.  For thermal and fast neutron fluxes.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
           (CHSEP) Chemical separation by ion exchange.

ANALYSIS   Observed  cross sections were determined by reaction
           yields in exp.hole N 1 and from fast neutron flux
           measured by Ni-58(n,p) reaction.
