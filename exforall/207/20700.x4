TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON-PROTON TOTAL CROSS
            SECTION USING 24-KEV IRON FILTERED NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   (LINAC)    46 MEV ELECTRON LINAC OF THE RESEARCH
            REACTOR INSTITUTE FROM KYOTO UNIVERSITY.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)  WATER COOLED PHOTONEUTRON TARGET MADE OF
            TANTALUM PLATES WITH A 5 CM THICK POLYETHYLENE
            MODERATOR.
           .A PURE IRON FILTER OF 30 CM THICKNESS WAS USED FOR
            FILTERING THE NEUTRON BEAM.
INC-SPECT  .IRON FILTERED NEUTRON SPECTRUM PEAKED AT 24.3 KEV
            WITH AN ENERGY WIDTH OF ABOUT 2 KEV.
           .LOWER ENERGY LIMIT = 17.5 KEV
           .UPPER ENERGY LIMIT = 26.3 KEV
SAMPLE     .PURE WATER REPLACED BY A OPTICALY FLAT SIO2 PLATE.
           .PLATE THICKNESS = 1 AND 2 CM.
METHOD     (TOF  )  22.2 M FLIGHT PATH.
           .IRON FILTERED BEAM.
           .TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  FOR NEUTRON DETECTION A BARE 12.7 CM
            DIAM. BY 5.08 CM THICK NAI(TL) CRYSTAL WAS USED.
           (PROPC)  A BF3 PROPORTIONAL COUNTER WAS USED FOR
            MONITORING THE NEUTRON INTENSITY.
ANALYSIS   .EFFECTIVE NEUTRON ENERGY CALCULATED BY FORMULA 1
            OF REFERENCE, SEE DETAILS IN P.5 OF TEXT.
           .N-P CROSS SECTION CALCULATED BY SUBSTRACTING
            CONTRIBUTIONS OF OXIGEN AND SIO2 WHOSE CROSS
            SECTIONS WERE TAKEN FROM R.C.BLOCK ET.AL. J. OF
            NUCL.SCI.TECHN.12(1975)1.
COMMENT    .PRESENT RESULT IS VERY CLOSE TO THAT OBTAINED WITH
            THE EFFECTIVE RANGE FORMULA USING THE LOMON AND
            WILSON PARAMETER VALUES,PHYS.REV. C9 (1974) 1392,
            AND IS FAR FROM THE DILG VALUES,PHYS. REV. C11,
            (1975) 103.
           .CROSS SECTION MEASURED WITH GREAT ACCURACITY.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.
HISTORY    (760923C)
           (771109E)
           (840106U) A.P.T. JAPAN CODE CHANGED TO JPN
           (840106E)
CORRECTION .BACKGROUND ESTIMATED FROM FLIGHT-TIME SPECTRUM OUT
            OF 24.3 KEV PEAK.
           .CORRECTIONS DUE TO DEUTERIUM IN WATER, DOPPLER
            EFFECT AND CAPTURE TO SCATTERING RATIO WERE
            APROXIMATELY ESTIMATED TO BE 3.E-5, 2.E-6  AND
            2.E-5 RESPECTIVELY.
           .MOLECULAR BINDING EFFECT ESTIMATED TO 1.E-6.
ERR-ANALYS .ERRORS IN EFFECTIVE ENERGY COME MAINLY FROM THE
            STATISTICS OF THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
           (DATA-ERR) ERROR IN CROSS SECTION IS
            MAINLY STATISTICAL (0.096 P.C.) ,SEE DETAILS IN
            TABLE 4 OF REFERENCE.
