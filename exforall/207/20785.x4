TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON CAPTURE AND FISSION
            CROSS-SECTIONS OF AM-241 -
FACILITY   (LINAC) HARWELL 45 MEV ACCELERATOR, RUNNING AT A
            REPETITION FREQUENCY OF 192 MHZ.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) NEUTRON BOOSTER TARGET OF THE HARWELL LINAC.
SAMPLE     .AM-241 SAMPLE WAS APPROXIMATLY 12 GRAMS OF AMO2
            GIVING AN N-VALUE FOR THE AM-241 OF 1.32*10**-3
            ATOMS/BARN.
           .IT WAS CANNED IN NICKEL AND ALUMINIUM EACH HAVING A
            TOTAL THICKNESS OF 0.4 MM.
           .AN IDENTICAL EMPTY CAN WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE
            CONTRIBUTION OF THE CANNING MATERIAL TO THE
            BACKGROUND.
           .THE MAJOR IMPURITIES WERE PLUTONIUM ISOTOPES (1.5
            PERCENT BY WEIGHT) OF WHICH ABOUT HALF WAS PU-239.
           .SAMPLES WERE MOUNTED IN A DOUBLE SLEEVE OF BORON AND
            LEAD TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF SCATTERED NEUTRONS AND
            SOFT GAMMA-RAYS AT THE DETECTOR.

            BOTH AM-241 AND THE BLANK SAMPLE HOLDER WITH A
            SCINTILLATOR SITUATED AT THE 100 METRE FLIGHT PATH.
           .THE ACCELERATOR PULSE WIDTH WAS 0.5 MICRO-SEC AND

           (PSD  ) PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAMMAS
           .THE U-235 MEASUREMENTS WERE USED TO ESTABLISH AN
            ABSOLUTE SCALE FOR THE AM-241 FISSION CROSS-SECTION.
           .IN EACH CASE THE ELECTRON PULSE LENGTH WAS 150 NSEC,
            GIVING A NOMINAL RESOLUTION OF NSEC/METRE.
           .FISSION EVENTS WERE DETECTED BY OBSERVING PROMPT
            FISSION NEUTRONS WITH A PROTON RECOIL DETECTOR PLACED
            TO ONE SIDE OF THE SAMPLE BUT OUTSIDE THE NEUTRON
            BEAM.
           .MEASUREMENTS WITH A GOLD SAMPLE WERE USED TO CHECK

            ON-LINE COMPUTER SYSTEM CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SEVERAL
            EVENTS PER LINAC CYCLE.
           .THE TIME DEPENDENT BACKGROUND WAS DETERMINED BY THE

            THIS SYSTEM WAS USED TO DISTINGUISH THE NEUTRON AND
            GAMMA-RAY EVENTS WHICH WERE THEN STORED AS SEPARATE
