FACILITY   (LINAC) Harwell 45 MeV electron accelerator, running at
            repetition frequency of 192 MHz.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutron booster target of the Harwell LINAC.
SAMPLE     -Am-241 sample was approximately 12 grams of AmO2
            giving an N-value for the Am-241 of 1.32*10**-3
            atoms/barn.
           -It was canned in nickel and aluminum each having a
            total thickness of 0.4 mm.
           -An identical empty can was used to evaluate the
            contribution of the canning material to the
            background.
           -The major impurities were plutonium isotopes (1.5 %
            by weight) of which about half was Pu-239.
           -Samples were mounted in a double sleeve of boron and
            lead to reduce the effects of scattered neutrons and
            soft gamma-rays at the detector.

REACTION   (95-AM-241(N,ABS),,SIG,,AV)   Average neutron
             absorption cross-section (predominantly capture).
METHOD     (TOF) Gamma-yield measurements were carried out for
            both Am-241 and the blank sample holder with a
            scintillator situated at the 100 meter flight path.
           -The accelerator pulse width was 0.5 micro-sec and
            the nominal resolution of 5.8 nano-sec/meter.
           -A 6 mm lead sleeve was placed around the sample to
            reduce the soft gamma-ray pule up.
           -A bias of 3 MeV was imposed to the detector.
           -The detector was only used in the coincidence mode.
           -Time-of-flight data were accumulated for a fixed
            pulse-height window of 3 MeV to 7 MeV using a digital
            time analyzer width 1/4 micro-sec timing channel and
            the ability to accept several events per accelerator
            cycle.
           -The shape of the absorption c.s. was determined
            using the same sample in the range 100 eV to 500 keV.
            In this case capture gamma-ray events were detected
            with a large liquid scintillator.

METHOD     (TOF) Fission yields measurements were made for the
            Am-241 and U-235 samples, using a 13 m flight path.
           (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination against gammas
           -The U-235 measurements were used to establish an
            absolute scale for the Am-241 fission cross-section.
           -In each case the electron pulse length was 150 nsec,
            giving a nominal resolution of nsec/meter.
           -Fission events were detected by observing prompt
            fission neutrons with a proton recoil detector placed
            to one side of the sample but outside the neutron
            beam.
           -Measurements with a gold sample were used to check
            the amount of breakthrough.
           -The time-of-flight information (minimum channel
            width 1/16 microsec.)was collected and stored by an
            on-line computer system capable of accepting several
            events peR LINAC cycle.
           -The time dependent background was determined by the
            black resonance filter technique using samples of
            manganese,tantalum and titanium.
            Background were measured for two thicknesses of each
            material to enable extrapolation to zero thickness.
           -A permanent cadmium overlap filter was present in all
            measurements.
           -The time constant background was determined by
            recording events at the end of each accelerator
            cycle with a background gate.
           -The spectrum of incident neutrons was measured
            relative to the Li-6(N,ALPHA) cross-section, using a
            lithium glass detector. This detector was placed in
            the same position as the sample in the fission yield
            measurements and background were determined in an
            identical manner using the same filters.
           -Fission cross-sections were measured in the energy
            range 1 eV to 10 keV  by observing prompt fission
            neutrons.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Lithium glass detector, monitoring the
            incident neutron spectrum.
           (SCIN) Four NE-213 proton recoil detectors placed
            around the sample, out of the incident neutron beam,
            with a pulse shape discrimination system.
            This system was used to distinguish the neutron and
            gamma-ray events which were then stored as separate
            time-of-flight spectra.
           -A pulse height bias equivalent to 1.5 MeV neutron
            energy was applied in all measurements.
ANALYSIS   -The observed time-of-flight spectra for both
            the Am-241 and the U-235 were converted to fission
            cross-section shapes after correction for background
            and incident neutron spectrum energy dependence.
           -The U-235 cross-section was placed on an absolute
            scale by normalizing the average U-235 fission yield
            in the 1 keV to 2 keV range of incident neutron
            energy to the value of 7.167 barns given by a recent
            status report on the U-235 evaluation in MONIT-REF.
           -The Am-241 fission c.s. was then normalized in the
            same energy range using the calibration obtained
            from the U-235 measurement, and the difference in
            the value of nu-bar for Am-241 and U-235, was taken
            into account,using the values of Manero and Konshin.

ANALYSIS   -Based on the assumption that to a first approximation
            the ratio,R,of fission neutron to gamma-ray yield for
            a particular resonance is given by:
            *****************************************************
            *     R = E(F,N)*NU-BAR(P)*G(F)/                    *
            *         (G(G)*E(C,G)+G(F)*E(F,G))                 *
            *****************************************************
            where E(F,N) is the detector efficiency for fis. n.,
                  E(C,G) and E(F,G) the overall efficiencies for
                     detecting capture and fission gamma-rays,
                  G(F),G(G) are fission and capture widths.
           -Authors took as good approximation the following
            value:
                      G(F) = C*G(G)*(R/NU)
            where C is about 2., obtained by calibration from
            U-235 data.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM1,95-AM-241(N,G),,WID,,G) Total radiation width
            assumed to be constant and equal to 40 milli-eV.
           (ASSUM2,92-U-235(N,G),,WID,,G)Same assumption as above.
