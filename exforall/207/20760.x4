TITLE      -ON SUB-BARRIER FISSION IN U-238-
FACILITY   (LINAC) CBNM LINEAR ACCELERATOR PRODUCING ELECTRON
INC-SOURCE (EVAP ) FAST NEUTRON PRODUCED IN A MERCURY-COOLED
            NATURAL URANIUM TARGET BY THE ELECTRON BEAM ARE
            SLOWED DOWN BY A 2.8 CM THICK POLYETHYLENE SHEET OF
            20 * 20 CM2.THE SPECTRUM OF THE MODERATED NEUTRONS AS
            DETERMINED WITH A 10-B F3 COUNTER SHOWS IN GOOD
            APPROXIMATION AN ENERGY DEPENDENCE LIKE E**-0.887 IN
            THE CONSIDERED ENERGY RANGE.
SAMPLE     .250 GRAMS DISK OF METALLIC U DEPLETED TO 0.2 PC OF
            U-235.
METHOD     (TOF  ) NEUTRON TIME OF FLIGHT MEASUREMENTS COULD BE
            PERFORMED AT A 30 M FLIGHTPATH WITH A NOMINAL
            RESOLUTION OF 1.3 NSEC/M,CORRESPONDING TO AN ENERGY
            RESOLUTION OF 0.7 AND 1.5 EV AT 720 AND 1210 EV
            NEUTRON ENERGY,RESPECTIVELY.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) THE FISSION NEUTRON DETECTOR CONSISTS OF FOUR
            LIQUID SCINTILLATION CHAMBERS FORMING A HOLLOW
            CYLINDER WITH OUTER DIMENSIONS 38CM DIAM 18CM LENGTH,
            AND INNER DIMENSIONS 16CM DIAM 38CM LENGTH.
           .THE SAMPLE IS PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CYLINDER.
           .SCINTILLATOR LIQUID IS NE 213.
           .DETECTOR FISSION SENSITIVITY WAS ABOUT 1/1000 FOR
            PROMPT NEUTRON DETECTION.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,WID)
           .DATA NORMALIZED BY COMPARISON TO YIELDS OBTAINED FROM
            LOW ENERGY RESONANCES(8 TO 32EV)IN U-235.
