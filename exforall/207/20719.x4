TITLE      -MULTILEVEL RESONANCE ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL NEUTRON
            CROSS-SECTION OF 23-NA AND CA BELOW 1 MEV-
FACILITY   (ISOCY)
INC-SOURCE .NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED IN BURSTS OF 1NS DURATION BY
            BOMBARDING A URANIUM TARGET WITH DEUTERONS AT A
            REPETITION RATE OF 19.13 HZ.
SAMPLE     .THE SCATTERING SAMPLE FOR NA WAS A HIGH PURITY
            (99.998PC) METAL SLAB, 0.2323 ATOMS/B , SEALED IN AN
            ALUMINIUM CAN.
           .THE CA SAMPLE HAD A THICKNESS OF 0.2133 ATOMS/B AND
            CONSISTED OF GRANULATED METAL ENCLOSED IN A CYLIN-
            DRICAL ALUMINIUM CONTAINER WITH THIN END WINDOWS.
METHOD     (TOF  ) FLIGHT PATH- 57M.
           .THE INCIDENT BEAM WAS MONITORED BY A GAMMA-PULSE-
            SHAPE DISCRIMINATION DETECTOR PLACED AT 6DEG TO THE
            BEAM AT A DISTANCE OF 11M FROM THE SOURCE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR (NE-213), 9CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 1CM THICK ON AN XP-1040 PHOTOMULTIPLIER.
ANALYSIS   (MLA  ) MULTILEVEL R-MATRIX DESCRIPTION WITH A SINGLE
            OPEN CHANNEL FOR ELASTIC SCATTERING.
MONITOR    .TRANSMISSION WITH TARGET IN/OUT CYCLE TIME 20MIN.

CORRECTION .FOR BACKGROUND AND DEAD-TIME EFFECTS.
           .THE COMBINED CORRECTIONS WERE TYPICALLY A FEW PC OF
            THE OPEN BEAM COUNTING RATE AND DID NOT EXCEED 20PC
            BELOW 1MEV.
ERR-ANALYS .COUNTING STATISTICS-
            FOR NA LESS THAN 0.3PC BETWEEN 600 AND 900KEV AND
            LESS THAN 1PC BETWEEN 420 AND 600KEV,
            FOR CA 5PC AT 800KEV TO 3PC AT 1.5MEV.
