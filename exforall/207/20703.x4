            ABSTRACT.
AUTHOR     (V.BHORASKAR,S.AMEMIYA,K.KATOH,T.MATSUI,T.KATOH)
TITLE      -FORMATION CROSS SECTIONS OF ZIRCONIUM-90M AND LEAD-
            207M WITH FAST NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) 2-MEV VAN DE GRAAFF OF NAGOYA UNIVERSITY.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )  FOR 14.8 TO 18.2 NEUTRONS A D-T REACTION
            INDUCED IN A TRITIUM TARGET BY THE DEUTERON BEAM.
           (D-D  )  FOR 4.1 TO 5.2-MEV NEUTRONS A COPPER DISC
            COATED WITH A THIN LAYER OF TITANIUM SERVED AS
            TARGET TO YIELD NEUTRONS BY THE D-D REACTION.
SAMPLE     .MIXTURES OF PURE (99.8 PC.) METALLIC POWDERS OF
            NATURAL LEAD AND ZIRCONIUM IN DIFFERENT RATIOS WERE
            USED.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE HALF-LIVES
            OF THE METASTABLE STATES OF ZR-90 AND PB-207 IS
            EXPLOITED IN A SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT ON SAMPLES
            WHERE BOTH NUCLIDES ARE MIXED. SEE DETAILS IN PP.
            2 AND 3 OF REFERENCE. J.NUCL.SCI.TECHN.,13(1976)343.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A 55-CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WAS USED FOR GAMMA
            RAY DETECTION
           .RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF DETECTOR DETERMINED FROM THE
            RESULTS OF ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENTS.
           .RESOLUTION 1.90 KEV AT 1.33 MEV.
ANALYSIS   .A RELATION BETWEEN THE RATIO OF THE FORMATION CROSS
            SECTIONS FOR BOTH ISOTOPES AND THE RATIO OF THE
            INTENSITIES OF GAMMA-RAYS IS ESTABLISHED.
            SUPPLEMENTARY DETAILS IN PP.

COMMENT    .THE PRESENT METHOD ALLOWS MEASUREMENT AT ENERGY
            RANGES WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED BY EARLIER
            WORKERS.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND AND SELF ABSORPTION NEGLIGIBLE.
           .CORRECTIONS OF DEAD TIME VARIATIONS IN THE NEUTRON
            FLUX AND IRRADIATION TIME NOT NECESSARY.
           .PROGRESIVE BUILD-UP OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE
            LONG LIVED ISOTOPES OF PB AND ZR WERE NEGLIGIBLE
            DUE TO SHORT IRRADIATION TIME.
ERR-ANALYS .OVERALL ACCURACITY OF ABOUT 10 P.C.,NO MORE DETAILS.
