TITLE       Formation cross sections of zirconium-90m and
            lead-207m with fast neutrons
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNNAG) 2-MeV Van de Graaff of Nagoya University.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )  For 14.8 to 18.2 neutrons a d-t reaction
            induced in a tritium target by the deuteron beam.
           (D-D  )  For 4.1 to 5.2-MeV neutrons a copper disc
            coated with a thin layer of titanium served as
            target to yield neutrons by the d-d reaction.
SAMPLE     .Mixtures of pure (99.8%) metallic powders of natural
            lead and zirconium in different ratios were used.
            For such mixtures were prepared using lead and
            zirconium in the ratios, 1:1, 1:1.25, 1:1.5 and 1:2
            respectively. Each mixture, having weight of about
            60 mg, was packed in a thin polyethylene bag of
            dimensions appropriate to the total volume of about
            28 mm3 of the mixture.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,MOMIX)  The similarity between the
            half-lives of the metastable states of Zr-90 and
            Pb-207 is exploited in a simultaneous measurement on
            samples where both nuclides are mixed. See details
            in pp. 2 and 3 of J.Nucl.Sci.Techn.,13(1976)343.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A 55-cm3 Ge(Li) detector was used for gamma
            ray detection
           .Relative efficiency of detector determined from the
            results of absolute efficiency measurements.
           .Resolution 1.90 keV at 1.33 MeV.
ANALYSIS   .A relation between the ratio of the formation cross
            sections for both isotopes and the ratio of the
            intensities of gamma-rays is established.
            Supplementary details in pp. 2 and 3 of
                                    J.Nucl.Sci.Techn.,13(1976)343.
COMMENT    .The present method allows measurement at energy
            ranges which have not been covered by earlier
            workers.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data from Tbl.1 of NSE,13,343.
CORRECTION .Background and self absorption negligible.
           .Corrections of dead time variations in the neutron
            flux and irradiation time not necessary.
           .Progressive build-up of the activities of the
            long lived isotopes of Pb and Zr were negligible
            due to short irradiation time.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) .Overall accuracy of about 10%,
                                             no more details.
