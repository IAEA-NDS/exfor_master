TITLE      - The neutron capture and fission cross section of
             Am-241 in the energy range from 10 to 250 keV -.
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) Karlsruhe 3 MV pulsed Van de Graaff
            accelerator.
SAMPLE     .A sintered pellet of 3.6 grams of AmO2, 17.7 mm in
            diameter and 2.2 mm in thickness, has been prepared,
            which was welded in a 0.15 mm thick stainless steel
            canning.
           .Part of the measurement were made with a similar
            Am-241 sample with double the diameter and 1/3 of
            the thickness.
           .Different Au-197 and U-235 metal samples plus some
            graphite and stainless steel samples were used for
            correction and normalization purposes.
METHOD     (TOF  ) With kinematically collimated neutrons and
            moderate energy resolution at short flight paths.
           .The flight path was 50 to 66.4 mm long.
           .A set of four samples were mounted on a sample changer
            and cycled automatically into the measuring position.
            The cycle time was determined by integrating the beam
            current to a preselected charge.
           .A dummy sample was used to correct for background
            events and a U-235 sample served for normalization
            of the fission correction and as a fission standard.
           .The capture cross-section ratios of Am versus Au-197
            have been measured in four runs of different flight
            paths.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) Cylindrical Ne-213 liquid scintillator,100 mm
            in diam, 30 mm thick, with a pulse shape
            discrimination equipment, see 'a simple pulse shape
            discriminator' by R.E.Bandl, KFK-1458.
           (MOXR ) with a 25 mm thick graphite converter used for
            registration of gamma-rays from capture and fission
            events
           .both detectors were shielded with lead and were
            located at backward angles of 120 deg with respect
            to the beam axis.They were completely outside the
            neutron cone.
