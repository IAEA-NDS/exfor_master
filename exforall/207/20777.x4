TITLE       Polarization measurements and optical model analyses
            of neutron scattering at 3.2 MeV
FACILITY   (CCW,2NEDAMS) Furnished a 650 keV deuteron beam with a
            mean current of 500 micro-A
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) - half of the neutron spectrum width
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-D)
           .The neutron producing targets were 1 mg/cm2 titanium
            deuterium targets with copper backing placed at 45
            degrees to the deuteron beam.
           .Mean neutron energy was 3.2 MeV and total width of
            neutron spectrum about 300 keV.
           .Neutrons were collimated to a narrow beam the width
            of which was the same as the scatterer diameter.
SAMPLE     .Natural targets of Ti,Cr,Fe,Ni,Cu,Zn,Sr,Zr,Nb,Mo,Ag,
            Cd,Sn,Sb,Te,Ba,W,Tl,Pb,Bi.
           .Their lengths and diam varied between respectively
            24 and 40 mm and 30 and 50 mm but were always smaller
            than the mean free path for 3.2 MeV neutrons.
METHOD     (TRN) Measurements made by transmission and restricted
            to forward angle between 30 and 75 degrees.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,SCIN) Four neutron NE-213 scintillator
            detectors, 5 cm in diam,7.5 cm in length could be
            positioned at angles between 30 and 150 degrees in a
             large paraffin shielding block.
            * The protons were detected with a silicon surface
              barrier detector
ANALYSIS   .Polarizations are calculated from the asymmetries
            with p1= -15%,by the following formula.
            P(cor)= A*F*P(exp)- B -C + (P1-sqrt(P1))
            where- P(cor) is the corrected datum
                 - P(exp) is the raw datum
                 - F the correction factor for inelastic scat.
                 - A,B,C terms which depend of the folded
                    Legendre polynomials.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Comparison with other data and optical model
           analyses.
CORRECTION .For multiple scattering,for geometrical spread,and
            for inelastic scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error given.
