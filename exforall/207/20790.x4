TITLE       Thermal neutron capture cross-section measurements
            for 23Na, 27Al, 37Cl and 51V
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK NPL)
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) flux level 1.26 x 10**7 n/cm2/s. This value
            is measured to 0.6% relative to the gold capture
            cross section.
INC-SPECT   NPL standard Maxwellian thermal spectrum.
SAMPLE      The samples were in the form of thin discs of 22 mm
           diam., except for the vanadium foils, which were of
           11 mm diam.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activity measured by 4Pi beta-gamma
            coincidence counting.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4Pi-beta argon-methane gas flow
            proportional counter.
           (NAICR) 3 x 3 inch NaI(Tl) crystal.
           (COIN,PROPC,NAICR) Absolute activities were measured
            by beta-gamma coincidence counting.
ANALYSIS    Saturated absolute activities per atom after
            irradiation bare, and after irradiation encased
            in 1mm cadmium, were combined to determine the
            2200 m/s cross section and reduced resonance
            integral using equations (see REL-REF).
CORRECTION .Beta efficiencies of the 4Pi-beta counter were
            determined for each decay scheme. Corrections were
            made for low specific activity,and electron
            capture and conversion.

MISC-COL   (MISC)  Measurement uncertainty (3sigma) presented by
            the author used to define ERR-S.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Standard error on mean (1-sigma) which was
            derived from MISC by compiler.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic error mainly from:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in neutron flux (An unassigned
            error of +-2.% was included in the measurement of
            flux to cover other possible undetected errors.
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in sample weighing
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in half-life
           and also from ERR-2 or/and ERR-3 given in Subents below
COMMENT    Overall error given in the tables includes the overall
           systematic error, which is then added linearly to
           the random error  calculated at the 99% confidence
           level from the standard error of the mean to give the
           final error for each isotope
                                (systematic + 3 standard error).
