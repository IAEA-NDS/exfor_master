TITLE       Measurement of (n,p)reaction cross sections at
            14.7 MeV using high-pressure liquid chromatography
            in the region of rare earths
FACILITY   (NGEN,2GERJUL)     Neutron Generator DYNAGEN.
             Fast pneumatic tube system for short lived isotopes.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)    Deuteron-tritium.
INC-SPECT   14.7 +- 0.3 MeV neutrons.  Irradiation up to 6 hr at
            neutron flux densities of (1 - 2) x 10**9 /cm2/sec.
            Contribution of thermal neutrons less 0.1%.
SAMPLE     .High-purity rare earth oxides (> 99.9%) were sealed in
            thin polyethylene foils and sandwiched between two
            layers of the flux monitor material (Al or As2O3)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation and identification of the radio-
            activ reaction products.
           (CHSEP) Wherever necessary the technique of high-
            pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed
            for chemical separation. For details see REL-REF.
           .Each measured value is based on at least three
            independent measurements.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) 3 GeLi-spectrometers were used-
            a well-type 65 cm3,
            a Co-axial 28 cm3 for longer-lived products,
            a small one with an active area of 2 cm2 with a thin
            beryllium window.
           .The detectors were on-line with a 4000-channel
            intertechnique DIDAC or a 16K nuclear data system
            4420 analyzer.

CORRECTION .For counting efficiency, geometry, absorption.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The maximum error is given, it includes the
            systematic errors such as the uncertainty in neutron
            flux determination, the uncertainty in the relative
            photopeak efficiency of the detectors, and the
            uncertainty in the evaluation of the Compton back-
            ground, particularly in the low energy region.
            Combining all individual errors in quadrature.
            Errors due to uncertainties in decay schemes are not
            included.
COMMENT    .Cross section trends were investigated and described.
