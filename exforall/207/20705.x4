TITLE      -PRECISE ENERGY DETERMINATION FOR THREE PEAK CROSS
            SECTIONS IN 23-NA AND 27-AL AND FOR THE 250 KEV
            RESONANCE IN 6-LI-
FACILITY   (SYNCY) 140MEV PROTONS.
INC-SOURCE (EVAP ) FAST NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A
            TUNGSTEN TARGET WITH THE PROTON BEAM.THESE NEUTRONS
            WERE THEN MODERATED IN A WATER MODERATOR BEFORE
            TRAVERSING THE FLIGHT PATH.
SAMPLE     .THIN SAMPLE OF 95.67PC LI-6 AND 4.33PC OF LI-7.
METHOD     (TOF  ) FLIGHT PATH APPROXIMATELY 100.0M.FOR A
            DETAILED ASSESSMENT FOR THE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING
            THE PATH SEE AERE-R 7919.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) LI-6 GLASS DETECTOR FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE
            RUN.
           (SCIN ) NE110 PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR FOR THE REMAINING
            PART.
PART-DET   (N    )
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) LEAST SQUARES FIT.
MONITOR    .TRANSMISSION WITH TWO LONG RUNS EACH OF 8HRS WITH
            SAMPLE IN AND SAMPLE OUT FOR LI.
CORRECTION .IN THE CASE OF LI-6 THE EFFECT OF THE LI-7 RESONANCE
            WAS SUBTRACTED.
ERR-ANALYS .MAIN SOURCES OF ERRORS WERE IN THE EXACT
            DETERMINATION OF THE FLIGHT PATH AND OF THE NEUTRON
            TIME-OF-FLIGHT.
           .FOR THE AL-27 RESONANCE AT 257.16KEV ADDITIONAL
            UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM POOR STATISTICS.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM AERE-R-7919.
