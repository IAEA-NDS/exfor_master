TITLE      -RESONANCE PARAMETER DETERMINATION OF THE MAIN
            RESONANCE OF RHODIUM BY THE MUTUAL-INDICATION METHOD.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATIONS IN A LARGE CONICAL COLLIMATOR WITH
            HOMOGENEOUS NEUTRON FLUX.
SAMPLE     .IN-NI ALLOYS (2.3/97.7 PER CENT) AS MONITOR AND
            RH-NI ALLOYS (7.03/92.97 PER CENT).
METHOD     (ACTIV) MUTUAL-INDICATION METHOD AS SUGGESTED BY FLECK
            AND WEISSHAEUPL IN NUCL.INSTR.METH. 66(1968)141 AND
            NUCL.INSTR.METH. 66(1968)149. THE FOILS SANDWICHES
            OF THE MONITOR AND RHODIUM ALLOYS WERE IRRADIATED IN
            A ROTADING DISC.
DETECTOR   .SIMULTANEOUS IRRADIATION AND ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS
            (NO INFORMATION FOR DETECTOR USED).
ANALYSIS   .FROM THE KNOWN RESONANCE PARAMETERS OF MONITOR NUCLIDE
            ONE CAN CALCULATE THE RESONANCE PARAMETERS OF THE
            NUCLIDE OF INTEREST BY USING THE EQUATIONS GIVEN IN
            THE ORIGINAL PAPER.
MONITOR    (49-IN-0(N,EL),,WID,,G) INDIUM HAS BEEN CHOOSEN
            BECAUSE OF ITS WELL KNOWN RESONANCE IN AN ENERGY NEAR
            TO THE ENERGY OF THE MAIN RESONANCE OF RHODIUM.
