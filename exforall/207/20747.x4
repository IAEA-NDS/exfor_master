TITLE       Resonance parameter determination of the main
            resonance of rhodium by the mutual-indication method
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations in a large conical collimator with
            homogeneous neutron flux.
FACILITY   No information.
SAMPLE     .In-Ni alloys (2.3/97.7%) as monitor and
            Rh-Ni alloys (7.03/92.97%).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Mutual-indication method as suggested by Fleck
            (see REL-REF). The foils sandwiches of the monitor and
            rhodium alloys were irradiated in a rotading disc.

DETECTOR   .Simultaneous irradiation and activity measurements
            (no information for detector used).
ANALYSIS   .From the known resonance parameters of monitor nuclide
            one can calculate the resonance parameters of the
            nuclide of interest by using the equations given in
            the original paper.
MONITOR    (49-IN-0(N,EL),,WID,,G) Indium has been choosen
            because of its well known resonance in an energy near
            to the energy of the main resonance of rhodium.
STATUS     (TABLE) From the text on p.272 of AKE,15(1970)271.
CORRECTION .For background,detection efficiency, different foil
            weighs, different thickness of the filter foils and
            corrections (see REL-REF).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) .Statistical errors.
