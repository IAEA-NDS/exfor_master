TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE COHERENT NEUTRON SCATTERING LENGTH
            OF HE-3 BY NEUTRON INTERFEROMETRY-
FACILITY   .EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT A RADIAL BEAM HOLE
            OF THE HIGH FLUX 250KW TRIGA REACTOR IN THE L-L INST.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) 34.5 MIN OF ARC COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM FROM
            ILL REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .HE-3 GAS CONTAINED IN A PRESSURE VESSEL.
           .HELIUM WAS USED AS A SHIFTING MATERIAL BETWEEN TWO OF
            THE INTERFEROMETER PLATES.
METHOD     .PERFECT CRYSTAL INTERFEROMETRY USING DYNAMICAL
            DIFFRACTION THEORY PROPERTIES,OF A MONOCHROMATIC
            COHERENT SLOW NEUTRON BEAM.
           .A (200)-REFLECTION OF AN ORIENTED GRAPHITE
            MONOCHROMATOR WITH A MOSAIC SPREAD OF 3DEG,WAS USED
            IN A FIRST ARRANGEMENT GIVING A DISPERSION PARAMETER
            TAN(TETHA1)/(TAN(TETHA2)=1.954,THEN A MONOCHROMATIC
            NEUTRON BEAM WAS COLLIMATED WITHIN 16.5 MIN OF ARC.
           .A PERFECT SILICON CRYSTAL WAS CUT AND POLISHED TO
            GIVE THE E-SHAPED LAUE-TYPE INTERFEROMETER WITH A
            SYMMETRICAL (220)-REFLECTION.THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
            THE THREE CRYSTAL PLATES WERE 27.2936+-0.0009 MM,AND
            THEIR THICKNESSES WERE 4.3954+-0.0008 MM (WITHIN A
            HORIZONTAL PLANE).
           .THE INTERFEROMETER COULD BE ROTATED BY A SUITABLE
            GONIOMETER WITH A 0.5 SEC OF ARC ACCURACY.
           .THE WIDTH OF THE INTERF.ROCKING CURVE WAS 27MIN ARC.
           .BEHIND THE INTERFEROMETER,DEVIATED AND FORWARD BEAMS
            WERE COLLIMATED WITHIN 27.5 MIN OF ARC,AND REACHED
            EACH A HE-3 TYPE DETECTOR WITH A VERTICAL DIVERGENCY
            OF 45 MIN.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) HE-3 DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   .EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WERE FITTED TO A SPECIAL FORM
            (SEE ORIGINAL WORK).
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM PL/B,71.
HISTORY    (780322C)
           (780705E)
CORRECTION .FINITE WAVE LENGTH RESOLUTION,ERRORS FROM DENSITY AND
            PRESSURE,INDEX OF REFRACTION OF AIR AND LONG TERM
            DRIFTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
ERR-ANALYS .GAUSSIAN ERRORS.
