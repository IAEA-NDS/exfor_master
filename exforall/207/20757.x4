TITLE      -Measurement of the coherent neutron scattering length
            of He-3 by neutron interferometry-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL).Experiments were carried out at a radial
            beam hole of the high flux 250kW TRIGA reactor in ILL
INC-SOURCE (REAC) 34.5 min of arc collimated neutron beam from
            ILL reactor.
SAMPLE     .He-3 gas contained in a pressure vessel.
           .Helium was used as a shifting material between two of
            the interferometer plates.
METHOD     .Perfect crystal interferometry using dynamical
            diffraction theory properties,of a monochromatic
            coherent slow neutron beam.
           .A (200)-reflection of an oriented graphite
            monochromator with a mosaic spread of 3deg,was used
            in a first arrangement giving a dispersion parameter
            tan(tetha1)/(tan(tetha2)=1.954,then a monochromatic
            neutron beam was collimated within 16.5 min of arc.
           .A perfect silicon crystal was cut and polished to
            give the E-shaped Laue-type interferometer with a
            symmetrical (220)-reflection.The distance between
            the three crystal plates were 27.2936+-0.0009 mm,and
            their thicknesses were 4.3954+-0.0008 mm (within a
            horizontal plane).
           .The interferometer could be rotated by a suitable
            goniometer with a 0.5 sec of arc accuracy.
           .The width of the interf.Rocking curve was 27min arc.
           .Behind the interferometer,deviated and forward beams
            were collimated within 27.5 min of arc,and reached
            each a He-3 type detector with a vertical divergency
            of 45 min.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) He-3 detector.
ANALYSIS   .Experimental results were fitted to a special form
            (see original work).
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from PL/B,71,321.
CORRECTION .Finite wave length resolution,errors from density and
            pressure,index of refraction of air and long term
            drifts were taken into account.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) .Gaussian errors.
