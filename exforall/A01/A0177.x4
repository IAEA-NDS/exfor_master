COMMENT    /By author/.After the irradiation foils were heated
           in hydrogen atmosphere at 950-1000 degree and the
           activity of the extracted tritium was determined in
           a proportional counter using methane as a counting
           gas. The tritium activity was measured several days
           after irradiations, so short-lived activities were
           no longer present.
CORRECTION No corrections were applied for the losses of tritium
           recoiling out of the front foils of the stack backwards
           with respect to the beam direction. However, from the
           shape of the depth distributions it was estimated that
           these losses amount in general only to very few percent
           of the thick-target yields.

ANALYSIS   Mean cross sections for the formation of tritium,
           averaged over the respective energy interval, were
           obtained from the differences between the respective
           thick-target yields divided by the number of target
           atoms per cm2 contained in that layer of the stack in
           which the energy of the projectiles is degraded from
           the upper to the lower limit of the energy interval.
           For these calculations the range energy tables of
           Williamson (see REL-REF) were used.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,20.) The error of the mean cross sections
           was estimated to be in general smaller than 20%.
           However, the uncertainty for the lowest energy
           intervals is larger due to the uncertainty of the
           threshold energies of the tritium producing reactions.
