TITLE      Production of neutron-rich isotopes by cold
           fragmentation in the reaction 197Au + Be at 950 A MeV

ADD-RES    (COMP) Abrasion-Ablation Model.
           To describe the production of extremely neutron-rich
           nuclei by cold fragmentation, an analytical formulation
           is presented.
           Longitudinal-Momentum distributions.
METHOD     (BCINT) The primary beam intensity was recorded
           permanently by measuring the current induced in a
           secondary-electron transmission monitor.
           (TOF,EDE)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two 5 mm thick scintillation detectors which
           measured the horizontal positions at the center
           and at the exit of the spectrometer as well as the
           time-of-flight in the second half of the separator.
           (IOCH) Multiple-sampling ionization chamber was mounted
           at the exit in order to determine the energy loss of
           the reaction products.
CORRECTION Corrections due to:
               * ionic charge-changing reactions
               * dead-time correction
               * low counting rates.
           All corrections were estimated to be of the
           order of 20%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of measurements was
           determined by error of corrections and statistical
           error
HISTORY    (20000712C)
           (20090827A) Correction in author' list has been done,
            according to V.Zerkin remarks.
           Corrections in Subents 002-034, according to new EXFOR
