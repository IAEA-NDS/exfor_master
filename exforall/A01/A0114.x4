REACTION   (3-LI-6(D,A)2-HE-4,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Aluminium foil with thin layer of deutrerium
           polyethylene (C/N,D/2N)
COMMENT    *By compiler*.Authors studied the reaction
            (1-H-2(3-Li-6,a)2-He-4) but their results were
           imagined as ones for deuteron beam.
FLAG       (1.).Accepted value
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainties of cross sections were
           produced by burndown of targets and statistics.
