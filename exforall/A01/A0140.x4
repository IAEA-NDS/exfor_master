TITLE      Cyclotron production of Ni-57 and Co-55 and
           synthesis of their bleomycin complexes.
AUTHOR     (R.D.Neirinckx)

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3SAFNLP)
INSTITUTE  (3SAFNLP)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,CHSEP)
ADD-RES     Method of chemical separation.
SAMPLE     Natural iron was soldered on to a copper backing and
           bombarded with an extracted beam of 100 microAmpere
           of 25 MeV He3 particles.
COMMENT      *By authors* Ni-57 and Co-55 for the labelling of
           bleomycin were produced by bombardment of natural
           iron with 25 MeV helium-3. The thick target yields
           were 32 muCi/muAhr of Ni-57 and 21 muCi/muAhr of
           Co-55 of 25 MeV helium-3. The bleomycin was
           successfully labelled with the carrier-free isotopes.

COMMENT    /By authors/ Ni-57 can most easily be produced by
           helium-3 bombardment of natural iron by the reaction
           Fe-56(He3,2n)Ni-57 the occurrence of Fe-56 in natural
           iron being 92%. Ni-56 can be produced by the
            (alpha,2n) reaction on Fe-54, but since natural iron
           contains less than 6% of this isotope the helium-3
           reaction on Fe-56 was preferred. However, since the
           decay scheme of Ni-56 is more favorable for medical
           work it will later replace the Ni-57 in this experiment

COMMENT     *By authors* Co-55 is easier and cheaper to produce
           than Co-57 it was also decided to produced this
           isotope and tag it on to bleomycin.
