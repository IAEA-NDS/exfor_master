TITLE      CYCLOTRON PRODUCTION OF NI-57 AND CO-55 AND
           SYNTHESIS OF THEIR BLEOMYCIN COMPLEXES.

SAMPLE     NATIRAL IRON WAS SOLDERED ON TO A COPPER BACKING AND
           BOMBARDED WITH AN EXTRACTED BEAM OF 100 MICROAMPERE
           OF 25 MEV HE3 PARTICLES.
COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.NI-57 AND CO-55 FOR THE LABELLING OF
           BLEOMYCIN WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDMENT OF NATURAL
           IRON WITH 25 MEV HELIUM-3.THE THICK TARGET YIELDS
           WERE 32 MUCI/MUAHR OF NI-57 AND 21 MUCI/MUAHR OF
           CO-55 OF 25 MEV HELIUM-3.THE BLEOMYCIN WAS
           SUCCESSFULLY LABELLED WITH THE CARRIER-FREE ISOTOPES.

COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.NI-57 CAN MOST EASILY BE PRODUCED BY
           HELIUM-3 BOMBARDMENT OF NATURAL IRON BY THE REACTION
           FE-56(HE3,2N)NI-57 THE OCCURRENCE OF FE-56 IN NATURAL
           IRON BEING 92 PER CENT.NI-56 CAN BE PRODUCED BY THE
            (A,2N) REACTION ON FE-54,BUT SINCE NATURAL IRON
           CONTAINS LESS THAN 6 PER CENT OF THIS ISOTOPE THE
           HELIUM-3 REACTION ON FE-56 WAS PREFERRED.HOWEVER,
           SINCE THE DECAY SCHEME OF NI-56 IS MORE FAVOURABLE
           FOR MEDICAL WORK IT WILL LATER REPLACE THE NI-57 IN
           OUR EXPERIMENTS.

COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.CO-55 IS EASIER AND CHEAPER TO PRODUCE
           THAN CO-57 IT WAS ALSO DECIDED TO PRODUCED THIS
           ISOTOPE AND TAG IT ON TO BLEOMYCIN.
