TITLE      Cross sections of production of 81-Kr in the
           reactions (A>81)Kr(p,pXn)81Kr and 80Kr(n,gamma)81Kr

SAMPLE     This sample had very small impurity Kr-81 and had
           not Kr-85.  The gas at a pressure of 520 mm Hg was
           enclosed in a glass ampoule of length 51 cm and
           diameter 10.5 cm.
INC-SPECT  The total flux of protons through the
           ampoule was 5 x 10**16.
