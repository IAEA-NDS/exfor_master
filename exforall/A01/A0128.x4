TITLE      Production of 123-I at the Rossendorf U-120
           cyclotron
AUTHOR     (G.J.Beyer,Ch.Damm,H.Odrich,G.Pimentel)
REFERENCE  (J,RRL,47,(3),151,1981)
INSTITUTE  (2GERZFK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERZFK) Deuteron energy is up to 14 MeV.
SAMPLE     About 0.22 gr  122-TeO2 (87% enrichment)
           was melted onto a platinum backing( 1.mm thickness,
           22.mm diameter). The target was cooled from the back
           side by water and at the front side by pressurized air
           air.
METHOD     (BCINT,SITA,ACTIV)
ADD-RES    Separation method of 123-I from the irradiated
           tellurium dioxide.
COMMENT     (By authors) The following isotopic composition
           at the end of bombardment was found (average 5
           production runs with 5.hr of irradiation.
             123-I     94%
             124-I     07-08%
             125-I     less 01%
             125-I     0.25%
             130-I     4.5%
             131-I     0.1%

COMMENT     (By compiler)  The additional information about
           'DETECTOR','ANALYSIS','DECAY-DATA' was
           received from G.J.Beyer and H.Oldrich.
HISTORY    (20160124A) SD: All lines from DECAY-DATA were deleted
            except one. SF8=PHY added to REACTION code.
            ANALYSIS (AREA) deleted (not relevant).
           (20180524A) SD: SF8=PHY -> EOB/MSC in REACTION code as
           it is said in the article on p.155.
