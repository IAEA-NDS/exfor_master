COMMENT    - By Authors:
           1.The Absolute Cross Section of the 15N(P,A0)12C
           Reaction was Determined at E=353.4 KeV Relative to the
           Rutherford Elastic Scattering Cross Section.
           2.Angular Distribution is 1+A1*Cos(THETA).Therefore
           The Yields Observed at 90 Ang. Degree Represent the
           Angle-Integrated Reaction Yield.
SAMPLE     Preliminary Experiments Using Solid Ti+15N Targets
           Revealed That Problems of Carbon Deposition As Well
           As of Target Deterioriation (FOR INTENSE BEAM LOADS)
           Hamper the Accuracy of the Data in Particular at Low
           Proton Energies (E<50 KEV), Since a Precise Knowledge
           Of the Efective Beam Energy is Required Here.
           For these Reasons,a Differentially Pumped and
           Recirculating Gas Target System of the Quasi-Point
           Supersonic Jet Type has Been Used For these
           Measurements at E <360 KeV.  The Ti+15N Targets were
           Fabricated by Vacuum Efaporation of a Layer of Natural
           Ti onto a 0.25 mm Thick Ta Backing and Then by
           Conversion of the Ti Film to the Nitride in an
           Atmosphere of 99% Enriched 15N Gas by Resistance
           Heating of the Coated Ta Backing. The Thickness of the
           Ti+15N Layers were Determined from the Apparent Width
           Of the E =429 KeV Resonance (W=0.9 KEV) In
           15N(P,A+G)12C and were Found to be Typically 3 KeV
           Thick For 429 KeV Protons.

REACTION   (7-N-15(P,A)6-C-12,,SIG,,,EXP)
PART-DET   (A)
COMMENT     (BY AUTHORS).The N-15(P,A1)C-12 Reaction is
           Unimportant at Stellar Energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).Error Includes Uncertainties in Number
           Of Count, Absolute Cross Setcion and Absolute
           Effective Beam Energy.
           (EN-ERR).For the Low-Energy Measurements at the
           Munster Accelerator, the Incident Proton Energies
           Are Known to an Acuracy of +-0.4 KeV. The Energy
           Loss of the Proton Beam Through the Supersonic Jet
           Gas Target System Up to the Jet Target Zone was
           Calculated from the Measured Ambient Pressures in the
           System and the Geometrical Lengths Involved. At the
           Lowest Incident Energy of E =79.7 KeV and an Inlet Pr
           Pressure of P =1.41 Bar, this Energy Loss is 0.2 KeV.
           From the Known Jet Taget Thickness the Energy Loss at
           Center of the Jet Target is Found to be 2.3+-0.3 KeV,
           Hence E/Eff=77.2+-0.5 KeV.This Energy would Represent
           The Effective Beam Energy Associated with Observed
           Alpha-Particle Yield, If the Cross Section
           Were Constant Over the Entire Jet Target
           Thickness (W=4.6 KEV).For a Constant Astrophysical
           S-Factor Over this Relatively Small Target
           Thickness the Cross Section Drops by 49% Over the
           Entire Target Thickness at this Lowest Beam Energy.
           This Relatively Small Drop in Cross Section Increases
           In Turn the Effective Beam Energy by 0.4 KeV, Hence
           E/Eff=77.6+-0.5  KeV.  The 0.5 KeV Uncertainty at this
           Lowest Beam Energy Corresponds to an Error of -+7% in
           The Cross Section.
