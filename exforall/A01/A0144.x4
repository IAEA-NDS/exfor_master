TITLE      The thick target yield of the reaction

ANALYSIS   (MLA) Absolute yields were computed from measurements
           on a Na22 positron source of known strength.

SAMPLE     The targets comprised a series of identical discs
           machined (dry) from a block of Acheson graphite.
           They were mounted in quick-change probe, which
           permitted easy insertion into and removal from the
           target chamber of an electrostatic accelerator.

COMMENT    /By author/.loss of N-13 by diffusion out of the
           graphite was considered negligible at the moderate
           temperatures developed in the targets, as no build-
           up of activity was detected by a shielded Geiger
           counter placed in the exhaust line of the target
           pumping system.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative error.
           (ERR-SYS) Absolute error. This error  includes
             * the error of the strength of 'standard'
                                        Na-22 source /5.5%/ and
             * systematic error due to radiation scattered into
                                           annihilation channel.
