SAMPLE     The tellurium foils were obtained by homogeneous
           dispersion of powdered metallic tellurium in the
           cellulosic suspension. Natural tellurium targets were
           stacked with copper foils with the purpose of
           monitoring the alpha particle flux.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The energy of the incident alpha-
           beam was 55.0 MeV with the uncertainty estimated
           below 1%. Reaction products losses by recoil were
           assumed to be negligible.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error limits for cross sections arise
           in the determination of the product nuclide activity
           and the alpha- particle flux. The gamma-ray yield
           involves the photopeak counts, the photopeak efficiency
           of the detector, gamma-ray transition probability,
           the internal conversion correction and a correction
           for the self-absorption in the sample. Since the
           alpha-particle flux involves the same quantities, the
           error in the flux measurments is estimated to Be equal
           to combined errors of these quantities. Error in
           timing,weight of the sample and in background
           subtraction were also estimated.
COMMENT    *By compiler*.The 'Data-Err G' for E=27 MeV have
           misprint probably.
