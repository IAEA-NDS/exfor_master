TITLE      Excitation functions for alpha-induced reactions on
           vanadium

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRSIU)
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,GSPEC)
           (EXTB) The beam current was about 0.2-0.5 uA
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
SAMPLE     The vanadium plate of 99.99% purity was rolled from
           9.15 mg/cm**2 down to foils with thickness from 1.73 to
           2.52 mg/cm**2. The target assembly consisted of a
           number of vanadium target sandwiched between aluminium
           degradation foils to avoid the loss of the product
           nuclei due to recoil. The stack was composed of such
           sandwiches. the inhomogeneity of the target thickness
           was less than 5%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error includes contributions from:
           (ERR-S,2.,4.) Uncertainty in the counting statistics
                        and peak integration (2-4%),
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the detector efficiency (3%),
           (ERR-2,,1.) Uncertainty in the beam current integration
           (ERR-3,3.,4.) Uncertainty in the inhomogeneity (3-4%)
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in the projectile energy is
           due to the energy spread of incident beam from
           cyclotron (~1%) and energy loss in the foils
           themselves (~0.2-0.4 MeV)
ADD-RES    (COMP)  The experimental results were compared with
           the theoretical calculations using the excitation
           model, and with earlier experimental results.
