TITLE      Excitation Functions For Alpha-Induced Reactions on
           Vanadium

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRSIU)
METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB)  The Beam Current was About 0.2-0.5 Mu-A
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
SAMPLE     The  Vanadium Plate of 99.99% Purity was Rolled from
           9.15 Mg/Cm**2 Down to Foils with Thickness from 1.73 to
           2.52 Mg/Cm**2.  The Target Assembly Consisted of a
           Number of Vanadium Target Sandwiched Between  Aluminium
           Degradation Foils to Avoid the Loss of the Product
           Nuclei Due to Recoil.  The Stack was Composed of Such
           Sandwiches. The Inhomogeneity of the Target Thickness
           Was Less Than 5%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Error Includes Contributions from the
           Counting Statistics and Peak Integration (2-4%),
           Detector Efficiency (3%), Beam Current Integration
            (<1%) And Inhomogeneity (3-4%), But not Spectroscopic
           Data Used in Analysis.
           (EN-ERR) The Uncertainty in the Projectile Energy is
           Due to the Energy Spread of Incident Beam from
           Cyclotron (~1%) And Energy Loss in the Foils Themselves
            (~0.2-0.4 MEV)
ADD-RES    (COMP)  The Experimental Results were Compared with the
           Theoretical Calculations Using the Exciton  Model,  and
           With Earlier Experimental Results.
HISTORY    (20010507C)
           (20010614U) Last checking has been done.
