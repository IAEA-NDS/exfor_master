COMMENT    /By authors/ Beam currents were determined by two
           methods:
           1) using a Faraday cup and comparison of activities:
           in this method a thin foil of the material for which
           excitation function were to be measured was placed in
           front of the thick stack. Additionally another foil of
           the same material and thickness as that in front of
           the stack was irradiated independently (without stack)
           and the total charge was collected in a Faraday cup.
           The average beam current incident on the stack was
           then obtained from a comparison of the various
           activities produced in the independently irradiated
           foil with those in the front foil of the stack after
           applying the relevant corrections such as for foil
           thickness, irradiation times, etc.
           2) via a monitor reaction: for the determination of
           beam currents via monitor reactions, several aluminium
           foils were placed at different positions in each stack.
           From the 24Na activity produced in each monitor foil
           the beam current was calculated.

SAMPLE     Two stacks were irradiated. The first one consisted of
           39 foils and the second one of 19 foils.
           The thickness of the vanadium foils varied between
           25 and 115 um. The purity of vanadium was better
           than 99.8%.
COMMENT     By authors. Since 51-V occurs in natural vanadium
           with an abundance of 99.75%, the 51-Cr should almost
           exclusively be formed in interactions of deuteron with
            51-V.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross section data
           were obtained by summing up in quadrature all the
           individual errors such as:
             * statistical errors,
             * errors in the analysis of the gamma-ray peaks,
             * errors in beam current measurements,
             * uncertainty in the efficiency of the detector.
           This is typical cross section uncertainty
           in general, the error in the rising part of excitation
           curves amounted to 12% and at the peaks to 6-8%.

COMMENT    Compiler could not exclude the production
           of 47-Sc via 47-Ca and 47-K.
           *By author*. The data have been measured using
           both the high-energy machine (thick stack)
           and the low-energy machine (relatively thin stack).
           The discrepancies have been observed for energy
           overlap region in the case of different stacks.
           For thick stack secondary neutrons contribute
           to the formation of scandium via (n,p) and (n,n'p)
           reactions.

SAMPLE     Titanium of natural isotopic composition,
           purity is better than 99.6%. The titanium foils used
           were 10,35 and 125 um thick and arranged such that the
           energy interval between two successive points on the
           excitation curve varied between 1.8 and 5 MeV.
           The thickness of each foil was determined
           independently.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross section data
           were obtained by summing up in quadrature all the
           individual errors such as:
             * statistical errors,
             * errors in the analysis of the gamma-ray peaks,
             * errors in beam current measurements,
             * uncertainty in the efficiency of the detector.
           This is typical cross section uncertainty
           in general, the error in the rising part of excitation
           curves amounted to 12% and at the peaks to 6-8%.
COMMENT    *By author*. The data have been measured using
           both the high-energy machine(thick stack)
           and the low-energy machine(relatively thin stack).
           The discrepancies have been observed for energy
           overlap region in the case of different stacks.
           For thick stack secondary neutrons contribute to
           the formation of scandium via (n,p) and (n,n'p)
           reactions.
FLAG       (1.) CV-28 (low energy, relatively thin stack)
           (2.) Isochronous cyclotron (high-energy, thick stack).
