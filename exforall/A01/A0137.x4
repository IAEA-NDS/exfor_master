METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB)
SAMPLE     Each packet contained a number of 1.268-cm diameter
           monitor,target, and recoil-catcher foils. Elemental
           Al, with a purity of 99.997% and thickness
           26 mu was used for beam monitors and forward
           and backward recoil catchers. A catcher foil was
           placed both upstream and downstream of each target
           to determine recoil loss corrections, and monitors
           were situated likewise to measure any loss of beam
           intensity upon traversal of the experimental packet.
           All Al monitors were, of course, fully compensated.
           High-purity (>=99.9%) elemental targets of
           La, Mo, and V were irradiated, and an entire packet
           was sandwiched together and maintained at a constant
           position in the proton beam with an external holder.
           While each packet contained a single La and Mo foil,
           three adjacent V targets were incorporated. In this
           way, the cross sections for nuclides such as 24-Na,
           22-Na, and 7-Fe, which are also produced in and
           recoil from the Al catchers, could be determined by
           analyzing the central V target.
            Two independent bombardments were performed.
           In the first, the thickness of each of the targets was
           approximately 0.05 mm, while in the second 0.25 mm
           was typical. Such a procedure allowed the study of
           individual cross sections as a function of target
           thickness in order to correct for any possible
           production via secondary reactions.

COMMENT     (By authors) The reported cross sections are based
           only upon the 22-Na and 7-Be monitor reactions in Al.
           While these monitors gave comparable results, cross
           sections calculated relative to 24-Na production
           were observed to be consistently 10-20%
             Although this is the correct direction for
           possible secondary interferences in this monitor
           reaction (primarily from the fast-neutron induced
           27-Al(n,alpha)24-Na reaction, our results are not
           compatible with the expected secondary rate, nor
           did we observe any appreciable differences in
           thick-target vs. thin-target experiments.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are on standard deviation of
           our individual experimental values, including a
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the detector efficiency
           calibration.
             Errors do not encompass any uncertainties
           in the monitor cross sections, however.
