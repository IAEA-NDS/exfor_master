SAMPLE     Targets of About 1 Mg/Cm**2 Thickness were Prepared by
           Vacuum Evaporation of Natural Rubidium Chloride on 7
           Mg/Cm**2 Aluminium Backing. The Target Thickness was
           Measured by Weighting the Foils Before and After
           Deposition of the Target Material. The Target Assembly
           Consisted of a Number of Rubidium Targets Sandwiched
           Between Aluminium Catcher and Degrader Foils.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV) The Duration of Each Irradiation was About 3
           Hours and the Beam Current was Aroun 300 Nanoampere.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Error Includes Contribution from the
           Counting Statistics and Peak Inegration (<=5%),
           Detector Efficiency (5%), Beam Current Integration (8%)
           And Target Thickness (6%), But not Those of the
           Spectroscopic Data Used in the Analysis.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Natural Rubidium Contains About 27.8%
           Rb-87. At Some Bombarding Energies the Same Product
           Nucleus can Therefore be Formed from the Two Isotopes
           Rb-85 and Rb-87 by Different Reaction Channels. To
           Avoid any Complication Due to the Presence Rb-87, the
           Alpha-Energy Range For any Particular Reaction Channel
           Was Selected in Such a Way That Rb-87 Could not
           Contribute Significantly to the Production of the
           Nucleus of Interest.

REACTION   (37-RB-85(A,2N)39-Y-87,,SIG,,,EXP)
COMMENT    - By Authors - In the Case of Y-87, the Half Lives of
           The Isomeric State and Ground State are Comparable.
           Therefore Their Yields were Measured Independently and
           From the Sum of the Yields of Y-87-G and Y-87-M, the
           Production Cross Section of Y-87 was Determined.
