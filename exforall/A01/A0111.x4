FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     Targets of about 1 mg/cm**2 thickness were prepared by
           vacuum evaporation of natural rubidium chloride on
           7 mg/cm**2 aluminium backing. The target thickness was
           measured by weighting the foils before and after
           deposition of the target material. The target assembly
           consisted of a number of rubidium targets sandwiched
           between aluminium catcher and degrader foils.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV) The duration of each irradiation was about
           3 hours and the beam current was around 300 nanoampere.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error includes contribution from:
           (ERR-S,,5.) Uncertainty in counting statistics and peak
                      integration
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in detector efficiency (5%),
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in beam current integration (8%)
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in target thickness (6%),
             but not those of the spectroscopic data used
             in the analysis.
           (EN-ERR) Any analysis is absent.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(A,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)   The monitor was
                                          used to cross checking.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Natural rubidium contains about 27.8%
           Rb-87. At some bombarding energies the same product
           nucleus can therefore be formed from the two isotopes
           Rb-85 and Rb-87 by different reaction channels. To
           avoid any complication due to the presence Rb-87, the
           alpha-energy range for any particular reaction channel
           was selected in such a way that Rb-87 could not
           contribute significantly to the production of the
           nucleus of interest.

REACTION   (37-RB-85(A,2N)39-Y-87,,SIG)
COMMENT    - By Authors - In the case of Y-87, the half lives of
           the isomeric state and ground state are comparable.
           Therefore their yields were measured independently and
           from the sum of the yields of Y-87-g and Y-87-m, the
           production cross section of Y-87 was determined.
