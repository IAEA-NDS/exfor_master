ANALYSIS   (AREA)
SAMPLE     THE LEAD FOILS WERE ANALYZED SPECTROSCOPICALLY
           FOR INTERFERING IMPURITIES, THE AMOUNTS OF THESE
           WERE FOUND TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. THE STACKS, USED FOR
           THE DETERMINATION OF EXCITATION FUNCTIONS AND THICK
           TARGET YIELDS, WERE DURING THE IRRADIATIONS INTERLAID
           BY COPPER AND ALUMINIUM FOILS.
COMMENT     (BY AUTHORS).NO ABSOLUTE BEAM ENERGY DETERMINATION
           WAS PERFORMED IN THIS EXPERIMENT. ON THE BASIS OF
           OTHER DETERMINATIONS OF THE EXTERNAL BEAM OF BUENOS
           ARIES SYNCHROCYCLOTRON, WE ASSUMED AN ENERGY OF
           55.0 MEV FOR ALPHA PARTICLES WITH AN ERROR OF 0.55 MEV
           IN EACH CASE THE TARGET STACK WAS THICK ENOUGH TO STOP
           THE 55.0 MEV EXTERNAL ALPHA-BEAM. THE UNCERTAINTY IN
           THE INCIDENT PARTICLE ENERGY FOR EACH DATA POINT
           ARISES FROM THE ENERGY SPREAD OF THE INCIDENT ALPHA-
           PARTICLE BEAM AS WELL AS FROM THE STRAGGLING ENERGY
           LOSSES. EFFECTIVE ENERGY SPREADS OF 0.5 MEV WERE
           OBTAINED FOR 10 MEV ALPHA-PARTICLES.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).THE AREAS OF ALL GAMMA-PEAKS OBSERVED WERE
           CORRECTED FOR EFFICIENCY OF DETECTION AND THE ACTIVITI-
           ES OF THE RADIOACTIVE PRODUCTS WERE CALCULATED SEPARA-
           TELY FOR EACH PEAK ON THE BASIS OF THE NUCLEAR DATA.
           FOIL THICKNESS AND ALPHA PARTICLES FLUX WERE MEASURED
           AND USED TO CALCULATE PRODUCTION CROSS SETCOINS FOR
           EACH OF THE ACTIVE ISOTOPES FOUND IN EACH FOIL.NO COR-
           RECTIONS WERE MADE EITHER FOR THE ENERGY SPREAD AT
           EACH FOIL /AS RESULTING FROM FOIL THICKNESS VARIATIONS/
           OR FOR ENERGY LOSSES AT THE PRECEDING FOILS. THE EVEN-
           TUAL LOSSES OF REACTION PRODUCTS BY RECOIL WERE
           ASSUMED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.AS FOR ANY REACTION THAT MIGH
           OCCUR DUE TO SECONDARY NEUTRONS, ADDITIONAL FOILS WERE
           SET UP BEYOND THE LANGE OF ALPHA PARTICLES. SPECTRA
           FROM THOSE FOILS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION
           TO OUR DATA. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE CROSS-SECTION VALUES
           WERE ESTIMATED BY PROPAGATING IN SQUARE THE
           CONTRIBUTIONS FOR BOTH DECAY CURVE AND PEAK ANALYSES
           /THE LATTER INCLUDING COUNTIG STATISTICS/,
           ABSOLUTE DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES, DISINTEGRATION
           SCHEMES, TARGET THICKNESSES AND ALPHA PARTICLES FLUX.
