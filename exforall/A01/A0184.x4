TITLE      Production of 77-Br by various nuclear reactions
REFERENCE  (J,ARI,30,79,1979)
AUTHOR     (T.Nozaki,M.Iwamoto,Y.Itoh)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNIPC)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNTOK). For 52 MeV protons.
           (ISOCY,2JPNIRS).For 35 MeV protons.
           (CYCLO,2JPNIPC). For 16 MeV protons and 40 and 20 MeV
           alpha-particle.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB)
           (CHSEP). Kr-76 and Kr-77 were measured after being
           extracted.
SAMPLE     The target unit for stacks were prepared as follow-
           for the Se+p and As+alpha reactions, uniform layers of
           Ba-Se-O/3 and Mg/2-As/2-O/7, respectively, made by
           precipitation from their acetonic suspensions were
           dried and sealed in aluminum Foils. For the Br+p
           reaction, powder of Na-Br was pressed into disks and
           sealed in aluminum foil envelopes. Thicknesses of
           the layers or disks were 10-100 mg/cm**2 for barium
           salt,10/20 mg/cm**2 for 'As' salt,200-250 mg/cm**2 for
           Na-Br.

ADD-RES    (TTY-C). Chemical separation method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute cross section might involve
           up to 25% error owing to uncertainties in target
           thickness, current integrator reading and gamma-ray
           counting efficiency.  Beside these experimental
           uncertainties, interference of 76-As and  77-As
           should be taken into account in non-destructive
           measurement of 76-Br and 77-Br, respectively.
