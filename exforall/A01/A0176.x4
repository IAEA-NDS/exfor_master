SAMPLE     EACH STACK CONSISTED OF UP TO 20 MO FOILS /PURITY
           IS BETTER 99.9 PER CENT/ OF DIMETER 15 MM AND
           THICKNESS BETWEEN 10 AND 22 MUMETERS.
COMMENT     (BY COMPILER).AUTHORS HAD NOT REPORTED ANY MUMERICAL
           REACTIONS. I QUOTE AUTHORS' TEXT ' OUR MEASURED
           EXCITATION FUNCTIONS FOR THE FORMATION OF 94-RU AND
           97-RU UP TO E/A=28 MEV WERE FOUND TO BE IN AGREEMENT
           WITH THE DATA GRAF AND MUNZEL. THE VALUES OF ESTERLUN
           AND PATE FOR THE AORMATION OF 95-RU IN THE REGION
           OF THE MAXIMUM OF THE EXCITATION FUNCTION ARE LOWER
           THAN OU VALUES AS WELL AS THOSE OF GRAF AND MUNZEL.
           BY A FAYTOR ABOUT 2. IN OTHER REGIONS, HOWEVER, THE
           AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR VALUES AND THOSE ESTERLUND AND
           AND PATE AND GRAF AND MUNZEL WAS GENERALLY GOOD.
