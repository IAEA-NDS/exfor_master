           (J,ANS,5,22,1962) A part of data, presented in the main
           ref., values are almost the same as in the main ref.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMTR)
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) The thermal-energy neutrons were obtained at
           the face of the MTR thermal column with about 11 ft
           of graphite moderator between the reactor fuel and
           the samples.
           Between 0.04 and 0.5 eV, irradiations were done with
           monoenergetic neutrons provided by the MTR beryllium-
           crystal neutron spectrometer.
           Very low-energy neutrons were obtained by using the
           MTR 'Cold Neutron' facility. Studies were carried out
           with beryllium-filtered neutrons of mean energy about
           of 0.004 eV and carbon-filtered neutrons about of
           0.002eV.
