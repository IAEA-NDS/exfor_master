TITLE      Low energy eta measurements
AUTHOR     (J.R.Smith,S.D.Reeder)
REFERENCE  (P,IN-1407,39,197012)
           (W,SMITH,198203) Reanalysis of data.
           (R,EPRI-NP-3436,(3),1984) Final values are often
           given without uncertainty as relative values of eta
           to 0.060 eV values.
INSTITUTE  (1USAMTR)
FACILITY   (SPECC,1USAINL) Mica crystal spectrometer with
           mechanical neutron filter.
METHOD     (MANGB) A 51 cm diameter manganese bath to measure
           fission neutrons.
DETECTOR   (BF3) A B(F)3 proportional counter behind the sample
           to measure neutron transmission.
CORRECTION Original corrections for sample transmission, fast
           multiplication, sample scattering, impurities and
           bath leakage were reanalyzed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error
           (MONIT-ERR) statistical error in normalizing value
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from private comm., Smith, 1982/3.

SAMPLE     Six 233-U foils, each about 0.066 cm thick. 1.64 and
           1.31 cm cadmium spacers separate the first and second
           and second and third foils respectively. No spacers
           were used to separate the remaining foils.
