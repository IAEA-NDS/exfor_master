TITLE      Fission yields of Ba139 and Ba140 in neutron fission
            of U235 and U238

INC-SOURCE (RA-BE)  Radium-beryllium neutron source.
SAMPLE     U-oxide - natural uranium.
           The samples were irradiated in paraffin and in air
METHOD     (CHSEP)
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,ABS),,ALF,,MXW) Taken as 2/3.
DECAY-DATA ((1.)56-BA-139,86.MIN,B-)
           ((2.)56-BA-140,12.7D,B-)
DETECTOR   The Beta - particle counters were of the end-on type,
           with windows of area 7.1 cm2 and mass thickness
           4.5 mgm/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS No information on uncertainty.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,SPA)
             - for thermal neutron fission of U-235
INC-SPECT  Spectrum moderated by paraffin block
ANALYSIS   Thermal neutron values were obtained by difference
           between the activities formed in the irradiation of
           samples in aluminium and cadmium vessels.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,SPA)
             - for fast fission of U-238
INC-SPECT  Spectrum moderated by paraffin block
CORRECTION The U235 in the natural uranium samples was
           fissioned by fast neutrons as well, although the
           fission cross-sections of U235 are lower than
           by thermal neutrons. No correction for this
           was made.
