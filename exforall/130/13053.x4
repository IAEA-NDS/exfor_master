REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,FIS)
             - for fast fission of U-238
CORRECTION The U235 in the natural uranium samples was
           fissioned by fast neutrons as well, although the
           fission cross-sections of U235 are lower than
           by thermal neutrons. No correction for this
           was made.
