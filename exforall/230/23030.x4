INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 98 MeV proton beam of about 5 microA hitting a
           thick lithium target enriched isotopically in Li-7 to
           99.98%.
INC-SPECT   Resulting neutron spectrum consisted of high-energy
            peak at 94.8+-0.5 MeV with energy spread of 2.7 MeV
            (FWHM)and low-energy tail,suppressed by TOF technique.
          1At MEDLEY target position 9.15m after Li target,neutron
           beam was about 8cm in diameter and intensity of about
           5.E+4 1/s/cm**2.
          2At SCANDAL target position 10.70m after Li target,
           neutron beam was about 9 cm diameter and intensity
           about 4.E+4 1/s/cm**2.
DETECTOR  1(TELES) MEDLEY :
           Vacuum chamber was cylinder of 80 cm diameter.
           Eight telescopes on rails emerging radially at 20 deg
           separation on rotatable table.
           (CSICR) Two silicon detectors (thin 50 or 60 microm and
           thick 400 or 500 microm available) and one thick CsI
           detector(to detect protons up to 110 MeV energy) could
           be mounted inside each telescope.
            Uncertainty of typically 1.5% in the effective
           detection area.
            Two fission detectors were mounted after the 0.1 mm
           thick stainless foil at exit of chamber for  relative
           monitoring of neutron fluence -
           (TFBC) one based on thin-film breakdown counters,
           (IOCH) other on ionization chamber.
          2  SCANDAL:
            Two identical arms rotated around target position,
            each equipped with
           (SCIN) 2mm thick veto scintillator for charged-particle
            rejection, two converter scintillators of 20 and 10 mm
            thickness for neutron-proton conversion, 2mm thick
            deltaE plastic scintillator for triggering,
           (DRFTC)  two drift chambers for proton tracking,
            another 2mm thick deltaE plastic scintillator for
            triggering,
           (CSICR) array of twelve CsI detectors for angular bins.
           Proton energy resolution 3.7 MeV (FWHM) average.
SAMPLE    1 MEDLEY:
           Four different targets were used:
           1) C-D2 target of 2.0cm x 4.0cm rectangle of
             280 microm thickness.
           2) C target of 2.5 cm diameter disk , 150 microm
              thickness.
           3) C-H2 thick target of 2.5 cm diameter disk,
              1000 microm thickness.
           4) C-H2 thin target of 2.0 cm x 4.0cm rectangle of
              200 microm thickness.
              Runs without target and with empty target
              were performed for background subtraction.
          2 SCANDAL:
             Proton/deuteron detection mode:
             Multi-target was used.
             Three most downstream targets -
           1) C-D2 target as disk of 7.0cm diameter, 1060 microm
              thickness.
           2) C target as disk of 8.0 cm diameter, 500 microm
              thickness.
           3) C-H2 target as sheet covering the whole beam area,
              of 380 microm thickness.
              Neutron detection mode:
            Targets were used one at a time.
           1) H2-O target as 1 liter water contained in aluminum
              can.
           2) D2-O target as 1 liter of heavy water contained in
              aluminum can.
           3) EMPTY target as empty aluminum can of 8.5 cm
              diameter, 18 cm height.
           4) C target as cylinder of 8 cm diameter, 16 cm height.
METHOD    1     MEDLEY : ND scattering. Elastic peaks were well
            isolated.
           (EDE) Particle identification by deltaE/E techniques.
            Main source of error was balance between deuteron
            loses and proton contamination from deuteron break.
           (TOF) Time of flight between trigger signal and
           radio-frequency signal from cyclotron was measured to
           reject events from low-energy neutrons.
           Spectra obtained without target were subtracted,
           then C spectra were subtracted from C-H2 and C-D2
           spectra to obtain (n,p) and (n,d) elastic peaks.
           Elastic peaks were fitted by Gaussian and integrated
           to obtain number of elastic events.
          2     SCANDAL:
           Essentially the same method as for MEDLEY, performed
           with another detector setup.
           In proton/deuteron detection mode-multitarget was used,
            veto and converter detectors were removed.
            nd data were normalized using (n,p) data.
            Diameter of C-H2 target effective area was found to be
            about 9 cm.
            For each target and each angular bin, after particle
            identification, TOF selection, CsI window selection
            and correction for MTGT efficiency, the accepted
            events were projected as energy histograms, normalized
            to the same neutron fluence.
           In neutron detection mode scattered neutrons were
           detected by additional plastic scintillators (veto and
           two converters) to tracking protons from (n,p)reactions
            After corrections for multiple scattering and
            attenuation in the target, events were projected as
            neutron energy histograms. EMPTY target spectra were
            subtracted. To extract (n,p) and (n,d) elastic events
            from H2-O and D2-O spectra, oxygen background have to
            be subtracted - carbon spectra were used to simulate
            the oxygen background in H2-O.
ANALYSIS  2 Spectra for collective states in C-12(n,inl) and
            O-16(n,inl) were fitted in the range down to 20 MeV
            below the elastic peak as the sum of four Gaussian
            curves, corresponded to elastic peak and different
            excited states.For carbon Gaussians at 4.4 MeV for
            "first" level, 9.6 MeV for "second" and arbitrarily
            set at 18 MeV to account for higher energy states.
            For oxygen - 6.6, 10.4, 18 MeV, respectively.
            Contribution from excited state Gaussians have been
            subtracted, number of elastic events was obtained by
            integrating the peaks in these spectra.

            (n,p) elastic scattering differential cross-section
            at 96 MeV of Rahm+, which in turn were re-normalized
            by 0.7% using data of Johansson+ (see REL-REF).

CORRECTION2 Correction for neutron multiple scattering and
            attenuation inside targets before oxygen background
            subtraction. Attenuation correction coefficients were
            calculated from carbon and oxygen reaction cross
            sections and (n,p) and (n,d) total cross-sections
            using MC simulation. Attenuation in carbon - 17.3%,
            in oxygen- 10.5%,in hydrogen- 1.2%, in deuterium-2.0%.
            Total attenuation effect 17.3% for C target,
            11.5% for H2-O target, 12.3% for D2-O target.
            Corrections for multiple scattering were typically 2%,
            with at most a 4% loss of events at smallest angle and
            50% gain at largest angle.MC and MCNPX codes were
            used.

            and large angles, with negligible systematic error.

EN-SEC     (E-LVL-MEAN,8-O-16) Energy of "first" excited state,

            7.1 MeV.
