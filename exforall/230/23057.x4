SAMPLE      This double-sided Cf-252 source produced in Radium
            Institute, St Petersburg, by self-transfer method
            onto 22 microg/cm*82 aluminum oxide support backing
            with a 10 microg/cm**2 layer of gold.
            Activity of 500 fis/sec.
METHOD     (TOF)   Particle separation based on the E vs TOF
                   analysis.
           (COINC) Coincidence of LCP and both FFs.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SI,PLATE,SI)
           - 10 unshielded silicon p-i-n diode detectors
            (380 microg thickness, 30x30 mm**2 area) for LCP
           detection. Placed at 20 cm from Cf-source.
           - Micro channel plate detector (MCP) at 2.5 cm distance
           from Cf-source. For FF registration to give start
           signal.
           - 2 silicon p-i-n diodes of 20x20 mm**2 area (roof
           detectors) at 6 cm distance from Cf-source, opposite
           MCP. For coincident registration of complementary
           fragments.
            Energy threshold  =< 0.5 MeV.
            At high energy the ternary alpha-particle spectrum is
            cut off at 27.5 MeV due to the limited detector
            thickness of 380 microm; for H-3 particles - 11.5 MeV.
            Energy calibration of silicon detectors was performed
            with alpha-lines from spectroscopic thin Ra-226 source
            and BNC PB5 precision pulse generator, to better than
            50 keV (FWHM).
           Nominal thickness of aluminum layer on entrance of
           silicon detectors 140 nm.
           Detector geometry registered alpha-particles with angle
           between ternary particle and LF from 55 deg to 13 deg.
           Efficiency function has FWHM of 33 deg around 92 deg
           mean angle.
CORRECTION  For energy loss - 110 keV for 1 MeV alpha-particles,
            30 keV for 10 MeV alpha-particles.
            Measured TOF spectra of ternary particles were
            corrected for
            - the difference in flight time between heavy and
            light fragment masses from source to MCP;
            - the wider than detected angular interval of
            equatorial particles, best defined as in range
           50 - 130 deg according to P.Heeg data;
           - full span of angles, including polar emission, as
           measured in REL-REFs of C.Wagemans+, Yu.Kopatch+,
           V.Tishchenko+ .
