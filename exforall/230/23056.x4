           fission neutron spectrum.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Pulsed proton beam of about 1-1.5 ns FWHM at
            repetition rate 1.25 MHz, average current 0.5 microA.
           Li-7(p,n) reaction on LiF target of 596 microg/cm**2
           thickness.
INC-SPECT   Mono-energetic neutrons of 0.52 MeV average energy.
            The actual neutron energy range due to LiF target
            thickness and geometrical factor  extended from
            0.41 MeV to 0.58 MeV.
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL) 7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
           Pulse mode operation at VdG with FWHM between 1-1.5 ns.
METHOD     (TOF) Fast neutron time-of-flight technique.
            Time resolution of neutron TOF spectrometer consist of
            components: detector resolution,shape of pulse from
            accelerator,neutron distribution inside the sample.
           (PSD) Traditional  neutron-gamma-ray discrimination
           technique (pulse-shape analysis) was applied for
           gamma-ray reduction.
SAMPLE     Metallic U-235 sample (93.15 % enrichment) ,weight
           161.28 g consists of 10 concentric rings canned in an
           aluminum  container of 0.2 mm wall thickness. Outside
           diameter of rings 3.00 cm, inside - 2.12 cm, height
           2.41 cm.
           Similar sized lead sample was applied for background
           measurements.
           Sample was placed at 5 cm and 8 cm from the neutron
           producing target at 0 deg. angle with low-mass holder.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,SCIN) Up to three NE213-equivalent liquid
           scintillators of 10.2 cm diameter and 5.1 cm or 2.5 cm
           length, coupled to XP4312/B photomultipliers. All were
           placed in large collimating shields made of lithium
           carbonate, paraffin, lead.
           The distances between the center of scintillators and
           sample were 273.0 +- 0.5 cm for the detector at 90 deg
           and 240.0 +- 0.5 cm for the one at 120 deg relative to
           the proton beam axis detectors. The flight path was
           224 +- 1 cm when using the three identical detectors
            (5.1 cm length) at 90, 150, and 120 deg. Additional
           copper cylinder was placed between target and detectors
           to reduce the direct gamma-ray and neutron flux from
           the target. Traditional n/g discrimination technique
           was applied for gamma-ray reduction.
           Another detector based on a PilotU plastic scintillator
             (diameter 3 cm, height 2 cm) mounted to XP2020Q
           photomultiplier as monitor of the proton pulses.
           Detector efficiencies were measured for all neutron
           detectors simultaneously, relative to 252-Cf standard
           spectrum - 252-Cf source inside a low mass, fast
           ionization chamber developed at IRMM and put at place
           of the U-sample keeping the same geometry. Total time
           resolution (FWHM) for a neutron threshold of about
           0.5MeV,estimated from the 252Cf efficiency measurement,
           is 1.5 ns for the detector at 90 deg. and 1.3 ns for
           the one at 120 deg. The gamma-ray suppression was about
           1/200 for both detectors.
CORRECTION Energy distributions were corrected for detector
           efficiencies,for neutron multiple scattering in sample,
           for time resolution.
ANALYSIS   TOF spectra for uranium and lead were normalized to the
           elastic peak.
           Exp. PFNS were normalized  to unity and the average
           secondary neutron energy was calculated.
           Maxwellian spectrum was fitted in the energy range of
           0.7 - 1.5 MeV and 9-11 MeV to the measured spectrum,
           and extrapolation to zero and to 20 MeV was performed.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data.
            Data of spectra received from N.Kornilov 17.03.2009.
