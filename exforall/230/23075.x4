FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNTOK) Yayoi reactor, University of Tokyo.
           Digital processing system ORTEC D-sec as data
           acquisition system, shaping time for processing signals
           from preamplifier was set as 6 microsec.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation . Irradiation period 3.3167 h .
           (PHD) Pulse height spectrum from irradiated Np-237
           sample is given on Fig.2. Measurement of spectrum was
           repeated twice -started about 18 and 40 h after
           irradiation.
           Dead time of gamma-ray processing system was about
           0.5- 0.6 % for Np-237, and about 0.3% for gold monitor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) After sample setting, the reactor power was
           increased up to 2000 W and was stable at 2000+-10 W.
           Then reactor power was decreased exponentially.
SAMPLE     Small amount of Np237 sample of 0.1159 mg, number of
           atoms 2.946E+17.
           Prepared using Standardized Solution of Np-237 by
           Amersham PLC. Seventy-microliter HCl solution of Np-237
           including about s kBq activity was dropped in quartz
           tube (1mm wall thickness, about 30 mm length, 6mm outer
           diameter) and dried by infrared lamp. The number of
           Np-237 nuclei in sample was determined by measured
           gamma-ray intensity of Pa-233. Time between solution
           product and irradiation in this study - about 2 years.
           Sample was wrapped in Al foil together with gold foil
            (0.1 mm thickness, weight 5.6395+-0.0001 mg, chemical
           purity 99.95%, number of Au-197 atoms 1.7223E+19),
           used as neutron flux monitor. Sample in polyethylene
           capsule was set in the canter of the core in the "Glory
           hole" of YAYOI reactor with position precision of less
           than 1 cm using Al holder.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity N-type Ge detector for gamma-ray
           intensity measurement. 90 % efficiency relative to
           7.6cm long and 7.6cm diameter NaI(Tl) detector and
           2.4 keV FWHM at 1333 keV gamma-peak of Co-60.
           Sample was set at 150.0+-0.5 mm distance from the end
           window of Ge detector.Sample and detector were shielded
           by lead blocks of 5-10 cm thickness.
           Full-energy peak efficiency of Ge detector was
           calibrated using standard gamma-ray sources:
           Ba-133 (calibrated with precision 2 % (2sigma)),
           Co-60 (calibrated with precision 1.5% (2sigma)),
           Eu-152 ( relative large uncertainty 8.7% on absolute
           activity, it was renormalized by measured gamma-ray
           intensities of Co-60 source).

REACTION   (93-NP-237(N,G)93-NP-238,,SIG,,SPA)
ANALYSIS   Np-237(n,g) reaction rate was determined from measured
           activities as (2.71+- 0.13)*10**-13 1/sec,
           Au-197(n,g) - (1.209+-0.025)*10**-13 1/sec.
           Energy dependence on neutron flux at irradiation point
           as 107 group data ( calculated using Monte Carlo
           simulation code MCNP) was normalized using the gold
           activation foil.
           107 groupwise neutron capture cross sections for Np-237
           and Au-187 were calculated using ENDF/B-VII.o and
           JENDL-3.3 evaluated libraries.
           Ratio C/E of calculated reaction rate to experimental
           one was determined using evaluated libraries:
             for Np-237(n,g)
           ENDF/B-VII.0      0.88+-0.03
           JENDL-3.3         0.75+-0.02
           JENDL/AC-2008     0.77+-0.02
             for Au-197(n,g)
           ENDF/B-VII.0      0.89+-0.02
           JENDL/D99         0.87+-0.02
           Reaction rates ratio C/E for Np-237 were renormalized
           using  Au-197(n,g) data:
                             from ENDF/B-VII.0  from JENDL/D99
           ENDF/B-VII.0      0.99+-0.05         1.00+-0.05
           JENDL-3.3         0.85+-0.04         0.86+-0.04
           JENDL/AC-2008     0.87+-0.04         0.89+-0.04
           Representative neutron energy was defined as point, at
           which the normalized ( to 1.) sum of reaction rate is
           equal 0.5.
           Corresponding capture cross section was calculated by
           dividing the cross section in data library
             (at representative energy) by C/E value.
           Measured cross-section at 214 keV representative energy
           agrees well with ENDF/B-VII.0. Cross section at
           representative energy 185 keV is about 15 % higher than
           JENDL-3.3 , that at 182 keV is about 13% higher than
           JENDL/AC-2008.
