FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) PGAA facility at the Research reactor
            FRM II .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Neutron beam at sample position had maximum flux
           7.3E+9 n/(cm**2.sec) . The spectrum at the end of
           neutron guide had a Maxwell-like distribution with
           average wavelength of 6.7 Angstrom (1.83 meV).
SAMPLE     The samples of isotopically enriched GeO2 (87.1+-1.2)%
           of Ge-76. Ge)2 powder was pressed into pills of 12 mm
           diameter, about 2 mm thickness.
           Gold foil of the same diameter was put behind the pill
           to obtain neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors provided by PGAA setup to
            measure accumulated activity of Ge-77g and Ge-77m.
METHOD     (ACTIV)Irradiation times for Ge-77m 60s-180s ,
            for Ge-77g - 1200s-1800s.
            Measurement of decay spectrum started few second after
            end of irradiation for Ge-77m.

            shielding and efficiency. Further corrections - for
            neutron self shielding in the sample.
CRITIQUE   Of authors.
           Cross section extracted from measured yields of gammas
           211 keV and 215 keV and emission probabilities from
           REL-REF Farhan+ is about 14 % lower than c-s of this
           experiment.
           Using the gamma ray intensities from REL-REF Ng+
           for 211 and 215 gamma-rays, the cross section 73.7 mb
           was obtained.
           Gamma ray emission probabilities of REL-REFs
           are not consistent and both are inconsistent with data
           of this experiment.

CORRECTION   Data not corrected for feeding from isomer.
ANALYSIS    Partial cross sections for the different energies were
            calculated relatively to capture cross section of Au,
            considering the times for activation, measurement
            itself and time waited between irradiation and
            measurement.By dividing the partial cross section with
            specific emission probabilities from REL-REF Farhan+
            a cross section was obtained, giving the measured
            overall probability to populate the ground state.

ANALYSIS  1 Direct cross section to ground state was evaluated by
            correcting c-s of Subent 002 for the feeding from the
            shorter lived isomeric state.
            Error is affected by large uncertainty of the
            branching ratio of IT from Ge-77m to Ge-77.

ANALYSIS    Cross section for Ge-77m state was calculated via B-
            decay.
CRITIQUE   Of authors. Cross section calculated via B- decay is
           14% higher than the one using IT. This effect is due to
           the rather large uncertainties of gamma-ray intensities
           or a wrong branching ratio of IT in REL-REF Farhan+.
