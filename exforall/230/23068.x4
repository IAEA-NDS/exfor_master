SAMPLE     Disc of 62.214 g of metallic bismuth with a purity >
           99.99%, diameter 81.0 mm, thickness 1.26 mm,
           corresponding to 4.38E-3 at/b; positioned
           perpendicularly to neutron beam.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)  Accelerator operated at 800 Hz ,
           60 microA average electron current. Electron pulses of
           1 ns width with 100 MeV average electron energy.
           800 hours of nominal accelerator operation.
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) Electron pulses 1 ns width with 100 MeV average
           electron energy. Moderated neutron beam was collimated
           to about 80mm in diameter at sample position.
            4.16E-3 at/b thick B-10 anti-overlap filter and
           permanent 30 mm thick Pb filter were used to reduce
           effect of overlap neutrons and gamma-flash.
INC-SPECT   High neutron flux . Resolution sufficient to resolve
           resonances up to 20 keV.
METHOD     (TOF) 12 m flight path. Angle between the flight path
           and the direction of electron beam was 72 degrees.
           To optimize the experimental conditions, particular
           care was given to the reduction of background by using
           an appropriate lead and boric acid shielding around
           the measurement area.
           (GSPEC) Experimental gamma-ray spectra up to deposited
           energy (Ed) of 1.5 MeV were obtained for 6 energy
           regions around Bi-209 neutron resonances at 0.80, 2.32,
            3.35, 4.46, 5.11, 6.53 keV.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Three high-purity germanium detectors
           Large volume coaxial detector - to study gamma-ray
           spectra up to an energy of 8 MeV; placed at 125 degrees
           with respect to the neutron beam.
           Two planar detectors -to investigate gamma-ray spectrum
           in the low energy part; placed at 55 and 125 degrees
           with respect to the neutron beam.
           Detectors were shielded with Li-6NH(2) and Li-6(2)CO(3)
           caps together with Li-6F sheets.

DECAY-DATA (32-GE-75,,DG,139.96)
           139.96 keV gamma-ray from Ge-75, 511.06keV annihilation
           gamma-ray and 870.56 keV gamma-ray from O-17 were used
           for an off-line adjustment of the gain using the most
           recent version of AGL code.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The data, measured with the planar detector
           positioned at 125 degrees with respect to the neutron
           beam, were analyzed, monitored weekly by measuring a
           Eu-152 calibration source.
           Effective gamma-ray detection efficiency was deduced
           with Monte Carlo simulation, using the MCNP code. MCNP
           model was validated with measurements using a
           well-characterized Eu-152 source. The model efficiency
           reproduced the measured efficiency within 5%.
           To deduce the full energy net peak areas, gamma-ray
           spectra were analyzed with spectrum analysis program
           Hypermet-PC [10].
           Net peak areas for the observed gamma-rays ranging from
           0.1 MeV to 1.5 MeV were obtained.
           The branching ratio was obtained by calculating the
           ratio between the sum of the resulting relative partial
           cross sections of the transition feeding the ground
           state and the isomeric state.
CORRECTION Net peak areas were corrected for the effective
           gamma-ray detection efficiency and for the internal
           conversion effect.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty results from :
           (ERR-1) 5% uncertainty adopted on the gamma-ray
            efficiency,
            and the uncertainty of the full energy net peak area.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary branching ratio as a function of
           neutron energy for 6 energy regions (0.80, 2.32, 3.35,
           4.46, 5.11, 6.53 keV) are given in Fig.5 of C,2007NICE.
            Request for the data was sent to A.Borella 07.07.2009.
            Answer 08.07.2009: "NOT to extract any data from the
            figures in the article " .
