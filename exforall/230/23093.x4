           (R,22653001,E.Kim+,J,NSE,129,209,1998)  Data of
            E.Kim+ were used to estimate peak-to-total ratio
            individually for (n,4n),(n,5n), (n,7n) reactions.

           Total cross-sections for Bi and concrete target
           reported by R.Finlay+ and W.Abfalterer+ were used
           to calculate neutron beam attenuation.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOH)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Quasimonoenergetic  neutrons were produced by
            protons impinging on Li-nat-target (92.5% of Li-7) via
            Li-7(p,n) reaction. 70 MeV proton beam from K=110 MeV
            AVF cyclotron of CYRIC. Thickness of Li plate was
           measured to be 4.74 mm (2 MeV energy loss for 70 MeV
           proton) using a micrometer with error less 0.05 mm.
           1 m collimator of copper and iron.
           Li target was surrounded by concrete and steel shield
           to reduce background.
INC-SPECT   Neutron spectrum consists of full-energy peak due to
           Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction and smooth continuum component
           attributable to multi-body breakup process.
           TOF data were used for a part of continuum spectrum
           close to peak and lower energy part was estimated
           using formula of M.Baba+ (1999, see REL-REF).
           Neutron spectrum is shown on Fig.2 of J,ANE,36,2009.
           Total (peak+ continuum) flux 2.60E+6 n/cm**2/sec,
           peak neutron fluence 1.34E+6 n/cm**2/sec.
           Ratio of peak neutrons to total neutron yield in the
           spectrum was found about 0.48 .
METHOD    1(TOF)   Neutron spectrum was measured by TOF technique.
          2(ACTIV) 2.5 hr irradiation.
           (STTA)  Bi-Conc-Conc-Bi stacked samples were placed
                   250 cm from Li-target.
           (GSPEC) Induced nuclides activity was measured
           nondestructively using HPGe-gamma-ray spectroscopy.
DETECTOR  1(SCIN)  Organic liquid scintillation detector NE213 of
           14 cm diameter, 10 cm long, equipped with large dynamic
           range n-gamma discriminator. Placed at 7.65 m from
           Li-target.NE213 detection efficiency was obtained by
           SCINFUL-R Monte Carlo code (Meigo, 1997) with estimated
           error 10 %.

                  10 h.

           ordinary concrete samples (5 cm diameter, 2 cm thick)
           as Bi-Conc-Conc-Bi.
               Atom density of elements in ordinary concrete is:
                      (in n/cm**3 * 10**24 units)
           H  - 1.23E-2      Ca - 3.32E-4       K  -  4.41E-4

ANALYSIS   Activation of concrete by quasimonoenergetic neutrons
           was measured. Activation cross sections on bismuth
           was measured to confirm the experimental procedure.
            Reaction rates for formation radionuclides identified
           from the gamma-ray spectra and half-life were
           estimated. Decay data for the investigated nuclides
           were take from NUDAT2 : www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2 .
