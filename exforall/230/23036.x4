FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR BRC) Tandem 7 MV accelerator, beam nominal
                          frequency 2.5 MHz
INC-SOURCE (D-D,P-T)  5 - 10 MeV neutrons
           (D-T)     20 - 25 MeV neutrons
INC-SPECT  .Monoenergetic neutrons corresponding to the above
            given source reactions and broad low-energy tail.
            TOF technique was employed to select the neutrons
           corresponding to the monoenergetic peak.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A 4pi neutron detector called CARMEN is a large
            spherical neutron detector, constituted of two
            independent vertical hemispheres, 60cm outer-radius,
            15cm inner radius, each one filled with less than
            0.5 m3 of gadolinium-loaded scintillating liquid
            (BC521) used for counting the two outgoing neutrons.
            Efficiency measured by 252-Cf trigger is 80%
            diminishing to 75% at 20-25 MeV neutron energy.
           (SOLST) 12.5 cm diameter, 5cm thick NE213 scintillation
           detectors were used to monitor neutron beam:2
           one - to measure neutron flux, other - measure the
           energy of incident neutrons.
           NE213 neutron flux monitor was calibrated at seven
           neutron energies between 5.8 and 22MeV at the German
           Lab.of Neutron Metrology (PTB).Efficiency was measured
           for the same low-energy threshold as the one used in
           the present experiment, with an accuracy obtained
           reaches 2% at energies up to 12MeV and 4% beyond this
           point.
METHOD     (TOF)  Used for separation of sharp neutron beam from
                  the broad background .
           Flight path 13m from the neutron production target.
SAMPLE     .Active deuteron target as 12.5cm diameter x 5cm thick
            (2x2inch) aluminum cell containing the 103 cm3
           scintillating liquid. Detector placed in the reaction
           chamber of CARMEN .
           To take into account the (n,2n) reactions on elements
           B, C, Si, O, Al ( present inside or in the vicinity of
           the active target volume), dedicated runs were done
           with a C6H6 hydrogenated target, with the same
           dimensions and scintillating properties as the
           deuterated one.
           C6D6 target: 4.06E+22 H-2 atoms per cm**3, 3.55E+20
           H-1 atoms per cm**3, 4.10E+22 C atoms per cm**3.
           C6H6 target: 4.0955E+22 H-1 atoms per cm**3, 4.10E+22
           C atoms per cm**3.
CORRECTION The Monte Carlo simulation code SIM was used to
           calculate correction factors taking into account the
           energy resolution, the spatial neutron beam profile,
           detailed description of the target, every possible
           reaction, the energy-angle correlations between the
           two neutrons and the proton.
           Contribution of C6H6 was subtracted.
           Detector efficiency was checked by Cf-252 sample and
           MCNP code calculations.
           For neutron absorption in the target - transmission
           was measured by measuring the flux with and without
           the target. It varies between 50% to 70%, depending on
           the incident energy.
           The resulting correction factor from:
           - correction for the finite-geometry effects of the
           target;
           - correction for the 2H(n,2n)p reaction losses due to
           the proton recoil threshold;
           - correction for the extra 2H(n,2n) reactions occurring
           in the expansion chamber and detected in the active
           volume.
           Total correction was applied to the measured finite-
           geometry cross-section data and amounts to 4.1-4.3% for
           20-25MeV incident neutron energies, varies from 12.6%
           to 16.2% for 5-8 MeV incident neutron energies .
