DETECTOR   (TELES,NAICR) Darmstadt-Heidelberg Crystal Ball
           spectrometer as homogeneous and highly granulated 4PI
           neutron detector, combined with an efficient detection
           system for fission fragments and ternary particles.
           Crystal  ball (CB) is dense spherical package of 162
           NaI(Tl) crystals of 20 cm long, of high gamma-ray
           detection efficiency (>90%). Simultaneously
           to gamma-rays, the CB registers neutrons from fission
           with a efficiency of about 60% for En>= 2MeV, dropping
           down to about 50% for En below 0.5 MeV.
           Inside the CB a spherical space of 50 cm diameter
           the assembly of particle detectors was mounted in
           CH4-filled spherical aluminum vessel, contained the
           Cf-252 sample located at the center.
           (SPEC,IOCH) Kinematic spectrometer CODIS consists of
           Frisch-gridded 4-pi twin ionization chamber IC for
           measuring fission-fragment energies and emission angles
           and of a ring of 12 deltaE-E telescopes made from
           deltaE IC and silicon p-i-n diodes, with a solid
           angle of pi/4, surrounding one half of the fragment IC
           for measuring the LCPs. Angular resolutions FWHM =<5deg
           for both the fragments and LCPs.
SAMPLE     Cf-252 sample of 4E+3 fissions/s on thin backing .
METHOD     (TOF) Gamma-rays were separated from the neutrons by
           time-of-flight measurement from the Cf-252 sample to
           the crystals -distance 25 cm.
           (COINC) Coincidences between the ternary particles,
           fission fragments, and neutrons and gamma-rays.
           Simultaneously to TF events, 7.E+07 binary fissions
           were recorded, the data acquisition rate for this event
           type being reduced by a factor of 1/64.
           (PHD) Calibration of the CB pulse-height spectra in
           terms of gamma-energy was performed with various
           gamma-ray sources, following standard procedures.
           Threshold corresponding to 100 keV gamma-energy was set
           in all the pulse-height spectra.
CORRECTION For detector efficiency.
           For energy loss in absorber foil and the fission
           chamber

ANALYSIS   Li yield was obtained from Gaussian fit to measured
           energy spectrum with fixed E-LCP = 14.3+-1.0 MeV and
           FWHM=14.3+-1.0 MeV from  C.Wagemans, in Particle
           Emission from Nuclei, edited by D.N.Poenaru+,CRC Press,
           Boca Raton,1989, chapter 3.
           For the H-3 spectrum there is also an upper limit of
           11.5 MeV for full energy registration due to the
           limited thickness of the silicon detectors.
