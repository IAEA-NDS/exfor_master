SAMPLE      Oxygen presented in working gas of IOCH as target.
            Thin U-238 standard of 549 microg/cm**2 thickness and
            2.54 cm diameter as monitor of incident neutron  beam.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,IOCH) Time projection chamber TPC spectrometer.
           Main Frisch grid ionization chamber - diameter of
           electrodes 18 cm, cathode-to-anode distance 4cm,
           grid-to-anode distance 3 mm. Kr (97%) and CO2 (3%)
           mixture at 3 bar absolute pressure as working gas.
             For charge particles detection.
           Other ionization chamber for fission fragment detection
           with common cathode of main chamber.
           99% background suppression was achieved by TPC,
           80% - by conventional gridded ionization chamber.

METHOD     (PHD) Pulse amplitude spectra were defined.
           (ACTIV) For neutron beam profile measurement the
           activation method with threshold reactions on Al and In
           at neutron energies 7.4 and 2.5 MeV,respectively, was
           used.
           Novel method of fast neutron beam profiling allows to
           determine diameter of beam with uncertainty 0.1mm.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty of radii of the surfaces of the
            truncated cone - 0.1 mm or 1.1%.

           (ERR-3) Uncertainty of the pressure of detector gas -
                   0.1%.
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty of temperature of detector gas -
                   0.3%.
           (ERR-5) Uncertainty of content of CO2 -2%, as certified
                 by producer.
           (ERR-6) Overall uncertainty in the number of oxygen-16
                nuclei amounts to about 2.5%.
           (ERR-S,,5.) -Uncertainty arising from counting  of
            statistics of reaction and monitor events - less 5%.
           (ERR-7) Uncertainty arising from background
                suppression - 1.2%.
           (ERR-8) Uncertainty due to correction for neutron
            background from structural materials of the neutron
            sources - 1.5%.
           (ERR-9,,0.7) -Uncertainty of number of U-238 nuclei in
                monitor sample - less 0.7%.
           (ERR-10,,1.5) -Uncertainty due to determination of low
            energy monitor events by extrapolation - less 1.5%.
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic uncertainty - 4.4% .
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty - 6.6%.
