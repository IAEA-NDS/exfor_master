            Method of self-shielding coefficients determination.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNYOK)  Research reactor of Rikkyo University.
            Reactor power 100 kW.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation. Irradiation in rotary specimen rack
           of research reactor of Rikkyo University without Cd and
           with Cd . Cd capsule of 22 mm outer diameter, 63 mm
           outer length, 1.0 mm thickness.
           (SITA)  Single-target irradiation
           (GSPEC) Gamma-rays were measured for about 4 hr,
            spectrum data were saved every 10 min.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  Detector performance is characterized by the
            relative efficiency of 90% to a 7.6 cm thick and
            7.6 cm in diameter NaI(Tl) detector and an energy
            resolution 2.1 keV full width at half-maximum at
            1.33 MeV peak of Co-60.
            Photopeak detection efficiencies were measured with
            standard gamma-ray sources: Eu-152,Ba-133, Cs-137.

                             DG,1332.,0.999856)
             Half-life error 0.0005 year,
            intensities errors 0.000007 and 0.000004, respectively
           (79-AU-198,2.69517D,DG,412.,0.9558)
             Half-life error 0.00021 day, intensity error 0.0012.
INC-SPECT   Samples were irradiated with and without cadmium
            shield. Because 59Co and 197Au have different sensi-
            tivities to thermal and epithermal neutrons, monitor
            wires allow to determine the thermal and epithermal
            fractions of neutron flux. Thermal neutron flux at
            irradiation position was (4.54+-0.15)*10**11
            n/(s*cm**2). Epithermal fraction was 0.038+-0.003 .
SAMPLE     -Monitor samples are cobalt/aluminum and gold/
            aluminum wires which were used to monitor neutron
            flux at the target positions.
           -Co/Al alloy(Co 0.46+-0.01 wt%, 0.381 mm in diameter) -
            two samples, irradiation time 6 hr, 2.941 mg without
            Cd, 6.506 mg with Cd;
           -Au/Al alloy (Au- 0.112+-0.001 wt%, 0.510 mm diameter)-
            4 samples, irradiation time 10 min, 16.239 mg and
            13.99 mg without Cd, 17.229 mg and 16.384 mg with Cd.
           -Selenium oxide SeO2 powder of  99.99% purity -
            two samples of 5.3845 mg (5 min irradiation time
            without Cd) and 14.336 mg (10 min irradiation time
            with Cd), in cylindrical quartz containers of 7 mm
            outer diameter,8 mm outer length, 1 mm thickness.
ANALYSIS    Reaction rates were calculated from photopeak counts
            of gamma-rays emitted from Co-60 and Au-198 to
            determine neutron flux.
            Cd cutoff energy of 0.5 eV was used in analysis.
           Half life of Se-81m was obtained from 103-keV gamma-ray
           decay curve as 56.2+-0.9 min(error - mainly due to
           statistical errors of gamma-ray yields).
           Half-life of Se-81g was determined as 19.3+-0.3 min.
           Cross sections were calculated from reaction rates and
           neutron fluxes.
           Self-shielding coefficients were estimated by method
           described in REL-REF of O.Shcherbakov+ to be:
           Co - 1.00; Au - 1.00(thermal energy), 0.99(epithermal);
           Se-81m - 0.994 (thermal), 0.997 (epithermal);
           Se-81g - 0.987 (thermal), 0.994 (epithermal).
