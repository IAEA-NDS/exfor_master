INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction by bombarding the lithium
             target on the copper backing with a 1.5 ns bunched
             proton beam. Diameter of lithium layer is 20 mm,
             thickness of few microns.
METHOD     (TOF)   Time-of-flight

PART-DET   (N,G)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  Anti-Compton NaI(TL) spectrometer located
            86 cm from the sample at an angle of 125 degrees with
            respect to the proton beam's direction. The main
            detector of the spectrometer was a 15.2-cm-diameter
            20.3-cm-long NaI(TL) detector and was centered in a
            large hollow Compton-suppression NaI(TL) detector
            with an outer diameter of 33.0 cm and a length of
            35.6 cm. The energy resolution of the main detector
            was 7.0 % (FWHM) at 0.662 MeV, and the time resolution
            was 4.0 ns (FWHM) for 0.511-MeV gamma-rays.

            area 176.1 mm2, chemical purity 99,99%, Au-197 100%
CORRECTION .Corrected for the attenuation by the 105Pd and the
            197Au sample runs, respectively, for effects coming
            from the neutron self-shielding and multiple-scatte-
            ring, for the gamma-ray scattering and absorption in
            the sample, from the dependence of the gamma-ray
            detection efficiency on the gamma-ray source position,
            for the impurities in sample, and for the dead time.
            Corrections for the neutron self-shielding and mul-
            tiple-scattering were made by using a Monte-Carlo
            method, see REL-REF, K.Senoo+. Correction coeffs are
            given in Table 2 of main ref.
