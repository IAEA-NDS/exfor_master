FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) The 150 MeV Geel Electron Linac,
            GELINA. Electron beam (800 Hz) accelerated to 150 MeV.
            DC440 digitizers from Acquiris - 12 bits amplitude
            resolution, 4096 channels full range, sampling
            frequency of 420 Msamples/s, 2.38 ns/sample.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutron produced via U-238(g,xn) and U-238(g,f)
            reactions as result of bremsstrahlung.
             Thick rotary U-238 target.
            current of 70 microA.
INC-SPECT   Direct neutron flux has a mixed evaporation and
            fission neutron spectrum, extended from 0.1 MeV to
            about 20 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF)Time-of-flight technique with a 200 m flight path.
            8 nsec time-of-flight resolution.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) An Al frame was installed for twelve HPGe
           detectors. Four detectors may be supported at each of
           110, 125 and 150 deg angles. First eight detectors were
           currently placed at 110 and 150 deg -four in horizontal
           and four in vertical plane. Seven detectors have
           relative efficiency of 100 % and one - 70%.
            Detection efficiency was measured with point source.
            Also MCNP simulations to determine efficiency
           corresponding to the extended dimensions of sample.
           (FISCH)  U-235 fission chamber at 200 m cabin - to
            monitor neutron flux, for absolute normalization.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) All measurements relative to
            U-235 fission cross-sections.

             Total inelastic cross section.
EXP-YEAR   (2006) During 2006 year - new digitized acquisition
            system was used in comparison with measurement at
            2005 year.
            To improve cross-section and to test digitizer-based
           acquisition, an earlier experiment was reiterated using
           a different (larger) enriched sample and other detector
           efficiencies. New measurement benefited from better
           statistics and the gamma production cross sections for
           few extra transitions could be obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Considered uncertainty .
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data are presented on Fig.1 of
            2007NICE together with data of previous experiment in
            energy range from about 1 MeV to about 17 MeV.
           (UNOBT) Data are unobtainable.

            Gamma production cross section for the first gamma
             transition in Pb-206.
EXP-YEAR   (2006) During 2006 year - new digitized acquisition

STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data are presented on Fig.2 of
            2007NICE in energy range from about 760.keV to about
            1 MeV. Very good time (neutron energy) resolution
            allows to probe the resonant structure.
