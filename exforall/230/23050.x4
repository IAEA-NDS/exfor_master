FACILITY   (VDG,2GERTUE)Single-ended 3MV Van-de-Graaff accelerator
           (ACCEL,2GERMUN) AMS setup in Munich Maier-Leibnitz Lab.
            based on 14 MV tandem accelerator.Combination of large
           accelerator and dedicated particle detection system
           featuring a time-of-flight system, a gas-filled magnet
           and multi-anode ionization chamber fulfills the
           requirement of sensitive Ni-59 detection.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Ti-T target was bombarded with 1.2 and 2.6 MeV
            deuterons to produce 17 and 19 MeV neutrons.
INC-SPECT   17-MeV neutron fluence (1.48 +-0.07)*10**12 n/cm**2,
             irradiation time 4 days.
            19-MeV neutron fluence (1.38+-0.06)*10**12 n/cm**2,
             irradiation time 8 days.
SAMPLE     Ni samples served in previous experiment as fluence
           monitor,when irradiating Al samples for the measurement
           of Al-27(n,2n) Al-26 cross sections at 17 and 19 MeV
            ( see REL-REF A.Wallner,T,,2000 ).
           Natural Ni samples with a thickness of 0.125 mm, 10 mm
           diameter. Distance between neutron-producing target
           and Ni foil 14 mm. Positioned at 0 deg relative to
           incoming d+ beam.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Time history of relative flux monitored with
           scintillation counter positioned under 108 deg relative
           incoming d+ beam in distance of about 3 m.
           (HPGE) 122 keV gamma-line was measured with HP-Ge-diode
            to determine the activity of irradiated Ni samples.
            Self absorption of photons in Ni foil was negligible.
METHOD     (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination for neutron-gamma
            discrimination.
            Production of Ni-59 via (n,gamma) on Ni-58 from
            thermalized neutrons was negligible.
           (ACTIV)  Activation technique combined with
           (AMS)    accelerator mass spectrometry.
            Four independent AMS measurement were performed.
            Standard samples (produced via irradiation of natural
            nickel powder with thermal neutrons) served as
            reference material for the final isotope ratios.
           Isotope ratio was calculated from activity measurements
           relative using thermal neutron cross section of Ni-64,
           sig-gamma=1.52+-0.03 b, and taking into account thermal
           cross section of Ni-58 , sig-gamma=4.13+-0.05 b.
           Ni-59/Ni isotope ratio of standard material was
           determined to (9.1+-0.4)*10**-11 .

            For fluence determination. Measured directly via
            induced activity in samples.
ANALYSIS   Contribution of Co-57 produced through Ni-58(n,2n)
           reaction with consecutive decay of Ni-58 was taken into
           account.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Ni-59/Ni-60 ratio.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Half-life of Ni-59 is discussed. ( 97+-9 )kyr
            value was deduced from measured value (108+-13) kyr
            from REL-REF W.Ruehm+ using the newest available data
            for cross sections and conversion coefficient yield.
