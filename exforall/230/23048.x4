DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two deltaE-E telescopes, each

METHOD     (EDE) Measurement was performed in 3 steps:
            1.Sample was placed to face the deltaE-E telescope.
            Al foil was removed. DeltaE detector was replaced by
            an empty dummy. Binary fission events were detected.
            2. Measurement of ternary alpha-particles using
           deltaE-E telescope. 30 microm Al foil was put in front
           of telescope to stop fission fragments and Cf-249 decay
           alphas. 29.8 microm deltaE and 500 microm E telescope
           allows good separation between LRA particles and
           background.
            3. Sample was turned over 90deg angle to place in
           front of DeltaE-E telescope. 30 microm Al foil covered
           telescope. 49.8 microm deltaE and 1500 microm E
           telescope  was used to measure the ternary triton and

SAMPLE      Cf-249 sample, deposited on a Ti foil, almost 100%
            pure, 5.84 microg mass. Sample was placed in center of
            vacuum chamber at angle 45 deg with respect to
            incident neutron beam. Sample activity 0.9 MBq.
            Prepared in LBNL, USA.

DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two deltaE-E telescopes, each
           consisting of thin deltaE and thick E silicon surface
           barrier detectors. Placed on both sides of sample at
           about 4 cm distance and perpendicular to beam.
            DeltaE detectors were covered by 30 microm Al foils.
            DeltaE detector thickness - 1500 microm,
            E detector thickness - 49.8 microm.
METHOD     (EDE) Measurement was performed in 3 steps:
            1.Sample was placed to face the deltaE-E telescope.
            Al foil was removed. DeltaE detector was replaced by
            an empty dummy. Binary fission events were detected.
            2. Measurement of ternary alpha-particles using
           deltaE-E telescope. 30 microm Al foil was put in front
           of telescope to stop fission fragments and Cf-249 decay
           alphas. 29.8 microm deltaE and 500 microm E telescope
           allows good separation between LRA particles and
           background.
