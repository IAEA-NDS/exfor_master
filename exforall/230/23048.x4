INC-SPECT  Neutron flux at sample position about 3.5E+9 n/s/cm**2.
SAMPLE      Cf-249 sample, deposited on a Ti foil, almost 100%
            pure, 5.8 microg mass. Sample was placed in center of
            vacuum chamber at angle 45 deg with respect to
            incident neutron beam.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two deltaE-E telescopes, each
           consisting of thin deltaE and thick E silicon surface
           barrier detector. Placed on both sides of sample at
           about 4 cm distance and perpendicular to beam.
METHOD     (EDE) Measurement was performed in 3 steps:
            1.Sample was placed to face the deltaE-E telescope.
            Al foil was removed. DeltaE detector was replaced by
            an empty dummy. Binary fission events were detected.
            2. Measurement of thernary alpha-particles using
           deltaE-E telescope. 30 microm Al foil was put in front
           of telescope to stop fission fragments and Cf-249 decay
           alphas. 29.8 microm deltaE and 500 microm E telescope
           allows good separation between LRA particles and
           background.
            3. Sample was turned over 90deg angle to place in
           front of DeltaE-E telescope. 30 microm Al foil covered
           telescope. 49.8 microm deltaE and 1500 microm E
           telescope  was used to measure the ternary triton and
           alpha yields simultaneously.
MISC-COL   (MISC) FWHM of triton energy distribution with average
            energy AKE at ternary fission.
