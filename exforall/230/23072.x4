            Whole assembly of 17 chambers, with 16 targets,

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Shape analysis of the TAC energy response for
           each time-of-flight (neutron energy) bin.
           4.5 eV resonance was used to define fission.
           Efficiency for capture was defined by simulation
           consisted in gamma-ray cascade generator coupled to
           GEANT4 toolkit.
           For fission - 100 % efficiency was considered.
           In the energy range above 10 keV, the cross-section was
           extracted directly from the ratio to U-235(n,f)
           reaction. Between 0.16 and 245 eV the cross-section is
           determined using the smooth flux obtained from the
           Li-6(n,a) reaction, normalized to the U-235(n,f) data
           between 0.16 eV and 1 eV.
CORRECTION MCNPX simulation to quantify the beam attenuation in
            various materials (targets, backings, electrodes),
            value was evaluated about 0.1%, so no correction was
            applied.
           For energy loss in the sample and in the gas volume by
           Monte Carlo simulation.
           Loss of counts due to the dead-time induced by the
           reconstruction routine was calculated under hypothesis
           of a non-paralyzable model.
           Efficiency and dead-time corrections were found to be
           of the order of a few percent.

           contributes to the background due to the high
