            Flux peaks at thermal energy is approximately
            isolethargic between 0.25 eV and 10 keV (due to water
            moderation), and then peaks again around 1 MeV (due
            to evaporation from spallation products).

DETECTOR   (IOCH) Fast ionization chamber (FIC) as fission
           fragment detector. Constituted by a stack of several
           parallel-plate chambers  with 5 mm spacing between
           electrodes, operating with argontetrafluormethane
            90% Ar + 10% CF4 at 720 mbar pressure.
            Whole assembly of 17 chambers, with 16 targets,
            mounted together in chamber of 50 cm length.
           Two detectors were used FIC-0 to low activity isotopes,
           FIC-1 for highly radioactive (U-233,Am-241,Am-243,
           Cm-245). No gas circulation.

            calibration procedure.

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Shape analysis of the TAC energy response for
           each time-of-flight (neutron energy) bin.
           4.5 eV resonance was used to define fission.
           Efficiency for capture was defined by simulation
           consisted in gamma-ray cascade generator coupled to
           GEANT4 toolkit.
           For fission - 100 % efficiency was considered.
CORRECTION MCNPX simulation to quantify the beam attenuation in
            various materials (targets, backings, electrodes),
            value was evaluated about 0.1%, so no correction was
            applied.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary results.
