INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Cold neutron beam of mean energy 1.8 meV , flux
           7.3E+9 n/(cm**2*sec) at spot size of 1.4cm x 3.8 cm
           at target position. Stopped by BC4 plate at one meter
           behind the target chamber.
SAMPLE     The pill-shaped samples of isotopically enriched GeO2
           (87.1+-1.2)% of Ge-76. 12 mm diameter, about 2 mm
           thickness. Two samples (A and B) were used.
           To monitor the neutron flux at the target position a
           gold foil (mass 28.7 +- 0.6 mg) of the same diameter
           was placed behind the pill.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two Compton-suppressed HPGe detectors positioned
           at distance of 30 cm from the beam center.Efficiency of
           60% and 36% relative to 3 in x 3 in NaI detector.
           Both are shielded against neutrons and other background
           radiation by combination of Pb, Li-6, Cd-113.

ANALYSIS   Using 1/v law for cold and thermal neutrons,the thermal
           capture cross-section for germanium at v=2200 m/s was
           obtained by thermal cross-section of gold.
CORRECTION  For self-absorption - correction factors 0.999 for Ge
            target, 0.978 for gold foil.
           Contribution from the target inhomogenity was estimated
           from the mass inhomogenity folded by the beam
           distribution.

SAMPLE     Two samples -

              480 s, measurement time 55200 s;
           B: 503.9 mg mass, activation time 1800 s, waiting time
           720 s, measurement time 55076 s.

ANALYSIS   Thermal neutron cross-section to the ground state was
           based on two transitions 367.4 kev and 558.0 keV.
           C-S is fed by IT from shorter-lived isomeric state.
COMMENT    Of authors. Using the transitions with lower
            gamma-energies at 211.0 keV and 215.5 keV to derive
            cross-section leads to lower values 57.9+-3.3 mb and
            58.5+-3.3 mb, respectively. While 714.4 keV transition
            yields to 69.4+-3.8 mb and 1193.3 keV transition
            yields to 66.7+-4.3 mb in agreement with results,
            obtained by 367.4 and 558.0 keV transitions,
            one has to conclude, that emission probabilities
            given for two low-lying energies in REL-REF of
            Farhan+ are too high.
