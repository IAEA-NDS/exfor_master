ANALYSIS    Two transitions (159.7 IT and 215.5 keV after beta-

           capture cross-section for germanium at v=2200 m/s was

CORRECTION  For self-absorption - correction factors 0.999 for Ge
            target, 0.978 for gold foil.

ANALYSIS   Thermal neutron cross-section to the ground state was
           based on two transitions 367.4 kev and 558.0 keV.
           C-S is fed by IT from shorter-lived isomeric state.
           Using 1/v law for cold and thermal neutrons,the thermal
           capture cross-section for germanium at v=2200 m/s was
           obtained by thermal cross-section of gold.
CORRECTION  For self-absorption - correction factors 0.999 for Ge
            target, 0.978 for gold foil.
           Contribution from the target inhomogeneity was
           estimated from the mass inhomogeneity folded by

COMMENT    Of authors. Using the transitions with lower
            gamma-energies at 211.0 keV and 215.5 keV to derive
            cross-section leads to lower values 57.9+-3.3 mb and
            58.5+-3.3 mb, respectively. While 714.4 keV transition
            yields to 69.4+-3.8 mb and 1193.3 keV transition
            yields to 66.7+-4.3 mb in agreement with results,
            obtained by 367.4 and 558.0 keV transitions,
            one has to conclude, that emission probabilities
            given for two low-lying energies in REL-REF of
            Farhan+ are too high.

           by 74Ge.
           Isotopic abundances of the samples in percent:
           Enriched: sum of 70Ge, 72Ge, 73Ge - 0.3, 74Ge - 12.7,
           76Ge - 87.0.
           Depleted: 70Ge - 22.03, 72Ge - 29.57, 73Ge - 8.42,
           74Ge -  39.02, 76Ge -  0.58.
           GeO2 powder was sealed in a FEP (Fluorinated
           Ethylene-Propylene) bag. An empty target consisting
           only of the FEP bag (70mg) was irradiated for
           background determination.
           All targets were exposed for about 15 h,
           for the depleted target a lower neutron flux than for
           the others.
           After the activation, a waiting time of 20 min (5 min)
           for the enriched (depleted) target. The decay spectra
           of the enriched (depleted) targets were recorded with
           the same standard data acquisition (DAQ) equipment for
           about 33 h (4 h).
           Isotopically enriched target (304.1mg) taken from the
           same batch was irradiated by a thermal equivalent
           neutron flux 1.48*10**9 n/(cm2 s) for 8.26 d - in
           coincidence measurement.
INC-SPECT  Maximum thermal equivalent neutron flux at the target
           position 2.9E+9 n/(cm**2*sec) with mean neutron energy
           1.83 meV.
METHOD     (COINC) To establish the decay scheme, gamma-gamma
           coincidences were measured using both Ge detectors in
           coincidence mode.
ANALYSIS   Energy calibration, corrected for nonlinearity was
           achieved using the numerous background peaks of 19F in
           the spectrum of the empty target. The detection
           efficiency calibration was performed by utilizing the
           decay radiation of 60Co, 133Ba, 152Eu sources placed at
           the target position and prompt gamma rays produced by
           neutron irradiation of N, Cl and Cr.
           Transitions in the germanium isotopes were identified
           by comparing the spectra of the enriched, the depleted
           and the empty targets taken in the singles mode.
           If a peak in the depleted spectrum was identified to
           be due to neutron capture on 73Ge or on 74Ge, the
           corresponding contribution in the enriched spectrum can
           be subtracted from overlapping peaks in the enriched
           spectrum.
           The relative intensities in 77Ge were normalized to the
           strongest transition of 5911.33 keV.
           Unless otherwise noted in table A.1, a transition was
           placed in the level scheme only if the complete path
           from the capture state to the ground state or to the
           isomeric state could be reconstructed with 90% CL.
           If a coincidence for a transition was observed, that is
           not part of an established decay path, the energy of
           the coincident photon is shown in the misc column.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Coincident transition
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
           Uncertainty of the measured gamma-ray energy contains a
           systematic contribution of 0.10 keV for the energy
           calibration added quadratically to the statistical one
           which came from the fit after background correction.
COMMENT    Of authors.
           -The intensities of the delayed gamma rays were
           remeasured using the same facility and the same samples
           as for the experiments with prompt radiation for a
           detailed reanalysis.

                For 247 keV transition.
ANALYSIS    Pill of GeO2 was irradiated together with a piece of
           gold. Knowing their thickness and masses the
           intensities of the prompt gamma rays in the Ge isotopes
           could be related to the reference transition in gold at
           247 keV, relying on a cross section of 5.56(8) b from
           IAEA-TECDOC (without number, see
           http://www-nds.iaea.org/pgaa/tecdoc.pdf).
           Alternatively, the partial cross-sections were derived
           from the decay peaks of 77Ge observed in the prompt
           spectrum. Both approaches are in good agreement, i.e.
           within 0.15% and 1.8% depending on the line used for
           normalization.
            Applying the obtained renormalization factor of
           fr = 0.395(15) to the relative intensities given in
           table A.1 (=Subent 005) the partial cross-sections can
           be calculated. For 862 keV line -
           51.4%*0.395=20.3 mb.
