             pulse compression system for intense relativistic
             electron beams
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)  Linear accelerator GELINA of the
             Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements
             at Geel in Belgium. Bunched electrons of 1 ns width,
             repetition rate 800 Hz, 70 microA average electron
             current, average electron energy 100 MeV
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Gamma-n and gamma-fission reactions
METHOD     (TOF)   Time of flight. Transmission measurements were
            carried out at 30 m and 50 m flight paths.
            The capture measurements were performed at a 30 m
            and 60 m flight path
           (PHD)   The sample dependent pulse height weighting
             function applied to ensure that the efficiency for
             a neutron capture event was independent from the
             gamma-ray cascade
DETECTOR   (IOCH)   B-10 ionization chamber was used to determine
                    the shape of the neutron flux.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)  The resonance shape analysis was performed
                with the most recent version of the REFIT code
CORRECTION .Direct correction for the neutron sensitivity of the
            capture detection system and accounts for the
            influence of the neutron attenuation in the sample
            on the weighted response.
