            Reference for Au decay data used.
SAMPLE     Pt samples were cut from metal foils.
           Chemically stable compounds Yb2O2, OsO2, Hg2Cl2 were
           used for pressing thin sample discs.
           All samples from material of natural composition.
           One exception - W-180 sample made from metal powder
           with 91.4% enrichment.
           Samples were 6 and 10 mm in diameter, sandwiched
           between 0.03 mm thick gold foils of the same diameter,
           which served for neutron flux determination.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKFK) 3.7 MV Van Der Graaf accelerator.
           Operated in DC mode with beam current between 80 and
           100 microA.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Protons of energy 1912 keV.
           Thin layers of LiF on Cu backing.
           neutrons are kinematically collimated in a forward cone
           of 120 degrees opening angle, with maximum energy of
           106 keV.
INC-SPECT  Angle integrated neutron spectrum corresponds closely
           to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for kT=25.0+-0.5 keV.
           Average neutron flux of about 10**9 n/sec.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Neutron repeated activation of quasi-stellar
           25 keV neutron spectrum.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Li-6 glass detector for neutron flux monitoring
           in time steps of 30 sec for proper evaluation of the
           decay correction.
           (HPGE) High purity Ge detectors - for measurement of
           induced activity.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198,2.69517D,DG,411.8,0.9558)
           Intensity (95.58+-0.12) % . Half-life error 0.00021day.
ANALYSIS    The measured spectrum averaged cross section was
           converted into a MACS for kT=25 keV by applying a small
           modification, connected with the difference between
           experimental neutron spectrum and the true Maxwellian
           shape. The extrapolation of these results to the values
           for kT=30 keV was based on the available shape of
           energy differential capture cross sections.
CORRECTION For variation of neutron flux and for the decay of
           activated nuclei during the irradiation time.
