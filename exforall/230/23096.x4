            Cavity Fission Spectrum Standard Neutron Field at
            Belgium CEN/SCK BR-1 reactor. Three configurations:
            MarkII - no Al cladding around U-235 foil;
            MarkIIA, MarkIII - Al clad thickness of 0.070 mm
            inside the uranium, 0.75 mm outside.
             U-235 cylindrical foil dimensions:

INC-SPECT   Fission neutron spectrum was obtained by
            the irradiation of U-235 cylindrical source.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) NBS fission ionization chambers with deposits
            from NBS collection of fissionable isotope mass
            standards.
METHOD     (FISCT) Fission rates were observed by NBS FISCH.
           (ACTIV) Radiometric analysis of activated foils was
           performed by NBS and CEN/SCK.
            Fluence rate was established by Pu-239 fission rate at
            Mol relative to that in NBS Cf-252 Spon.Fis.Standard
            Neutron Field . Absolute fluence rate at NBS Cf-252
