             for Res-Int, graph for cross section
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNKTO)  46-MeV linear accelerator of KURRI.
             Pulsed electron beam energy 30 MeV, current 30 micro-
             amperes, pulse width 100 ns, repetition rate 100Hz
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)  Fast neutrons were produced from the water-
             cooled photo-neutron target assembly, 5 cm in diam.
             and 6 cm long, which was composed of 12 sheets of
             tantalum plates with total thickness of 29 mm.
             The target was surrounded with a water moderator.
METHOD     (TOF)  The flight path used in the experiment is in
             direction of 90-degree to the LINAC electron beam.
           (SITA) Intermittent capture sample, dummy sample and
              lead sample irradiation
           (PHD)  Pulse height discrimination
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 4pi Ge spectrometer surrounded with large
             Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) detectors for anti-Compton suppres-
             sion was employed.
           (PROPC)  BF3 proportional counter was set at the exit
             of the first flight tube used as a neutron intensity
             monitor
            To decrease the background, a 10 mm thick lead was
            set on the surface of each detector
SAMPLE      The sample of 243Am was 128 mg of americium oxide
            Am-O2 powder packed in an aluminum disk container 30
            mm in diameter and 0.5 mm thick walls. The thickness
            of sample 8.92E-5 atoms/b, sample radioactivity
            835 MBq.
            The dummy sample of identical Al case without the
            americium oxide powder was used for the background
            measurements. The identical Al case with Pb was also
            used for determination of background level due to
            neutrons scattered by the capture sample.
            The enriched 10B sample, purity 93 %, was used for
            the measurement of the incident neutron flux/spectrum
            on the sample. The 10B sample was encapsulated in a
            cylinder thin-walled (0.2 mm) aluminum container 25
            mm in diameter, with a sample material thickness
            5.68E-2 atoms/b.
