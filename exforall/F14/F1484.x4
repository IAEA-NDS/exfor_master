FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) DC-280 cyclotron of the Superheavy
           Element Factory
METHOD     (TOF,ASPEC)
SAMPLE     (95-AM-243,ENR=0.995) The targets consisting of the
           enriched isotope 243Am were produced by
           layer-by-layer electrodeposition. Six target sectors
           were mounted on a disk with a diameter of 15 cm and
           rotated at 1500 rpm.
INC-SOURCE The beam intensity was gradually increased to
           1.2-1.3 p mu-A.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were analyzed by means
           of Dubna Gas Filled Recoil Separator (DGFRS-2) .
           (SISD) The focal detector of 48 mm in vertical and
           220 mm in horizontal directions consisted of two
           double-sided strip detectors (DSSD) covering 48x128 mm2
           with 1 mm wide strips in such a way that the front
           detector shielded part of the rear detector. Each two
           of the 48 front horizontal strips of both detectors
           were connected. The back strips were paired together
           to form 110 strips of 2 mm width. The focal detector
           was surrounded by eight 60x120 mm2 side detectors, each
           with 8 strips, forming a box with a depth of 120 mm.
           (MWPC) Two multiwire proportional chambers were used
           to register the nuclei passing through the separator.
ERR-ANALYS The beam energy was measured with a systematic
           uncertainty of 1 MeV.
           (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty is given.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Fifty-five new decay chains of 288Mc and six
           chains assigned to 289Mc were detected. A new
           spontaneously fissioning isotope 264Lr was identified.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Excitation energy of the compound nucleus.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. V.K.Utyonkov
