METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,BCINT)
           (STTA) Seven foils were combined into one single
           stack of targets.
           (EDEG) Aluminum foils with a different thickness were
           placed between thorium targets, using as beam
           monitors or degraders.
INC-SOURCE Average beam current was 0.1 mu-A. Irradiation was
           carried out until a total charge of 0.3 mu-A h was
           reached.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activity was measured on gamma spectrometer
           with ultrapure germanium detector ORTEC GEM.
SAMPLE     Mechanically stable thorium oxide layers 12 to 15
           mg/cm2 thick were used. Thorium oxide was deposited
           onto aluminum substrates by the sedimentation method.
           The diameter of the deposited spot was 20 mm.
REL-REF    (R,,E.Browne+,J,NDS,113,2113,2012)Decay data for Pa-230
           are given.
           (R,,E.Browne+,J,NDS,107,2579,2006) Decay data for
           Pa-232 are given.
           (R,,B.Singh+,J,NDS,170,499,2020) Decay data for Pa-233
           are given.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental cross sections were compared
           with the data from TENDL-2021 library.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties in the experimental cross
           sections were between 15% and 36% at a fiducial
           probability of 68%. These uncertainties received
           contributions from the error in determining the
           detector efficiency, the error in determining the areas
           under the peaks of total proton absorption in the
           spectrum, and the error in the quantum yields used to
           determine activities. The uncertainties in the energy
           of 4He were determined using SRIM software from the
           scatter of + -1 MeV in the initial energy of 4He,
           which is specified by the parameters of the cyclotron.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. K.A.Makoveeva.
