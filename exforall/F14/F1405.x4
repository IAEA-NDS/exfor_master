SAMPLE     Aquadag target, whose thickness corresponded to a
           deuteron energy loss of 600 keV, was used. Target
           square was 18 mm2.
INC-SOURCE Mean beam current was 5 mu-A.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) For polarization measurements gaseous helium
           scintillation counter with high pressure was used as
           analyzer. Pressure of He+7 %Xe mixture was 70 atm.
           Stilbene crystal with FEU-13 multiplier was used for
           neutron registration.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from the text, p.136.
