            113 and 94 MeV
           (LINAC,4RUSFVE) For proton energies 73 and 38 MeV
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA,CHSEP,GSPEC)
SAMPLE     Every Sb-target was placed together with aluminum
            (100+ -4 mu-m thickness) or/and copper (40+ -2 mu-m)
           foils of the same form for beam intensity monitoring
           and wrapped in aluminum foil envelopes.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG)
           (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The error in proton energy comprised
           uncertainty of initial accelerator energy, target
           thickness, proton straggling and scattering in the
           targets, degraders and water or air gaps.
           (DATA-ERR) Errors in cross section values include
           uncertainty in proton flux determination, detector
           efficiency, statistics in gamma-ray spectra, and
           geometry in gamma-ray measurement.

           72.7 +- 0.7, and 37.8 +- 0.4 MeV; beam currents (mu-A)
           and irradiation times (h) were 1.2, 0.5, 0.07,
           0.03 and 5.2, 9.8, 7.9, 8.2, correspondingly.
SAMPLE     Thin metallic antimony foils of natural isotopic
           composition (121Sb 57.21 %, 123Sb 42.79 %, purity
           more or equal to 95 %) were used. Foils with
           dimensions of 17 * 50 mm and nominal Sb thickness of
           40 mu-m on 130 mu-m polyester backing were prepared
           for irradiation with protons of initial energy 159 MeV
           and 94 MeV; and 25 mu-m foils (170 mu-m of
           polyester backing) with dimensions of 17 * 17 mm for
           irradiation with normal to target surface beam of 73
           MeV and 38 MeV protons.

INC-SOURCE Initial proton energy was 37.8 +-0.4 MeV (as well as
           calculated from experiments with natSb and 123Sb);
           beam current (mu-A) was 0.05 and irradiation time (h)
           was 8.0.
SAMPLE     (51-SB-121,ENR=0.9953) Enriched material was in the
           form of dispersed metallic grains. The material was
           pounded in a mortar to fine powder and then it was
           utilized for preparation of target with thickness
           27-49 mg/cm by different methods.
