FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSTPI) U-120 cyclotron
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Type GC1020, diameter 46.5 mm, length 32 mm,
           10 % relative efficiency and energy resolution of 2 keV
           for the 1.332 MeV gamma-line of the 60Co standard
           source. The samples were counted from 40 min up to 24 h
INC-SOURCE The energy of the primary alpha-particle beam was
           27.2 MeV with a beam intensity of less than 100 nA.
           The irradiation times were 2 and 3 h for the first
           and second stack foils, respectively.
SAMPLE     Two stacks of foils were used. Each stack was made of
           several groups of targets:
           natZr (98.2 % purity),
           (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.5145),
           (40-ZR-91,ENR=0.1122),
           (40-ZR-92,ENR=0.1715),
           (40-ZR-94,ENR=0.1738),
           (40-ZR-96,ENR=0.280);
           natCu (99.95 % purity) and natTi (99.95 % purity)were
           used as monitor foils that acted also as beam degraders
           The foils thicknesses were natZr-25 mu-m, natCu-10 mu-m
           and natTi-13 mu-m.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty was calculated as the
           square root of the sum of squares of the following
           errors:
           (ERR-1,3.,5.) detector efficiency
           (ERR-2,1.,3.) the area under the spectrometric peak
           (ERR-3,2.,4.) target thickness
           (ERR-4,4.,8.) beam intensity
           (ERR-5,,5.)   decay data
