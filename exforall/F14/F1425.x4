FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFTI)
SAMPLE     Aquadag target of 6-7 mg/cm2 thickness was used. the
           target area bombarded by deuterons was 0.25 cm2
INC-SOURCE Mean beam current was 3 mu-A.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Polarized neutrons were analyzed in a gas
           scintillation counter at high pressure. The overall
           pressure of the gas mixture (7% Xe and 93% He-4) was
           80 atm. Neutron scattered on He-4 nuclei were
           recorded by plastic scintillators. The gas analyzer
           was 40 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length; the
           plastic scintillator was 45 mm in diameter and 25 mm
           thick. The distance between the centers of the gas
           counter and the lateral detectors was 20 cm.
