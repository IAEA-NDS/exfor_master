TITLE      Experimental study of alpha-particle induced
           reactions on natural erbium for the production of

SAMPLE     Erbium targets of natural isotopic composition were
           used. Mechanically stable and visually homogeneous
           samples with a thickness of 5-11 mg/cm2 were
           obtained. The spot diameter was 20 mm. The target was
           covered with ~9 mu-m aluminum foil. Three stacks of
           foils were prepared, each consisted of ten erbium
           targets and aluminum degraders with a thickness of
           ~20 and ~30 mu-m interposed between them.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectrometer with an ORTEC GEM 35P4 high
           purity germanium detector with energy resolution 850 eV
           for the 122 keV line and 1.8 keV for the 1330 keV
           line was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time was ~ 0.5 h at a beam
           current of 200-400 nA.
