FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSJIA)
INC-SOURCE Initial proton energy was 128, 143 and 158 MeV. Beam
           current was approximately 5 mu-A.
SAMPLE     10x10 mm2 pieces of 5-mu-m-thick Th metal foil
           were used.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Yields of 225Ac and 223Ra were calculated.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties in cross section definition
           include the errors in measurement of thickness of
           targets and monitor foils; the errors in reference
           cross-sections of monitor foils with regard to
           spatial scattering and energy spread under real beam
           parameters; statistical errors and errors in geometry
           at gamma and alpha spectrometric measurements.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. B.L. Zhuikov.
