INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 15N nuclei with an energy of 49.7
           MeV/A was focused on a producing 9Be target. The
           secondary beam of fragmentation reaction products was
           formed and purified by the magnetic system of the
           fragment separator.
SAMPLE     The target (natural Si, 243-mu-m thick) was located
           in the reaction chamber which was a thin-walled
           vacuum cylinder of stainless steel.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI) A set of detectors was used: scintillation
           detector AC1; position sensitive 16X- 16Y Si detector
           dE (300-mu-m thick); start dE0 Si detector (380-mu-m
           thick); scintillation detector AC2; target dET Si
           detector; six CsI(Tl) scintillation detectors.
METHOD     (TRN,TOF)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are due to uncertainties in the
           values of coefficients that occur when determining the
           the relationship between the number of triggered
           spectrometer detectors and the flux of particles
           incident on a target.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. Yu.G.Sobolev.
