FACILITY   (ISOCY,4RUSKUR) U-150 isochronous cyclotron
SAMPLE     Targets in the form of disks with a diameter of 8 mm
           and a thickness of 3 to 9 mm from ThO2 powder were
           packed into target devices with window of aluminum
           foil with a thickness of 40 microns at the entrance
           of the beam. The targets had a bulk density of
           2.15-3.6 g/cm3, determined by weighing. The targets
           were installed at a distance of 6-42 cm from the
           surface of the detector.
INC-SOURCE Beam current was ~0.15 mu-A, total charge of ~0.1 mu-Ah
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The measurements were carried out using an
           ORTEC GEM 35P4 gamma spectrometer with a detector made
           of ultrapure germanium with a volume ~100 cm3.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
DECAY-DATA (44-RU-103,39.274D)
ANALYSIS   The activity of radionuclide 103Ru was determined by
           the peak of total absorption of gamma quanta along
           the line Eg = 497.085 keV after irradiation and about
           7 days of exposure.
CORRECTION Calculated corrections were introduced, including
           correction for the decay of the radionuclide during
           the measurement and correction for self-absorption of
           gamma quanta in targets.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors of the measured values include:
           (ERR-1) the error in determining the efficiency of the
           detector;
           (ERR-2,5.,10.) the errors in determination of peak
           areas of the total absorption of gamma quanta in the
           instrument spectra;
           (ERR-3) the error of quantum yield.
