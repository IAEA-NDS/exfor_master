FACILITY   (ISOCY,4ZZZDUB) U400-M
INC-SOURCE The intensity of the beam was 100 nA.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were separated and detected
           by the high-resolution magnetic spectrometer MAVR.
           (TELES,SI) Registration and identification of
           reaction products in the focal plane of the
           spectrometer was carried out by a detector system
           consisting of two silicon telescopes located 25 cm
           apart from each other. The first telescope consisted
           of dE-detector (50-mu-m thick) and E-detector (1-mm
           thick); the thickness of the detectors of the second
           telescope was 100 mu-m and 1 mm for dE-and
           E-detectors, respectively.
SAMPLE     Ta-181 target of thickness 4 mu-m was used.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Theoretical analysis of product yields in the
           framework of the finite-range distorted-wave Born
           approximation was performed using FRESCO code.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties correspond to fitting
           uncertainties for isotope yield distribution.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. M.A. Naumenko.
