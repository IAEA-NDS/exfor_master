FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFTI)
INC-SOURCE Deuteron beam of 6.6+ - 0.1 MeV.
METHOD     (DSCAT)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons were analyzed with a high-pressure
           gas scintillation counter (85 atm 4He + 4 atm Xe) and
           were registered at an angle of 135 degrees (c.m.s.)
           with lateral plastic scintillators.
SAMPLE     The target was gaseous deuterium at a pressure of 4.5
           atm in a volume bounded by two tantalum foils, the
           distance between which was 23 mm.
CORRECTION The measured asymmetry was corrected for both the
           finite dimensions of the analyzer and detectors and
           the angular dependence of the reaction cross section.
