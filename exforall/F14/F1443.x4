INC-SOURCE The mean beam density was (1.97+ - 0.05) *10**5
           protons/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PLATE)
SAMPLE     A camera of dimensions 10*10*2 cm3 consisting of
           layers of emulsion of type NIKFI-BR of thickness 400
           microns was used.
COMMENT    *By authors* Contribution of the quasi-elastic cases
           of scattering and other cases belonging to the
           background was ~ 2 %.
ERR-ANALYS In order to segregate cases of elastic scattering by
           free hydrogen the uncertainties in determination of
           the angle of the recoil proton and the angle of
           scattered proton were taking into account.
           (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
