FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
INC-SOURCE An internal proton beam of pulsed intensity
            (1-3) x 10**10 protons from the proton synchrotron
           was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation times were from 1.5 to 3.0
           hours.
           (CHSEP,ASPEC)
DETECTOR   An alpha spectrometer was used.
