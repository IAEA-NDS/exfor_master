INC-SOURCE The intensity of the O-16 beam was 10 nA.
SAMPLE     Ta-181 target with the thickness d=4 mu-m.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI) A detector system formed by two silicon
           telescopes separated by a distance of 25 cm from each
           other was used. The first telescope consisted of a dE
           detector 50 mu-m thick and an E detector 1 mm thick;
           the thicknesses of the detectors forming the second
           telescope were 100 mu-m and 1 mm for, respectively,
           the dE and the E detector.
METHOD     (EDE)
ADD-RES    The yield of reaction products was analyzed
           theoretically in the finite-range distorted-wave Born
           approximation by means of the FRESCO code.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative error in the measurement of
           the differential cross sections was calculated as the
           relative error in approximating the distribution of
           the isotope yields.
