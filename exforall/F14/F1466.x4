METHOD     (ACTIV) The activity of each protoactinium
           radionuclide was measured several times during three
           half-life periods and determined on the basis of the
           peaks of total photon absorption.
           (STTA) Eleven foils were combined into one single
           stack of targets.
           (EDEG) Aluminum foils with a thickness from 9 to 30
           mu-m were placed between thorium targets, using as
           beam monitors or degraders.
           (GSPEC)
INC-SOURCE Average beam current was 0.1 mu-A. Irradiation was
           carried out until a total charge of 0.3 mu-A h was
           reached.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The measurements were performed on gamma
           spectrometer with ultrapure-germanium detector ORTEC.
           The distance from the target to the detector during
           measurements was from 6 to 40 cm, depending on the
           radiation intensity.
SAMPLE     Targets of thorium oxide with the thickness from 7 to
           11 mg/cm2 and spot diameter of 20 mm deposited by
           means of sedimentation on aluminum foils were used.
REL-REF    (R,,E.Browne+,J,NDS,113,2113,2012)Decay data for Th-230
           are given.
           (R,,E.Browne+,J,NDS,107,2579,2006) Decay data for U-232
           are given.
           (R,,B.Singh+,J,NDS,170,499,2020) Decay data for U-233
           are given.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental results were compared with
           theoretical data from TENDL-2019.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainties in the experimental values of
           the cross sections were between 13 and 25 % at a
           fiducial probability of 68 % and include:
           (ERR-1,8.,12.) the error in determining the detector
           efficiency;
           (ERR-2,10.,15.) the error in determining the areas
           under the peaks of total photon absorption in the
           spectrum;
           (ERR-3,3.,18.) the error in the quantum yields used
           to determine the activities.
