           (3CZRCZR) Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) DC-280 cyclotron of the Superheavy
           Element Factory
METHOD     (TOF,ASPEC)
SAMPLE     12 sectors of the target were produced by
           electrodeposition on a 0.62-mg/cm2 Ti backing, were
           mounted on a disk 24 cm in diameter, which was
           rotated at 980 rpm. To control the thickness of the
           target layer during the experiment, about 30 mu-g
           of 243Am were added to the target as a marker.
           Target thickness was 0.89 mg/cm2 at the energy of 231.1
           MeV, 0.76 mg/cm2 at 237.8 MeV and 0.65 mg/cm2 at 250.6
           MeV.
INC-SOURCE First beam intensity was 4 p mu-A, then it was
           reduced to 3 p mu-A.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were analyzed by means
           of Dubna Gas Filled Recoil Separator (DGFRS-2).
           (SISD) The focal detector consisted of two 48x128-mm2
           double-sided strip detectors with 48 1-mm horizontal
           strips on the front side and 128 1-mm-wide vertical
           strips on the back one. The first detector shielded a
           part of the rear detector. The back strips of 1-mm in
           width were paired together to form 110 strips of 2 mm
           in width. The focal detector was surrounded by eight
           60x120-mm2 side strip detectors, each with 8 strips,
           forming box with a depth of 120 mm.
           (MWPC) Two multiwire proportional chambers were used
           to register the nuclei passing through the separator.
ERR-ANALYS The beam energy was measured with a systematic
           uncertainty of 1 MeV.
           (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty is given.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Decay properties of synthesized for the first
           time superheavy nuclides 268Sg, 272Hs,and 276Ds were
           investigated.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Excitation energy of the compound nucleus.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. V.K.Utyonkov
