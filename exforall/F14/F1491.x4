FACILITY   (ISOCY,4RUSKUR) U-150 cyclotron
SAMPLE     Targets in the form of disks 8 mm in diameter made
           from ThO2 powder were packed in target devices with
           40 mu-m thick aluminum foil windows at the beam
           entrance. The targets had bulk density of 2.2 g/cm3
           determined by weighing.
INC-SOURCE Beam current was ~0.15 mu-A, total charge of ~0.3 mu-Ah
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The measurements were performed using a gamma
           spectrometer with an ultrapure germanium detector
           ORTEC. The dead time during measurements did not
           exceed 5%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,CHSEP,BCINT)
RAD-DET    (88-RA-222,DG)
DECAY-DATA (88-RA-222,,DG,324.31,0.0257)
ADD-RES    (COMP) Comparison with the computed yield using the
           nuclear data from the TENDL-2019 library.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors of the measured values include
           the error in determining the detector efficiency, the
           errors in determination of peak areas of the total
           absorption of gamma quanta in the instrument spectra
           and the error of quantum yield.

CORRECTION The contribution of the 230U accumulated upon the
           decay of 230Pa produced in the target via the
           reaction 232Th(3He,p4n)230Pa was subtracted from the
           measured activity.

COMMENT    *By author* No correction was made to account for 230U
           accumulation via 230Pa decay in determining 230U
           activity through direct 232Th(4He,6n)230U reaction.
