FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSKUR) U-150 cyclotron
SAMPLE     (74-W-186,ENR=0.9996) A layer of metallic tungsten
           powder with 17-25 mg/cm2 thickness deposited onto
           high purity aluminum backings with 40 mu-m thickness
           was used. Diameter of the layer was 10 mm. The
           targets were produced by sedimentation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) ORTEC GEM 35P4 series HPGe detector was used.
           The dead time did not exceed 5%.
METHOD     (BCINT,STTA,EDEG,GSPEC) Aluminum foils (40 and 50 mu-m
           thick) were placed between the 12 targets.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time was 1 hr.
INC-SOURCE Average beam current was 0.1 mu-A.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The results were compared to the data from the
           TENDL-2019 library.
ERR-ANALYS The uncertainties of the energy were calculated using
           the SRIM software based on the spread in the initial
           beam energy of + - 1 MeV.
           (ERR-T) Total experimental uncertainty was 12-25% with
           confidence interval 68%. Components of the uncertainty:
           (ERR-1,8.,10.) uncertainty in determining the
           efficiency of the detector;
           (ERR-2,8.,20.) uncertainty in determining the areas
           of the peaks of the total absorption of gamma quanta;
           (ERR-3,4.,5.) uncertainty in determining the number
           of 186W nuclei in the target;
           (ERR-4,3.,9.) uncertainty of the used quantum yields.
