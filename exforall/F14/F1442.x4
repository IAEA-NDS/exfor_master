INC-SOURCE The scanned area was subdivided during the course of
           reduction of the experimental data into three
           sections of area 9.49, 5.93, and 4.74 cm3. The
           average intensity of the primary beam in these
           sections was respectively (4.34 + - 0.03)*10**5,
            (3.91+ - 0.03)*10**5, and (3.40+ - 0.03) *10**5
           protons/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PLATE)
SAMPLE     A stack of 29 type NIKFI-BR pellicles of initial
           thickness 400 microns was used. Three pellicles were
           impregnated with heavy water, and the remainder with
           ordinary water. The thickness of the impregnated
           layers was 1000 microns.

COMMENT    *By authors* Contribution of the quasi-elastic
           scattering and of other background events was ~ 5 %
           for all angle intervals.
