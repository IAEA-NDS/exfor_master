           (3CZRCZR) Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) DC-280 cyclotron of the Superheavy
           Element Factory
METHOD     (TOF,ASPEC)
INC-SOURCE Maximum beam intensity was of 3 p mu-A.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of the enriched isotopes and were
           produced by electrodeposition on a 0.62-mg/cm2 Ti
           backing. Targets consisted of 12 sectors which were
           mounted on a periphery of a disk with a diameter of
           24 cm and 10-mm target layer opened for the beam and
           were rotated at 980 rpm. The total active surface
           area was 69 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were analyzed by means
           of Dubna Gas Filled Recoil Separator (DGFRS-2).
           (SISD) The focal detector of 48 mm in vertical and
           220 mm in horizontal directions consisted of two 48 x
           128-mm double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs).
           They were mounted one by one in such a way that the
           front detector shielded part of the rear detector.
           Forty eight 1-mm front horizontal strips of both
           detectors were connected. The back strips were paired
           together to form 110 strips of 2 mm width. These
           detectors were surrounded by eight silicon single-
           sided 60 x 120-mm side detectors (SSSDs), each with
           eight strips, forming a box with a depth of 120 mm.
           (MWPC) Two multiwire proportional chambers were used
           to register the nuclei passing through the separator.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) The decay properties of 286Fl and 287Fl, as
           well as their descendants, have been refined from 25
           and 69 new decay chains, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS The beam energy was measured with a systematic
           uncertainty of 1 MeV.
           (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty is given.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Excitation energy of the compound nucleus.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. V.K.Utyonkov.

           targets were 0.56 and 0.35 mg/cm2 thick.
