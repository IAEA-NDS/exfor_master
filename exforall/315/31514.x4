INC-SPECT  The average neutron flux at the place of irradiation
            was approx. 10**7 n/cm2/s
SAMPLE     Neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) powder of enriched isotopes.
           The samples were made by uniform spreading the
            powdered sample within perspex ring of diameter
            1.6 cm and were sandwiched between two thin cellulose
            tapes.
           The samples were irradiated simultaneously by wrapping
            them in cadmium foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of contribution the sample was
            performed in zero degree forward direction at a
            distance of 2.0 and 2.5 cm, respectively, from litium
            and tritium targets.
           The product nuclei were identified by their
            characteristic gamma transitions following their
            decay.
           ORTEC detector with associated electronics was coupled
            with 4096 channel ND-100 analyser.

ERR-ANALYS See Ann. Nucl. Energy 11(1984)172 (EXFOR.30678):
           Systematic errors
            1.Fluctuation in the proton-beam current +-6 %
            2.Detection efficiency of GE(LI) detector 2-6 %
            3.Self-absorption of gamma-rays in the samples between
              0.5 and 2 %
            4.Estimation of the number of nuclei,less than +-0.3%
              The weighing was done up to an accuracy of 0.01 mg
            5.Non-reproducibility of the geometries at the times
              of irradiation and counting +-2 %
            6.Integration of the pulse-height spectrum, +-1
              to +-5 %
            7.Pulse-summing effect less than 0.2 %
            8.Various measurements of the standard reaction
              cross-section had an uncertainty of about 7 %
           Statistical errors in the counts under the photopeaks
            between +-1 and +-10 %
           Error in the decay properties were not taken into
            account.
COMMENT    By compiler (2012-04-27):
            En uncertainty 6.10 MeV at 0.46 MeV given Table 1 is
            perhaps typographical mistake. Text (p554) gives 0.04
            MeV instead of 6.10 MeV and it is adopted in 002-003.
