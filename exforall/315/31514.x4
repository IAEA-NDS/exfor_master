TITLE      Fast neutron radiative capture cross-sections in
           fission product isotopes of neodymium
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM) 5.5 MV Van-de-Graff accelerator at
           Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay, India
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T) The average neutron flux at the place of
           irradiation was approx. 10**7 n/cm2/s
SAMPLE     Neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) powder of enriched isotopes:
           Nd-148: 93.2%, Nd-150: 94.0%
           The samples were made by uniform spreading the
           powdered sample within perspex ring of diameter 1.6 cm
           and were sendwiched between two thin cellulose tapes.
           The samples were irradiated simultaneously by wrapping
           them in cadmium foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of contribution the sample was
           performed in zero degree forward direction at a
           distance of 2.0 and 2.5 cm, respectively, from litium
           and tritium targets.
           The product nuclei were identified by their
           characteristic gamma transitions following their decay.
           Ortec detector with associated electronics was coupled
           with 4096 channel ND-100 analyser.

           EXFOR.30678:
           Systematic errors
            1.Fluctuation in the proton-beam current +-6 %
            2.Detection efficiency of GE(LI) detector 2-6 %
            3.Self-absorption of gamma-rays in the samples between
              0.5 and 2 %
            4.Estimation of the number of nuclei,less than +-0.3%
              The weighing was done up to an accuracy of 0.01 mg
            5.Non-reproducibility of the geometries at the times
              of irradiation and counting +-2 %
            6.Integration of the pulse-height spectrum, +-1
              to +-5 %
            7.Pulse-summing effect less than 0.2 %
            8.Various measurements of the standard reaction
              cross-section had an uncertainty of about 7 %
           Statistical errors in the counts under the photopeaks
            between +-1 and +-10 %
           Error in the decay properties were not taken into
            account.
