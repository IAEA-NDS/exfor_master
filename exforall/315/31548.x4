FACILITY   (REAC) IEA-R1 pool-type 2 MW IPEN research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Core of the reactor
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method.
INC-SPECT  The thermal and epithermal average neutron fluxes,
           about 6x10**11 and 2x10**11 neutronsxcm2/s, respectivel
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray measurements were performed with a
           HPGe detector, shielded by a 10-cm thick lead wall and
           previously calibrated with an standard 152Eu source.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of approx. 0.0015 g natural
           isotopic composition metallic thorium (20 mu-g
           uncertainty, 100% 232Th), obtained from a foil
           0.0508 mm thick, 99,8503% purity.  The irradiation
           sample consisted of a thorium target and Au-Al foils,
           irradiated in pairs with and without a 0.5-mm-thick
           Cd shield, wrapped in thin commercial aluminum foils.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative uncertainty is
           due to two kinds of errors:
             * the correction for the activation by epithermal
               neutrons, 1.9% of the cross section, and other
               smaller contributions, like time measurements
               and counting statistics.
             * the emission probability of the 312-keV gamma ray,
               1.0% relative standard deviation, followed by the
               relative precision in the Au cross section used as
               the monitor, 0.3%.
            The uncertainty due to the efficiency calibration is
            almost negligible because the final result depends
            only on the relative efficiency of the 312 keV from
            233Pa and 411 keV from 198Au decay gamma rays.
