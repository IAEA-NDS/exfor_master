TITLE      Activation Cross Section Measurements of

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3KORKRM) The MC-50 cyclotron at KIRAMS is an
           azimuthally varying- field (AVF)-type cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) Semi-monoenergetic neutrons with a maximum
           energy of 18.1 MeV were  generated by using the
           9Be(p,n)9B reaction with the 20-MeV proton beam
           delivered  from the MC-50 cyclotron. The Be target
           system consisted of a 1-mm-thick 9Be target and a
           proton stopper with a 1-mm-thick aluminum wall and a
           1-mm-thick aluminum disc.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Two methods were used:
             * LSC (liquid scintillation counting) for
               cross section measurement and direct counting
               of 14C atoms
             * AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) measurement
           for direct counting of 14C atoms.
SAMPLE     Ten C3D6O (d-acetone) liquid targets (acetone-d6,
           certified 100 at.% D) contained  in 1-c.c. ampules were
           irradiated with neutrons. Nine samples were used for
           the a LSC measurement, and the one remaining sample
           was  used for the AMS  measurement.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) LSC measurements at the Korea Research
           Institute of Standard and Science (KRISS)
           by taking gamma-ray energy spectra with an LSC
           system (Quantulus Liquid  Scintillation Spectrometer)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The neutron flux, the statistical
           uncertainties of gamma-ray counts,  and the efficiency
           of the LSC system were all included in the error of
           the cross  section.
