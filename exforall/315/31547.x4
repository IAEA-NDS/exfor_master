FACILITY   (REAC,3BZLIPE) IEA-R1 pool-type 2 MW IPEN res. reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Core of the reactor
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method.
INC-SPECT  Thermal and epithermal average neutron fluxes of
           4.7E12 n/cm2/s and 7.4E11 n/cm2/s, respectively.
           Irradiation times were 15 and 24 h for the thermal
           and resonance integral cross-section measurements,
           respectively.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray measurements were performed with a
           HPGe detector (35% ORTEC), shielded by a 10-cm-thick
           lead wall, using live time counting methodology.
SAMPLE     The samples to be irradiated were made from aliquots of
           57Co (approx.0.8 MBq) solution dropped inside quartz
           bottles with an external diameter of 9-mm and 1-mm wall
           thickness. The samples were placed inside a sealed
           aluminum rabbit
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) Au-Al alloy
           with 0.1% gold in form of foils
           were used to monitor the thermal and epithermal
           neutron fluxes. Foils were irradiated in pairs with
           and without 0.5 mm thick cadmium shield.
