TITLE      Activation cross sections for generation of long-lived
           radionuclides.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T-Ti target with thickness = 0.9mg/cm**2;
           Effective deuteron beam energy = 125 keV;
           Beam current intensity = 20 mA;
           Neutron yield: about (1-3)*E+12 neutrons/sec;
           Neutron flux monitored by a uranium fission chamber;
           Neutron energies at sample positions were determined
           by cross section ratios of the Zr-90(n,2n)Zr-89-m+g
           and Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92-m reactions.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial high purity Ge detector in conjunction
           with an EG & G ORTEC 7450 multichannel analyzer;
           Relative efficiency: 20%
           Energy resolution: 2.7 keV at 1.33 MeV;
           Efficiency calibration with standard sources at 20 cm
           distance to detector;
           Efficiency ratio between 20 cm and 2 cm (sample
           position) was determined with a set of monoenergetic
           calibration sources.
CORRECTION For detector efficiency conversion from 20 cm to 2 cm,
           neutron fluence fluctuation during irradiation,
           gamma-ray self absorption in the sample,
           coincidence sum effect in the investigated nuclide,
           counting geometry.
