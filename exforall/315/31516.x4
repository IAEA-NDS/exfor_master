TITLE      Threshold reaction cross sections of nickel isotopes,
           averaged over a U-235 fission neutron spectrum
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method with registration of
           secondary gamma-ray spectra. Irradiation times were
           not more than 20 min, to keep the burn up losses
           negligible. Source-to-detector distances no closer than
           4.8 cm for short-lived activities (Co-60m, Co-61) and
           Co-58g and detector dead time less than 5% (Co-60m,
           Co-61) or 1% - Co-58g. 3 cm source-to-detector
           distances for long-lived activities with dead time less
           than 0.2%.

           Compiler's note: The neutron flux characteristics of
           this reactor as given in earlier publications (see
           ENTRY 31511 for references) are the following:
           thermal neutron flux about 6.0E+12 neutrons/cm**2/sec,
           epithermal neutron flux about 3.0E+11
           neutrons/cm**2/sec and fast neutron flux about 2.0E+12

DETECTOR   (HPGE) 67 cm*3 ORTEC high-purity germanium intrinsic-N
           coaxial detector with efficiency 12.3% relative to the
           7.6*7.6-cm NaI(Tl) detector at 1.33 MeV and 25-cm
           distance.
           The detector absolute efficiency curve was obtained
           with IAEA and NIST standard sources calibrated within
           2 per-cent uncertainty.

           - 0.987. Data are taken
           from J.K. Tuli, Nuclear Wallet Cards, BNL (1995) for
           half-life and from R.B. Firestone and V. Shirley, Table
           of Isotopes (1996) for gamma-ray energy and emission
           probability. Same sources were used for decay radiation
           parameters of all measured activities
CORRECTION Gamma-ray self-attenuation correction factors were
           computed considering the foil samples as slabs and
           using data from Nucl. Data Tables, Vol.7, Chap. 6
            (1970) p. 565.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)The statistical component of the uncertainty was
           obtained as weighted mean for a few measurements and
           is given separately.
           (ERR-T)The total uncertainty includes
           the corresponding isotopic abundance uncertainty
           (MONIT-ERR) 2.8% as uncertainty of the reference cross
           section value,

SAMPLE     Natural isotopic abundance of Ni-58 was taken as:
           68.077+-0.009%
METHOD     3 samples were individually irradiated under 1 mm-thick
           cadmium covers for 20 min. After about 1 hr decay, a
           series of 12 20-min spectra were taken in a period of
           24 hr; between about 50 and 100 hr decay another eight
           1 hr spectra were taken and last spectrum was measured
           after an 8-day decay. Last spectrum was used as
           for Ni-58(n,p)Co-58m+g reaction. From equation of decay
           and peak area of 811.8 keV gamma ray measured in these
           spectra the cross sections with independent yield of
           Co-58-m and Co-58-g can be determined as independent
           From sample mass and purity, fast neutron flux,
