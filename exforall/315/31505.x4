FACILITY   (LINAC,3ARGCAB) Pulsed 25 MeV electron linear
            accelerator at the Centro Atomico Bariloche.
            The Linac was run at 5O pps and 9.3 micro-amp average
            current runs were performed.
INC-SOURCE  Lead target + ple (2 cm thickness in different runs)
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight technique, flight paths = 8.33 m.
            The  sample-in sample-out method was used.
MONITOR     Normalized transmission measurement.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Seven He-3 counters, each of 2.5 cm diam. and
            15 cm active length, with 10 atm filling gas pressure
CORRECTION  Performed: background, dead time and mean emission
            time.
            Negligible: in-scattering and multiple scattering.
PART-DET   (N) Neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Quoted errors due to statistics only.
