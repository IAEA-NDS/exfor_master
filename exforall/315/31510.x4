TITLE      Experimental and Calculated Scandium Threshold
           Reaction Cross Sections Averaged over a U-235 Fission
           Neutron Specrum
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method with registration of
           secondary gamma-ray spectra.
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron flux from RA-6 materials test
           reactor at Centre Atomico Barilochi
INC-SPECT  Undisturbed U-235 fission spectrum. Set of 8
           activation detectors having thresholds from 2.6 to
           11.6 MeV were used to show that flux of fission
           neutrons is undisturbed
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 67 cm*3 ORTEC high-purity germanium intrinsic-N
           coaxial detector with resolution 2 keV at 1.33 MeV.
           The detector absolute efficiency curve was obtained
           with IAEA standard sources (Am-241, Ba-133, Co-60,
           Cs-137, Eu-152) calibrated within 2 per-cent
           uncertainty. Ra-226 source was also used
SAMPLE     3 scandium foils, 0.127 mm thick and 99.85 per-cent
           pure with a mass from 4 to 18 mg inside 1 mm thick
           cadmium cover. 1.5 mg/g impurities include gold,
           manganese, terbium, tantalum (1.2 mg/g), samarium,
           sodium, and tungsten.

CORRECTION Gamma self-attenuation factor for 811.79 keV line in
           nickel foil and wire was calculated as 0.992
           and 0.981, respectively. Gamma self-attenuation
           factors for scandium foil are given in free text
           under DECAY-DATA
ERR-ANALYS The systematic uncertainty components for all
           measurements: 2.8% - uncertainty of the reference
           cross section value, 2 to 3% - uncertainty in the
           detector absolute efficiency determination (depending
           on energy and counting geometry), 1% - uncertainty due
           to sample impurities, 1% - uncertainty in sample and
           monitor foils mass determination, nickel isotopic
           abundance, decay constant, self-attenuation
           corrections. Total systematic uncertainty is between
           4.3 and 4.8%
COMMENT    The experimental results were compared with the
           calculated ones. The calculated averaged cross
           sections were obtained by folding the statistical
           model curves adjusted by list square procedure to the
           experimental microscopic cross sections with 9
           different analytical model presentations. It is shown
           that for Sc-45(n,2n) high threshold reaction the
           calculated values are systematically lower than
           experimental values especially for Watt
           parameterisation. New analytical presentation for U-235
           fission neutron spectra which gives more neutrons for
           En > 10 MeV is proposed

ANALYSIS   Final value is obtained as weighted averaged
           of results of 3 measurements with their statistical
           uncertainties (0.289+-0.010, 0.3089+-0.0059 and
           0.3131+-0.0062 mb). Then systematic uncertainty was
           added
DECAY-DATA (19-K-42,12.360HR,DG,1524.70,.1808) Scandium foil
           self-attenuation factor is 0.999. Possible
           interference due to potassium impurity in the scandium
           sample through 19-K-41(n,g)19-K-42 reaction was
           assumed less than 1%
ERR-ANALYS Total uncertainty is given. Main contribution to the
           uncertainty (4 to 5%)is due to background in
           gamma-spectrum generated by the 2010 keV sum peak
            (889+1121) from the decay of Sc-46
