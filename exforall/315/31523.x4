SAMPLE     252Cf electro-deposited on Au planchet covered with
            VYNS film.
           Fission fragments could pass through film.
           Fission fragments were collected on sodium acetate
            salt pellets with mass thickness 70-90 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Pellets were dissolved in hot basic solution
            containing iodine carrier and a little hold-back
            carrier of tellurium.
           After completion of separation, iodine was oxidized,
            then extracted and after further chemical procedures
            collected on a teflon disc, dried, mounted and
            counted.
           (GSPEC) 133I (530 keV peak) was counted, 135I was
            used as intrinsic monitor for the chemical yield.
           Spectra were taken at different separation times.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Low-background NaI(Tl) scintillation detector
            coupled to multichannel analyzer.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Spectra taken at different delay (separation)
            times were used to obtain the parameters of the
            equations for the growth (from 133mTe and 133gTe)
            and the decay of 133I, and hence for the fractional
            yields of 133mTe and 133gTe.
           The equations were solved in an iteration process.

ASSUMED    (ASSUM,98-CF-252(0,F)51-SB-133,CUM,FY,,FRC)
CORRECTION Corrected for
            - chemical yield,
            - interfering gamma-peaks of 135mXe and 135gXe,
            - efficiencies of counters.
ERR-ANALYS No information on the source of the uncertainty.
           Compiler's comment: The total error is probably
            resulting from the iteration process employed to
            obtain fractional yields from activities.
