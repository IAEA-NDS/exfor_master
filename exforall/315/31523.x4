TITLE      Nuclear charge distribution in the spontaneous fission
           of Cf-252: determination of fractional cumulative
           yields of Te-133m and Te-133g.
SAMPLE     Cf-252 electro-deposited on gold planchet,covered with
           VYNS film.Fission fragments could pass through film.
           Fission fragments were collected on sodium acetate salt
           pellets with mass thickness 70-90 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (RCHEM) Pellets were dissolved in hot basic solution
           containing iodine carrier and a little hold-back
           carrier of tellurium. After completion of separation,
           iodine was oxidized, then extracted and after further
           chemical procedures collected on a teflon disc, dried,
           mounted and counted.
           (GSPEC) I-133 (530 keV peak) was counted, I-135 was
           used as intrinsic monitor for the chemical yield.
           Spectra were taken at different separation times.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Low-background, coupled to multichannel
           analyzer;
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Spectra taken at different delay (separation)
           times were used to obtain the parameters of the
           equations for the growth (from Te-133m and Te-133g)
           and the decay of I-133, and hence for the fractional
           yields of Te-133m and Te-133g. The equations were
           solved in an iteration process.

           (98-CF-252(0,F)53-I-133,CUM,FY))
           Sb-133 fractional cumulative yield, given as ratio to
           the I-133 cumulative yield, used for calculating the
           data in subentries 2-4.
CORRECTION Chemical yield, interfering gamma-peaks of Xe-135m and
           Xe-135g, efficiencies of counters.
ERR-ANALYS No details given. Compiler's comment: the total error
           is probably resulting from the iteration process
           employed to obtain fractional yields from activities.
