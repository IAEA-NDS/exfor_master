SAMPLE     High purity zirconyl nitrate (99.999%pure), weighing
           25-50 mg, was filled  in a quartz ampoule, sealed and
           then placed in an NRX type  aluminum irradiation
           capsule.

           Two of each of the four neutron flux monitor foils (Au,
           Co, Fe and Ni) were placed in a cylindrical arrangement

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) On the average the fast neutron flux density
            was 7x10**13/cm2/s.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
           activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
           products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP)
           Each cross-section value is a mean of at least six
           independent measurements.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
           the monitor reactions was detennined by gamma-ray
           spectrometry using a co-axial 270 cm3 HPGe detector in
           conjunction with a 4K Canberra Series 85 multichannel
           analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, gamma-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The given uncertainties incorporate both
           statistical and systematic uncertainties.
           The main sources of uncertainties involved in
           cross-section measurements were those associated with
           the determination of fast neutron flux densities (<8%)
           and absolute decay rates (5 to 10%).
           Other sources of uncertainties were small and were due
           to uncertainties in the number of target nuclei (< 1%)
           as well as in irradiation and cooling times (<<1%).
           The overall uncertainty in each reaction cross section
           was obtained by summing the individual uncertainties
           in quadrature.
