FACILITY   (VDGT,3KORKRM) KIGAM 1.7 MV tandem accelerator with
           the source of negative ion by cesium sputtering (SNICS)
INC-SOURCE (P-T) The TiT thin film target of this experiment
           was provided by a company (SODERN) in France. Backing
           material was Cu with a thickness of 1.2 mm and a
           diameter of 2.54 cm. Ti was deposited on Cu with an
           areal density of from 200 to 300 mu-g/cm2 and tritium
           was impregnated into Ti.
           The control of the beam energy and the stability for
           terminal voltage was performed by the resonance of
           991+-1 keV in 27Al(p,gamma) and that of 3047+-1 keV
           in 16O(alpha,alpha).
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
           (FLUX) Neutron flux was measured by a monitor until the
           accumulated proton charge reached 20 mC for 63Cu.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
            Two samples of Au are:
            First: purity - 99.99% , weight - 122.84g , diam. -
           5.115cm, thickness - 0.315cm, density - 19.282g/cm3,
           molecular weight - 196.97g, areal density - 1.7633.
            Second: purity - 99.99% , weight - 117.34g , diam. -
           5.090cm, thickness - 0.310cm, density - 19.282g/cm3,
           molecular weight - 196.97g, areal density - 1.8280.
           Cross sections of Au are references without
           uncertainties for calculating the cross sections of
           63Cu and 186W. These reference data were obtained by
           fitting ENDF-6 data about Au(n,gamma) reaction with
           polinomial. (Authors comment)
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198,,DG,411.)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The pulse-height spectrum and the pulse-shape
           spectrum of the produced neutron were measured by
           2"x2" BC-501 liquid scintillation detector.
           Other BC-501 liquid scintillation detector is used as
           a neutron monitor.
           (HPGE) A 2"x2" HP Ge detector was used as a detector
           of gamma-rays.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error includes the fluctuations of
           gamma-ray counts and monitor counts.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic error includes the difference of
           the simulated efficiency to the measured efficiency
           of HPGe, the uncertainty of areal density of samples,
           and the longterm decrease of the tritium areal density
           by evaporation on proton bombardments.
