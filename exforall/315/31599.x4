FACILITY   (REAC) Dalat nuclear research reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The structures of the filter for 55 keV
           neutron beam are 98cmSi+35g/cm2S+0.2g/cm2B10, Flux
           density 5.61x10**5 n/cm2/s, and those
           for 144 keV neutron beam are 98cmSi+1cmTi+0.2g/cm2B10,
           Flux density 2.14x10**6 n/cm2/s.
SAMPLE     The samples were prepared from the natural oxide
           powders, 99.99% purity, of La2O3, Sm2O3 and IrO2.
           Each sample was sandwiched between two gold disks,
           and the sample groups were wrapped in Cd covers with
           0.5mm in thickness with aim to reject most of
           thermal neutron background.
METHOD     (ACTIV,FNB)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activities of samples and gold foils were
           measured with the high resolution and efficiency
           calibrated HPGe detector, and the samples were placed
           on the surface of the detector because of their
           weak activities.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The results,
           obtained relative to the standard cross section values
           of 197Au(n,g)198Au
           The standard gold foils with 2.54cm in diameter and
           0.01mm in thick. were used as the neutron flux monitors

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The experimental uncertainties of the current
           measurements are 5 to 10%, which are mainly due to:
            * the statistical errors (0.1 - 2%),
           (ERR-1) the uncertainties of gamma-ray detection
              efficiency (3.5%)
           (ERR-2) the reference cross section value (3.0%)
           (ERR-3) the correction factors for neutron resonance
              capture, self-shielding and multiscattering
              effects (~3%).
