           reactor ( PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity ruthenium sponge, titanium sponge, europium
           oxide or dysprosium oxide, weighing 25-50 mg each, was
           filled in a quartz ampoule, sealed and then placed in
           an NRX type alummum irradiation capsule. Two of each
           of the three neutron flux monitor foils (Au, Fe and Ni)
           were placed in a cylindrical arrangement around the
           ampoule in such a way that the same neutron flux
           monitor material was on opposite sides of the ampoule.

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
           activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
           products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation of 45Ti, 96gTC, 153Sm,
           153Gd from the irradiated material.
           Each cross section value is a mean of at least four
           independent measurements.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
           the monitor reactions was detennined by gamma-ray
           spectrometry using a co-axial 245 cm3 HPGe detector in
           conjunction with a 4K Canberra Series 85 multichannel
           analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, gamma-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
           statistical and systematic errors. Main sources of
           errors associated in cross-section measurements were
           those associated with determination of fast neutron
           flux densities (8%) and absolute decay rates (5 to 10%)
           Other sources of error were small and were due to
           uncertainties in the number of target nuclei < 1% and
           in radiation and cooling times ( 1%).
