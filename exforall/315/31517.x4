TITLE      Measurement of the thermal neutron capture cross
           section of Cs-137
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method. 30 min irradiation time.
           Time interval between
           the end of irradiation and counting is 10 min.
           Nine irradiations have been performed in order to
           obtain the needed statistics
FACILITY   (REAC) IEA-R1 pool-type 2 MW IPEN research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Core of the reactor
INC-SPECT  Flux of thermal neutrons 1.7E+12 n/cm*2/sec with
           epithermal index in the Westcott r*sqrt(T/T0)
           convention equals to 0.036.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) calibrated using Co-60, Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152,
           and Am-241 standard sources supplied by the IAEA.
           Additional points were obtained using Na-22 and Y-88
           standard sources.  All samples were counted at distance
           of 88 mm from the detector.
SAMPLE     1.1 MBq Cs-137 target sealed inside a 0.8 mm thick
           polyethylene sandwich and placed inside polyethylene
           rabbit
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) Au-Al alloy
           with 0.1% gold in form of foils
           were used to monitor the thermal and epithermal
           neutron fluxes. Foils were irradiated in pairs with
           and without 0.5 mm thick cadmium shield.
           Compiler's note: used Au-197(n,g) standard cross sect.
           is not given, but from other works done by the authors
           at this time and with this method it is 98.8+-0.3 b
            (see N.L.Maidana et al.,RCA,89,419,2001)

           (55-CS-138-M,2.91MIN,DG,1435.86,.19)
CORRECTION Corrected at dead time and pile-up were introduced
           where they were needed.
           Correction at branch of beta decay of Cs-138m
           into Ba-138 without emission of 1435.86 keV gamma-rays,
           which depends from unknown isomer production
           probability was estimated in the limits of 1.5% and
           added to the overall uncertainty.
           Correction at contribution of the epithermal neutrons
           Has been estimated to be 5.7%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Full covariance analysis for 4 groups
           of measurements was done.
           The individual components of the uncertainty
           100% correlated between groups of measurements:
           production of Cs-138m - 1.5%
           detector efficiency - 0.99%
           decay correction of Cs-138 - 1.2 to 1.4%
           dead time and pile-up - 0.97
           epithermal neutrons (for 0.0253 eV cross section) -1.8%
           and with 0% correlations between groups is counting
           statistics varying from 9.4 to 14.8%.
STATUS     Data taken from  p.118 of main reference.
