INC-SPECT  The true integrated neutron flux at the sample
            position was increased to 1.0x10**8 n/cm2/s with
            the Cd-ratio of over 200.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Relative efficiency of 43% and resolution of
            2.5 keV (FWHM) for the 60Co 1332 keV gamma-line.
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.956) Enriched (95.6 at.%) 6Li2CO3
            powder, whose 6Li abundance was confirmed by mass
            spectrometry.
METHOD     (MOMIX) 6Li2CO3 sample was mixed with melamine, and
            the mass ratio of 6Li2CO3 to melamine was determined
            by predicting the approximate count rates for the 6Li
            and 1H capture gamma-rays.
           (ACTIV) Two samples 6Li2CO3:melamine=224 mg:211 mg,
            and 157 mg:306 mg were irradiated for about 70 hrs.
CORRECTION Empty run was done for about 60 hrs to measure
            background.
           Two graphite samples (203 and 562 mg, 99.999% purity)
            were also irradiated for about 50 hrs to estimate
            background variation due to scattering effect of the
            sample.
