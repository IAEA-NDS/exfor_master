FACILITY   (REAC,3KORKAE) Hanaro, the 24MW research reactor
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe detector with a relative efficiency of
           43% was used.
SAMPLE     The Li target sample consisted of 95.6 at.% enriched
           6Li2CO3 powder,  whose 6Li abundance was confirmed by
           mass spectrometry. The  homogeneous mixture samples of
           6Li2CO3 and melamine (C3H6N6)  were prepared and
           irradiated with neutrons.
INC-SPECT  The true integrated neutron flux at the sample
           position was increased to 1.0x10**8 n/cm2/s,
           and the Cd-ratio was over 200.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includs following components:
             * efficiency;
             * Net peak count rate;
             * k(0,H) factor.
           (MONIT-ERR) the uncertainty includes the same
           components as ERR-T.
