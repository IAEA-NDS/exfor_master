FACILITY   (REAC,3HUNKFI) The guided thermal neutron beam of the
           Budapest Research Reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (GSPEC)
INC-SPECT  Properties of the thermal neutron beam and neutron
           guide are: Length -33m; Curvature: -4500 m;
           Cross section of the guide: 25 x 100mm2;
           Cross section of the collimator: 20 x 20mm2;
           Effective temperature: approx. 100 K;
           Coating: natural nickel;
           Length of guide elements:0.75 m.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Compton suppressed HPGe detector with
           5-cm-diam. Ge crystal and a 2-cm-diam. lead collimator
