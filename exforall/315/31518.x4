TITLE      Measurement of the thermal neutron capture cross
           section and resonance integral of Am-241
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method with measuring the
           activity with 4Pi-beta-gamma coincidence system
           applying the tracer technique. 30 min irradiation time
           for thermal cross section measurements and 60 min for
           resonance integral measurements. Time interval between
           the end of irradiation and counting is about 60 min.
           2 irradiations for thermal cross section determination
           After irradiation the sample
           was diluted in 1 M HNO3 solution and activity was
           measured in 4-Pi-beta-gamma system for source prepared.

INC-SPECT  Flux of thermal neutrons 2.8E+12 n/cm*2/sec with
           epithermal index in the Westcott r*sqrt(T/T0)
           convention equals to 0.036. A slight variation in the
           epithermal neutron spectrum with respect to the usual
           1/E form was observed
DETECTOR   (COIN,PROPC,NAICR) gas flow proportional counter with
           4-Pi geometry (90%Ar + 10%CH4, 0.1 MPA) as the beta
           detector in the coincidence with
           two 7.6*7.6-cm NaI(Tl) scintillation counter
           as gamma-detector. The selected gamma-channel window
           covered both 1173 and 1332 keV peaks of Co-60

           polyethylene and placed inside polyethylene rabbit

CORRECTION Corrected for accidental coincidence, dead time and
           decay.
           For thermal cross section: corrected at the
           contribution in the activation from 0.308 eV and 0.573
           eV resonances, at the departure of the epithermal
           neutron spectrum from 1/E dependence and at the
           non-ideal Cd cut-off of thermal neutrons with Monte
           Carlo simulation calculations.
           For resonance integral, the Monte Carlo simulated
           corrections was equal to 7.5%, corrected at resonance

ANALYSIS   Compiler considers
           measured "thermal" cross section given in this work
           as equal to the value at 0.0253 eV energy point
           because corrections at deviation of cross sections
           from 1/V and spectrum in epithermal region from
           1/E dependence are introduced
