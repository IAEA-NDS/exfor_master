SAMPLE     Two different disc-shaped samples of ZnO (99.4%
           enriched in 68Zn) were used, 1cm in diam., 0.1cm thick,
           and masses of 150 and 98 mg (83.920+-0.005 molecular
           weight). The samples were irradiated inside 1 mm-thick
           cadmium covers.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated on different days
           during 30, 45, or 60 s for the studying of
           sequential spectra.
           The measurements were made by two methods:
             1. Direct method
             2. Straight line method - determination from
                simultaneous measurement of metastable and
                ground state cross sections.
PART-DET   (DG)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were performed in the reactor core
            in undisturbed U-235 fission neutron spectrum.
           The fast neutron flux, measured during the irradiation
           of each and all samples, varied between 1.70x10**12
           and 1.85x10**12 n/cm2/s.
