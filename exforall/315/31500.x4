TITLE      The Effect of Low-Energy Neutrons on Activation
           Cross Sections Measurement

FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) In the 1 up to 13 MeV energy region.
           (D-T) In the 13 up to 20 MeV energy region.
           Incident energies of deuteron beams were 2 and 3 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) In order to reduce effect of low-energy
           neutrons on activation cross-section measurement,
           following technics were used:
            - The new D target was used (1.5 mg/cm2 instead
              1.7 mg/cm2).
            - In the neutron energy region from 1 to 6 MeV,
              the irradiation time for neutrons was as short
              as possible.
            - In the 7 to 13 MeV energy region, the
              measuring neutron flux was deducted from the curve
              of the effective reaction threshold energy via the
              measured neutron flux. The curve was obtained by
              irradiating a set of samples with different reaction
              threshold energies.
            - In the 13 to 20 MeV energy
              region, the effect of low-energy neutrons was
              deducted by irradiating an empty target that was
              free of T.
           Neutron spectra for the D(d,n)He-3 and T(d,n)He-4
           reactions at the 0-degree angle have been measured
           by the time-of-flying method for the deuteron beams
           of 2 and 3 MeV.
