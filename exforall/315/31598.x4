ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error is given.
           The partial uncertainties from:
           - irradiation, decay and counting time - 0.1%
           - irradiation geometry - 0.5 to 1.5%
           - sample weight - 0.3%
           - statistics counting - 1-10% (depends on spectrum)
           - efficiency of the detector - 1.5-3%
           - error in flux determination - 2-4%
           - neutron absorption and scattering - 0.5%
           - self-absorption of gamma rays in sample - 0.5%
           - gamma-ray emission probability - 0.3 to 1%
           - decay data - 0.3 to 1%
           - neutron flux variation with time - 0.5-1.5%

INC-SOURCE (D-T) D-T reaction under 0, 10, 30, 60, 80, 110 degree
           angles between deuteron beam and neutrons for nickel
SAMPLE     Extremely pure natural nickel (purity 99.9%) foils were
           cut into round shaped (diam. 12 mm) and cleaned
           thoroughly by acetone. Masses of the foils were in the
           range 0.6675-0.7006g. Each of the foils was sandwiched
           by two aluminium (purity 99%) flux monitor foils. These
           two aluminium foils were used to determine average
           flux at the sample position. Masses of the aluminium
           foils were in the range 0.1003-0.1118g.
