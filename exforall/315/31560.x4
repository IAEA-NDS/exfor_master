TITLE      Measurement of fission neutron spectrum averaged cross
            sections of some threshold reactions on europium:

FACILITY   (REAC,3PAKNIL) 5 MW swimming pool type Pakistan
            research reactor (PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity europium oxide (99.999% pure), weighing
            25-50 mg, was filled in a quartz ampoule, sealed and
            then placed in an NRX type aluminum irradiation
             capsule.
           Two of each of the four neutron flux monitor foils
            (Au, Co, Fe and Ni), were placed in a cylindrical
            arrangement around the ampoule in such a way that the
            same neutron flux monitor material was on opposite
            sides of the ampoule, allowing thereby a
            determination of the effective flux density within
            the ampoule.
           The foils were washed with acetone; dried and weighed
            before attaching to the ampoules.

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal-neutron flux
            ratio for monitor reactions having different
            threshold it was concluded that the neutron spectrum
            used was approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
            activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
            products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) A new radiochemical separation was proposed.
           Tracer experiments showed the chemical yield of the
            procedure up to 98 +/- 2%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
            the monitor reactions was determined by gamma-ray
            spectrometry using a coaxial 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector
            in conjunction with a 4 K Canberra Series 85
            multichannel analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates
            corrections were applied for radiochemical yields,
            gamma-ray intensities, detector efficiencies,
            counting geometry, absorption, self-absorption,
            pile-up effects and coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
            statistical and systematic errors.
