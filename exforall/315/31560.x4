FACILITY   (REAC,3PAKNIL) 5 MW swimming pool type Pakistan
           research reactor ( PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity europium oxide (99.999% pure), weighing
           25-50 mg, was filled in a quartz ampoule, sealed and
           then placed in an NRX type aluminum irradiation capsule
           Two of each of the four neutron flux monitor foils (Au,
           Co, Fe and Ni), were placed in a cylindrical
           arrangement around the ampoule in such a way that the
           same neutron flux monitor material was on opposite
           sides of the ampoule, allowing thereby a determination
           of the effective flux density within the ampoule.
           The foils were washed with acetone; dried and weighed
           before attaching to the ampoules.

           reactions.
INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
           activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
           products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) A new radiochemical separation was proposed.
           Tracer experiments showed the chemical yield of the
           procedure up to 98 +- 2%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
           the monitor reactions was determined by gamma-ray
           spectrometry using a coaxial 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector in
           conjunction with a 4 K Canberra Series 85 multichannel
           analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, gamma-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
           statistical and systematic errors. Main sources of
           errors associated in cross-section measurements were
           those associated with determination of fast neutron
           flux densities (8%) and absolute decay rates (5 to 10%)
           Other sources of error were small and were due to
           uncertainties in the number of target nuclei < 1% and
           in radiation and cooling times ( 1%).
