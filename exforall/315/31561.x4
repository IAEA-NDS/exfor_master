           (3PAKPAK) Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad
FACILITY   (REAC,3PAKNIL) 5 MW swimming pool type Pakistan
            research reactor (PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity titanium sponge (99.999% pure), weighing
            25-50 mg, was filled in a quartz ampoule, sealed and
            then placed in an NRX type aluminum irradiation
            capsule.
           Two of each of the three neutron flux monitor foils
            (Au, Fe and Ni) were placed in a cylindrical
            arrangement around the ampoule in such a way that the
            same neutron flux monitor material was on opposite
            sides of the ampoule, allowing thereby a
            determination of the effective flux density within
            the ampoule.
           The foils were washed with acetone; dried and weighed
            before attaching to the ampoules.

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
            ratio for monitor reactions having different
            threshold it was concluded that the neutron spectrum
            used was approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
            activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
            products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) Tracer experiments showed the chemical yield
            of the procedure up to 98 +/- 2%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
            the monitor reactions was determined by gamma-ray
            spectrometry using a coaxial 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector
            in conjunction with a 4 K Canberra Series 85
            multichannel analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates
            corrections were applied for radiochemical yields,
            gamma-ray intensities, detector efficiencies,
            counting geometry, absorption, self-absorption, pile-
            up effects and coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
            statistical and systematic errors.
           (ERR-1) Fast neutron flux densities    (8%)
           (ERR-2) Radiation and cooling times    (1%)
           (ERR-3,5.,10.) Absolute decay rates (5-10%)
           (ERR-4,,1.) Number of target nuclei   (<1%)
DECAY-DATA No information was given about decay data.

REACTION   (22-TI-46(N,2N)22-TI-45,,SIG,,FIS) In the case of this
           reaction, the contribution of the 5OTi(n,a)47Ca -> 47SC
           process was taken into account.
