FACILITY   (REAC,3PAKNIL) 5 MW swimming pool type Pakistan
           research reactor ( PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity titanium sponge (99.999% pure), weighing
           25-50 mg, was filled in a quartz umpoule, sealed and
           then placed in an NRX type aluminum rradiation capsule.
           Two of each of the three neutron flux nonitor foils
            (Au, Fe and Ni) were placed in a cylindrical
           arrangement around the ampoule in such a way that the
           same neutron flux monitor material was on opposite
           sides of the ampoule, allowing thereby a determination
           of the effective flux density within the ampoule.
           The foils were washed with acetone; dried and weighed
           before attaching to the ampoules.

MONIT-REF  (,A.CALAMAND,R,IAEA-156,273,1974) First four monitor
           reactions.
INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
           activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
           products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) Tracer experiments showed the chemical yield
           of the procedure up to 98 +- 2%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
           the monitor reactions was determined by gamma-ray
           spectrometry using a coaxial 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector in
           conjunction with a 4 K Canberra Series 85 multichannel
           analyzer.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, gamma-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
           statistical and systematic errors. Main sources of
           errors associated in cross-section measurements were
           those associated with determination of fast neutron
           flux densities (8%) and absolute decay rates (5 to 10%)
           Other sources of error were small and were due to
           uncertainties in the number of target nuclei < 1% and
           in radiation and cooling times ( 1%).
DECAY-DATA No information was given about decay data.

REACTION   (22-TI-46(N,2N)22-TI-45,,SIG,,FIS) In the case of this
           reaction, the contribution of the 5OTi(n,a)47Ca -> 47SC
           process was taken into account.
