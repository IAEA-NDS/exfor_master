FACILITY   (REAC,3BZLREC) IEA-R1 reactor
SAMPLE     Samples with mass 20-150 mg different reference
           standard material were used:
             * NIST 1400 Bone Ash;
             * NIST 1486 Bone Meal;
             * NIST 1573A Tomato Leaves;
             * NIST 8414 Bovine Muscle Powder.
           Samples were irradiated for 180s.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal neutron flux of appr. 10**12 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (FLUX) Two appr. 800 mu-g gold foils (1 bare one
           cadmium-covered) were irradiated with each sample,
           to calculate thermal neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Both samples and the gold foils were counted
           in 198 cm3 HPGe detector, and spectra were carefully
           analysed using the IDEfix software.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from of main reference.
