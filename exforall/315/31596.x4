SAMPLE     Two identical tungsten foils (99.9% pure) with a
           size of 50.1mm X50.1mm X 0.138mm (6.644g) to measure
           the Cd ratio at the same time of the irradiation.
           The thickness of the foil was calculated by dividing
           the mass of the foil by the area with a density of
           19.25g/cm3. One foil was sandwiched by two Cadmium
           foils of about 1mm thickness.

INC-SOURCE (THCOL) The thermal neutron flux was previously
           measured at this beam line as about 7-8x10**8
           neutrons/sec/cm2.
