SAMPLE     Three samples (112Sn, natSn and Cu) were placed
           in that order in a stack-like arrangement along the
           deuteron beam axis and were irradiated by the same
           incident neutron flux. These disks (triad) were weighed
           and grouped into three stacks.
           Three enriched samples and two natural sample were used
           in the set of experiments.
           Two 112Sn targets enriched to 62.5% with masses
           72.5 mg and 911.1 mg were cut to disks of diam. 7 mm
           and 10.9 mm and thicknesses 0.3 mm and 0.16 mm,
           respectively. The third enriched sample with 84%
           enrichment was also shaped to disk of 5.1 mm diam.,
           0.15 mm thickness and of mass 20.6 mg. The 5.6 g sample
           of natural tin (diameter 22 mm, thickness 2.2 mm) was
           prepared from spectrographically pure tin. The second
           1.88 g sample of natural tin foil 44 mm in diam. and
           0.17 mm thick had purity better than 99%.
           Abundance in the natural sample is: 112Sn - 0.971%;
           114Sn - 0.651%; 115Sn - 0.341%; 116Sn - 14.531%;
           117Sn - 7.687%; 118Sn - 24.230%; 119Sn - 8.594%;
           120Sn - 32.591%; 122Sn - 4.633%; 124Sn - 5.795%.
           Abundance in the enriched sample 1. is:
           112Sn - 62.5%; 114Sn - 2.1%; 115Sn - 0.7%;
           116Sn - 9.6%; 117Sn - 3.4%; 118Sn - 7.9%;
           119Sn - 2.9%; 120Sn-7.6%; 122Sn-1.4%; 124Sn-1.9%
           Abundance in the enriched sample 2. is: 112Sn-84.0%;
           114Sn-13.%; 115Sn-0.75%; 116Sn-2.0%; 117Sn-0.25%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Small, enriched irradiated samples of 112Sn
           were measured on a 72 cm3 Ge(Li) spectrometer.
           The natural tin samples and Cu monitors with higher
           masses and dimensions were measured using another
           spectrometer with large 177 cm3 Ge(Li) detector
           Two different types of neutron detectors have been
           used: 1. a multi sphere Bonner type neutron detector;
           2. a second detector in the form of copper disks. The
           copper monitor foil 44 mm diam. 1 mm thick
            (mass 13.25 g) was 99.9% pure.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error. Uncertainties in the cross
           section values reported in this work are composed of
           uncertainties from various sources entering into well
           known activation formula. The dominant sources are:
           (ERR-1) gamma-ray detector efficiency (5%),
           (ERR-S,1.,18.) photo-peak counting statistics (1 to 18%
           (MONIT-ERR)  neutron flux determination (standard cross
                section of the 65Cu(n,2n)64Cu for the neutron flux
                monitor with error (3%),
                error of the half-lives (1 to 18%),
           (ERR-2,1.,14.) the gamma-ray branching ratios (1 to 14%
           (ERR-3,1.,33.) cascade (coincidence) summing (1 to 33%)
                for close geometry (source-to-detector distance
                0.3 cm)
           (ERR-4) self-absorption of gamma-rays in the sample (1%
           Other uncertainties, such as sample weight, isotopic
           abundance, irradiation, cooling and measuring time
           were of the order of 0.1 % each.
           Wherever it was possible, the authors used a few gamma
           lines for the activity (cross section) determination.
           In such a case the final value was calculated by
           weighting the values of cross sections with their
           errors. Of course the result was dominated by the value
           of the cross section with the smallest uncertainty.
