FACILITY   (REAC) Dalat nuclear research reactor. The structures
           of the filter for 55 keV neutron beam are
           98cmSi+35g/cm2S+0.2g/cm2B10, and those for 144 keV
           neutron beam are 98cmSi+1cmTi+0.2g/cm2B10.

METHOD     (ACTIV,FNB)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activities of samples and gold foils were
           measured with the high resolution and efficiency
           calibrated HPGe detector, and the samples were placed
           on the surface of the detector because of their
           weak activities.
MONITOR    ((MONIT1)79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The results,
           obtained relative to the standard cross section values
           of 197Au(n,g)198Au

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The experimental uncertainties of the current
           measurements are 5 to 10%, which are mainly due to:
            * the statistical errors (0.1 - 10%),
            * the uncertainties of gamma-ray detection
              efficiency (2.0%)
            * the reference cross section value (3.0%).

SAMPLE     The samples in disk form of Ag were made of naturally
           high pure metallic foils with 2.54 cm and 0.05 mm in
           diameter and thickness, respectively, and the gold
           foils, 2.54 cm in diameter and 0.01 mm in thickness,
           were used as the neutron flux monitors. Each sample
           was sandwiched between two gold foils; the sample
           groups were wrapped in Cd covers of 0.5 mm in
           thickness to reject most of thermal neutron background.
           The duration of irradiations for each energy region
           were about 24 hours for W .
