TITLE      Use of the absolute parametric method to evaluate
           the analytic significance of threshold reactions
           on P, Si, Al and Mg by NAA
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutrons from RA-6 materials test reactor
           at Centre Atomico Barilochi with thermal neutron flux
           about 6.0E+12 neutrons/cm**2/sec, epithermal neutron
           flux about 3.0E+11 neutrons/cm**2/sec and fast neutron
           flux about 2.0E+12 neutrons/cm**2/sec
INC-SPECT  Undisturbed U-235 fission spectrum. Set of 8
           activation detectors having thresholds from 2.6 to
           11.6 MeV were used to show that flux of fission
           neutrons is undisturbed
SAMPLE     High purity metallic (Al - 99.9998% purity, Mg, Si -
           spectrographic purity) and pure chemical compounds
           (SiO2, PO4KH2, PO4K2H) dried and kept in a
           dessicator up to a moment of irradiation
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method with registration of
           secondary gamma-ray spectra.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 67 cm*3 ORTEC high-purity germanium intrinsic-N
           coaxial detector with resolution 2 keV at 1.33 MeV.
           The detector absolute efficiency curve was obtained
           with IAEA standard sources (Am-241, Ba-133, Co-60,
           Cs-137, Eu-152) calibrated within 2 per-cent
           uncertainty. Ra-226 source was also used
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58-M+G,,SIG,,FIS)
MONIT-REF  (,J.H.BAARD+,B,BAARD,,1989)
DECAY-MON  (27-CO-58-G,70.82D,DG,810.772,.9944) From MONIT-REF.
           Gamma self-attenuation factor for 811.79 keV line in
           nickel foil and wire was calculated as 0.992
           and 0.981, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS The statistical component of the uncertainty was
           obtained as weighed averaged for few measurements and
           is given separately. The total uncertainty includes
           2.8% as uncertainty of the reference cross section
           value, 2 to 3% - uncertainty in the detector absolute
           efficiency determination and other systematic
           uncertainties
CORRECTION Irradiation of bare and cadmium covered samples in the
           reactor core, and of bare samples in the thermal
           column were used for the investigation of the
           impurities which could respectively interfere, through
           (n,gamma) or threshold reactions, the measurement
           of the cross sections
STATUS     Data from main reference.
