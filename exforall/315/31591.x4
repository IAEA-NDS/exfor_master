SAMPLE     Eight analytical-quality samples of arsenic oxides
            (As2O3 and As2O5) were individually irradiated under
            1 mm thickness cadmium covers in polyethylene vials,
            together with high purity aluminum wires, for 20 sec.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,P)12-MG-27,,SIG,,AV)
           The 27Mg activity of the aluminum wire monitor was
            counted immediately after, at the same geometry.

SAMPLE     Nine analytical-quality samples of As2O3 (As2O5 was
            excluded because of its instability during
            irradiations) were individually sealed in
            polyethylene vials with a final disk shape of about
            1 cm in diam.  and less than 1 mm thickness.
           The samples and high purity nickel wire monitors were
            irradiated together in an aluminum can, for 4 hours.
