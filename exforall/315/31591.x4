SAMPLE     Eight analytical-quality samples of arsenic oxides
           (As2O3 and As2O5) were individually irradiated under
           1 mm thickness cadmium covers in  polyethylene vials,
           together with high purity aluminum wires, for
           20 seconds.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(N,P)12-MG-27,,SIG,,AV)
           The 27Mg activity of the aluminum wire monitor was
           counted immediately after, at the same geometry.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main contributions to the systematic
           uncertainty of the measured cross section were:
            * 5.1% for the reference cross section value,
            * 2 to 3% for the detector efficiency,
            * 2% for gamma-ray yields,
            * about 1 to 2% to other contributions (half-lives,
           decay,  irradiation, and counting times).

SAMPLE     Nine analytical-quality samples of As2O3 (As2O5 was
           excluded because of its instability during
           irradiations) were individually sealed in polyethylene
           vials with a final disk shape of  about 1 cm in diam.
           and less than 1 mm thickness. The samples and high
           purity nickel wire monitors were irradiated together
           in an aluminum can, for 4 hours.
