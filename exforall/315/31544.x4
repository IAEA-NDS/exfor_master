TITLE      Investigation of the outgoing tritons angular
           distribution in the 9Be(n,t1g)7Li* Reaction at
           14.9 MeV by the line shape analysis of the
           0.4776-MeV gamma transition

INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons incident on the sample were
           produced from the T(d,n)4He reaction at Ed=300 keV.
SAMPLE     The sample was a pure metallic beryllium. The size of
           the sample was 3.0 cm in diameter and 3.0 cm in height,
           and its weight and chemical purity were 39.21g and
           99%, respectively.
DETECTOR   (GELI)The Ge(Li) detector was sensitive volume 110 cm3
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in the Legendre coeff.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from p.241 of the ref.
