FACILITY   (REAC) Pakistan Research reactor-1 at PINSTECH.
           The reactor core contains 20% LEU fuel.
SAMPLE     The targets of the terbium were prepared from spectro-
           graphically pure powder Tb4O7 from Merck. A small
           quantity of terbium powder (2-6 mg) was spread onto
           a Whatman-1 filter paper,covering a relatively large
           circular foils of about 8-10 mm in diam. Four samples
           were prepared for bare irradiation and another four
           for irradiation under a cadmium cover. The weighing of
           the target materials was carefully carried out using a
           Sartorius semimicro electrical balance.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma ray spectrometry of the irradiated
           samples was carried out using a high-resolution
           ganuna ray detection system. The system employed a
           40% relative efficiency high purity germanium detector
           with energy resolution of 2.0 keV at the 1332.5 keV
           peak of 60Co. The induced activities in the terbium
           samples were determined by measuring the y rays at
           298, 879, and 1177 keV associated with the decay of
           160Tb while counting the samples at source-detector
           distances of 25 and 15 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           The irradiations of the activation detectors of Au, Co,
           Mn, and Zn were carried out to characterize the neutron
           irradiation facility. The targets of Au weighing 1-4 mg
           were prepared from thin gold foils of thickness 30 mu-m
           The cobalt samples (6-10 mg) were made from 10-mil
           cobalt wire.The wires were cut into roughly equal
           pieces of length 2 cm and rolled spirally. The
           manganese samples (2-4 mg) were made from manganese
           metallicpieces. Zinc foils (approx.2 mg) of 8 mm diam.
           were used. For the determination of the alpha deviation
           parameter, these activation detectors were packaged
           together in standard polystyrene irradiation capsules
           of dimension 13.5 mm in diameter and height 11 mm for
           bare irradiation and another set of detectors was
           packaged into a cadmium box of dimension 14 mm diam.,
           height 6 mm, and thickness 1 mm. Each of the activation
           detectors was also encapsulated individually within
           polystyrene and cadmium covers for the determination
           of thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes and cadmium
           ratios.
CORRECTION Thermal and epithermal correction factors were used
           in the determination of the thermal neutron capture
           cross section (the cross section at 2200 m/sec)
           and resonance integral (epithermal neutrons in the
           1/E region) for the rare-earth nuclide Terbium-159.
           Thermal and epithermal correction factors were
           calculated by using the expression described by
           Zweifel (Nucleonics,18,174,1960) and
           Baumann (AEC Report DP-817, 1963).
           Paramenter alpha, which determines deviation of
           thermalized neutron spectrum from 1/E dependance as:
             alpha - (1/E)**(1+alpha)
           was measured as alpha = -0.1623+-0.0055
