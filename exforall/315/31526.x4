TITLE      Mass Distribution in Fission Spectrum Neutron Induced
           Fission of U-235
COMMENT    By compiler (ML): These measurements were performed
           to test the radiochemical method used for fast fission
           yield mesurements (see EXFOR31525), and are regarded
           only as byproduct of the fast yield experiment.
           However, it can be assumed, that the detector and
           method are the same as for fast yields, although
           no information on METHOD, DETECTOR or ANALYSIS is
           explicitely given in the publication.
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum.
INC-SOURCE No information; compiler assumes: the thermal neutron
           beam of the institute's heavy water reactor.
SAMPLE     No information.
DETECTOR   No information on fission counting or radioactivity
           measurements.
           From EXFOR31525 for beta-measurements:
           (PROPC)-2Pi-gas-flow proportional counter, or
           (SCIN)-2Pi-plastic-scintillator;
           for gamma-measurements:
           (NAICR)-well type NaI(Tl),3x3 inch, anticoincidence
            spectrometer.
METHOD     No information given. From EXFOR31525 for beta-
           measurements:
           (RCHEM) Sample was dissolved in 6-10M HCl, fission
           products extracted with carriers;standard radiochemical
           procedures were used to separate and purify the fission
           product samples for measurement.Chemical yields were
           determined. Purified samples were measured by beta- or
           gamma-counting (generally for 2-4 half lives).
ANALYSIS   No information, see second reference.
CORRECTION No information, see second reference.
ERR-ANALYS Only the overall error is given.
STATUS     Data taken from text on page 970 of 88Mito.
