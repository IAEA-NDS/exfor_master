TITLE      Measurement of cross section for 24Na production from
           magnesium isotopes by 13.5-18.0 MeV neutrons
FACILITY   (VDG,3POLIPJ) 3 MV Van de Graff of 25 micro-Ampere
           deutron beam served as neutron source.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The T-target in the form of titanium tritide was
           about 1.12 mg/cm**2 thick. Two deutron energies were
           applied: 1.8 and 2.0 MeV
INC-SPECT  Monoenergetic neutrons
SAMPLE     Enriched samples of MgO (Mg-25: 96.4+-0.3%,
           Mg-26: 97.1+-0.2%) and 99.99% Al foil were used.
           The weight of magnesium samples was around 70-80 mg
           and of Al foils was around 170 mg.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           Powder samples of MgO were placed in perspex containers
           around which the Al standard-monitor foil was wrapped.
           The weight of magnesium samples and Al foils was chosen
           to achieve approximately equal dead-time and pile-up
           effects, during counting.
           After irradiation and ca. 5h decay the samples were
           counted with NaI(Tl) detector for 2000-4000 s. Since
           the 24Na-lines only were observed, the integral
           counting was performed within the gamma-energy range
           from 0.4-3.0 MeV.
           MgO sample and Al foil were activated simultaneously
           in the same position of the sample holder, were counted
           directly one after another to minimise instrumental
           errors.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.5*7.5 cm Na-I(Tl) detector
ERR-ANALYS - Statistical
           - Systematic
           Most of the systematic errors were eliminated in
           the applied procedure.
