TITLE      Determination of Ge-70(n,p)Ga-70 and
           Ge-74(n,p)Ga-74 reaction cross sections for a fission
           neutron spectrum
FACILITY   (REAC) Pneumatic facility of RA-6 reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
           Fast flux at irradiation position was
           about 8.0E+11 neutrons/cm**2/sec.
SAMPLE     Hyperpure detector-grade Ge slices of about 250 mg.
           Thickness was about 0.15 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation. Absorbers of Pb, Cd, and Cu were
           placed in front of the detector to attenuate low
           energy gammas. Samples were measured at 4.8 cm from
           the detector front end.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           Absolute efficiency was determined to an accuracy
           of 3.5%.

CORRECTION No pile-up or coincidence effects were observed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors include statistical dispersion of 4
           determinations and systematic uncertainties of
           nuclear constants involved.

CORRECTION A radiochemical method was developed to make sure
           that no Gallium was present in the sample which would
           contribute to Ga-70 production through the
           Ga-69(n,gamma) reaction.
