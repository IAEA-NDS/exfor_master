TITLE      Excitation fuctions of some neutron threshold reactions
           on 89Y in the energy range of 7.8 to 14.7 MeV

SAMPLE     High-purity Y2O3 powder (4.0g, 99.999%) was pressed at
           10 tonne/cm2 into pellets of 2.0 cm diam. and 0.43 cm
           thickness. The disks obtained were packed in thin
           Al-capsules to ensure mechanical stability. Aluminium
           and iron monitor foils (Al 1.00 mm and Fe 0.50 mm
           thick) of the same size as a sample were attached in
           front and at the back of each capsule.

MONITOR   1(13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) used below 10 MeV, a
           weighting was done in the average flux density
           determination in favour of the reaction:
          2(26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG) At higher neutron energies
           the authors took an average of the mean neutron flux
           densities via the two monitor reactions (only in the
           case of D-D inc.source)

DETECTOR   (GELI)
           (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The deviations include energy error as well
           as the energy spreads on the neutrons due to the
           angle emission
           (ERR-T) Total error, mainly from the efficiency of the
           detector (5-10%), decay curve analysis (10-16%),
           correction for activity induced by background
           neutrons (gas out/gas in, breakup) (1-20%), error in
           the excitation functions of monitor reactions (3-8%)
