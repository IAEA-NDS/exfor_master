FACILITY   (REAC,3PAKNIL) 10 MW swimming pool type Pakistan
           research reactor ( PARR-I) at Pinstech.
SAMPLE     High purity cadmium oxide  (99.999% pure), weighing
           25-50 mg, was placed in a quartz ampoule, sealed and
           then placed in an NRX type aluminum irradiation capsule
           Two of each of the threer neutron flux monitor foils
            (Au, Fe, and Ni),were placed in a cylindrical
           arrangement around the ampoule in such a way that the
           same neutron flux monitor material was on opposite
           sides of the ampoule, allowing thereby a determination
           of the effective flux density within the ampoule.
           The foils were washed with acetone; dried and weighed
           before attaching to the ampoules.

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cross sections were measured by neutron
           activation of the target nuclei and the radioactive
           products were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry.
           (CHSEP) A new radiochemical separation was proposed.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity of the reaction products and
           the monitor reactions was determined by gamma-ray
           spectrometry using a coaxial 270 cm3 HPGe detector in
           conjunction with a 4 K Canberra Series 85 multichannel
           analyzer.
PART-DET   (DG)
CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, gamma-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The reported uncertainties incorporate both
           statistical and systematic errors. Main sources of
           errors associated in cross-section measurements were
           those associated with determination of fast neutron
           flux densities (8%) and absolute decay rates (5 to 10%)
           Other sources of error were small and were due to
           uncertainties in the number of target nuclei < 1% and
           in radiation and cooling times ( 1%).
