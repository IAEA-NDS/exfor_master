TITLE       Activation Cross Sections for Reactions Induced by
            14.7-MeV Neutrons on Natural Calcium and Enriched
            44Ca Targets

INC-SOURCE (D-T) The 14.7-MeV neutrons were produced in the
           3H(d,n)4He reaction by bombarding thick
           tritium-titanium targets with a deuteron beam from a
           small Cockroft-Walton accelerator of 100 kV
SAMPLE     The samples used were prepared by pressing 44CaCO3
           and CaCO3 powders into disk-shaped polyethylene
           containers.
           The copper monitor foil (44-mm diam., 1-mm thick.,
           13.25-g mass) was 99.9% pure.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV) All three samples (44CaCO3, natCaCO3,
           and Cu) were placed one behind another in a stacklike
           arrangement and were irradiated by the same
           incident flux.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectra were registered with a
           high-purity germanium detector (Canberra GC 1520,
           72-cm3 volume, 1.8-keV energy resolution for
           1332 keV).
           The gamma-specttra from natural CaCo3 sample and copper
           monitoring foil were taken with a 177-cm3 HPGe detector
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties in the cross-section values
           are composed of uncertainties from various sources
           entering into the well-known activation formula.
           The dominant sources were:
            * gamma-ray detector efficiency (1.5 to 5%),
            * photopeak counting statistics (1.7 to 8%),
            * neutron flux (3%),
            * self-absorption of gamma rays in the sample (0.5%).
           Other uncertainties, such as sample weight, isotopic
           abundance, irradiation time, cooling time, and
           measuring time were of the order of 0.1% each.
