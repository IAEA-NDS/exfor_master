FACILITY   (VDGT,3KORKRM) KIGAM 1.7 MV tandem accelerator with
           the source of negative ion by cesium sputtering (SNICS)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (P-T) The Ti-3H thin film target of this experiment
           was provided by a company (SODERN) in France. The
           substrate of this target was Cu with a thickness of
           1.2 mm. The first layer was Ti with an areal density
           between 200 mu-g/cm2 (2.5.10**18 atoms/cm2) and 300
           mu-g/cm2 (3.8.10**18 atoms/cm2). Ti was impregnated
           with tritium of 4.6.10**18 atoms/cm2.
           The control of the beam energy and the stability for
           terminal voltage was performed by the resonance of
           991+-1 keV in 27Al(p,gamma) and that of 3047+-1 keV
           in 16O(alpha,alpha).
SAMPLE     The shape of Fe sample with a purity of 98% was a
           disk with a diameter of 5 cm and a thickness of 0.3 cm.
METHOD     (PHD,PSD,GSPEC)
           (FLUX) The flux in the beam direction was
           determined to be 3.76x10**7 n/s/sr. The neutron flux
           was  measured by fast neutron activation using Au
           sample, with purity of 99.99%, a metal disk with a
           diameter of 5 cm and a thickness of 0.3 cm.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The pulse-height spectrum and the pulse-shape
           spectrum of the produced neutron were measured by
           2"x2" BC-501 liquid scintillation detector.
           Other BC-501 liquid scintillation detector is used as
           a neutron monitor.
           (HPGE) A 2"x2" HP Ge detector was used as a detector
           of gamma-rays.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) statistical errors of gamma-counts from samples
           and neutron-counts of BC-501 detectors
           and also systematic errors in the counting efficiency
           for HP Ge detector and the uncertainty of areal
           density of samples were considered in calculating
           neutron capture cross section and neutron total cross
            section.
