TITLE      Mass Distribution in Fission Spectrum Neutron Induced
           Fission of U-235
INC-SPECT  U-235 fission spectrum neutrons; the sample was
           surrounded by thick layers of 1.0 cm boron carbide and
           0.1 cm cadmium to shield it from slow neutrons.
INC-SOURCE Uranium plate enriched in U-235, put in the thermal
           neutron beam of the institute's heavy water reactor.
           Irradiations were made in a concrete and paraffin
           shielded room of dimensions 3.5m x 3.0m x 2.2m.
SAMPLE     Uranium metal disk, 1.6 cm diameter, 0.02 cm thick;
           weight of samples ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 g;
           isotopic composition: 1.1% U-234, 90.2% U-235,
                                 0.3% U-236, 8.4% U-238
DETECTOR   (FISCH)-double fission chamber
METHOD     (FISCT)-absolute fission counting:
           a sandwich of standard-sample-standard was placed in
           the fission chamber, where the fission rates of the
           standards were counted directly; standard: uranium
           electrodeposited on platinum disk. The fission rate in
           the sample was calculated from the weight ratio sample/
           standard.

CORRECTION No information, see second reference.
ERR-ANALYS Only the overall error is given as the square root of
           the sum of squares of:

               and the errors of:
                  fission rate determination

DECAY-DATA No information, see second reference.
METHOD    1(FPGAM) High-resolution gamma-spectrometry, spectrum
           analysis by computer program. 7 samples were used.
          2(RCHEM) Sample was dissolved in 6-10M HCl, fission
           products extracted with carriers;standard radiochemical
           procedures were used to separate and purify the fission
           product samples for measurement.Chemical yields were
           determined. Purified samples were measured by beta- or
           gamma-counting (generally for 2-4 half lives).
           6 samples were used.
           Comment by compiler: to test the radiochemical method,
           3 thermal fission yields were determined and were found
           to agree well with published yields. They are compiled
           in entry EXFOR31526.
DETECTOR  1(GELI) 130 cm3, resolution: 1.85 keV at 1.33 MeV;
           photopeak efficiency was determine with a set of
           standard sources.
          2For beta-measurements:
           (PROPC)-2Pi-gas-flow proportional counter, or
           (SCIN)-2Pi-plastic-scintillator;
           for gamma-measurements:
           (NAICR)-well type NaI(Tl),3x3 inch, anticoincidence
            spectrometer.
FLAG       (1.) Total chain yield, calculated using an isomer
            ratio from: H.Ihara et al, JAERI-M 9715 (1981) or
            L.E.Glendenin et al, Phys.Rev. C24 (1981) 2600.
COMMENT    By compiler: The values given in the data table are
           practically total chain yields. The element and isomer
           given show the fission product measured.
