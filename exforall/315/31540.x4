METHOD     (TOF,PSD)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 14.2 MeV neutrons were produced by T(d,n)4He
           reaction.
SAMPLE     The samples consisted of highly purified and
           isotopically enriched metal: 90.5% in 6Li and 95.2%
           in 7Li respectively. Both samples were encapsulated in
           0.1 mm thick Al cans. The samples are cylinders 4 cm in
           length and 2 cm in diameter for 6Li and 2.5 cm in
           diameter for 7Li. An identical empty Al can was also
           prepared for sample out background measurements.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) The TOF spectrometer
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) In order to get values of DDX,
           polyethylene scatterer of identical size of the sample
           was used to measure the total counts for the n-p
           scattering peak Nh(25 degr.) at 25 degr. The n-p
           scattering neutron counts Nh(25 degr.) were accurately
           measured with the statistical uncertainty < 2%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error sources of the data mainly come
           from;
             * the counting statistics (about 10%-20% for most of
               energy bins),
             * the background subtraction (about 10%),
             * the efficiency of neutron detector (about 3%)
             * the correction errors of Monte-Carlo calculation,
               which were about 3% for 6,7Li samples and
               1% for polyethylene.
