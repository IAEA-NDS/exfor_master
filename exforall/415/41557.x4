           Xe isotopes absolute yields .
ANALYSIS    Cumulative yield of Xe-138 was used to define absolute
           independent yields of Xe isotopes. Xe-138 fractional
           cumulative yield of 0.70 +- 0.15 was used from known
           systematics of K.F.Flynn+, A.C.Wahl+ :

           Cumulative yields ratio of photo-fission to spontaneous
           fission of Cm-248.
FACILITY   (MICRT,4ZZZDUB) Microtron, electron energy 25 MeV,
           intensity 15 microA, corresponded to Cm-248 excitation
           energy of  12.5 MeV ( defined from U-238 photo-fission
            dependence of J.Caldwell+, see REL-REF ).

           Method for the calculation of bremsstrahlung spectra
           produced by electrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Fission fragments were collected on Al foil of
           20 microm thickness, place at 0.5 mm distance from Cm
           layer during 200 hr for SF, 6 hr for photo-fission.
           After cooling of a week, gamma-spectra were measured
           during several months to define half-lives.
           To identify  fission fragment the data were used from
           the book: Yu.P.Gangrskiy+, Nuclei fission fragments,
           Moscow, Energoizdat,1986.
           (GSPEC) Yields were defined from its gamma-spectra.
ANALYSIS          Gamma-lines areas were used to define fission
           yields.
