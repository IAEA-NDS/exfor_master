           fission of Cm-248.
FACILITY   (MICRT,4ZZZDUB) Microtron, electron energy 25 MeV,
           intensity 15 microA, corresponded to Cm-248 excitation
           energy of  12.5 MeV ( defined from U-238 photo-fission

           Method for the calculation of bremsstrahlung spectra
           produced by electrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Fission fragments were collected on Al foil of
           20 microm thickness, place at 0.5 mm distance from Cm
           layer during 200 hr for SF, 6 hr for photo-fission.
           After cooling of a week, gamma-spectra were measured
           during several months to define half-lives.
           To identify  fission fragment the data were used from
           the book: Yu.P.Gangrskiy+, Nuclei fission fragments,
           Moscow, Energoizdat,1986.
           (GSPEC) Yields were defined from its gamma-spectra.
ANALYSIS          Gamma-lines areas were used to define fission
           yields.
