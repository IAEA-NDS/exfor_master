           improvements.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Two ionization chambers:
           Frisch grid  (GIC) for n,alpha reaction products;
           parallel plate chamber with thin solid U-238 layer as
           neutron flux monitor.
           Detector registers particles in full 4PI solid angle.
FACILITY   (VDG) Accelerator EG-1 .
INC-SOURCE (D-D,P-T) Solid deuterium and tritium targets of
           1 - 2 mg/cm**2 thickness.
METHOD     (PHD)
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Pulses shape analysis.
