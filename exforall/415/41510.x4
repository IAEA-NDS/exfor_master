            tank of 40 l volume, 40 cm length, 40 cm diameter,
            with hole of 110 mm diameter; solution
            of scintillation admixtures and 5.5 liter of trimethyl
            borate B(OCH3)3 and 34.5 l of toluene C6H5CH3
            as scintillation liquid. For TOF spectra measurement
            as (n,gamma)-detector. Registration efficiency 30%,

            background determination.
SAMPLE      Thin metallic disks of 80 mm diameter.
ANALYSIS    Radiative capture reaction group cross-sections were
            defined from TOF spectra using normalization on
            U-238 standard cross-sections.
            Program GRUCON was used for group cross-section
            calculations.
