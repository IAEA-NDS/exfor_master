           (LINAC,4RUSJIA) Beam stop of 200 MeV protons of the
           linear accelerator.
INC-SOURCE      Neutrons produced in the tungsten target (60 mm W)
           are collimated at zero angle at a length of 12 m in
           order to form a beam with a diameter of about 60 mm at
           the reaction CD2 target.
INC-SPECT   Neutrons incident on the deuterium target have a
           continuous energy spectrum, with an endpoint energy
           equal to the proton beam energy. Detection of three
           particles in coincidence makes it possible to
           reconstruct the primary neutron energy in the
           n+d -> p+n+n reaction and obtain data on the reaction
           yield in a wide range of neutron energies, determined
           only by the statistics of the experiment.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) dE-E telescope consisting of two fast
           plastic scintillation detectors. For proton detection.
           The neutron time-of-flight hodoscope consists of
           several (5-6 at the moment) detectors, located at
           different angles with respect to the primary neutron
           direction at a flight distance of 4-5 m from the CD2
           target,on the left from the incident neutron beam axis.
           The time resolution of all detectors was about 0.6 ns.
           The angular resolution was defined by the detector
           cross section size and the time-of-flight distance;
           it was about +-0.5deg.

REACTION   (0-NN-1(N,EL)0-NN-1,,AMP)  Neutron scattering length
METHOD      Experiments have been performed in the final state
           interaction (FSI) geometry. The neutron-neutron FSI
           manifests itself as a peak in the reaction yield
           distribution versus the relative energy of two neutrons
ANALYSIS   Simulation based on the Watson-Migdal approximation.
