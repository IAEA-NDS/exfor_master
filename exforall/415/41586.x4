TITLE       Investigation into the neutron multiplicity of
            spontaneously fissioning short-lived heavy nuclei at

FACILITY   (FRS,4ZZZDUB) VASSILISSA electrostatic separator.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 54 He-3 ( with 10% Ar) counters(30 mm diameter,
           500 mm long) were mounted around the focal-plane
           detector chamber of the VASSILISSA - to detect SF
           neutrons. Efficiency was measured by Cm-248 source to
           be 39 %.
            Neutron detector efficiency was measured before and
           after main measurement in beam, using Cm-248 source,
           and was found to be from 36 to 39%.
           (SISD) Five 16-strip (58mmx58mm) Si detectors set to
            detect FF and alphas. Energy resolution (measured in
           tests) is about 20 keV (focal detector) and about
           150 keV (side detectors, FF and alphas registration).
           Geometry efficiency about 85 % (for alphas)
