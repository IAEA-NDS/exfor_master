TITLE       Study of characteristics of gamma-quanta from
           Cm-248, Cf-252, Cf-254, Fm-256,and Md-259 spontaneous
           fission .
DETECTOR   (GE) Set of eight scintillation detectors on the base
           of bismuth-germanite Bi4Ge3O12 crystals of 36 mm
           diameter, 140mm long. Gamma-quanta were registered in
           energy range of 320 - 5120 keV.
            after FF registration.
           Response function of this set was defined
           experimentally by gamma-sources of Zn-65 (1115 keV),
           Y-88 (898, 1836 keV), Pu-Be ( 4.43 MeV) and also was
           compared with calculated ( 80 keV bin) one using Monte-
           Carlo method.
METHOD     (COINC) Gamma-quanta were registered by 8 Ge
           scintillators during 4 micro sec after FF registration.
ANALYSIS    Amplitude spectra of single gammas for registration
            from 1 to 8 gamma-quanta and common gamma-spectrum
            ( not dependent from number of gamma-quanta) were
            obtained and analyzed.
            Energy spectra were defined from amplitude spectra by
            method of statistical regularization.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,5.,7.) Not specified.
ADD-RES        SF gamma- quanta spectra are on Fig.2 - are not of
            enough good quality for digitizing .
