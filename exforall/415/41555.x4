REACTION   (105-DB-268(0,F),,NU)
SAMPLE      Isotope Db-268 was produced as product of five
            consecutive alpha-decays of super-heavy element
            115-NN-288 - result of fusion evaporation reaction
            Am-243 + Ca-48.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Neutron detector had 72 He-3 counters
           distributed in a polyethylene moderator as three
           concentric rings at different distances from the
           chambers with the counting samples.
           (SOLST) Four identical chambers with two semiconductor
           detectors in each. Chambers were placed inside neutron
           detector.
            The detector array was calibrated Cm-248 and Cf-252
            sources.
            Fission fragments detection efficiency - about 90%.
            Neutron detection average efficiency - about 40%.
METHOD     (FISCT) 15 spontaneous fission events with half-life
            32(with error +11,-7) hour and 25 neutrons were
            detected during the first 174 hours of measurements of
            total time 957 hours.
