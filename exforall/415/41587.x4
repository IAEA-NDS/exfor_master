TITLE      Search and study of low-mass scalar mesons in
           n p -> n p pi+ pi- reaction at neutron beam impulse
           Pn=(5.20+-0.12) GeV/c .
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
INC-SOURCE     Neutron beam was produced by stripping of deuterons
           on 1cm Al target placed inside vacuum chamber.
           Neutrons outgoing at 0 deg angle relative to deuteron
           beam were cleared from charged particles and gammas.
           Set of collimators was used.
           In HBC - neutron beam parameters :
           impulse resolution 2.5 %,
           solid angle 10**-7 sr.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monochromatic neutrons.
SAMPLE     Hydrogen bubble chamber - HBC.
METHOD      Accuracy of track impulse measurement in HBC - 2-3 %,
            accuracy of angle measurement 0.5 deg.
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) 1 m hydrogen bubble chamber placed at about
           130 m from Al target.

REACTION   (1-H-1(N,PIN+PIP+N)1-H-1,,SIG,,MSC)
            Cross-section at mass resonance.
            6000 events were detected for this reaction.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,1-H-1(N,PIN+PIP+N)1-H-1,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   Mass distribution (fig.3 of J,FCY/L,8,(6),928,2011)
           was fitted by sum of 9 Legendre polynomials
            ( non-resonance part) and
           resonance curve in Breit-Wigner form.
            Resonance spin J was determined to be 0.
            (most probable),
            orbital momentum l was determined to be 0.,
            resonance parity P = +1, parity C=+1, parity G=+1,
            isotopic spin I = 0.

            mass resolution ( about 7.8 MeV/c**2 ) as
            SQRT( (width-exp)**2 - (resolution)**2 ) .
           (MISC4) Statistical significance of resonance was
           defined as: (Nres-Nbackgr)/sqrt(Nbackgr) .
