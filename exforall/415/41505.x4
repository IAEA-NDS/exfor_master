FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB) IBR-30 reactor., 10kW, 100Hz, 4microsec.
            Electronic apparatus  of CAMAC standard.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) 3rd neutron beam of IBR-30 reactor.
            Vacuum neutron guide. Al (70 mm) NaF (10 mm),
            B4C (4 mm) resonance filters were permanently fixed on
            neutron beam to remove background from recycled
            neutrons and to determine background components in
            measured TOF spectra.
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux was decreased 100 times at 0.8 eV energy
            of recycled neutrons, 12.8 times -at 4.2 eV, 7.6 times
            - at 10.3 eV at the presence of resonance filters.
            Flux density 100 n/eV/cm**2/sec .
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 16-sections liquid (n,gamma)-detector PARUS.
           Total volume 80 l. Lead shielding.Scintillation liquid-
           solution from 100 g of scintillation additions, 11 l of
           threemethylborate enriched to 94% in B-10 and 69 l of
           tholuol.Total length 80 cm, diameter 40 cm.Throughgoing
           hole of 110mm diameter. Every section is viewed by
           photomultiplier FEU-110. Registration efficiency 30 %,
           geometric efficiency 98 %. Energy resolution was
           estimated about 30 % for 662 keV Cs gamma-quanta.

             counters SNM-12.Efficiency about 0.5% at 4.3 eV.
             Surrounding by polyethylene moderator.
METHOD     (TOF) Distance from neutron source to filter-sample -
            115 m, to sample-radiator - 122 m, to neutron detector
            - 124 m.

            spectrometric channels.

MONIT-REF  (,P.F.Rose+,R,ENDF-102,1988) ENDF/B-6
SAMPLE      Thin metallic disks .
ANALYSIS   Analysis of measured spectra: subtraction of background
           components, compression of spectra in energy groups of
           BNAB constants system,determination of transmission and
           cross-sections with some corrections like for an effect
           of self-shielding.
           Radiative capture cross-sections were extracted from
           TOF spectra by normalization on standard cross-sections
           of U-238.
CORRECTION  For background.
            For resonance self-shielding.
            For zero thickness of sample.
COMMENT    Of author and compiler. There is a misprint in data
           Table 1 of reference : U-235 capture c-s was used as
           monitor and given in Table, not total.
STATUS     (COREL,41510001) Two independent experiments on
            different facility by the same method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are not specified.
