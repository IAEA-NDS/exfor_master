FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB) IBR-30 reactor., 10kW, 100Hz, 4microsec.
            Electronic apparatus  of CAMAC standard.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) 3rd neutron beam of IBR-30 reactor.
            Vacuum neutron guide. Al (70 mm) NaF (10 mm),
            B4C (4 mm) resonance filters were permanently fixed on
            neutron beam to remove background from recycled
            neutrons and to determine background components in
            measured TOF spectra.
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux was decreased 100 times at 0.8 eV energy
            of recycled neutrons, 12.8 times -at 4.2 eV, 7.6 times
            - at 10.3 eV at the presence of resonance filters.
            Flux density 100 n/eV/cm**2/sec .
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 16-sections liquid (n,gamma)-detector PARUS.
           Total volume 80 l. Lead shielding. Scintillation liquid
           - solution from 100 g of scintillation additions, 11 l
           of trimethyl borate enriched to 94% in B-10 and 69 l of
           toluene. Total length 80 cm, diameter 40 cm.
           Throughgoing hole of 110mm diameter. Every section is
           viewed by photomultiplier FEU-110. Registration
           efficiency 30 %, geometric efficiency 98 %. Energy
           resolution was estimated about 30 % for 662 keV Cs
           gamma-quanta.
           (BF3) Neutron detector as battery of three B-10
             counters SNM-12.Efficiency about 0.5% at 4.3 eV.
             Surrounding by polyethylene moderator.
METHOD     (TOF) Distance from neutron source to filter-sample -
            115 m, to sample-radiator - 122 m, to neutron detector
            - 124 m.
           (COINC) Coincidence multiplicities from pulses of 16
            spectrometric channels.
SAMPLE      Thin metallic disks .
ANALYSIS   Analysis of measured spectra: subtraction of background
           components, compression of spectra in energy groups of
           BNAB constants system,determination of transmission and
           cross-sections with some corrections like for an effect
           of self-shielding.
           Radiative capture cross-sections were extracted from
           TOF spectra by normalization on standard cross-sections
           of U-238.
CORRECTION  For background.
            For resonance self-shielding.
            For zero thickness of sample.
COMMENT    .Of author and compiler. There is a misprint in data
           Table 1 of reference : U-235 capture c-s was used as
           monitor and given in Table, not total.
           .Of author.41510 and 41505 -two independent experiments
           on different facility by the same method.
