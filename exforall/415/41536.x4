             Exp. method details.
SAMPLE      252-Cf of 6 mm diameter had 50 microg/cm**2 Al2-O3
           support.
           Cm-248 of 10 mm diameter had Ti support of 1.5 microm
            thickness.
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Two identical detectors on the basis of CsI(Tl)
           of 20 mm diameter, 0.5 mm long (Harshaw Chemical Comp.)
           and FEU-176 (Novosibirsk,Russia) with photocathode
           diameter 44 mm and spectral range of 300-850 nm.
           Positioned at distance of 4 mm on both sides of sample.
           Total geometry efficiency of set-up - about 60 %.
           Both crystals had 2.5 microm Al mylar reflector on the
           front polish surface.
           27 microm thickness Al foils were installed in front of
           the scintillation counters to absorb the natural
           alpha-activity and fission fragments.
            Energy resolution of each detector (E-alpha=8.78 MeV)
            at T1 gate was 2.8 %.
METHOD     (PSD) Pulse shape analysis method .
           (COINC) Simultaneous detection of two LCP had gate
            duration of 2 microsec.

           Simultaneous emission of two LRA particles accompanying
           quaternary fission ( to all fission event of Cf-252).
ANALYSIS    ASSUMED data and geometrical efficiency were used to
            derive probability of simultaneous emission of two
            LRA particle accompanying quaternary fission.

            Data are 5 times smaller than of Kataria's;
            The explanation of discrepancy is found by considering
            the different experimental geometry.
