DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 54 He-3 ( with 10% Ar) counters(30 mm diameter,
           500 mm long) were mounted around the focal-plane
           detector chamber of the VASSILISSA - to detect SF
           neutrons.Efficiency was measured by Cm-248 source to be
            (40+-1.) % .
           (SISD) Five 16-strip (60mmx60mm) Si detectors set to
            detect FF and alphas. Energy resolution (measured in
           tests) is about 25 keV (focal detector) and about
           150 keV(backward detectors,FF and alphas registration).
