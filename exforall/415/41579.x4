EXP-YEAR   (2010) July 2010.
FACILITY   (FRS,4ZZZDUB) VASSILISSA electrostatic separator.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 54 He-3 ( with 10% Ar) counters(30 mm diameter,
           500 mm long) were mounted around the focal-plane
           detector chamber of the VASSILISSA - to detect SF
           neutrons. Efficiency was measure by Cm-248 source to be
            39 %.
           (SISD) Five 16-strip (58mmx58mm) Si detectors set to
            detect FF and alphas. Energy resolution (measured in
           tests) is about 20 keV (focal detector) and about
           150 keV (side detectors, FF and alphas registration).
           Geometry effociency about 85 % (for alphas)
