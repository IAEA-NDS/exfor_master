TITLE      Absolute measurements of NU(Cf-252) by means of
           manganese bath method.
SAMPLE     Samples were prepared by evaporation in vacuum on Pt
           backings of 0.5 mm thickness.
DECAY-DATA (98-CF-252,2.638YR)
METHOD    1(MANGB) Manganese bath (certificated at 1977 ) -
           for neutrons measurement.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) For FF registration.
          1(NAICR) Two drift gamma-gamma counters:
            - NaI(Tl) of 70 x 70 with FEU-82,
            - NaI(Tl) of 150 x 150 with FEU-49b.
PART-DET   (N,FF)
CORRECTION For absorption of fast neutrons in S and O was
           calculated by Monte-Carlo method.

ANALYSIS    Neutron yields were defined by parameters:
           - thermal neutrons absorption cross section by S
            0.523E-28 m882,
           - thermal neutrons absorption cross section by Mn
            13.35E-28 m**2,
           - Mn-56 decay constant 2.5774 1/hr,
           - ratio of thermal neutrons absorption cross section
            of H to that of Mn 0.02486 .
CORRECTION - For absorption of fast neutrons in S and O was
           calculated by Monte-Carlo method to be 1.00414 .
           - For neutron absorption by Mn  1.0132.
           - For neutron self-absorption in Cf source cover
           1.00756, defined by Au foils .
           - For neutron leakage from Mn baht - 1.00243.
ERR-ANALYS   Uncertainties of fission rate measurement:
           (ERR-1) Counting statistics
           (ERR-2) Linear extrapolation of FF energy distribution
                   tail.
           (ERR-3) Cf self-evaporation.
           (ERR-4) Solid angle definition.
             Uncertainties of neutron distributions:
           (ERR-5) Measurement of Mn-56 activity ( statistical).
           (ERR-6) Coefficient F definition.
           (ERR-7) Efficiency of gamma-counter.
           (ERR-8) Neutron leakage.
           (ERR-9) Fast neutrons capture by S and O .
           (ERR-10) Neutron attenuation in source.
           (ERR-11) Mn resonance integral.
           (ERR-12) Mn bath chemical purity.
           (ERR-13) Cf-252 half-life.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty was defined as
           sqrt(S**2 ((1/3)*sum(SYSi))**2), where
           S- average deviation of average measured value,
           SYSi - systematical uncertainties.
