MONITOR     The ratio of capture to fission detection efficiencies
            1.03 % was used to normalize the alpha value.
            Cf-252 measured multiplicity spectrum was used for
            absolute alpha normalization.
METHOD     (TOF)      Multiplicity spectrometry of gamma quanta
                      and neutrons. 26 m flight path.
FACILITY   (LINAC)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  48 sectional detector on the base of Na-I(Tl).
               Scintillation volume is about 180 litres.
           Fission events detection efficiency about 99.8 %,
           capture - 96.8 % .
           Geometric efficiency about 98 % .
           B-10 n-gamma converter (0.27 g/cm**2 thick) was used to
           detect neutrons by 480-keV gamma quantum of B-10.
           Cs-137, Co-60, Cf-252 were used for validation of
           detection efficiency .

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,ABS),,ALF,,RES) ALFA at resonance.
SAMPLE      Sample consists of six identical 29-mm-diameter,
            0.06 g/cm**2 thick disks, placed at 1-cm intervals
            along neutron beam axis.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)     Total Error, includes:
            -statistical error,
            -error of determination of form of fission multiplicyt
             spectra,
            -error due to statistical spread of TOF spectra in
             resonances,
           (ERR-1) error in determining the capture event detectio
             efficiency,
            - error in determining the fission detection
              efficiency < 0.1 %.
