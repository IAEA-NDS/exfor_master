            the system of lead target (length 456 mm, diameter
            84 mm, total mass 28.7 kg) and natural U blanket of
            four sections (each contains 30 U rods enclosed in Al
            shell)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons generated by the spallation reaction.

            37 Pb-nat foils (0.7x0.7x0.03 cm) covered by
            fission-track detectors were irradiated with deutron
            beam in from of lead target to determine shape of
            beam.
            Neutrons produced in lead target were multiplied and
            moderated in U-blanket.
INC-SPECT   Simulated (using the INCL model and real beam) neutron
            flux is on Fig.4 of J,EPJ ,in which the total flux of
            neutrons is 2.86E-2 neutrons/cm2/deuteron.
            Looks like as of exponential shape, value varies
            from about 3.E-2 neutron/deutron/MeV/cm**2 at about
            20 MeV energy to about 8.E-8 neutron/deutron/MeV/cm**2
            at about 980 MeV neutron energy.

            G.L.Morgan+ .
COMMENT     Of compiler.In C0950003 at 0.81 GeV c-s value is
            10.70+-1.2%. Question about the value really used was
            sent to J.Adam 11.12.2009.
CORRECTION  Na-24 rate production was corrected for:
            - beam intensity fluctuations - 0.9865 ,
            - coincidence summing for 1368 keV gamma - 1.017,
              for 2754 keV gamma - 1.053 .
            Residual nuclei production rates were corrected for:
            - self-absorption of gamma-ray in sample.
            - the fluctuation of beam intensity.
            - coicidence summing.
            - non-point geometry of measured sample.
ANALYSIS   Processing of measured data was performed by
           interactive mode of DEIMOS code. Energy calibration,
           background gamma-lines subtraction, single and double
           escape peaks subtracting, efficiency calibration,
           experimental half-lives determination were made by
           system of codes.
ADD-RES    (RRATE) Absolute rates of independent and cumulative
            reactions in different U-nat and Th-232 samples were
            determined as the ratio of number of produced residual
            nuclei per sec, per number of atoms of the sample and
            per number of incident deuterons.
            Measured reaction rates:
            Th-232(n,gamma) - (3.03+-0.10)E-26,
            Th-232(n,f) - (5.89+-0.60)E-27,
            Th-232(n,2n) - (1.60+-0.16)E-27,
            U-nat(n,g) - (2.97+-0.14)E-26,
            U-nat(n,f) - (2.24+-0.10)E-26.
           (COMP) Comparison with reaction rates calculated by
            several theoretical models using ENDF/B-VI and
