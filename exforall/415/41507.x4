FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) 6 MWt power.
INC-SPECT   Reactor spectrum. EN-DUMMY was proposed by compiler
            as thermal.
SAMPLE      U-235 of reactor active zone.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) spectrometer with crystal of 200 mm
             diameter, 200 mm length.
             Protected by distilled water filter of 300 cm
             thickness. Two lead collimators with hole of 2 cm
             diameter and 15 cm length in each.
              Gamma quantas intensity in detector position -
              5E+04 gammas/sec.
           (SCIN) Scintillation detectors system around the
            NaI-spectrometer. Used in anti-coincidence with NAICR.
            Calibration of spectrometer was made by gamma-lines
            (1.33 MeV) of Co-60 source, by 7.72 , 7.64 MeV gamma
             lines from radiative neutron capture on Al and Fe;
             resolution was defined to be 11% and 7.7%,
             respectively .In energy range 30-100 MeV the electron
             beam of synchrotron SIRIUS was used.
             Registration efficiency 95 % in 1-10 MeV gamma energy
             range, and 85% for higher energies.
            Oscilloscope "Tektronix-TDS 2014" was used in
           measurements to exclude superpositions of pulses.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma energy spectrum was measured.
PART-DET   (G) Gammas from the prosess of bremsstrahlung of FF.
DECAY-DATA (27-CO-60,,DG,1170.,,DG,1330.) + sum peak 2.5 MeV
           (28-NI-59,,DG,11380.)
            Cr - 1.78, 1.79 MeV, H - 2.2 MeV, Be - 6.8 MeV,
            Ti - 6.76 MeV, Al - 7.72 MeV, Fe - 7.64 MeV,
            Cr and Ni - 8.8 MeV, 8.9 MeV, Cr - 9.7 MeV, 11.3 MeV,
            The book of V.I.Gumma, A.M.Demidov+ "Neutron radiation
            analysis", Moscow, Energoatomizdat,1984, was used for
            gamma spectra analysis.
ANALYSIS    (AREA) Ratio of pulse area to pulse-height was used.
             Gamma spectrum at energy range 12 - 20 MeV was fitted
            by exponent and two Gaussians of 11.38 and 15.04 MeV.
            Calculated parameters, used in analysis:
            - Solid angle of detector 1.26E-05 steradian,
            - Intensity of fissions 4.8E+15 fissions/sec,
            - Coefficient for gamma absorption in water filter and
            materials of reactor zone - (1.1 - 4.4)E-3,
            - Efficiency of gamma registration by NaI(Tl)-spectro-
            meter - 0.85, assumed not dependent from energy.
