           neutron yields from neutron induced fission of U-236

FACILITY   (VDG) Cascade Generator CG-2.5.
           Pneumatic transfer system on base of 2 electromagnetic
           valves, stainless steel tube of 10 mm diameter, 0.3 mm
           wall thickness. Times of sample transportation from 150
           to 500 msec were defined in test runs.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) T(p,n)He-3 for monoenergetic neutrons of 1.2 MeV.
            Proton energy 1.974 MeV.
           (D-D) D(d,n)He-3 for monoenergetic neutrons from 3.5 to
           5.MeV. Deuterons energy 0.493, 0.888, 1.283, 1.777 MeV.
INC-SPECT  Neutron energy distributions calculated my Monte-Carlo
           method are presented on Fig.5 and Fig.6 of main
           reference. EN-MAX -maximal energy of neutrons generated
           in neutron production reactions.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Periodic radiation in neutron beam of fixed
           energy, moving the sample in neutron detector by
           pneumatic system, and measuring the time-dependence of
           delayed neutron activity.
           Two different types of experiment:
           -measurement of delayed neutron abundances and periods.
           -measurement of total delayed neutron yields.
           Irradiation time intervals 15, 180, 300 sec. Counting
           intervals 424.5 and 724.5 sec.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Two fission chambers with Np-237 or Pu-239
           layers.
           (D4PI) For delayed neutron registration, thirty SNM-11
            boron counters assembly in polyethylene cylinder of
            400 mm diameter and 300 mm length.Counters were placed
            at three circles of 106, 160, 110 mm diameters.
            In the center - hole of 36mm diameter to sample flight
            tube. Boron carbide powder, borated polyethylene,
            cadmium sheets - for detector protection.
            Absolute efficiency of neutron detector was measured:
            1)by activation method based on V-51(p,n)Cr-51reaction
            2) by measurement of average number of prompt neutrons
            from Cf-252 spontaneous fission neutrons with surface
            barrier detector.Energy dependence of relative
            efficiency was determined by Monte-Carlo calculations.
            Energy dependence of absolute efficiency is presented
            on Fig.4 of main reference (about from 8.6 to 7. %).
            (LONGC) Long counter.
SAMPLE      No information.
ANALYSIS    Composite delayed neutron decay curves, value of
            fission rates in Np-237 or Pu-239 flux monitors,
            number of counts registrated by long-counter and
            current integrator were analyzed.6-group approximation
            and iterative least-squares method were used in decay
            curve analysis.
CORRECTION  For fission events masked by alpha-events and other
            low pulse height signals.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty, includes:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties of delayed neutron abundance and
            period values - 1.8 - 2.0 %,
            - Error of the sample under investigation and fission
            chamber positions relative to neutron target,
            - Uncertainties of fission rate calculations,
            - Statistical uncertainty.
