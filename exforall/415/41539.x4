                         VASSILISSA electrostatic separator.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 54 He-3 filled counters were mounted around the
           focal-plane detector chamber of the VASSILISSA,
           in three concentric rings, covered by organic glass
           and boron polyethylene, both of 5 cm in thickness.
            Efficiency of detection of neutron measured using
            chamber with Cm-248 source and Si detector (1 cm**2
            pin-diode), placed in the position of the focal-plane
            semiconductor detector, was 36+-1 %.
ANALYSIS   (REGUL) Average number of prompt neutrons and
           multi-neutron emission probabilities for Fm-246 was
           determined from the multiplicity of detected neutrons
           by the detector efficiency using the statistical
           regularization method.
ADD-RES     Measured HL of Fm-246 = (1.3 +- 0.2) s.
            SF branching ratio for Fm-246 was estimated to be
             (5+-3)%.
COMMENT     Work was performed partially under the financial
           support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research,
