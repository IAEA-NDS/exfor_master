DETECTOR   (IOCH) Double ionization chamber with common cathode -
           Frisch grid chamber was used to detect the events of
           neutron interaction with nuclei of nitrogen;
           parallel plate chamber with thin solid 238U layer was
           used as neutron flux monitor.
           Chambers were filled by 97%Kr + 3%N2 gas mixture.
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI) Accelerator EG-1 .
INC-SOURCE (D-D) d(d,n) reaction on firm titanium target of
           1 mg/cm**2 thickness.
SAMPLE     About 3% of N in IOCH working gas was used as target.
           U-238 target as flux monitor.
