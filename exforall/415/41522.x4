FACILITY   (ACCEL,4ZZZDUB)  Nuclotron Accelerator in Lab.of High
           Energies of Joint Institute for Nuclear Research,Dubna.
            Target-blanket facility 'Energy plus Transmutation'.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons generated by the spallation reaction
           of 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2. GeV protons and lead target
            (84 mm diameter, 480 mm length, 43 kg mass) interact
            with subcritical uranium blanket (300 uranium rods in
            Al shell with 36 mm diameter, 104 mm length and
            1.720 kg mass).
INC-SPECT   Total number of neutrons passing through 1 cm**2 per
            one incident 2 GeV proton was 9.70E-03.
            Effective energies of neutrons are between 500 keV and
            14 MeV for Ep=1.5 GeV.
           Neutron spectra obtained from threshold detectors
           activation data for 2 GeV protons is presented on
           Fig.4 of reference.
SAMPLE      Radioactive samples I-129, Pu-238, Pu-239, Np-237,
           Am-241 and natural iodine I-127.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Transmutation reaction yields (residual nuclei
           production yields) were determined using
           gamma-spectroscopy. Different filters of Pb, Cd and Cu.
DETECTOR   (THRES) Set of threshold detectors (Au-197, Al-27,
           Cu-63, Ni-58, Co-59, Ta-181, In-115,Bi-209) to study
            the neutron field's energy distribution.
           (SOLST) Activation or solid-state nuclear track
           detectors at side , where beam enters.
           (HPGE) High purity germanium detectors for gamma
           measurement: CANBERRA GR1819 of relative intensity
           18.9%, resolution 1.78 kev ( E-gamma 1323 keV);
           ORTEC GMX-23200 of relative intensity 27.7%, resolution
           1.86 kev ( E-gamma 1323 keV); ORTEC GMX-20190-P of
           relative intensity 28.3%, resolution 1.80 keV ( E-gamm
           1323 keV).
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,,SIG) The values of cross
           sections 11.08+-0.20 , 10.51+- 0.17, 9.93+-0.17,
           9.58+-0.17 mb were used for calculation integral number
           of protons with  energies 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 GeV,
           respectively.

ANALYSIS   Processing of measured data was performed by
           interactive mode of Deimos code. Energy calibration,
           background gamma-lines subtracting, single and double
           escape peaks subtracting, efficiency calibration,
           experimental half-lives determination were made by
           system of codes.
