METHOD     (SLODT) 100-ton moderator of ultra-pure (99.99%) lead.
            Slowing down constant 171 keV/microsec**2,
            energy resolution in 1 eV- 1 keV region -28%,
            initial pulse width (FWHM) 0.5-2. microsec.
              Spectrometer LSD-100 (=SVZ-100, =S-100).
            Measured characteristics of spectrometer are close to
            theoretical predictions and Monte-Carlo calculations.
           (ASPEC) To define thickness and mass of sample.
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSJIA)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Proton beam of 209 MeV energy,average current
            1-1.5 microA. Proton target at 70 cm from center of
            moderator.
INC-SPECT   Neutron source intensity > 1.E+13 n/sec, neutron flux
            density about 1.E+9 n/(sec*cm**2) on the surface of
            sample. Flux of time decreasing parameter 1.3 (Fig.4
            of S,ISINN-12,237).
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Two fission chambers.
            -  Distance between electrodes 3mm, total gas pressure
            2.5 atm. Fast amplifiers and time-coders to eliminate
            the background of overlapping pulses driven by
           alpha-particles.
           - Contains four layers of Th-232, Np-237,Cm-245,Pu-239.
            Distance between electrodes 1 mm, total gas pressure
            1.5 atm.
           Both chambers were place in one channel at 90 cm from
           proton target.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) as flux monitor in all runs.
           (94-PU-239(N,F),,SIG) as second flux monitor.
STATUS              Request for data was sent 04.08.2009 to
            A.Trufanov - no reply, he's retired.
           (PRELM) Analysis of data has not finished, data are not
            ready for EXFOR (some authors left their institutes).
