            gamma rays with energy above 20 MeV in spontaneous
            fission of 252-Cf.

METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma spectra were measured in 20-160 MeV
            energy range.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) of 150 mm diameter, 150 mm long.
            Lead collimator between Cf source and crystal of 60 mm
            inner diameter.
            25-cm  borated polyethylene layer to absorb neutrons
            and gamma quanta with energy < 1 MeV.
            Energy calibration by standard gamma-lines 0.661,
           1.17, 1.33, 2.5. 4.4 MeV, last from Be-9(A,N)C-12.
SAMPLE      Cf-252 source of 0.7E+7 fis/sec, placed at 37 cm
            distance from detector surface .

            Units PD/FIS/MEV were used instead of usually used
            PT/FIS/MEV according to N.Otsuka's opinion (NDS IAEA).
