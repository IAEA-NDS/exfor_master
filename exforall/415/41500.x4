REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),DL,NU)
ANALYSIS    Absolute total delayed neutron yields were measured at
            En=1.165 MeV (EXFOR 41291.006).
            Energy dependence of relative total delayed neutrons
            yields was measured in range En= 0.769 - 5. MeV,
            normalized at En=0.769 MeV to value, which was
            obtained by linear interpolation of evaluated data
            values for thermal and fast neutrons from 2nd REL-REF.
