            Regularization method of analysis.
FACILITY   (FRS,4ZZZDUB) VASSILISSA electrostatic separator.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 72 He-3 filled counters were mounted around the
           focal-plane detector chamber of the VASSILISSA,
           in three concentric rings, covered by organic glass
           and boron polyethylene, both of 5 cm in thickness.
           The efficiency of detection of one neutron measured
           using a Cm-248 source, placed in the position of focal
           plane semiconductor detector, was 25%.
COMMENT     Work was performed partially under the financial
           support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research,
           contract No.02-02-16116 and JINR-BMBF (Germany),
           JINR-Polish, JINR-Slovak Cooperation Programs.

REACTION   (102-NO-252(0,F),PR,NU)
            Average number of prompt neutrons.
SAMPLE      Produced in the complete fusion reaction
            Ca-48(Pb-206,2N) -> No-252.
            Produced evaporation (ER) residues were separated in
            flight by the VASSILISSA.
