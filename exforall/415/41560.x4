COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           As mentioned in the article, the isomeric ratio was
           obtained from measured cross-sections ( given in Subent
           004). Using thes cross-sections the isomeric ratio M/T
           is calculated as 74./647. = 0.114374 - this is not
           equal to values given :
           in R,ICD-6,42,1969 - 0.118 ,
           in R,LA-TR-71-74,1971 ( Engl.translation of R,ICD-6) -
           0.113 .
           Also units "barns" are given in both articles for this
           ratio - it's misprint.
