           interval 1-70 keV.

            Detector efficiency calculation.
MONITOR    Neutron beam intensity was measured by calibrated boron
           and helium counters.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight base is 33.2 m .
FACILITY   (REAC) Fast pulse reactor IBR-30 in booster regime
           concurrently with LUE-40 linear electron accelerator.
SAMPLE      Liquid He-3 in container. Target area 30 cm**2,
            thickness 3E+22 nuclei/cm**2 .
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Na-I(Tl) crystal of 10 cm diameter, 10 cm
           thickness, placed at 90 and 45 degrees angles relative
           to beam. Screen of 10 cm paraffin, 4 cm boron carbide,
           1 cm lead was placed between target and detector.
           Detector efficiency was calculated, correctness was
           checked (see REL-REF of R.W.Zurmuhle+) and was
           reconfirmed in calibrated measurements of the known
           partial width of direct transition ( 9.0 MeV ) for
           neutron capture in nickel.
CORRECTION  For attenuation of gamma-rays by the screen.
            For contribution of faster neutrons.

ANALYSIS    Radiative capture cross section was determined as:
            (8/3)*PI*SIG(90deg), which is suitable for the case of
           angular distribution corresponding to the function
            SIN**2 .This dependence was indicated by measured
           relationship of gamma-ray intensities at 90 and 45 deg.
           angles equal to 1.8+-0.20.
