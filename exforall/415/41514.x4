FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSMIF) IRT-MEPhI reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) VEC-25 and VEC-28 channels.
INC-SPECT  Thermal maxwellian neutron flux and cadmium ratio were
           determined experimentally by capture in gold,as a rule.
            For VEC-25 - neutron flux 1.98E13 n/cm**2/sec,
            cadmium ratio 5.06 .
            For VEC-28 - neutron flux 5.75E10 n/cm**2/sec,
            cadmium ratio 13.5 .
            Error of neutron flux about 4 % .
SAMPLE      Am-241 of high enrichment. Relative content of Am-242m
            and Am-243 atoms in samples < 3.E-6. Electrodeposition
            from alcoholic solution was used for fission samples,
            spot diameter 6.0+-0.1 mm .
            For radiative capture - several ampules of quartz
            glass containing purified nitrate of Am-241.
            Am-241 content in layers from 12.9 to 16.8 microg,
            in ampoules - from 32.3 to 35.5 microg .
            U-235 or Pu-239 certified layers - for additional
            control and normalization.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial semiconductor detector of extra-purity
            germanium - for flux measurements.
           (TRD) Dielectric track detectors - plates of silicate
           glass of 6.00+-0.02 mm diameter at 6.00+-0.02 mm
           distance from surface layer. Probability of one of
           fission fragments hit to the area of detector sensitive
           surface - (9.37+-0.10)% .
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Three layers of Am-241 (3.60, 4.05, 3.19 10**6
           nuclei of Am) in aluminum chambers were irradiated in
           VEC-25 within 30min, 1.0hour, 1.5hour, respectively .
           Immediately after irradiation dielectric track
           detectors were established in chambers,and measurements
           were continued in VEC-28.
           Irradiation with and without cadmium.
           (ASPEC) Alpha-particle spectra were registered by
           semiconductor alpha-spectrometer with 30keV resolution.
            Two ampoules with Am-241 nitrate were irradiated in
            VEC-25 within 69.6 hour (neutron fluence
            (0.495+-0.021)*10**19 n/cm**2) .
DECAY-DATA (96-CM-242,,A,6113.,,A,6069.) by B-decay of Am-242g.
           (95-AM-241,,A,5485.,,A,5443.)
            Relative yield of Cm-242 alpha-particles to yield of
            Am-241 alpha-particles was measured.

REL-REF    (D,,G.Fioni+,J,NP/A,693,546,2001)
CRITIQUE   Of authors. Data of Am-241(n,g)Am-242 c-s of this
           experiment are higher then Fioni+ data (696.+-48.)mb
           and ENDF/B-VII data 620.8 mb. Most probably, this
           difference is conditioned by the fact that the neutrons
           in IRT MEPhI reactor channels are thermalized
           insufficiently.

METHOD      Dielectric track detectors underwent etching with
            hydrofluoric acid.Counts of tracks caused by fission
            fragments were implemented visually by optical
            microscope.
ANALYSIS    In irradiated layer the nuclei of Am-241, Am-242m,
            Am-242g are contained and the accumulation of Cm-242
            nuclei takes place.Am-242m fission of Am-241
            sub-barrier fission contribute too large to yield of
            fission fragments. Statistical analysis of data made
            possible to get upper value.
