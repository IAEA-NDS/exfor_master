TITLE       Study of the resonance structure of neutron
           cross-section of Zr, Ta, Re, in the energy region
           0.005 - 100 keV.

FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)   Fast pulse reactor IBR-30
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight, flight base is 501m, 121m, 1006m.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 16-sections scintillation detector with NaI(Tl)
           crystals (122*122*152 cm**3) of total volume 36 liter.
           (SCIN)  16-sections liquid scintillation detector of
           total volume 80 liter.
            Registration efficiency of n,gamma detector about 30%,
           energy resolution about 30% for 662 keV gamma-quanta.
           (BF3)  Batteries of B-10 and
           (HE3SP)                      He-3 counters.
SAMPLE     Metal discs of natural Zr, Ta, Re as sample-filter.
           Radiator-samples - metal plates :
           Zr - 0.00435 at/b, Ta - 0.00116 at/b, Re - 0.00976at/b,
           U-238 - o.000437 at/b and 0.00121 at/b.
ANALYSIS   Total transmission and partial capture cross-sections
           were determined from measured TOF spectra of various
           coincidence multiplicities of gamma-quanta after
           background subtraction.
           Doppler coefficients were determined by measurement
           of Ta (0.0138 at/b) total transmission at nitrogen
           temperature.
CORRECTION For resonance-self-shielding using ENDF/B-6.7 data.
COMMENT    Of authors. Exp. group total c-s for Ta and Re differ
           10-70 % in most of energy groups from calculated
             (by ENDF/B-6.7, BROND) values.
           Exp. and calculated capture c-s for Re coincide,
           for Zr and Ta - different within the limits of exp.
           errors.
           Of compiler. Figures of S,ISINN-12,59,2004 are not
           good for digitizing, are given in LIN-LIN scale,
           of little size.
