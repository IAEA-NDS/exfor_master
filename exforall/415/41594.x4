TITLE      Neutron resonances of nucleus Ce-141 (T1/2=32.5days).
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSNIR) SM-2 reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)  Fluence 3.2E+21 n/cm**2 .
SAMPLE      Plate 1.3 x 8 x 27 mm**3 was irradiated in SM-2
           reactor by fluence 3.2E+21 n/cm**2; initial content:
           Ce-140 96.4%, Ce-142 4.6%, main admixture - natural Sm.
           Additional sample of about 5.E-2 mg Ce-140 was
           irradiated together with main sample and was used to
           analyze Ce-141 content in irradiated samples by gamma
           spectrometry (145 keV gamma line).
DECAY-DATA (58-CE-141,32.5D,DG,145.)
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Neutron spectrometer.
METHOD     (TOF,TRN) 92 m TOF base. Best resolution 58 ns/m .
           Background was less 2.% .
           Transmission was measured by initial sample and
           then by irradiated sample.
ADD-RES     Measured energy dependence of Ce-141 total c-s is
           mentioned, but not presented in the article.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,58-CE-141(N,G),,WID)
ADD-RES    Neutron resonances at 11.1, 64.8 and 131.7 eV were also
           observed; they could be probably weak levels of Ce-140.
           Resonances 64.8 and 131.7 eV could be levels of Ce-136,
           but Ce-136 is not given in certificate of sample.

METHOD     (ACTIV) Samples were irradiated in SM-2 reactor channel
           together with Co sample (about 0.5 microg Co-59) which
           was used for neutron beam monitoring.
