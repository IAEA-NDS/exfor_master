             Monte Carlo model calculations.
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSLIN) Radial channel #7 of the research
           reactor WWR-M  equipped with a neutron guide of 3m
           length.
METHOD     (TOF) Multidimensional measurements involving a
           determination of the times of flight of a neutron and
           two fragments along with the angle between the velocity
           vectors of neutron and light fragment.
           (PSD) Double discrimination by the pulse shape and
           time-of-flight was used to separate the events produced
           by neutrons and gammas.
           (COINC) Each of stop MWPDs .
            10 weekly cycles of measurement were performed.
DETECTOR   (MWPC)  One MWPD as start detector, located within
            7mm range from target parallel to target plane.
            Eight pairs of multiwire proportional fission-fragment
            detectors, operating voltage 400-500 V, placed in two
            arching formations diametrically opposed each other in
            the reaction chamber at distance of 140mm from the
            chamber axis.
           (SCIN) Two scintillation detectors for neutron
            registration - stilbene crystals of 50 mm diameter,
            50mm high and 60 mm diameter, 40mm high mounted on
            Hamamatsu-R6091 phototubes, positioned with 90 deg
            angle between their respective axis at distance about
            50 cm from target. Cylindrical shield made of 30 mm
            thick layer of lead and 40mm thick layer of
            polyethylene. Neutron registration threshold
            150-200 keV. Position of neutron detectors was fixed.
            Total counting rate was about 100 events/min for both
            neutron detectors. 2E+06 events were accumulated.
SAMPLE      U-235 target, enriched to 99.99% purity, consisted of
            280 microg/cm**2 thick U-235 layer sprayed as UF4 on
            self-supporting 70 microg/cm**2 thick Ti backing
            making a circular spot of 15 mm diameter.
CORRECTIONS -For time uncertainties in the time-of-flight
            measurements. Applied to the raw spectrum. As result,
            the FWHM of the fragment-gamma-quantum coincidence
            curve decreased from 2.5 to 1.2 ns.
            -For neutron detector background, including
            gamma-quanta background, background component related
            to neutron scattering and insufficient neutron-gamma
            separation in low energy.
            -For the fragment detector efficiency, including
            correction for efficiency differences of MWPDs,
            correction for difference in registration efficiency
            for light and heavy fragments by start detector (<=2%)
            -For complementary fragment contribution.
            -For angular resolution.
            -For neutron detector efficiency
            -Correction for the limited transparency of the start
            detector is minimal and can be neglected.
            -Correction related to variation of angular
            distribution of fission fragments due to transmission
            through the target backing and due to the neutron
            emission is negligible.
ANALYSIS    Neutron spectra were normalized to the average fission
            neutron multiplicity value 2.43 =ASSUM1.
            Data of each weekly cycle were processed separately.
            The weighted averaging of 10 cycles was done for
            two neutron detectors.
            Results obtained independently for two neutron
            detectors were averaged and combined to produce
            final energy and angular distribution.
            For calculations - ASSUM2, ASSUM3 values were
            used to obtain neutron energy spectra for light and
            heavy fragments in center-of-mass system, which were
            used to obtain neutron energy and angular
            distributions in laboratory system.
STATUS     (PRELM)   Data are preliminary.

COMMENT    Of author A.Vorobyev.
            Data of Fig.6 left, right of S,ISINN-17,60,2010
            marked as "experimental" are not from this experiment.
ADD-RES     The yield of 'scission' neutrons has been estimated in
            the framework of a simple evaporation model and was
            found to be less 5% of the total neutron yield.
            The specific energy per nucleon for light and heavy
            fragments, obtained in this experiment,  was
            EL=1.025 MeV and EH=0.476 MeV,respectively,.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total errors, including statistical -
            mean-squares-average deviation from weighted average
            values.   Analysis of errors is not finished yet.

            Ratio of prompt neutron spectra.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The incident neutron energy 0.0363 eV.
INC-SPECT   Flux density about 2E+07 1/cm**2/s at neutron guide
            outlet slit (2x40 mm**2). Collimated neutron beam
            passed through a 100 micron thick Al-window in
            cylindrical reaction chamber, filled with isobutane at
            4-6 Torr pressure, striking a target at small angle
            of incidence.
EN-SEC     (E,N) Prompt neutron energy.
METHOD     (TOF) Cf and U time-of-flight spectra were obtained in
           separate measurement but in the same experimental
           conditions, excluding the beam condition.
ANALYSIS   Total prompt neutron spectra of Cf-252 and U-235 were
           obtained independently for two neutron detectors as
           weighted averages of 4 measurement cycles. Final result
           is a weighted average of two ratios obtained by
           individual detectors.

CORRECTION For:
           - time uncertainties in TOF measurements ;
           - neutron detector background:
           a double discrimination method - time-of-flight and
           pulse shape;
           time dependent background related with coincidence
           between neutron and fission fragment which belong to a
           different fission event. It was calculated analogous to
           REL-REF of W.P.Poenitz+ and then it was subtracted;
           the remaining part of background is the sum of
           independent background, which results from random
           coincidence, and background component, which increases
           roughly linearly with time -the value of this component
           was estimated from a count number at the discrimination
           cut-off (En about 0.2 MeV). Separate experiments with a
           shadow cone have been performed recently to determine
           value and shape of the remaining part of background.
           - fission fragment detection efficiencies .
           - Ratio was corrected for finite energy and angular
           resolution.
           - Also the normalization correction connected to the
           fact that in the measurement the experimental histogram
           distributions instead of continuous distribution is
           observed.
