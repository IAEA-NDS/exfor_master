TITLE      Measurement of the 18Ne(a,p)21Na reaction with the
           ANASEN active-target detector system at
           Ec.m.=2.5-4 MeV

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAFSU) Experiment performed at John D. Fox
           Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory of Florida
           State University using RESOLUT radioactive beam
           facility
SAMPLE     Active target detector Array for Nuclear Astrophysics
           and Structure with Exotic Nuclei (ANASEN) was filled
           with 4He as the target gas including a 4% admixture
           of CO2 as a quenching gas, at a pressure of 379 Torr.
           The beam particles entered the gas volume through an
           8.9 mu-m Kapton window, in which they lost 9 MeV of
           energy, and proceeded through the target gas to a
           range of 59 cm after the window
DETECTOR   (MWPC) The ANASEN detector systems were arranged in
           concentric layers surrounding the beam axis,
           starting from an inner set of 24 position-sensitive
           proportional-counter anodes at radius of 3.75 cm.
           (SISD) Detector ended with a layer of 24 position-
           sensitive silicon-strip detectors of the Micron
           Semiconductor Super-X3 design at a radius of 8.9 cm.
           (SISD) Four silicon-strip detectors of the Micron
           Semiconductor QQQ3 design covered forward laboratory
           angles in an annular geometry
           (IOCH) A high-rate, compact ion chamber, sensitive to
           heavy ions traveling within 2.2 cm of the beam axis,
           including both beam particles and reaction residues.
           The ion chamber drift field was created between a
           negatively biased (-200 V) tungsten-wire cathode on
           the beam axis and 48 anode wires surrounding it at
           radius of 2.2 cm.
INC-SOURCE The 18Ne beam was produced via the 16-O(3He,n)18Ne
           reaction and selected at 80 MeV and at an average beam
           intensity of 2E+3 pps.
