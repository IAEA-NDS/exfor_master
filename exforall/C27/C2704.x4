FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at coupled
           cyclotron facility of the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory using the re-accelerator ReA3
           facility
SAMPLE     Heavy-ion beam impinged on a solid target made out of
           high-density polyethylene (C2H4)n. Target's effective
           thickness was (3.95+-0.4) mu-m and the corresponding
           areal density of hydrogen in the target
           was (3.18+-0.32)E+19 atoms/cm2
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons from the (p,n) reactions were
           detected using low energy neutron detector array
           LENDA. In this experiment LENDA consisted of 14
           BC-408 scintillators arranged in two consecutive
           layers downstream of the target, aligned at 35 cm and
           41.5 cm from the target. The angular acceptance of
           LENDA in the laboratory frame was from 5 deg to 52 deg.
           (MAGSP) Heavy reaction products were momentum
           analysed in ReA3 beam line, consisting of
           spectrometer dipole magnet, quadrupole multiplets,
           4-jaw slit system at the focal plane of the
           spectrometer magnet to block the deflected beam ions
           and a piece of standard beam line to the Si detector.
           (SISD) Reaction products were identified at the end
           of ReA3 beamline using double sided Si strip
           detector. The detector has an active area of 40.3 x
           75.0 mm2 and consists of 64 vertical strips on the
           junction side and 4 horizontal strips on the Ohmic
           side. The effective thickness of the detector was
           1000 mu-m
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between SISD detector and LENDA
           array was required. Inverse kinematics was used.
           (TOF,PSD) Neutron energy was determined by time-of-
           flight. Start time was provided by SiSD detector, stop
           signal was provided by LENDA array.
ANALYSIS   Final result was determined as weighted average of
           two runs.
