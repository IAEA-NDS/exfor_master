FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USATNL) The experiment was performed at the
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory using an
           unpolarized beam from the TUNL atomic-beam polarized
           ion source. Beam currents on target of 400-450 mu-A
           were sustained throughout the experiment.
SAMPLE     The (Ta)2(O)5 targets of natural isotopic composition
           were used for background measurement.
           The (Ta)2(O)5 targets were produced by oxidation of
           0.1 mm tantalum (99.99%) sheets in an oxygen atmosphere
           enriched to 77% 17O.
           (8-O-17,ENR=0.77).
DETECTOR   (SI) Six implanted silicon detectors, with active
           areas of 3.1 cm2, and with no metal electrical
           contacts on their front faces, were used to detect
           outgoing alphas.
           The gains of the detectors were calibrated using the
           reactions 10B(p,alpha)7Be and 6Li(p,alpha)3He.
CORRECTION The background was subtracted from the data. The
           background in the spectrum arises from several
           sources: cosmic rays, natural radioactivity, elastic
           protons, and the nuclear reactions 10B(p,alpha)7Be,
           7Li(p,alpha)4He, and 6Li(p,alpha)3He.
