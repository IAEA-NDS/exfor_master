INSTITUTE  (1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 184-inch cyclotron.
SAMPLE     A one-mil polystyrene target.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford D1 nuclear track emulsion.
METHOD     The spalls enter the surface of nuclear track
           emulsion making a small angle with the surface. The
           position, track-angle, range, and estimate charge are
           recorded for each track. The calculated radius of
           curvature plotted against the range provides a
           nuclide spectrum of the tracks, since each nuclide
           falls on a definite locus in such a diagram.
           Resolution of H1, H2, H3, He3, and He4 splinters is
           unambiguous. A group probably comprising Li6 and Be7
           and another group probably of He6 and Li7 are also
           found, but for lack of good range-energy curves for
           highly charged particles the resolution is at present
           uncertain. No Li8, B8, H>3 or He<3 tracks were found.
           Other groups plus background, 6.2 percent of product
           yield.
