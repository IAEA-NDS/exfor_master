TITLE      Cross section for the reaction 20(230,240)10

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAPUR)
INC-SPECT  He3 beam.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
SAMPLE     Deuterium gas. Target was about 0.55 MeV thick.
METHOD     The above cross section values were obtained from
           measurements in a cone of approximately 45 degrees
           about the direction of the beam. Additional
           measurements at right angles to the beam indicate
           that anisotropy exists in the center of mass system.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Probable error. Each quantity involved in
           the calculations was critically examined and an
           estimate of the error in that quantity made. The
           uncertainty of a given quantity is the maximum amount
           or fraction of that quantity by which it is believed
           the measured value could have differed from the true
           value. If the reasonable view were taken that the
           uncertainties connected with sigma independent of
           each other, then their sum should be the square root
           of the sum of their squares. This gives a total
           root-mean-square uncertainty of 11.7% in the value of
           any one measurement of the absolute cross section.
CORRECTION Corrections to the cross section for the effect of
           thick target and inhomogeneity of the beam.
CRITIQUE   Erratum: Experiments on the reaction 20(30,240)n [1-H-
           2(HE3,P)2-HE-4] have shown a mistake in the design
           of the ionization chamber used in the 230 [HE3]
           experiments. Corrections can be made to the results
           already obtained by calculating the fraction of the
           240's [2-HE-4] emitted which reached the detecting
           region with sufficient energy (about 330 keV by
           experiment) to be detected. In other words, the the
           solid angle in which particles were detected was not
           determined entirely by the collimating system but also
           by the variation of the range of the emitted particles
           with angle and bombarding energy. A crude estimate of
           the necessary correction factor to the data reported is
            1.02 for an average energy of 0.9 MeV, increasing to
           1.47 at 0.475 MeV. In making these estimates it was
           assumed that the energy loss in the collection region
           necessary for a particle to be detected was 0.8 MeV
           which has turned out to be too high, in view of some
           recent experiments. No recalculation is being made at
           this time, however, since the entire problem requires
           careful and detailed examination.
