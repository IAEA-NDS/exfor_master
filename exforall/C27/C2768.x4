FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The experiment was performed at the
           Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS)
           facility using a 100Mo beam
SAMPLE     Active target was used. Multi-Sampling Ionization
           Chamber (MUSIC) detector was filled with a gas
           mixture of 95% He and 5% Kr. The purpose of the Kr
           was to increase the stopping power of the gas
           mixture. Two gas pressures were used. First at 498.1
           MeV 100Mo beam and a calibrated gas pressure of 408
           Torr, followed by a setting with a 474.8 MeV 100Mo
           beam and a calibrated gas pressure of 459 Torr.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) MUlti-Sampling Ionization Chamber (MUSIC) was
           used to detect reaction products and beam
           particles.The segmented anode allows to measure
           position and energy loss of particles along their
           track, which allow discrimination between beam
           particles and reaction products.
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used.

           section subtracting interpolated (a,1n) cross section
           in the literature.
