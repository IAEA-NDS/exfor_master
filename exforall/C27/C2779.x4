DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detection system consisted of two 7.5 cm
           diameter by 7.5 cm thick NaI crystals mounted
           face-to-face with the target centered between them.
           The decay of 18F was detected by counting 511 keV
           annihilation gamma-rays in coincidence. The
           separation between the detector faces was 5.7 cm.
           Except for the solid angle subtended by the crystals,
           the volume between the two faces was filled in with
           lead. The efficiency of the system was measured
           using a calibrated 22Na source and found to be
            (3.13+/-0.15)%.
SAMPLE     Thick disks, 1.25 cm in diameter and 0.4 cm thick, of
           sintered TiN were used as targets. The targets were
           air-cooled.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
CORRECTION Corrected for the 3% electron-capture branch of the
           18F decay, for the detection efficiency, for the 18F
           decay during bombardment and during transfer to the
           detection assembly and for background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainty.

COMMENT    The authors suppose that for EN-RES=1.140 MeV spin may
           be also equal 2,3,4 with parity +.
