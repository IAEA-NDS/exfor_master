FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University using the ReAccelerator
           facility.
SAMPLE     A small gas-cell target filled with hydrogen gas. The
           gas cell has a 2 mu-m thick molybdenum foil used for
           the front and back cell window and is approximately 4
           cm in length. It was filled with 600 Torr of
           hydrogen gas for the experiment and the beam loss was
           approximately 0.19-0.22 MeV/u, depending on the
           initial beam energy
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma rays were detected with the summing
           NaI(Tl) (SuN) detector. SuN is a cylindrical detector
           of optically isolated NaI crystals 16 inches in
           length and diameter with a 1.77 inch borehole in the
           center resulting in nearly 4pi angular coverage. The
           gas-cell target filled with hydrogen gas was placed
           in the center of SuN.
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used
