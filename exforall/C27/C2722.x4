SAMPLE     Targets of 250 and 375 mu-g/cm2 manufactured by
           Micromatter Corporation were used. They were in the
           form of CaO on 0.50mm tantalum backings and had an
           uncertainty of +/-20% in thickness.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in cross section values is
           due primarily to target thickness uncertainty and is
           +/-21% for energies below 3.0 MeV, rising to +/-25% at
           the highest energies, due to subtraction of background
           activity.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in cross section is due
           primarily to target thickness uncertainty (+/-20%) and
           only secondarily to corrections for contributions to
           the yield from 43Sc decay resulting from the
           40Ca(alpha,p) reaction (+/-1.3 to +/-2.9%). The overall
           uncertainty is +/-21% at all energies.

SAMPLE     Targets of 44Ca were prepared by mixing 44Ca0 enriched
           to 98.55% 44Ca with thorium, pressing into pellets, and
           evaporating onto 0.50 mm tantalum backings. A
           20 mu-g/cm2 layer of gold was deposited on each target
           to protect it from exposure during handling and to
           better distribute the heat during irradiation. Target
           thickness was measured by the crystal oscillator method
           with an uncertainty of +/-20% and equal 300 mu-g/cm2
           for each from two targets.
