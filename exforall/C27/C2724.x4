FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Detector of Recoils and Gammas of
           Nuclear Reactions was used to perform a direct
           measurement of the 26mAl(p,g) reaction at the ISAC-I
           radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with H2 gas at 6.66 mbar.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Array of 30 bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors
           surrounding the gas target was used to detect gamma
           rays resulting from (p,gamma) reactions
           (MAGSP) 27Si recoils were momentum analyzed by DRAGON
           magnetic and electrostatic dipole systems and
           transmitted to the focal plane of DRAGON.
           (TELES,MCPLT,IOCH)Recoils were identified using a local
           time-of-flight (TOF) system based on two microchannel
           plates and an isobutane-filled ionization chamber.
           (NAICR) Positrons from decay of 26mAl were guided to
           the pair of NaI(Tl) detectors. By comparing the number
           of coincident 511-keV annihilation rays with GEANT4
           simulations of the NaI detector response, an average
           26mAl beam intensity of was determined
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
INC-SOURCE Unstable 26Al was produced by bombarding a thick SiC
           production target with up to 70 mu-A of 500 MeV protons
           from TRIUMF's cyclotron and initially accelerated to
           energies of 150 AkeV using a radio-frequency quadrupole
           accelerator. This beam was then stripped to a higher
           charge state and further accelerated using drift tube
           linac.
