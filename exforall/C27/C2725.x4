METHOD     (CHSEP) The Rf was separated from the actinides using
           liquid-liquid extractions. The organic phase was 0.5 M
           thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TFA) in benzene and the
           aqueous phase was 0.05 M HCl. The collection time for
           each experiment was 3 minutes.
ANALYSIS   The cross section for the 248Cm(180,3n) reaction was
           calculated using a modified SPIT code. The peak of
           the excitation function is at 92.5 MeV with a cross
           section estimate of 300 pb. From the cross section
           estimate, the 263Rf production rate is about 2
           atoms per hour. Folding in the gas jet transport
           yield, chemical yield and detector efficiencies, the
           detection rate would be 1.3 events per hour for SF
           and 0.7 events per hour for alpha decay.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
DECAY-DATA (104-RF-263,500.0SEC,SF) Measured by authors as (500
