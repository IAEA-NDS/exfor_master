FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAFSU) Experiment performed using linac
           accelerator at the J.D.Fox Accelerator Laboratory at
           Florida State University.
SAMPLE     CD2 target with thickness of 517 mu-g/cm2
INC-SOURCE A primary beam of stable 23Na was accelerated by the
           FN Tandem and linac to an energy of 115 MeV. The
           primary 23Na beam was incident on a production target
           filled with deuterium gas to produce a radioactive
           beam of 24Na via the 23Na(d,p) 24Na reaction. The
           production target was 40 mm long, with a 2.5-micron
           HAVAR entrance and exit windows. Target was cooled
           with liquid nitrogen to 77 K and was kept at 350 Torr.
DETECTOR   (SISD) Double-sided 300 mu-m thick Micron S2 silicon
           detector placed 10.5 cm upstream from the target
           position was used to detect light charged particles.
           The angular coverage of the silicon detector was
           161.6 deg to 173.7 deg in the laboratory frame.
           (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) detectors were placed close to 90
           deg above and to the side of the target position to
           monitor the isomeric content of the beam via the
           detection of the 472 keV gamma rays from the decay
           of the isomeric state to the ground state (t1/2 =
           20.18 ms) of the 24Na beam.
           (IOCH) Downstream from the target position, an
           ionization chamber collected the unreacted beam
           and the heavy reaction products. The ionization
           chamber had 80 mm section to measure energy loss
           and a 200 mm section to measure total energy. It was
           filled with isobutane at a pressure of 45 Torr.
