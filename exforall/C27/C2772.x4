FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment performed using the
           Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) in-
           flight system.
SAMPLE     A CD2 target with a thickness of 300 mu-g/cm2 was
           placed inside the HELIOS spectrometer
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Solenoid spectrometer HELIOS with 2 T
           magnetic field
           (TELES,SI,SI) The heavy-ion recoil particles
           identified using quadrant silicon dE-E recoil
           detectors placed at 500 mm downstream of the target
           position. Their dimensions were 10 mm inner radius
           and a 50 mm outer radius, placed 10 mm apart. The
           thickness of the dE and E detectors was 500 and 1000
           mu-m, respectively.
           (SI) The light charged particles were detected using
           a position sensitive Si-detector array with the first
           active area beginning at 710 mm downstream of the
           target position. The array had six sides in a
           hexagonal shape with five detectors on each side. The
           position was determined by resistive charge division
           along the beam direction: the active area was 50 mm
            (along the beam axis) x 10 mm with a position
           resolution of roughly 1 mm along the beam axis.
METHOD     (EDE) Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE The 16N secondary beam was produced from a 15N
           primary beam at 13.5 MeV/u bombarding a cryogenically
           cooled (90 K) deuterium gas cell at 1400 mbar. The
           total intensity of the 16N secondary beam (ground
           state and isomeric state) was 2E+5 pps at an energy
           of 11.8 MeV/u. Separate experiment was carried out to
           determine 16mN content of the beam. It was determined
           that the 16mN was (24+-2) % of the 16N beam, which was
           more than 50% of the total beam.
