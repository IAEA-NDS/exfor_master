INC-SPECT  The source of the tritium used for bombarding was 60
           cm3 (at NTP) of gas containing 0.025% 30's.
SAMPLE     The deuterium gas used in the ionization chamber. A
           target about 0.2 MeV thick.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Disintegration (reaction products) chamber.
ERR-ANALYS Errors in the measurement of the cross section involve
           errors in
           (ERR-S,3.,24.) the number of disintegrations observed,
           the standard error arising from the statistical nature
           of the number of disintegrations observed, the standard
            error arising from the statistical nature of the
           number of disintegrations observed varied from 3 to 6%
           for all except the data of Aug. 20 and 21, for which
           the best established points have an error of 7% and the
            poorest 12 and 24%,
           (ERR-1) the number of target particles, the errors in
           the determination of the number of target particles are
            the same as those given in the 230 report in which an
           error of 1.1% was assigned,
           (ERR-2) A very subjective estimate of the uncertainty
           is 7%,
           (ERR-3,1.,3.) the solid angle in which disintegrations
           were detected, since for measurements in the 90 degrees
            direction the solid angle has not been finally
           calculated and since in the forward direction, because
           of the presence of short-range particles, the solid
           angle is an as yet unknown function of energy, no
           attempt will be made to assign errors to the
           determination of solid angle. The measurements of the
           dimensions of the chamber were made with an error of 1%
            and with an uncertainty of 3%.
           (ERR-4), indirectly, the determination of the energy.
           The error in the determination of the incident energy
           was estimated as 3.5 percent in the 230 report.
           An attempt will be made to assign to these quantities a
            "probable" error and an uncertainty. The error is our
           best estimate of the errors in the measurements, and
           the uncertainty is the limit within which we believe
           all errors lie.

REACTION   (1-H-2(T,N)2-HE-4,,SIG)
METHOD     The measurements made in a cone of approximately 30
           degree about the direction of the beam give a thick
           target cross section. These values are subject to
           final calculations of the solid angles.
