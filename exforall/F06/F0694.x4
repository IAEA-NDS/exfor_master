TITLE      Energy-dependent coherence width of 28Si at excitation
           energies between 22 and 33 MeV.

REL-REF    (I,,L.W.Put,J,NP/A,112,561,1968) Experimental
           arrangement was described.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2NEDGRN)Philips prototype 30 MeV AVF-cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Target of MG-24 was used.
INC-SOURCE Alpha-particle beam.
INC-SPECT  Energy of alpha particles is in the range from 18 MeV
           to 27 MeV.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Detectors were placed at eight angles between
           80 degrees and 164 degrees (lab.)
ANALYSIS   Excitation functions were obtained in steps of
           35, 40 and 100 keV. Statistical analysis was applied to
           56 measured excitation functions.
CORRECTION The values of resonance width Gamma(n) were corrected
           for energy resolution and finite range of data effects.
           Half-widths of Gamma(g) needed extra correction for
            "damping" of excitation functions. Values of resonance
           width Gamma(p) were corrected for energy resolution,
           step size and counting statistics.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in resonance width.

COMMENT    DATA2 is a mean value of an averaged value of width
           from normal autocorrelation functions,an averaged value
           of width from autocorrelation functions of
           trend-reduced excitation functions and an averaged
           value from a number of maxima in the excitation
           functions.
