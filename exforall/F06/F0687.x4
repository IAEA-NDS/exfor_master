FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSSUL)  U-120
DETECTOR   (GELI) 1. Ge(Li)- spectrometer with a crystal size of
           100 cm*3 and the energy resolution of 3.8 keV for
           Eg=661 keV was used for check measurements.
           2. Ge(Li)- spectrometer with a crystal size of 80 cm*3
           and the energy resolution of 2.8 keV for Eg=1.332 MeV
           was used for the final series of measurements.
SAMPLE     (48-CD-114,ENR=0.99) The targets were self-supporting
           foils of Cd  (3.3 and 5.9 mg/cm2 thickness)with 99%
           enrichment of 114Cd.
           As a monitor target a copper foil with the natural
           isotope composition (4.05 and 4.18 mu-g/cm2 thickness)
           located at the place of main target was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were defined by induced
           activity method. 1. The check measurements allowed to
           establish the presence of the gamma-lines under study
            (190, 558, and 725 keV) in the 114In decay spectrum
           and to estimate their relative intensity.
            2. Final measurements were carried out 48 h after the
           exposure (run 1) and 42 days after the exposure (run 2)
           They were helped to solve problems arising from
           short-lived isotopes 113In, 115In, and 116In
           and annihilation peaks.
