DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li)- spectrometer with a crystal size of
           100 cm*3 and the energy resolution of 3.8 keV for
           Eg=661 keV was used for check measurements. Ge(Li)-
           spectrometer with a crystal size of 80 cm*3 and the
           energy resolution of 2.8 keV for Eg=1.332 MeV was used
           for the next series of measurements.
SAMPLE     The targets were self-supporting foils of Cd  (3.3
           and 5.9 mg/cm2 thickness)with 99% enrichment of 114Cd.
           As a monitor target a cuprum foil with the natural
           isotope composition (4.05 and 4.18 mu-g/cm2 thickness)
           located at the place of main target was used.
METHOD     Cross sections were defined by induced activity method.
