FACILITY   (VDG)   6 MV
DETECTOR   (SI) The 100 mu silicon detectors mounted on
           rotatable arms, with an angular accuracy of 0.1 degr.
           Circular detector collimators subtended a solid angle
           of 0.5 msr with an angular acceptance of 0.8 degr.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of 250 mu-g/cm2 natural silicon
           evaporated onto a backing consisting of a 40 mu-g/cm2
           gold layer on a KAPTON film.
MONITOR    Forward angle elastic scattering from a thin gold
           target, measured on both sides of the beam, was used to
           determine the angular offset of the angle
           determinations.
           Rutherford scattering from the thin gold layer
           sandwiched between the silicon target material and the
           KAPTON backing, was used to monitor the total incident
           flux.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)Statistical error
           (ERR-SYS)Systematic error in the measured cross section
           values, which is mainly due to uncertainties in the
           silicon and gold target thicknesses.
           (DATA-ERR)The experimental error bars represent
           statistical errors only.
           (ERR-DIG)Digitizing error
