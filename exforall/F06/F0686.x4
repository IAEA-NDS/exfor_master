SAMPLE     Natural sulphur in the form of cadmium sulphide was
           used as the target material. The targets for p-gamma
           experiment were self-supporting and had a thickness of
           about 100 ug/cm2, whilst the target for the
           polarization and lifetime experiment was 1 mg/cm2
           thick and was supported on a thick gold backing.
INC-SPECT  Photon-gamma angular correlations were measured at
           alpha particle energy of 14.7 MeV, and lifetime and
           gamma ray linear polarization measurements were
           performed of alpha particles energies of 11.0 MeV and
           12.0 MeV.
DETECTOR   (TELES,NAICR,GELI) In correlation experiment particles
           were detected using annular E/DE telescope accepting
           particles emitted close to 180 degrees with respect to
           the beam direction. Gamma rays were detected in five
           5 in x 6 in NaI(Tl) detectors mounted in a horizontal
           plane around the target chamber at angles of 8, 30, 45
           and 120(60) degrees with respect to the beam direction.
           Ge(Li) detector was mounted vertically above the target
           chamber, to assist in determination of the decay scheme
           and to yield accurate gamma ray energies.
           (GELI) Gamma ray linear polarizations were measured at
           90 degrees to the beam direction using a three Ge(Li)
           Compton polarimeter.
           Escape-suppressed spectrometer was used to measure the
           angular distribution of gamma rays.
           The resolution of the counter system for protons was
           about 80 keV.
METHOD     (EDE) The use of E/DE counter enabled protons from the
           32S(alpha,pgamma)35Cl reaction to be distinguished
           from alpha particle from the competing
           32S(alpha,alpha'gamma)32S inelastic scattering.
           (GSPEC)
           Doppler shift attenuation method was used to determine
           the lifetimes of the levels.
           The lifetime of 6088 keV level was measured by recoil
           distance (plunger) method.
           The peak counts at each angle of gamma ray distribution
           were normalized using the isotropic 1220 keV gamma ray
           from  the 1/2+ first excited state of 35Cl.
           Gamma-ray centroid shifts were extracted from the
           angular distribution data.
ANALYSIS   The phase convention of Rose and Brink (1967) was used.

           Compiler believes that the abscissa axis is given on
           a linear scale in units of cos**2. In accordance with
           this representation, the abscissa of a point whose
