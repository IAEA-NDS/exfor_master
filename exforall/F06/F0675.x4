FACILITY   (CYCLO)
INC-SOURCE Alpha-particle beam was focused by a pair quadrupole
           lenses and deviated by rotational magnet. Angle of
           divergence was 0.2 degree.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two scintillation spectrometers were used.
           Their sensors were placed at 45-50 degrees to the
           beam.
