FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR CSN) 4 MV accelerator.
INC-SOURCE Alpha particle beam intensity is 5 microA.
SAMPLE     A natural silicon target was used. Its density is
           about 15 mu-g/cm**2. The target was prepared by
           evaporation in vacuum.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two detectors of NaI(Tl) were used. Their size
           was 12.7 cm x 12.7 cm. They were protected from
           external radiation by  lead cylinder of 5cm thickness.
           One detector was fixed in horizontal plane at 90
           degrees angle to the beam direction. Another one was
           placed in the same plane at the angles of 0, 35, 55,
           90 degrees to the beam.
           (GELI) The volume of detector is 30 cm**3. The
           resolution of detector is 6 - 661 keV for radiation of
           15 keV - 6 MeV energies.

HISTORY    (20040127C)
           (20090119A) Reaction definition in sub 3,5,6 was
           changed. NO-DIM units in sub 2-6 were replaced by
           ARB-UNITS.

DETECTOR   (SCIN) The irradiation of 5.77 MeV (from level of
           10.23 MeV to level of 4.46 MeV) was measured at fixed
           angle of 90 degrees. The irradiation of 2.23 MeV and
           2.24 MeV (from level of 4.46 MeV to level of 2.24 MeV
           and from level of 2.24 MeV to level of 0.0 MeV) was
           measured at variable angle.
SAMPLE     The distance from the target is 12 cm.
