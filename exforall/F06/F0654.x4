FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
DETECTOR   (TELES) A three element telescope consisting of
           transmission type solid-state 10 micron thick detector
           followed by a 150 micron thick transmission type
           solid-state detector and 3000 micron thick E detector
           was placed at back angle and rotated from 150 degrees
           t0 164 degrees in steps of 4-5 degr. to obtain angular
           distribution.
           (SOLST) A 2000 micron thick detector was placed at a
           fixed angle 32 degrees for beam monitoring.
MONITOR    Elastic yields at forward angles were normalized to
           the corresponding data from A.Budzanowski et al, and
           in this way, the absolute normalization constants were
           determined.
