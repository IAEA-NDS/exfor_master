TITLE      Measurement of proton inelastic cross sections between
            77 MeV and 133 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAHRV)
METHOD     (EXTB,COINC) The cross sections are measured by
           counting the number of protons entering the target and
           then counting the number of protons leaving the target
           which have not lost energy in an inelastic collision.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) The first two counters use plastic
           scintillators and are discs 1.3 cm in diam. by 0.64 cm
           thick. These counters, operated in coincidence, define
           a well collimated beam striking the target and serve as
           the beam monitor.
           Counters 3, 4 and 5 with the specially shaped brass
           absorbers comprise the energy analyzer and detector for
           elastically scattered protons. Counters 3, 4 and 5 are
           made with plastic scintillators and have a diameter
           of 6.98 cm, 15.2 cm and 20.3 cm, respectively, to
           accommodate the desired cut-off angle.
SAMPLE     Carbon, aluminium, copper, silver and lead, are
            made from commercially pure stock
CORRECTION Data were corrected for:
            1) large angle elastic scattering
            2) the inclusion of "near-elastic" scattering events
               as elastic events.
           No corrections are made for the effect of small
           differences in range distribution of protons passing
           through the telescope in the target-in and target-out
           configurations.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors (statistical counting errors,
           measurement errors and the estimated errors in the
           corrections) have been combined in the usual manner
           for Gaussian errors.
