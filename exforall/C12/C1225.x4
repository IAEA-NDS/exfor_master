TITLE      148Gd production cross section measurements for 600-
           and 800-MeV protons on tantalum, tungsten, and gold
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) LANSCE accelerator and WNR Facility
            Irradiation in the so-called Blue Room at WNR
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,SITA)
           Experiments were done with stack of foils and with
           single foil, sandwiched between two aluminum catcher
SAMPLE     The tantalum, tungsten, and gold foils (>99.9% purity)
           were  nominally 3 mu-m in thickness so that proton
           energy loss through  a foil was negligible.
           Aluminum activation foils (10 mu-m thickness,
           99.0% purity) were used for beam  monitoring
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Monitor cross-sections were used to determine
           the proton fluence by counting the 22Na with a HPGe
           detector calibrated with a 152Eu source.
            The gamma-spectroscopy system was used not only for
           measuring 22Na, but also for measuring other
           radionuclide production cross sections.
