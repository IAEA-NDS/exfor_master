DETECTOR   (NAICR) Stanford 24x24 cm NaI gamma-ray spectrometer.
SAMPLE     (7-N-15,ENR=0.993)  Target cell in stainless steel,
           thin cylindrical wall, 4cm in diameter, with an
           entrance and exit window in Mo (2.59 mg/cm2).
ANALYSIS   The gamma-ray spectra from 15N(p,gamma0)160 were
           analyzed by fitting them with the standard lineshapes
           by means of a least-squares computer program. The
           changes in lineshape and peak efficiency of the
           detector with energy were taken into account in
           determining the absolute yields.

METHOD     The 90 degrees yield was measured from E = 12.7 to
           18.0 MeV in 100 keV steps (some 50 keV steps) at a
           gas cell pressure corresponding to a target thickness
           of the order of 40 keV; from Ep = 10.0 to 11.2 MeV in
           10 or 20 keV steps math a target thickness of about
           15 keV; and from Ep = 8.45 to 8. 78 MeV and 13.98 to
           14.30 MeV in 20 to 25 keV steps with a target
           thickness also of about 15 keV. The target entrance
           window introduced a beam energy loss of about 57 keV
           at Ep = 10 MeV and 37 keV at Ep = 18 MeV, and a beam
           energy straggle of about 13 keV that is nearly
           independent of beam energy. The detector solid angle
           was about 0.15 sr and 13 to 20 cm of paraffin was
           inserted between the target and the NaI crystal to
           attenuate fast neutrons which produced an undesirable
           background in the detector.

METHOD     The angular distributions were measured between 32 (in
           some cases 22 or 39) and 135 degrees at five to eight
           angles. The energy range covered was Ep= 8.6 to 18.0
           MeV, in the following steps: from 8.6 to 18.65 MeV in
           100 keV steps, with a few larger or smaller steps;
           from 14 to 1.7 MeV in 250 keV steps, and from 17 to
           18 MeV in 125 keV steps. The gas pressures were about
           0.40 Torr (2.4 mg/cm2) corresponding to thicknesses
           varying from 91 keV at Ep = 10 MeV to 58 keV at Ep=18
           MeV. The detector solid angle was about 0.05 sr and
           20 to 40 cm of paraffin was used between the target
           and detector.

METHOD     The angular distributions were measured between 32 (in
           some cases 22 or 39) and 135 degrees at five to eight
           angles. The energy range covered was Ep= 8.6 to 18.0
           MeV, in the following steps: from 8.6 to 18.65 MeV in
           100 keV steps, with a few larger or smaller steps;
           from 14 to 1.7 MeV in 250 keV steps, and from 17 to
           18 MeV in 125 keV steps. The gas pressures were about
           0.40 Torr (2.4 mg/cm2) corresponding to thicknesses
           varying from 91 keV at Ep = 10 MeV to 58 keV at Ep=18
           MeV. The detector solid angle was about 0.05 sr and
           20 to 40 cm of paraffin was used between the target
           and detector.
