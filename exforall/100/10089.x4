ANALYSIS   The 3.39-MeV state in B12 has been studied in the
           B12+n system, where the state appears as a resonance
           at a (lab) neutron energy of 20.8+-0.5 keV.
           Scattering and transmission measurements were
           compared with 11B(d,p) data and were used to
           determine that resonance was d-wave. Spin J=3-
           determined by ruling out other alternatives. For each
           possible j value a neutron width was calculated from
           the data.

INC-SPECT  Energy resolution about 7 keV.
           Beam chopped for capture measurements so as to give
            27 msec bursts separated by 53 msec.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Capture was measured by detecting residual
           12B activity. The active region of the boron sample
           was defined in the vertical direction
            (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of the neutron and
           proton beams) by the edges of the scintillator and in
           the horizontal direction by a lead slit. The lead
           slit was curved so that the center line followed a
           constant neutron energy. Output pulses from the
           photomultiplier were amplified and then fed into a
           single-channel pulse-height analyzer, whose output
           was fed into a multichannel analyzer operating in the
           multiscaler mode with a time scale of 1 msec/channel.
           The start and stop of the counting by the
           multichannel analyzer was synchronized with the
           mechanical beam chopper so that the activity was
           measured between beam bursts. Runs were taken for a
           fixed number of monitor counts both with the boron
           sample in and with it out. The sample-out
           multichannel (time) spectra were subtracted from
           those taken with the sample in; the resultant (time)
           spectra were dominated by the B12 activity.

DETECTOR   (BF3) System of moderated BF3 counters used.
METHOD     (TRN) The apparatus has been used in a number of fast
           neutron experiments. A sample, which may or may not
           consist of the element being investigated, scatters
           the neutrons into a system of moderated BF3 counters.
           Another sample can be placed in front of the entire
           system so that transmission measurements are possible
           as well. Background is measured by removing the
           scattering sample. All sample changing is remotely
           controlled.
