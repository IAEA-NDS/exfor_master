ANALYSIS   Scattering and transmission measurements were compared
            with 11B(d,p) data and were used to determine that
            resonance was d-wave. Spin J=3- determined by ruling
            out other alternatives. For each possible j value
            a neutron width was calculated from the data.
STATUS     Data taken from text of reference.

REACTION   (5-B-11(N,G)5-B-12,,SIG)
INC-SPECT  Energy resolution about 7 keV.
           Beam chopped for capture measurements so as to give
            27 msec bursts separated by 53 msec.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Capture was measured by detecting residual
            12B activity.
