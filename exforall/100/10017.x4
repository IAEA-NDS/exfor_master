TITLE      Slow-neutron cross sections of He, Ne, Ar and Kr.
FACILITY   (SPECC,1USABNL) Crystal spectrometer.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) High Flux Beam Reactor.
METHOD     (TRN) The total cross section for each gas was
           determined from transmission of the sample
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error includes statistical error
            and estimation of error due to density uncertainty.
