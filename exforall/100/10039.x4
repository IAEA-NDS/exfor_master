TITLE      Coherent neutron scattering by cobalt with nuclear
            polarization.
FACILITY   (REAC) MIT research reactor.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) Monochromatic neutrons from polarizing crystal.
SAMPLE     Ferromagnetic, hexagonal cobalt, ellipsoidal in shape.
METHOD     (DIFFR) Polarized neutron diffraction technique used to
            determine the modification of coherent scattering with
            nuclear polarization in cobalt. Sample cooled as low
            as 2.23 K and studied in two Bragg reflections, (220)
            and (140).
DETECTOR   Polarized beam spectrometer
ANALYSIS   Spin-state scattering amplitudes determined from
            modification of coherent thermal neutron scattering
            with nuclear polarization in cobalt.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,THS)27-CO-59,COH,AMP)
CORRECTION Allowed for imperfect neutron polarization within
            crystal and secondary extinction in the Bragg
            reflection process.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.
