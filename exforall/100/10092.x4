TITLE      3He(n,p)T Cross Section from 0.3 to 1.16 MeV
FACILITY   (LINAC) Pulsed linear accelerator
INC-SPECT  First two energy intervals arbitrarily chosen. Above
            0.5 MeV, intervals chosen to be consistent with
            instrumental resolution which is limited mainly by
            timing uncertainty (2.5 microsec) of counters.
SAMPLE     3He gas counter filling. Better than 99.9% isotopic
            purity.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight, with 220-meter flight path.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Four 1-in diameter by 6-in long (active length)
            3He-filled proportional counters filled to 10 atmos.
            pressure.
MONITOR    (2-HE-3(N,TOT),,SIG) Total counts in spectra
            normalized to total 3He cross section, which is known
            to about 3% in energy range studied.
CORRECTION Corrected for wall effect. Background very low.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quadrature sum of statistical uncertainties,
            extrapolation uncertainties (assuming 20%
            uncertainties in calculations), and uncertainties in
            total cross section.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author
            Data taken from Table I in reference.
