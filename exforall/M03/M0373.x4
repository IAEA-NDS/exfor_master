COMMENT    The evaluated Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62 reaction cross   section
            was obtained by using the method of reduction.
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) The method based on the method of reduction is
            proposed for  the  evaluation  of  the   photonuclear
            reaction cross   sections   have   been  obtained  at
            significant systematic    uncertainties    (different
            apparatus functions,  calibration  and  normalization
            uncertainties).
           The main criterion used in  analysis was similarity of
            the generalized features of initial  cross  sections,
            such  as  integrated  cross  sections  and centers of
            gravity,  to their  weighted-mean  values.  The  main
            principle   used   for   analyzing  and  reducing  of
            systematic  discrepancies  between  the  results   of
            different   experiments   was   some   transformation
            (recalibration -  correction  of  the scale in energy
            axis, renormalization - correction  of  the  scale in
            cross  section  axis)  of initial cross sections with
            that aim of forming the best agreement of generalized
            characteristics.
           Initial cross sections whose generalized features were
            too different  from  the  weighted-mean  values  (the
            systematic  errors  were  too high) were rejected and
            the entire procedure was repeated.
           The set  of cross section values  that  have satisfied
            all the selection criteria,  was used to evaluate the
            cross sections and their errors by means of reduction
            method.
