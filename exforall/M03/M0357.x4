SAMPLE     Plane target  and  cylindrical  targets  were used to
            study the energy spectrum of photoneutrons from C-12
            and  angular  distributions  of  photoneutrons  from
            Be-9, C-12 and Al-27 respectively.  Sizes of targets
            WERE CHOSEN  TO  RESTRICT  A  FRACTION  OF  NEUTRONS
            scattered  inelastically in a sample and a lead slab
            before detector by 5  p.  c.  to  study  the  energy
            spectrum   and   10   p.c.   to  study  the  angular
            distributions.
METHOD     (REC) A paraffin disk was used as a converter.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)  a  lead  slab  was  placed  before
            converter    and    detector   for   absorption   of
            photoprotons and main part of electrons emitted by a
            target.
CORRECTION The angular distributions were corrected for (a)  the
            thickness  of  the  converter,(b)  the dependence of
            efficiency of registration on neutron energy and (c)
            the angle of (n,p)-scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  Statistical  errors  of   measurements.  The
            background  was negligible.  It was less than 3 p.c.
            for measurements of angular distributions and 5 p.c.
            for measurement of energy spectrum.

COMMENT    An investigation  was  carried  out  of  the  angular
            distribution of photoneutrons with energies above 10
            MeV  emitted  by Be-9,  C-12 and Al-27 targets under
            the  irradiation  by   88   MeV   end-point   energy
            bremsstrahlung. The energy spectrum of photoneutrons
            emitted at the angle of 75  degrees  from  C-12  was
            also  investigated and from the data thus obtained a
            comparison  is  made   of   the   photoneutron   and
            photoproton yields in the same energy intervals. The
            angular distribution results are compared  with  the
            quasi-deutron   model   and   the  model  of  direct
            resonance nuclear photoeffect. Qualitative agreement
            with the quasi-deutron model has been obtained.

            Common logarithm of neutron spectrum is presented.
ANALYSIS   To determine the photoneutron spectrum the groups  of
            proton  recoils  formed in the converter by neutrons
            from 1 MeV-wide range around the mean energies  E(i)
            were graphically found.  On the basis of such graphs
            constructed for the neutrons energies E(i) with  the
            step  of  1 MeV the number of recoil protons in each
            energy interval may be  calculated  by  summing  the
            number  of  neutrons  multiplied by some coefficient
            over  all  possible  values  of  E(i).  The   energy
            distribution  of  neutrons  which  took  place after
            calculations  the   experimental   distribution   of
            protons   was  regarded  as  the  real  photoneutron
            spectrum.
CORRECTION For (a)  the  thickness  of the converter and (b) the
            cross section of (n,p)-scattering were made.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.   The method   of   energy
            spectrum  calculation  leads  to  appearance  of the
            additional errors.  The  summary error was estimated
            as 40 p.c.  (without the  statistical errors).
