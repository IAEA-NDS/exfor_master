SAMPLE     PLANE TARGET AND CYLINDRICAL TARGETS WERE USED TO STU-
           DY THE ENERGY SPECTRUM  OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM C-12 AND
           ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM BE-9, C-12
           AND AL-27 RESPECTIVELY.SIZES OF TARGETS WERE CHOSEN TO
           RESTRICT A FRACTION OF NEUTRONS SCATTERED INELASTICAL-
           LY IN A SAMPLE AND A LEAD SLAB BEFORE DETECTOR BY 5 P.
           C. TO STUDY THE ENERGY  SPECTRUM  AND 10 P.C. TO STUDY
           THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS.
METHOD     (REC).A PARAFFIN DISK WAS USED AS A CONVERTER.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN). A LEAD  SLAB WAS PLACED BEFORE CON-
           VERTER AND DETECTOR FOR ABSORPTION OF PHOTOPROTONS AND
           MAIN PART OF ELECTRONS EMITTED BY A TARGET.
CORRECTION THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS  WERE  CORRECTED FOR (A) THE
           THICKNESS OF THE CONVERTER,(B) THE DEPENDENCE OF EFFI-
           CIENCY OF REGISTRATION  ON NEUTRON ENERGY  AND (C) THE
           ANGLE OF (N,P)-SCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS OF MEASUREMENTS.
           THE BACKGROUND WAS NEGLIGIBLE. IT WAS LESS THAN 3 P.C.
           FOR MEASUREMENTS  OF  ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS AND 5 P.C.
           FOR MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY SPECTRUM.

COMMENT    AN INVESTIGATION  WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE ANGULAR DIST-
           RIBUTION OF PHOTONEUTRONS  WITH  ENERGIES ABOVE 10 MEV
           EMITTED BY BE-9,C-12 AND AL-27 TARGETS UNDER THE IRRA-
           DIATION BY 88 MEV END-POINT ENERGY BREMSSTRAHLUNG. THE
           ENERGY SPECTRUM OF PHOTONEUTRONS  EMITTED AT THE ANGLE
           OF 75 DEGREES FROM C-12 WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED AND FROM
           THE DATA  THUS  OBTAINED  A COMPARISON  IS MADE OF THE
           PHOTONEUTRON AND PHOTOPROTON YIELDS IN THE SAME ENERGY
           INTERVALS. THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION RESULTS ARE COMPA-
           RED WITH THE QUASI-DEUTRON  MODEL AND THE MODEL OF DI-
           RECT RESONANCE  NUCLEAR PHOTOEFFECT. QUALITATIVE AGRE-
           EMENT WITH THE QUASI-DEUTRON MODEL HAS BEEN  OBTAINED.

ANALYSIS   TO DETERMINE THE PHOTONEUTRON  SPECTRUM  THE GROUPS OF
           PROTON RECOILS FORMED IN THE CONVERTER BY NEUTRONS FR-
           OM 1 MEV-WIDE RANGE AROUND THE MEAN ENERGIES E(I) WERE
           GRAPHICALLY FOUND. ON THE BASIS OF SUCH  GRAPHS CONST-
           RUCTED FOR THE NEUTRONS ENERGIES E(I) WITH THE STEP OF
           1 MEV THE NUMBER OF RECOIL  PROTONS IN EACH ENERGY IN-

           TRONS MULTIPLIED BY SOME COEFFICIENT OVER ALL POSSIBLE

           WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER  CALCULATIONS  THE EXPERIMENTAL
           DISTRIBUTION OF PROTONS WAS REGARDED  AS THE REAL PHO-
           TONEUTRON SPECTRUM.
CORRECTION FOR (A) THE THICKNESS OF THE CONVERTER AND (B) THE CR-
