TITLE      Cross sections for photoneutron emission induced
            by lithium gamma rays.

INSTITUTE  (1USAPEN)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(3-LI-7(P,G)4-BE-8))
INC-SPECT  Lithium proton-capture gamma rays were obtained  from
            narrow  line  at  17.6 MeV  and a broad line at 14.8
            MeV.  All gamma rays were associated  with  441  keV
            resonance.  The  relative intensity of 17.6 and 14.8
            MeV components was about 1.7 : 1.
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAPEN) With energy of protons 0.48 MeV.
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     High-purity powder  samples  of thirteen elements (of
            atomic  numbers  ranging  from  26   to   83)   were
            irradiated  in  thin aluminum cylindrical containers
            which fit over the proton beam tube and thus subtend
            almost the total solid angle at the lithium target.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A cylindrical crystal 1.5 inch  by  1.5  inch
            was used to monitor the gamma rays intensity.
           Two groups of four counters (1 inch diam. by 4.5 inch
            active length) were used:
          1(BF3) Group A:
            Four counters consisted of two counters above and two
            counters below the sample.
          2(BF3) Group B:
            Four counters formed a square array above the sample
            at 90 deg to the protons beam. The counters of this
            group were placed closer to the target.
MONITOR    To determine  the  absolute  energy  of  the  neutron
            counters Ra-Be neutrons source were used, calibrated
            by the National Bureau of  Standards.  Its  absolute
            strength was estimated to be 5%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) With  data of early experimental measurements.
            The efficiency of detection systems was measured for
            different energy of neutrons.
ANALYSIS   The cross sections for photoneutron  production  were
            calculated from neutron yields,  which were measured
            at all energies of gamma rays.
          1Group A:
            The efficiency of the counters does not depend on
            the neutrons energy.
          2Group B:
            The efficiency of the counters depends strongly on
            the  neutrons energy (near to 1/E).
ERR-ANALYS1(DATA-ERR) Group A:
            The  uncertainty in absolute value of each cross
            section is to be 15%, determined chiefly by the
            uncertainties in the neutron and photon  detector
            efficiencies. The relative cross-section values for
            the different elements are known to better than 10%.
          2No information on the uncertainty.
COMMENT    The energies of lithium gamma line are  presented  as
            high  and low values of limit of gamma quanta energy
            Eg-min and Eg-max, respectively.
           Since the results for Group B  depend on the
            assumptions made about the photoneutron energy
            spectra, authors believe the Group A values to be
            more accurate than those obtained with Group B.
