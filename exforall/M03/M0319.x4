FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSFTI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) With end-point energy from 18. MeV up to 52.5
           MeV.
INC-SPECT  The gamma-beam impulse length was close to 0.5 microsec
           the period following the impulse was close to
           13 millisec.
MONITOR    The calibration was made by using threshold of
            (gamma,n) reaction for Bi-209, Co-59, C-12 nuclei and
           maximum position for the reaction O-16(gamma,p)n-15.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA). The neutron yield was measured for
           different value of end-point energy of bremsstrahlung
           beam.
PART-DET   (N)    The neutrons were slowed down to the thermal
           energy.
DETECTOR   (BF3). 12 BF3-counters were used, which where placed
           parallelly to the beam axis.
SAMPLE     Thickness was near to 17 g/cm-sq.
ADD-RES    (THEO)  The data of this experiment agree with
           theoretical calculations wade without any
           assumption about the final state of the nucleus.
           (COMP) With experimental data of early measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented only.
COMMENT    The yield curve was measured with step 0.25 MeV in
           the energy range from the threshold up to 26.5 MeV,
           and with step 1.0 MeV in the energy range from the
           threshold up to 52.5 MeV.
           The cross sections were calculated by using
           inverse matrix method (Penfold-Leiss).

ANALYSIS   (PLA)  The cross section was calculated from
           the yield curve with step 0.5 MeV twice. One result
           was shifted with respect to the other by 0.25 MeV.
