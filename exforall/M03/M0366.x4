TITLE      Observation of magnetic dipole strength in o-16.

DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     A gas cell with enriched N-15 gas at a pressure of 12
            250 torr.
ANALYSIS   Reaction  cross  section was measured  as  a function
            bombarding energy.
ERR-ANALYS No information.
STATUS     (CURVE)   Data  have  been  digitized IN  USA  NIST.
            DATA-ERR information has been added in CDFE.
COMMENT    The  polarized-proton  radiative  capture  was  used
            unambigiously identifying   of  the  concentrations
            magnetic dipole  strength. Three  M1  resonances  we
            observed in the doubly magic O-16 nucleus between
            E-e = 16 and  20 MeV,  with relatively  large  total
            g transition strength.

            dates corrected from two to  four  digits  including
            those in   REFERENCE   and   HISTORY,   lower  case,
