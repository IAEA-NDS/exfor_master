INSTITUTE  (1USAGWU)
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,264,30,79)
FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAGWU)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     A  GAS CELL WITH ENRICHED N-15 GAS AT A PRESSURE OF 12
            250 TORR.
ANALYSIS   REACTION  CROSS  SECTION WAS MEASURED  AS  A FUNCTION
            BOMBARDING ENERGY.
ERR-ANALYS NO INFORMATION.
STATUS     (CURVE)   DATA  HAVE  BEEN  DIGITIZED IN  USA  NIST. T
            DATA-ERR INFORMATION HAS BEEN ADDED IN CDFE.
COMMENT    THE  POLARIZED-PROTON  RADIATIVE  CAPTURE  WAS  USED
            UNAMBIGIOUSLY IDENTIFYING   OF  THE  CONCENTRATIONS
            MAGNETIC DIPOLE  STRENGTH.  THREE  M1  RESONANCES  WE
            OBSERVED IN THE DOUBLY MAGIC O-16 NUCLEUS BETWEEN E-E
            = 16 AND  20  MEV,  WITH  RELATIVELY  LARGE  TOTAL  G
            TRANSITION STRENGTH.
