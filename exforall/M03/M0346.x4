SAMPLE     Enriched to 99.6 %.  Ar-40 contained in the 12 cm
           diameter vacuum-insulated target-vessel.
METHOD     (TOF)
           The energy resolution of time-of-flight system was
           0.6 - 0.9 ns/m (20 keV at neutron energy of 1 MeV).
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  Proton-recoil detector  was  consisted of 8 cm
           thick cylinder of Ne 102 scintillator viewed by 4
           photomultiplier tubes.

ANALYSIS   A series of photoneutron difference spectra were
           obtained by subtracting the neutron spectrum measured
           at each  end-point  energy  from the spectrum obtained
           at the next higher energy. Such subtractions were
           carried out for 1 MeV differences up to 16 MeV and in
           2 MeV steps thereafter.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for (a) the background and (b) the
           detector efficiency.
ADD-RES    (COMP)  The theoretical description of the gamma
           quantum absorption by the whole nucleus at the
           resonance energy was performed.

           received for giant dipole resonance at 20 MeV.

COMMENT    Photoneutron energy spectra from Ar-40  have been
           measured at bremsstrahlung end-point energies from 13
           to 23 MeV in 1 MeV steps. The total cross section
           derived from the neutron spectra exhibits a change
           from single particle behavior at about 14 MeV where
           collective effects begin to dominate and neutrons are
           emitted to highly excited states of Ar-39.

ANALYSIS   The ground state  differential  cross section has been
           received from the neutron difference spectra  dividing
           by the bremsstrahlung intensity distributions. The
           fine structure in the low energy region has been
           averaged over 200 keV intervals.
           data are a collage of results obtained by using 11
           different end-points energies.

ASSUMED    Isotropy of the neutron angular distributions is
           assumed as an approximation.
ANALYSIS   The total cross section has been obtained as a product
           of the ground-state  differential cross section by the
           sum of the unit  and the relative number of non-ground
           state transitions from excited states of Ar-40.
ERR-ANALYS No information.
ADD-RES    The integrated strength of the measured total
           photoneutron cross section was found to be 260 mb*MeV
           with 60 mb*MeV error.
