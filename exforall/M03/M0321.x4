TITLE      PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF O-16 AND CU-63 BY PHOTONS
           OF VARIABLE ENERGY.
AUTHOR     (J.G.CAMPBELL)
INSTITUTE  (3AULAML)
REFERENCE  (J,AUJ,8,449,55)
FACILITY   (VDG,3AULAML) WITH ENERGY OF PROTONS 0.7 MEV.
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(3-LI-7(P,G)4-BE-8))
           CHANGING OF PHOTON ENERGIES BY VARIATION OF P-ENERGY.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 1.5 INCH LONG AND 1.5 INCH IN DIAMETER.  USED
            FOR MONITORING GAMMA RAYS FROM THE LI-7(P,G) REACTION.
           (SCIN) FOR DETECTION OF POSITRONS, WHICH WERE OBTAINED
           AT THE DECAY OF AN ACTIVATED SAMPLE. A SCINTILLATOR
           WAS ALSO USED FOR DETECTING THE CURRENT OF PROTONS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
PART-DET   (B+)
ADD-RES    (COMP) WITH THE DATA OF EARLY EXPERIMENTS BY USING
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG GAMMA BEAMS.
SAMPLE     THE LITHIUM TARGET WAS ABOUT 80 KEV THICK.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERRORS PRESENTED
COMMENT    MAXIMUM WAS OBSERVED IN THE CROSS SECTION AT THE ENERGY
           OF 17.85 MEV.
