TITLE      Photodisintegration of O-16 and Cu-63 by  photons  of
            variable energy.
AUTHOR     (J.G.Campbell)
REFERENCE  (J,AUJ,8,449,1955)
INSTITUTE  (3AULAML)
FACILITY   (VDG,3AULAML) With energy of protons 0.7 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(3-LI-7(P,G)4-BE-8)) Changing of photon energies
            by variation of p-energy.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 1.5 inch long and 1.5 inch in diameter.  Used
            for monitoring gamma  rays  from  the  Li-7(p,gamma)
            react.
           (SCIN) For  detection  of   positrons,   which   were
            obtained  at  the  decay  of an activated sample.  A
            scintillator was also used for detecting the current
            of protons.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ADD-RES    (COMP) With the data of early  experiments  by  using
            bremsstrahlung gamma beams.
SAMPLE     The lithium target was about 80 keV thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors presented.
COMMENT    Maximum was observed in  the  cross  section  at  the
            energy of 17.85 MeV.

DECAY-DATA (8-O-15,118.SEC,B+)
ANALYSIS   Detection was done by counting the 1.68 MeV positrons
            emitted by O-15,  the half-life of which is 118 sec.
            4pi  geometry was obtained by making a scintillation
            counter in which the scintillator itself was rich in
            oxygen.
COMMENT    Dioxane scintillator  was  used   for   measurements.
            Toluene scintillator was used for beam monitoring.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data from Fig.1 of AJP,8,449,1955.
HISTORY    (20180216A) Corrected  by SD and VV: SF9 = EXP deleted
            from REACTION, ANALYSIS added, PART-DET, ERR-S.

DETECTOR   Dioxine scintillator was used.
SAMPLE     It was in the form of annulus of the  exterior  of  a
            cone,  2 inch in diameter with central hole 3/8 inch
            in diameter.  Two samples were used: with subtending
            angle 82. - 98. and 60. - 98. degrees.
