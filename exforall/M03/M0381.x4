DETECTOR   (TRD)  FOR   FISSION   FRAGMENTS   THE   POLYCARBONATE
            MAKROFOIL N (BAYER AG) SHEETS WERE USED, FOR NEUTRONS
            A 4 PI (LONG-COUNTER) CONSISTING OF 60 HE-3  DETECTOR
            CONVENTIONALLY DISTRIBUTED    INSIDE    A   MODERATOR
            MATERIAL (POLYETHEN) WAS USED.
METHOD     (FISCT)
SAMPLE     THE  U-233  SAMPLE CONTAINED 52.4 MG DEPOSITED IN  THE
            FORM OF (U-3)(O-8) ON FOUR TITANUM DISKS EACH WITH AN
            ACTIVE DIAMETER OF 40 MM WAS USED:
                MASSES       ISOTOPE     ISOTOPIC PERCENTAGE

ANALYSIS   THE DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF NUMBER OF FISSION FRAGMENTS
            USING THE SCANNING OF THE MAKROFOL SHEETS BY MEANS OF
            CONVENTIONAL OPTICAL MICROSCOPY.
ERR-ANALYS THE TOTAL ERRORS  ARE GIVEN.  THE ERROR SOURCES  WERE:
            GAMMA FLUX - 10% OF THE SUSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE
            PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY DETERMINATION PLUS 1.5 TO 3%  OF
            STATISTICAL ERROR;  PHOTOFISSION EVENTS - 3.1% OF THE
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR  IN  THE  CALIBRATION  FOR   FISSION
            COUNTING PLUS 2 TO 5% OF THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY;
            PHOTONEUTRON EVENTS - 1%  OF THE SYSTEMATIC ERROR  IN
            THE CALIBRATION FOR NEUTRON COUNTING PLUS 6 TO 10% OF
            THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY; SAMPLE ATOM CONTENT - 2%
            OF THE  SYSTEMATIC ERROR.  THE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS IN
            NU(E) AND IN THE RELATIVE INTENSITY OF THE  GAMMA-RAY
            LINES WERE  NOT  INCLUDED IN ANY ERROR ANALYS.  THESE
            VALUES RESULTED IN A OVERALL UNCERTAINTIES  OF  ABOUT
            15% FOR THE FINAL PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS,  ABOUT
            20% FOR THE FINAL TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS  SECTIONS,  AND
            RANGED FROM  20  TO  50%  FOR  THE FINAL PHOTONEUTRON
            CROSS SECTIONS.
COMMENT    THE  PHOTOFISSION  AND PHOTONEUTRON  CROSS SECTIONS OF
            U-233 HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY USING  MONOCHROMATIC  AND
            DISCRETE PHOTONS  PRODUCED BY THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE
            GAMMA-RAYS IN SEVERAL TARGETS PLACED AT THE  CORE  OF
            THE IAA-R1  REACTOR  IN THE ENERGY INTERVAL FROM 5.43
            TO 9.72   MEV.   THE   EVALUATION   OF   THE    TOTAL
            PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS  SECTIONS  AND  THE PARAMETERS:
            SINGLE FISSION  BARRIER,   RELATIVE   FISSIONABILITY,
            FISSION PROBABILITY,     NEUTRON     EMISSION/FISSION
            COMPETITION, NUCLEAR TEMPERATURE ARE ALSO PRESENTED.
