FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Frascati National Laboratories LADON.
SAMPLE     The target materials  consisted  of  metal  films  of
            high-purity natural gold,  about 1.4 mg/cm**2, lead,
            about 4.1 mg/cm**2, and bismuth, about 5.7 mg/cm**2,
            prepared by vacuum evaporation on about 3.5 cm x 3.5
            cm thin  foils  1.72  mg/cm**2  thick  of  mylar  as
            supports,  and the films of natural thorium, natural
            uranium and 93 % - enriched U-235 oxides produced by
            the "parlodion ignition" method on about 4 cm x 4 cm
            sheets of muscovite mica about  25  mg/cm**2  thick,
            which   served  as  supports  and/or  detectors  for
            fission fragments.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) 100 micron thick MACROFOL N,  BAYER  AG,  foils
            and mica foils.
ANALYSIS   The direct fission fragment track counting.
CORRECTION To obtain the final values of the physical quantities
            and associated errors,  the data have  been  treated
            taking  into  account  the  geometry of irradiation,
            statistics  of  track   counting   and   efficiency,
            registration  efficiency,  energy absorption effects
            of fission fragments by thick-target samples Au, Pb,
            and Bi, and background.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty.
COMMENT    Absolute   cross   section   measurements   for    the
            photofission reactions  of Au-197,  Pb-nat.,  Bi-209,
            Th-232, U-238,  and U-235 muclei have been  performed
            at an   incident   photon  energy  of  69  MeV  using
            monochromatic and fully polarized  photon  beams  and
            dielectric fission-track detectors. Nuclear fissility
            values have  been  obtained  and   results   are   in
            agreement with   those   from   other   laboratories,
            although in some  cases  discrepancies  are  observed
            between one  other.  For  nuclei  in  the  region  of
            actinides the fissility result is >  0.4,  while  for
            Au, Pb,  and  Bi  nuclei  it  only  is about 10**-3 -
            10**-2. results have been interpreted in terms of the
            primary levinger's        quasideuteron       nuclear
            photoabsorption followed   by    a    mechanism    of
            evaporation-fission competition   for   the   excited
            nuclei. Shell effects have been taken  into  account,
            and they  are  clearly  manifested  when fissility is
            evaluated. The influence of  photon  polarization  on
            photofission of U-238 also has been investigated, and
            results have shown isotropy in the fragment  azimutal
            distribution.
