INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     A 68.5 g cobalt target.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 400  mu thick Ilford L-4 emulsion.  A foil of
            lead screened the  plates  against  the  low  energy
            photons.
CORRECTION The correction factor is 1/(p1*p2*p3*sigma), where p1
            = probability that a neutron does not collide in the
            Co target,  p2 = probability that a neutron does not
            collide in the lead screen,  p3 = probability that a
            proton  track  ends in  the  emulsion, sigma = cross
            section for the neutron-proton collision.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
ADD-RES    (THEO,COMP) The  evaporation  theory  was used to fit
            the  experimental  spectrum  and  to  calculate  the
            evaporation spectra due to the (gamma,2n) process.
