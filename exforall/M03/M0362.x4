METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     In the B-11 experiment  a  sample  of  natural  boron
            (80.39% B-11,19.61% B-10) of 11.04 g/sm**2 thickness
            was used.  For B-10 measurements the enriched target
            (90.4 % B-10, 9.6% B-11) had thickness 5.69 g/sm**2.
ANALYSIS   A high efficiency neutron  detector  enables  one  to
            measure the photoneutron multiplicities directly. It
            then follows that the (g,xn) cross sections  can  be
            obtained   separately   by   means   of  statistical
            considerations. The moments method which was further
            developed  by Krueger was used.  in order to measure
            absolute cross sections the photon flux,  the photon
            energy  and  the  efficiency of the neutron detector
            have been calibrated.
ERR-ANALYS The statistical errors only. The absolute calibration
            error of the photon flux causes a  systematic  error
            of the measured cross sections of about 10%.

            method for statistical data consideration.
CORRECTION The cross sections obtained were corrected for isotope
            impurities and photoneutron absorption in the  sample
            (~ 5%).
COMMENT    Absolute (g,xn) cross sections for B-10 and B-11 were
            measured  up  to  35  MeV  using  quasimonoenergetic
            photon beam from positron  annihilation  in  flight.
            The  experimental  cross sections were compared with
            many-particle shell-model calculations and data from
            previous   bremsstrahlung   experiments.   The  B-11
            photoneutron cross section is discussed with respect
            to  the  possible  isospin  splitting.  A systematic
            review of the  photoneutron  cross  section  of  the
            p-shell  nuclei  integrated up to about 30 MeV seems
            to show a  strong  influence  of  the  alpha-cluster
            structure of the target nuclei.
