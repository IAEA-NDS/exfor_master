COMMENT    Evaluation  of  Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62,  Cu-63(g,np)Ni-61 and
            Cu-63(g,p)Ni-62 reaction  cross  sections  has   been
            carried out  by means of the method of joint analysis
            and evaluation  of  photonuclear  experiment  results
            obtained at   significant  systematic  uncertainties:
            apparatus function  differences   (effective   photon
            spectra), absolute     normalization    and    energy
            calibration uncertainties of individual  experiments.
            energy location of components with isospins T< = T0 =
            5/2 and T> = T0 + 1 = 7/2 has been interpreted on the
            basis of comparative analysis of energy dependance of
            Cu-63(g,p)Ni-62 and  Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62  reaction  cross
            sections.Iisospin   splitting  parameters  have  been
            determined by means of both reaction  cross  sections
            fitting using    appropriate    Gaussians.    Isospin
            splitting value was found to be delta E = ET> - ET< =
            U(T0 +  1)/T0  =  U0(T0 + 1)A = 4.8 (4) MeV.  Nuclear
            symmetry energy has been found to be equal  to  U0  =
            86.4 (7.2) MeV. The isospin component intensity ratio
            value of r = (1/sigma>)/(1/sigma> + 1/sigma<) =  0.37
            (2) has been obtained.

COMMENT    The evaluated Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62 reaction cross   section
            was obtained by using the method of reduction.
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) The method based on the method of reduction is
            proposed for  the  evaluation  of  the   photonuclear
            reaction cross   sections   have   been  obtained  at
            significant systematic    uncertainties    (different
            apparatus functions,  calibration  and  mormalization
            uncertainties).
           The main criterium used in  analysis was similarity of
            the generalized features of initial  cross  sections,
            such  as  integrated  cross  sections  and centres of
            gravity,  to their  weighted-mean  values.  the  main
            principle   used   for   analyzing  and  reducing  of
            systematic  discrepances  between  the   results   of
            different   experiments   was   some   transformation
            (recalibration -  correction  of  the scale in energy
            axis, renormalization - correcton  of  the  scale  in
            cross  section  axis)  of initial cross sections with
            that aim of forming the best agreement of generalized
            characteristics.
           Initial cross sections whose generalized features were
            too different  from  the  weighted-mean  values  (the
            systematic  errors  were  too high) were rejected and
            the entire procedure was repeated.
           The set  of cross section values  that  have satisfied
            all the selection criteria,  was used to evaluate the
            cross sections and their errors by means of reduction
            method.
