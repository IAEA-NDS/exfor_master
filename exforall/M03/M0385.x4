COMMENT    Evaluation  of  Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62,  Cu-63(g,np)Ni-61 and
            Cu-63(g,p)Ni-62 reaction  cross  sections  has   been
            carried out  by means of the method of joint analysis
            and evaluation  of  photonuclear  experiment  results
            obtained at   significant  systematic  uncertainties:
            apparatus function  differences   (effective   photon
            spectra), absolute     normalization    and    energy
            calibration uncertainties of individual  experiments.
            energy location of components with isospins T< = T09
            5/2 and T> = T0 + 1 = 7/2 has been interpreted on t0
            basis of comparative analysis of energy dependence of
            Cu-63(g,p)Ni-62 and  Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62  reaction  cross
            sections. Isospin   splitting  parameters  have  been
            determined by means of both reaction  cross  sections
            fitting using    appropriate    Gaussians.    Isospin
            splitting value was found to be delta E = ET> - ET<
            U(T0 +  1)/T0  =  U0(T0 + 1)A = 4.8 (4) MeV.  Nuclear
            symmetry energy has been found to be equal  to  U0  =
            86.4 (7.2) MeV. The isospin component intensity ratio
            value of r has been obtained.
