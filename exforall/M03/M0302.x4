TITLE      Photoneutrons from K and Ca.

FACILITY   (BETAT,2ITYTUR)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
INC-SPECT  The diameter of the gamma beam at the  place  of  the
            targets  was  35 mm.  The doses of gamma-irradiation
            were 3690 roentgen for Ca and 6027 roentgen for K.
SAMPLE     A cylinder  of natural Ca (hight = 20 mm,  diameter =
            29 mm,  weght = 19 g)  and  a  spherical  target  of
            natural K (diameter = 30 mm, weght = 12 g).
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford L4 emulsion (thickness = 400 mu,  area
            = 1 x 3 inches). The nuclear plates were screened by
            3 mm thick Pb foils against the low  energy  photons
            diffused by the target.
CORRECTION A) for the probability of  escape  of  recoil  proton
            tracks from the emulsion,
           B) for the neutron absorption in the target,  in  the
            window  of the vessel containing the K target and in
            Pb foils.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The evaporation theory was used.  The fraction
            of neutrons exceeding the theoretical values at high
            neutron energies is reported.
COMMENT    The spectra  show  that at least 50%  of the neutrons
            above 2 MeV are due to direct process.  For  Ca  and
            also  for  K a second resonance seems to exist about
            10 MeV above the threshold.  At 31 MeV  photoneutron
            yields  for Ca and K at angle = 90 degrees for E > 2
            MeV are about the same.

            of method by means of which the plates were  scanned
            and the proton recoil tracks were analysed.
