TITLE      PHOTONEUTRONS FROM K AND CA.

INC-SPECT  THE DIAMETER OF THE GAMMA BEAM AT THE PLACE OF THE
           TARGETS WAS 35 MM. THE DOSES OF G-IRRADIATION WERE
           3690 ROENTGEN FOR CA AND 6027 ROENTGEN FOR K.
SAMPLE     A CYLINDER OF NATURAL CA (HIGHT = 20 MM, DIAMETER = 29
           MM, WEGHT = 19 G) AND A SPHERICAL TARGET OF NATURAL K
            (DIAMETER = 30 MM, WEGHT = 12 G).
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE). ILFORD L4 EMULSION (THICKNESS = 400 MU, AREA=
           1*3 SQUARE INCHES). THE NUCLEAR PLATES WERE SCREENED
           BY 3 MM THICK PB FOILS AGAINST THE LOW ENERGY PHOTONS
           DIFFUSED BY THE TARGET.
CORRECTION A) FOR THE PROBABILITY OF ESCAPE OF RECOIL PROTON
           TRACKS FROM THE EMULSION, B) FOR THE NEUTRON ABSORP-
           TION IN THE TARGET, IN THE WINDOW OF THE VESSEL CON-
           TAINING THE K TARGET AND IN PB FOILS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
ADD-RES    (COMP). THE EVAPORATION THEORY WAS USED. THE FRACTION
           OF NEUTRONS EXCEEDING THE THEORETICAL VALUES AT HIGH
           NEUTRON ENERGIES IS REPORTED.
COMMENT    THE SPECTRA SHOW THAT AT LEAST 50%  OF THE NEUTRONS
            ABOVE 2 MEV ARE DUE TO DIRECT PROCESS.  FOR CA AND
            ALSO FOR K A SECOND RESONANCE SEEMS TO EXIST ABOUT
           10 MEV ABOVE THE THRESHOLD. AT 31 MEV PHOTONEUTRON
           YIELDS FOR CA AND K AT ANGLE = 90 DEGREES FOR E>2 MEV
           ARE ABOUT THE SAME.

           METHOD BY MEANS OF WHICH THE PLATES WERE SCANNED AND
           THE PROTON RECOIL TRACKS WERE ANALYSED.
           (N,,A.AGODI+,C,58PARIS,625,58). THE FIRST RESULTS ON
           THE ENERGY SPECTRUM OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM CA WERE RE-
