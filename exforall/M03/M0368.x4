            MeV.

FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR SAC)
INC-SOURCE (ARAD) Positron annihilation in flight.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Gd-loaded liquid scintillator.
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     The oxygen sample was in form of water, was 7 g/sm**2
            thick, and 8 sm in diameter.
ANALYSIS   The detection  process permits the measurement of the
            photoneutron  multiplicity  I  and   therefore   the
            simultaneous  and  independent  measurement  of each
            partial inclusive photoneutron cross  section  SIG-i
            for each value of Eg-i. The total photoneutron cross
            section SIG was obtained as a sum of the sig-i.
COMMENT    The inclusive  partial  photoneutron  cross  sections
            sig(g,1n),  sig(g,2n),  and the  total  photoneutron
            cross  section  sig(g,n-tot),  which is equal to the
            sum of the partial ones, for O-16 have been measured
            with  monoenergetic  photons  in  the  energy region
            above  the  giant  resonance  and  below  the  meson
            thresholds.  Comparison  with  other  data shows the
            dominance of  the  (g,pn)  process  in  this  energy
            region  and  thus  underscores the importance of the
            mechanism  of  photon  absorption  by  a  correlated
            proton-neutron pair in nucleus;  thus,  satisfactory
            agreement of modern versions  of  the  quasideuteron
            theory with the data has been obtained. The measured
            integrated total photoneutron cross  section  up  to
            140  MeV is 0.67 (0.07) TRK sum-rule units.  Because
            the  low  thresholds  the  following  reactions  can
            participate:  (g,n+p) - 23 MeV, (g,n+2p) - 30.5 MeV,
            (g,n+a) - 25.9 MeV,  (g,n+p+a) - 34.6 MeV in  (g,1n)
            reaction  cross  sections  and  (g,2n+p) - 33.5 mev,
            (g,2n+2p)  -  35.5   MeV,   (g,2n+a)   -   39   MeV,
            (g,2n+2p+3a)  -  42.8  MeV  in (g,2n) reaction cross
            sections and hence in their sum sig (g,n-tot).

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The   total   errors   which  include  the
            contributions of the  major  systematic  (ERR-1)  as
            well  as the statistical (ERR-S) uncertainties.  The
            principal systematic uncertainty is that  associated
            with   the  neutron-detector  efficiency.  The  data
            errors (error flags in the figures) result from the
            combination  in quadrature of the purely statistical
            uncertainties of  the  photoneutron  counting  rates
            (including  background  subtractions),  the  mostly
            statistical  uncertainties  related  to  the  photon
            beam,   and   the  mostly  systematic  uncertainties
            associated with the neutron-detector efficiency.
