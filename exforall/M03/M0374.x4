COMMENT    The published data for Cu-63,65 giant dipole resonance
            photodisintegration have been analyzed. The evaluated
            Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62 reaction cross section and  new  data
            for Cu-63,65(g,np)Ni-61,63  and Cu-63,65(g,p)Ni-62,64
            were obtained.  The   parameters   of   GDR   isospin
            splitting were  deduced:  Cu-63 GDR isospin splitting
            deltaE = E(T>) - E(T<) = U0(T0+1)/A = 3.6 (0.1)  MeV,
            Cu-65 -  5.8  (0.1) MeV;  nuclear symmetry energy for
            Cu-63 and  Cu-65:  64  (3)  MeV  and   85   (4)   MeV
            correspondingly; isospin  component  intensity  ratio
            values   r   =   (1/sigma(T>))  /   ((1/sigma(T>))  +
            (1/sigma(T<))) = (0.39 (0.01) and 0.10 (0.01)).

ANALYSIS   The new Cu-63((g,n) + (g,np)) reaction  cross  section
            was obtained   by   using   the  procedure  of  joint
            normalization  and  calibration  of  Fultz  ((g,n)  +
            (g,np))  and  Sund (g,n) reaction cross sections (see
            REL-REF). The  correction means new normalization and
            calibration of  initial  cross  sections  for  energy
            range  below  the  threshold of reaction (g,np) where
            both initial cross sections must be identical.

COMMENT    The evaluated Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62 reaction cross   section
            was obtained by using the method of reduction.
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) The method based on the method of reduction is
            proposed for  the  evaluation  of  the   photonuclear
            reaction cross   sections   have   been  obtained  at
            significant systematic    uncertainties    (different
            apparatus functions,  calibration  and  mormalization
            uncertainties).
           The main criterion used in  analysis was similarity of
            the generalized features of initial  cross  sections,
            such  as  integrated  cross  sections  and centers of
            gravity,  to their  weighted-mean  values.  The  main
            principle   used   for   analyzing  and  reducing  of
            systematic  discrepances  between  the   results   of
            different   experiments   was   some   transformation
            (recalibration -  correction  of  the scale in energy
            axis, renormalization - correcton  of  the  scale  in
            cross  section  axis)  of initial cross sections with
            aim  of  forming  the  best  agreement of generalized
            characteristics.
           Initial cross sections whose generalized features were
            too different  from  the  weighted-mean  values  (the
            systematic  errors  were  too high) were rejected and
            the entire procedure was repeated.
           The set  of cross section values  that  have satisfied
            all the selection criteria,  was used to evaluate the
            cross sections and their errors by means of reduction
            method.

REACTION   (29-CU-65(G,N+P)28-NI-63,,SIG,,,EVAL)
ANALYSIS   For the evaluation of  Cu-65(g,np)Ni-63 reaction cross
            section three facts were used:  the  (g,np)  reaction
            threshold value  is  egual to 17.1 MeV;  the ((g,n) +
            (g,np)) reaction cross  section  of  Fultz is   equal
            approximately  to 0 for energies higher that about 23
            MeV; the evaluated  in  this  work  (g,np)   reaction
            cross section  is  not  equal  to  0  only for energy
            region Eg = 17 - 23 MeV.  Therefore the  three  clear
            maxima in the ((g,p)+(g,np)) cross sections in energy
            ranges THR - 17 MeV,  17 - 23 MeV,  more than 23  MeV
            could be  imagined  as  resonances from the reactions
            (g,p), (g,np),  (g,p).  The separation of these three
            resonances was  obtained by fitting  (hi-2 = 2.39) of
            the ((g,p) + (g,np)) reaction cross  section  by  the
            sum of  three  corresponding gaussians.  The gaussian
            for the energy range 17 - 23 MeV was declared  to  be
            the evaluation of (g,np) reaction cross section.

REACTION   (29-CU-65(G,P)28-NI-64,,SIG,,,EVAL)
ANALYSIS   The new Cu-65(g,p)Ni-64 reaction  cross  section  was
            obtained by  subtraction procedure
                 sig(g,p) = sig((g,p)+(g,np)) - sig(g,np)
            of Cu-65(g,np)Ni-63  reaction cross section has been
            evaluated   in   this    work    from    that    for
            Cu-65((g,p) + (g,np)) reaction.
