TITLE      Energy spectrum of photoneutrons from gold.

SAMPLE     A gold  cylinder  of  diameter  1.232cm  and   height
            1.257cm.
METHOD     (REC)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 200 mum thick Ilford C-2 emulsion. The  plane
            of  each  emulsion was vertical and made an angle of
            5.degr.  to the line  joining  the  centres  of  the
            target and the emulsion.  Lead shields 0.32 cm thick
            were placed over each emulsion to screen it from low
            energy photons from the target.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for:
            (a) the shrinkage of the emulsion,
            (b)  the tracks which leave the emulsion,
            (c) the  attenuation  of neutrons in the gold target
            and the lead shield round the emulsion,
            (d) the   variation  of  the  n-p  scattering  cross
                section with neutron energy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
           (ERR-1) The error involved in  normalising  the  fast
            and slow scan, which is 7.5% .
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental spectrum is compared with the
            energy distribution calculated on the basis  of  the
            evaporation model.
           A  new method for the calculation of the  corrections
            involved  for  those  proton recoils which leave the
            emulsion is presented.
COMMENT    The spectrum shows two peaks.  The large peak at 1.25
            MeV can be interpreted as  due  to  the  statistical
            decay  of  the compound nucleus. The smaller peak at
            about 5.5 MeV is  assumed  to  came  from  a  direct
            transition, as described by the Wilkinson model.

            energy spectrum of direct neutrons
ANALYSIS   The data are difference between the experimental
            spectrum and the evaporation curve fitted to the low
            energy experimental data.
COMMENT    12.4%  of  the  neutrons  are  produced  by  a direct
            process.

ANALYSIS   For neutron energies greater than about 5 MeV this is
            simple  to   obtain  from  the   data,   since   the
            contribution  by  the  evaporated  neutrons  to  the
            spectrum  is small  at high energies.  The situation
            for  En < 5 MeV  is much  more difficult to resolve,
            however,  since  the fraction  of the neutrons which
            are produced  by the direct  process is  not  known.
            Also,  the shape of the statistical spectrum  may be
            in error,  even  though  it  appears to fit  the low
            energy data well.  Nevertheless, if this spectrum is
            assumed to be correct, then 20 % of the neutrons are
            found to be produced by a direct process.
