TITLE      ENERGY SPECTRUM OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM GOLD.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     A GOLD CYLINDER OF DIAMETER 1.232 CM AND HEIGHT 1.257
           CM.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE).200MU THICK ILFORD C-2 EMULSION. THE PLANE OF
           EACH EMULSION WAS VERTICAL AND MADE AN ANGLE OF 5
           DEGREES TO THE LINE JOINING THE CENTRES OF THE TARGET
           AND THE EMULSION. LEAD SHIELDS 0.32 CM THICK WERE
           PLACED OVER EACH EMULSION TO SCREEN IT FROM LOW ENERGY
           PHOTONS FROM THE TARGET.
CORRECTION THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR
            (A) THE SHRINKAGE OF THE EMULSION,
            (B) THE TRACKS WHICH LEAVE THE EMULSION,
            (C) THE ATTENUATION OF NEUTRONS IN THE GOLD TARGET AND
                THE LEAD SHIELD ROUND THE EMULSION,
            (D) THE VARIATION OF THE N-P SCATTERING CROSS SECTION
                WITH NEUTRON ENERGY.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED. (DO NOT
            INCLUDE THE ERROR INVOLVED IN NORMALISING THE FAST AND
            SLOW SCAN, WHICH IS 7.5%).
ADD-RES    (COMP).THE EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRUM IS COMPARED WITH THE
           ENERGY DISTRIBUTION CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE
           EVAPORATION MODEL.
            A NEW METHOD FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE CORRECTIONS
           INVOLVED FOR THOSE PROTON RECOILS WHICH LEAVE THE
           EMULSION IS PRESENTED.
COMMENT     THE SPECTRUM SHOWS TWO PEACKS.THE LARGE PEAK AT 1.25
           MEV CAN BE INTERPRETED AS DUE TO THE STATISTICAL DECAY
           OF THE COMPOUND NUCLEUS.THE SMALLER PEAK AT ABOUT 5.5
           MEV IS ASSUMED TO CAME FROM A DIRECT TRANSITION, AS
           DESCRIBED BY THE WILKINSON MODEL.
STATUS     (CURVE).DATA WERE COMPILED IN SCJAD OF SARATOV STATE
           UNIVERSITY.
