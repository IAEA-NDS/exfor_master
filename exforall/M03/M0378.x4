INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOK)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNTOK)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) ELECTRON TAGGED BREMSSTRAHLUNG.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) THE TAGX  SPECTROMETER  (PI SR SOLID ANGLE FOR
            PROTONS AND 0.85 SR FOR NEUTRONS).

METHOD     (COINC)
SAMPLE     CRYOGENIC HE-3 TARGET.
ANALYSIS   THE EVENTS WERE ANALYZED ON AN  EVENT-BY-EVENT  BASIS,
            AND MISSING MOMENTUM  WERE  RECONSTRUCTED  USING  THE
            PHOTON ENERGY  AND  FOUR-MOMENTA  OF THE TWO OBSERVED
            PARTICLES (PROTON AND NEUTRON) WHEN THE MISSING  MASS
            WAS CONSISTENT  WITH  THE PROTON MASS,  THE EVENT WAS
            IDENTIFIED AS BEING NPP FINAL STATE,  AND THE MISSING
            MOMENTUM WAS  REGARDERED TO BE THAT OF THE UNOBSERVED
            PROTON. THE FOURFOLD DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS WITH
            RESPECT TO  VARIABLES FOR A NEUTRON AND A PROTON WERE
            INTEGRATED WITH RESPECT TO THE  FOUR  VARIABLES  OVER
            THE ANGULAR-MOMENTUM RANGES (FOR OBSERVED PROTONS P =
            300 - 1000 MEV/C AND THETA-LAB = 15 - 165 DEGREE, FOR
            ONSERVED NEUTRONS P = 100 - 800, THETA-LAB = 18 - 162
            DEGREE, AND FOR UNOBSERVED PROTONS P = 0 - 1000 MEV/C
            AND THETA-LAB = 0 - 180 DEGREE).
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN ONLY.
COMMENT    THREE-BODY  HE-3  PHOTODISINTEGRATION  WAS MEASURED IN
            THE PHOTON ENERGY RANGE EG = 145 - 425 MEV. THE TOTAL
            CROSS SECTION  FOR  PHOTON ABSORPTION ON THE NP PAIRS
            IN HE-3, SIG(HE-3(G,NP)P-SPECTATOR), IS REPORTED HERE
            FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE EG-DEPENDENCE OF THR SIGMA IS
            FOUND TO SCALE TO THAT  OF  SIGMA  (HE-2(G,NP)),  AND
            THEIR RATIO IS DETERTMINED TO BE 1.24(0.26).
STATUS     (TABLE) THE DATA WERE PUBLISHED IN FORM OF TABLES.
