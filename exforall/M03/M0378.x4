METHOD     (COINC)
SAMPLE     Cryogenic He-3 target.
ANALYSIS   The events  were analyzed on an event-by-event basis,
            and missing momentum were  reconstructed  using  the
            photon  energy  and four-momenta of the two observed
            particles (proton and neutron) when the missing mass
            was  consistent with the proton mass,  the event was
            identified as being npp final state, and the missing
            momentum  was  regarded to be that of the unobserved
            proton.  The fourfold  differential  cross  sections
            with respect to variables for a neutron and a proton
            were integrated with respect to the  four  variables
            over   the  angular-momentum  ranges  (for  observed
            protons p = 300 - 1000 MeV/c and theta-lab  =  15  -
            165  degree,  for  observed  neutrons p = 100 - 800,
            theta-lab = 18 -  162  degree,  and  for  unobserved
            protons  p  = 0 - 1000 mev/c and theta-lab = 0 - 180
            degree).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are given.
COMMENT    Three-body He-3 photodisintegration was  measured  in
            the  photon  energy  range  Eg = 145 - 425 MeV.  The
            total cross section for photon absorption on the  np
            pairs   in   He-3,   sig(He-3(g,np)p-spectator),  is
            reported here for the first time.  The Eg-dependence
            of  the  sigma  is  found  to scale to that of sigma
            (He-2(g,np)),  and their ratio  is determined to  be
            1.24(0.26).
