SAMPLE     A 21 G WEIGHT SPHERICAL TARGET ENRICHED TO 95.77% IN
            IN-115.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE). 400 MU THICK NIKFI JA-2 EMULSIONS OF 5*3 CM**2
           SIZE.
CORRECTION THE NUMBER  OF OUTGOING NEUTRONS WAS CORRECTED FOR:
            (A) THE PROBABILITY OF ESCAPE OF RECOIL PROTON TRACKS
                FROM THE EMULSION;
            (B) THE VARIATION OF THE N-P SCATTERING CROSS
                SECTION WITH NEUTRON ENERGY;
            (C) THE BACKGROUND (THE RELATION OF THE BACKGROUND TO
                THE EFFECT WAS EQUAL TO 22%).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) AN UNCERTAINTY OF NEUTRON NUMBER INCLUDES A
            STATISTICAL ERROR  OF CORRECTION FOR PROBABILITY THAT
            PROTON TRACKS END OUTSIDE THE EMULSION AND AN
            UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINATION OF THE N-P SCATTERING
            CROSS SECTION.
ADD-RES    THE DEPENDENCE OF TRACK LENGTH ON RECOIL PROTON ENERGY
           WAS OBTAINED FOR NIKFI JA-2 EMULSION.
COMMENT    THE ENERGY  AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF PHOTONEUTRONS
           FROM IN-115  ARE OBTAINED AT 28 MEV END-POINT
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG ENERGY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF RESONANCE
           PHOTOEFFECT CAME OUT TO 45% WITH 10% ERROR. THE ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTONEUTRONS IN THE RANGE 1.0-11.0 MEV
           IS ANISOTROPIC.
