FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSFTI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     a 21 g weight spherical target enriched to 95.77%  in
            In-115.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 400 mu thick  nikfi  ja-2  emulsions  of  5*3
            cm**2 size.
CORRECTION the number  of outgoing neutrons was corrected for:
            (a) the  probability  of  escape  of  recoil  proton
                tracks from the emulsion;
            (b) the  variation  of  the  n-p  scattering   cross
                section with neutron energy;
            (c) the background (the relation of  the  background
                to the effect was equal to 22%).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An  uncertainty of neutron number includes
            a statistical error of  correction  for  probability
            that  proton  tracks end outside the emulsion and an
            uncertainty in determination of the  n-p  scattering
            cross section.
ADD-RES    The dependence  of  track  length  on  recoil  proton
            energy was obtained for NIKFI JA-2 emulsion.
COMMENT    The energy and angular distributions of photoneutrons
            from   In-115  are  obtained  at  28  MeV  end-point
            bremsstrahlung energy. The contribution of resonance
            photoeffect  came  out to 45%  with 10%  error. The
            angular distribution of photoneutrons in  the  range
            1.0-11.0 MeV is anisotropic.
