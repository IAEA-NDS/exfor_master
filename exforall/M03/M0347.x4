DETECTOR   (PLATE) The  100  mu  thick Ilford C-2 emulsions (1/2
            in. x 1 in.) were used.
METHOD     (REC) Photoparticles recoiled in nuclear emulsions.
ERR-ANALYS No information about sources of data uncertainties.
CORRECTION The energy spectrum was corrected for the probability
            that deuteron tracks end outside the emulsion.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The evaporation model was used.
COMMENT    It was  noted  that  the  large  number  of  observed
            deuterons  cannot be explained within the evaporation
            model.
