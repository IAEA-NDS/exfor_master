METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
MONITOR    (8-O-16(G,P)7-N-15,PAR,SIG,G)  The integrated cross
            section for the de-excitation  g-quanta  from the
            third excited state of the final nucleus N-15.
ANALYSIS   The spectrum  of the  de-excitation  photons  has been
            measured.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean root-square errors are given.
COMMENT    The integrated cross sections for various channels  of
            Ni-58 photodisintegration have been obtained from the
            experimental spectrum of the de-excitation photons by
            the  comparison  with  the  data  for  well   studied
            reaction O-16(g,p-3).  the  integrated  cross section
            values have  been  obtained  for  isotropic   angular
            distributions.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data were published in form of tables.
