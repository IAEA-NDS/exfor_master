COMMENT    MEAN ENERGIES AND MULTIPLICITIES OF PHOTONEUTRONS FROM
            SOME MEDIUM  AND  HEAVY  NUCLEI  WERE  MEASURED  AS A
            FUNCTION  OF  END-POINT   BREMSSTRAHLUNG  ENERGY. THE
            NUCLEAR  TEMPERATURES  AND  LEVEL DENSITY  PARAMETERS
            WERE FOUND.
ADD-RES    (COMP).THE STATISTICAL THEORY OF NUCLEAR REACTIONS WAS
            USED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS OF MEASUREMENTS.
STATUS     (APRVD) BY A.M.GORYACHEV.
HISTORY    (911005C).DATA WERE COMPILED IN SCJAD OF SARATOV STATE
