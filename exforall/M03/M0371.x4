ANALYSIS   The (gamma,np)  reaction  cross  section  evaluation
            using the subtraction procedure:  sig(gamma,np) =
            sig((gamma,n) + (gamma,np))  -  sig(gamma,n)  for
            corrected  initial cross sections published
            by Fultz and Sund.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean root-square errors are given.
STATUS     (TABLE,APRVD) by V.V.Varlamov.
COMMENT    The  comparison of  the various photonuclear  reaction
            cross section  data for  Cu-63,nat  published earlier
            and the detailed analysis of conditions in which they
            have  been obtained was carried out.  To overcome the
            disagreements between the results of various  authors
            the   new   initial  data  mormalization  and  energy
            calibration procedures were proposed  for  difference
            method of Cu-63(gamma,np)   reaction   cross  section
            determination.  The data obtained for  this  reaction
            were  used  for  evaluation of new cross section data
            for Cu-65,nat (gamma,np) reactions.

REACTION   (29-CU-63(G,N+P)28-NI-61,,SIG,,,EVAL)
ANALYSIS   This Cu-63(gamma,np)Ni-61 reaction  cross section was
            obtained by Sund (see REL-REF) using the  subtraction
            of Cu-63(gamma,n)Cu-62 reaction cross section obtained
            by him using activation method from that for
            Cu-63((gamma,n) +  (gamma,np))  reaction  obtained by
            Fultz (see REL-REF) using direct method of measurement
            of  multiplicities on the beam of quasimonoenergetical
            photons obtained by positron annihilation of fast
            positrons in flight.
COMMENT    This is cross section data published  by  R.E.Sund  in
            Phys.Rev.,176,1366,68, which are absent in
            appropriate EXFOR Entry L0013.
