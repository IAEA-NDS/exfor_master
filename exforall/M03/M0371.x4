ANALYSIS   The (gamma,np)  reaction  cross  section  evaluation
            using the subtraction procedure:  sig(gamma,np) =
            sig((gamma,n) + (gamma,np))  -  sig(gamma,n)  for
            corrected  initial cross sections published
            by Fultz and Sund.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean root-square errors are given.

COMMENT    The  comparison of  the various photonuclear  reaction
            cross section  data for  Cu-63,nat  published earlier
            and the detailed analysis of conditions in which they
            have  been obtained was carried out.  To overcome the
            disagreements between the results of various  authors
            the   new   initial  data  mormalization  and  energy
            calibration procedures were proposed  for  difference
            method of Cu-63(gamma,np)   reaction   cross  section
            determination.  The data obtained for  this  reaction
            were  used  for  evaluation of new cross section data
            for Cu-65,nat (gamma,np) reactions.
