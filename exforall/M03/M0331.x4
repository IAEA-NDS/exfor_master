TITLE      Energy distribution of fast photoneutrons from lead.
AUTHOR     (H.Breuer)
REFERENCE  (J,ZN/A,17,584,1962) in German
INSTITUTE  (2GERGER) Max-Plank-Institut      fuer     Biophysik,
            Frankfurt.
FACILITY   (BETAT,2GERGER) The   pulse   length   at   32.5  MeV
            end-point energy was 300-400 microsec. The frequency
            was 50 pulses per second.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The diameter of the gamma beam at the place of
            the sample was equal to 5 cm. The intensity of gamma
            irradiation  at  the  distance  of  1  m  from   the
            bremsstrahlung target was 300 erg/(cm2*sec).
SAMPLE     The disk of lead (thickness = 8 mm,  diameter = 5 cm)
            was oriented at 45 degrees to the beam direction.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2 mm thick Li-I crystal of  1*1/2  in**2  size
            screened by 12 mm thick lead shield.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for:
            (a) the cross section of Li-6(n,alpha) reaction;
            (b) the nonelastic scattering of neutrons within the
                target and the lead screen;
            (c) the scattering of neutrons within the quartz ligh
                conductor;
            (d) the background.
           The neutron  scattering  on the walls of detector and
            elastic scattering of neutrons within the target and
            the screen were negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No    information    about    source    of
            uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (THEO) Statistical model calculations of photoneutron
            spectra were made for some values  of  level-density
            parameter and nuclear temperature.
           (COMP) Experimental   data   were    compared    with
            predictions  of  evaporation  theory and Wilkinson's
            model of direct photoeffect.
COMMENT    The fraction of direct photoneutrons was equal to 11%.
