TITLE      ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF FAST PHOTONEUTRONS FROM LEAD.
AUTHOR     (H.BREUER)
INSTITUTE  (2GERGER).MAX-PLANK-INSTITUT FUER BIOPHYSIK, FRANKFURT
           A.M.
REFERENCE  (J,ZN/A,17,584,1962)
FACILITY   (BETAT). THE PULSE LENGTH AT 32.5 MEV END-POINT ENERGY
            WAS 300-400 MICROSEC. THE FREQUENCY WAS 50 PULSES PER
            SECOND.
INC-SOURCE (BRST). THE DIAMETER OF THE GAMMA BEAM AT THE PLACE OF
            THE SAMPLE WAS EQUAL TO 5 CM.  THE INTENSITY OF GAMMA
            IRRADIATION AT THE DISTANCE OF 1 M FROM THE
            BREMSSTRAHLUNG TARGET WAS 300 ERG/(CM**2*SEC).
SAMPLE     THE DISK OF LEAD (THICKNESS=8 MM, DIAMETER=5CM) WAS
            ORIENTED AT 45 DEGREES TO THE BEAM DIRECTION.
METHOD     (EXTB)
PART-DET   (A) ASSOCIATED ALPHAS FROM LI-6(N,A) REACTION.
DETECTOR   (SCIN). 2 MM THICK LI-I CRYSTAL OF 1*1/2 IN**2 SIZE
            SCREENED BY 12 MM THICK LEAD SHIELD.
CORRECTION THE DATA  WERE CORRECTED FOR:
            (A) THE CROSS SECTION OF LI-6(N,A) REACTION;
            (B) THE NONELASTIC SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS WITHIN THE
                TARGET AND THE LEAD SCREEN;
            (C) THE SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS WITHIN THE QUARTZ LIGH
                CONDUCTOR;
            (D) THE BACKGROUND.
           THE NEUTRON SCATTERING ON THE WALLS OF DETECTOR AND
            ELASTIC SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS WITHIN THE TARGET AND
            THE SCREEN WERE NEGLIGIBLE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
ADD-RES    (THEO). STATISTICAL MODEL CALCULATIONS OF PHOTONEUTRON
            SPECTRA WERE MADE FOR SOME VALUES OF LEVEL-DENSITY
            PARAMETER AND NUCLEAR TEMPERATURE.
           (COMP). EXPERIMENTAL DATA WERE COMPARED WITH
            PREDICTIONS OF EVAPORATION THEORY AND WILKINSON'S
            MODEL OF DIRECT PHOTOEFFECT.
COMMENT    THE FRACTION OF DIRECT PHOTONEUTRONS WAS EQUAL TO 11%.
