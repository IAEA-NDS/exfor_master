SAMPLE     A 1.247 g truncated lead sphere was 5 mm thick in the
            direction of the beam.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 200 mu thick Ilford E-1 nuclear emulsions.
CORRECTION The number  of  photoneutrons in each energy interval
            was  obtained  by  taking  into  account:
            1) the  probability  of  producing acceptable recoil
            protons in the volume of  emulsion  examined,  which
            included  (A) the number of hydrogen nuclei per unit
            of volume of nuclear emulsion,  (B)  the  amount  of
            neutron   path   length   in  the  volume,  (C)  the
            neutron-proton scattering  cross  section,  (D)  the
            fraction of recoil lying within acceptable angles;
            2) the absorption of  neutrons  by  the  target  and
            along their paths through the plates.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The   energy  distributions  of  neutrons  are
            compared with the evaporation theory.
           (TRCS) A  yield curve for the photoneutrons from lead
            was obtained using neutron counters in paraffin  and
            was normalized at 23 MeV to the yield observed using
            nuclear emulsion.  The cross section curve for  lead
            was  derived  from  the yield curve and X-ray energy
            spectrum by means of the photon difference method.

ANALYSIS   The energy  distribution  of  the  photoneutrons  was
            obtained  by (1) summing the neutrons in each energy
            interval over the angles 30,  50,  70,  90, 110, 130
            and  150  degrees,  (2) dividing the neutron sums by
            the sum of the fractional solid angles, (3) dividing
            by  the  number of moles of target irradiated by the
            beam and (4) dividing by the exposure in  roentgens,
            corrected  for the effective absorption of x-rays by
            the target.
COMMENT    Arbitrary unit =
            10**6* neutron/(0.5*MeV*mole*roentgen).
            The yield,    in    units    10**7    neutrons   per
            mole-roentgen,  was 1.4 with the error of  0.2.  The
            calculated   energy   distribution   which   gave  a
            satisfactory   correspondence   to   the    observed
            photoneutrons  consisted  of 90%  evaporation from a
            compound nucleus and 10%  emission by the  resonance
            direct effect.
