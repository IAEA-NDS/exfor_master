TITLE      PHOTONEUTRONS FROM LEAD.

SAMPLE     A 1.247 G TRUNCATED LEAD SPHERE WAS 5 MM THICK IN THE
           DIRECTION OF THE BEAM.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE). 200 MU THICK ILFORD E-1 NUCLEAR EMULSIONS.
CORRECTION THE NUMBER OF PHOTONEUTRONS IN EACH ENERGY INTERVAL
           WAS OBTAINED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
            1) THE PROBABILITY OF PRODUCING ACCEPTABLE RECOIL
           PROTONS IN THE VOLUME OF EMULSION EXAMINED, WHICH
           INCLUDED (A) THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN NUCLEI PER UNIT OF
           VOLUME OF NUCLEAR EMULSION, (B) THE AMOUNT OF NEUTRON
           PATH LENGTH IN THE VOLUME, (C) THE NEUTRON-PROTON
           SCATTERING CROSS SECTION, (D) THE FRACTION OF RECOIL
           LYING WITHIN ACCEPTABLE ANGLES ;
            2) THE ABSORPTION OF NEUTRONS BY THE TARGET AND ALONG
           THEIR PATHS THROUGH THE PLATES.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
ADD-RES    (COMP). THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS OF NEUTRONS ARE
           COMPARED WITH THE EVAPORATION THEORY.
           (TRCS). A YIELD CURVE FOR THE PHOTONEUTRONS FROM LEAD
           WAS OBTAINED USING NEUTRON COUNTERS IN PARAFFIN AND
           WAS NORMALIZED AT 23 MEV TO THE YIELD OBSERVED USING
           NUCLEAR EMULSION. THE CROSS-SECTION CURVE FOR LEAD WAS
           DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE AND X-RAY ENERGY SPECTRUM
           BY MEANS OF THE PHOTON DIFFERENCE METHOD.
STATUS     (CURVE). DATA WERE COMPILED IN SCJAD OF SARATOV STATE
           UNIVERSITY.

ANALYSIS   THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF THE PHOTONEUTRONS
           WAS OBTAINED BY (1) SUMMING THE NEUTRONS IN EACH ENERGY
           INTERVAL OVER THE ANGLES 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130 AND
           150 DEGREES, (2) DIVIDING THE NEUTRON SUMS BY THE SUM
           OF THE FRACTIONAL SOLID ANGLES, (3) DIVIDING BY
           THE NUMBER OF MOLES OF TARGET IRRADIATED BY THE BEAM
           AND (4) DIVIDING BY THE EXPOSURE IN ROENTGENS,
           CORRECTED FOR THE EFFECTIVE ABSORPTION OF X-RAYS BY
           THE TARGET.
COMMENT    ARBITRARY UNIT=10**6 * NEUTRON/(0.5*MEV*MOLE*ROENTGEN).
           THE YIELD, IN UNITS 10**7 NEUTRONS PER MOLE-ROENTGEN,
           WAS 1.4 WITH THE ERROR OF 0.2 .
           THE CALCULATED ENERGY DISTRIBUTION WHICH GAVE A SATIS-
           FACTORY CORRESPONDENCE TO THE OBSERVED PHOTONEUTRONS
           CONSISTED OF 90% EVAPORATION FROM A COMPOUND NUCLEUS
           AND 10% EMISSION BY THE RESONANCE DIRECT EFFECT.
