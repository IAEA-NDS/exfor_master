TITLE      Time-of-flight measurement of photoneutron energy
            spectra.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
INC-SPECT  The neutron energy resolution is roughly 3%at 2 MeV
            and 6% at 9 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF,REC) Flight path = 7m.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
ANALYSIS   The data are normalized  so as to yield equal numbers
            of  photoneutrons  from   d(gamma,n)  reaction  with
            energies E > 1.4 MeV for each bremsstrahlung energy.
            The data are also normalized per atom.
HISTORY    (19881227C) Data were compiled in SCJAD of Saratov
           State University.
           (19910202A) Corrected by V.Varlamov, V.Mclane.
           (19981116A) Corrected by V.Varlamov: SF5 PAR  deleted
            from reaction of Subents 004, 007, 010.
           (20190521A) Corrected  by SD  and  VV:  PART-DET  and
            ADD-RES deleted, SUBENTs 002 - 010 deleted  because
            no  relevant to EXFOR, lowercase.
