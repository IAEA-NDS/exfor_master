INC-SOURCE (TAGD)   The  bremsstrahlung monochromator  identifies
            photon energies by determining  the  energies  of  an
           electron  before  and  after it emits a bremsstrahlung
           gamma-ray.
SAMPLE     The 3/8-in.thick plate of Bi-209 was used as a target.
            The normal to the sample made an  angle  of  50  deg.
            with respect to the incoming beam.
METHOD     (COINC)  For identification of photon energy.
           (TOF,PHD)  For determination of neutron energy.
           (MAGFR)  For determination of the energy of secondary
            electron.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  For both kinds of particles detected.
            The neutron detector consisted of a cylindrical pyrex
            container, 6 in. In diameter and 3 in.deep, which was
            filled with NE 213 liquid scintillator.  The detector
            was placed at 150 cm from the target at 115 deg. with
            respect to the  gamma  beam  and  was  shielded  from
            gamma-rays on the front face by 1-in. thick screen of
            lead.  The secondary electrons  were  detected  by  a
            3-in.-wide  *  1.62-in.-hight  *  2-in.-thick pilot B
            plastic scintillator.
ANALYSIS   To obtain a discrete probability the data were reduced
            to the  probability  dp(E,Eg)  that  an   interacting
            photon  of  energy  Eg  will produce a neutron in the
            energy range between  E  and  E+dE  by  dividing  the
            number  of observed neutrons by a factor proportional
            to the number of absorbed gamma-rays given by product
            of the measured number of incident gamma-rays and the
            photon-absorption   cross   section.    A    discrete
            probability  was  defined  as an integral of dp(E,Eg)
            over  the  energy  interval  of  fixed  width  around
            discrete value of neutron energy or excitation energy
            in the residual nucleus into which  the  experimental
            data were grouped.

           (E-ERR)     Half  of  energy  range   into  which  the
            experimental  data  were
            grouped.
EN-SEC     (E-EXC,83-BI-208)     The  excitation  energy  of  the
            residual nucleus.
ADD-RES    (COMP)   Statistical  model  and the simplest model of
            nonstatistical emission  which treats the complicated
            giant resonance as though it is  a  simple  resonance
            associated  with  a  single  dipole  state were used.
           (LD)  The energy dependence of the level  density  of
            Bi- 208 was obtained.
COMMENT    Spectra  of  photoneutrons  from  a Bi-209 target were
            obtained in   the  electric  dipole  giant  resonance
            region (12-16 MeV).  About 88%  of  the  neutrons
            ejected  by  14-MeV  gamma-rays are statistical.  The
            inferred level density  of  Bi-208  near  its  ground
            state is  not a simple function of excitation energy,
            but from 4 to 7 MeV it increases  exponentially  with
            energy. In that energy range the temperature is about
            1 MeV.  The nonstatistical high-energy neutrons leave
            the  Bi-208  nucleus  at  the  excitation energies at
            which   the   states   are   well   represented    as
            single-neutrons  holes  in Bi-209.  these high-energy
            neutrons are  intimately  connected  with  the  giant
            resonance.  If  the giant resonance is dominated by a
            single dipole  state,  the   absolute   width   which
            characterizes the  decay of the dipole state into the
            compound nucleus must increase by a factor of about 3
            between 12 and 16 MeV.
