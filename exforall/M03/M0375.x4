INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) Electron tagged bremsstrahlung.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillator.
METHOD     (EDE) Each spectrometer consisted of 2 thin de-layers
            consisting of 1 mm thick  plastic  scintillator,  in
            front of 50 mm thick NaI(Tl) detector.
SAMPLE     A natural graphite target of thickness  196  mg/cm**2
            was  positioned  at  45  degree  with respect to the
            beam.
ANALYSIS   Photoproton energy  spectra  were  measured using the
            pulse-height  information  from  EdE-detectors.  The
            information   was   converted  into  missing  energy
            spectra  E(m).  Differential  cross  sections   were
            deduced  by  integrating  over the first peak in the
            E(m) spectra.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-root-square uncertainties  presented.
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainties are estimated  to be
            10%.
COMMENT    The 12C(g,p0+1)11B  differential  cross  section  has
            been  measured  for tagged-photon energies of E(g) =
            44 - 98 MeV at laboratory angles of 30,  45, 65, and
            90  degrees.  Comparison  has  been  made  with four
            different types of calculation. Results from similar
            calculations  for the photoneutron channel have been
            compared  to  previously  published   12C(g,n0+1)11C
            data.
