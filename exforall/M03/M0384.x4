SAMPLE     Cryogenic He-4 target.
ANALYSIS   Each of the events  includes two charged particles and
            one neutral particle.  The events were analyzed on an
            event-by-event basis to obtain the  momentum  vectors
            and masses  of  the  particles.  The missing mass and
            momentum on the nppx-type event,  where x  represents
            an unobserved  particle,  were calculated from the Eg
            and the reconstructed four-momentum of  the  detected
            particles.  When the missing mass was consistent with
            a neutron,  the event  was  classified  as  the  nnpp
            channel  and  the  missing momentum was attributed to
            the neutron.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
COMMENT    This is the  first  measurement  of  the  total  cross
            section of  the  He-4(g,npp)n  reaction in the energy
            range of 135 -  455  MeV.  The  cross  section  which
            cannot  be  reproduced  by  any   model,  has similar
            Eg-dependence to cross section of the process  (He-4)
            + g  ->  all  channels.  The  average  ratio of cross
            sections of two kinds mentioned  above  is  equal  to
            2.3 (0.3) %   and  is  compared  with   cascade-model
            calculation in  which  quasi-free   pion   production
            followed by pion reabsorption is assumed.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data were published in form of table.
