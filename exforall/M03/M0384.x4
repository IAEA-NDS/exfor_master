INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOK)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNTOK)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) ELECTRON TAGGED BREMSSTRAHLUNG.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) THE TAGX MULTIPARTICLE SPECTROMETER (PI SR
            SOLID ANGLE FOR PROTONS AND 0.85 SR FOR NEUTRONS).

METHOD     (COINC)
SAMPLE     CRYOGENIC HE-4 TARGET.
ANALYSIS   EACH OF THE EVENTS  INCLUDES TWO CHARGED PARTICLES AND
            ONE NEUTRAL PARTICLE.  THE EVENTS WERE ANALYZED ON AN
            EVENT-BY-EVENT BASIS TO OBTAIN THE  MOMENTUM  VECTORS
            AND MASSES  OF  THE  PARTICLES.  THE MISSING MASS AND
            MOMENTUM ON THE NPPX-TYPE EVENT,  WHERE X  REPRESENTS
            AN UNOBSERVED  PARTICLE,  WERE CALCULATED FROM THE EG
            AND THE RECONSTRUCTED FOUR-MOMENTA  OF  THE  DETECTED
            PARTICLES.  WHEN THE MISSING MASS WAS CONSISTENT WITH
            A NEUTRON,  THE EVENT  WAS  CLASSIFIED  AS  THE  NNPP
            CHANNEL  AND  THE  MISSING MOMENTUM WAS ATTRIBUTED TO
            THE NEUTRON.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN ONLY.
COMMENT    THIS IS THE  FIRST  MEASUREMENT  OF  THE  TOTAL  CROSS
            SECTION OF  THE  HE-4(G,NPP)N  REACTION IN THE ENERGY
            RANGE OF 135 -  455  MEV.  THE  CROSS  SECTION  WHICH
            CANNOT  BE  REPRODUCED  BY  ANY  MODEL ,  HAS SIMILAR
            EG-DEPENDANCE TO CROSS SECTION OF THE PROCESS  (HE-4)
            + G  ->  ALL  CHANNELS.  THE  AVERAGE  RATIO OF CROSS
            SECTIONS OF TWO KINDS MENTIONED  ABOVE  IS  EGUAL  TO
            2.3 (0.3)   %  AND  IS  COMPARED  WITH  CASCADE-MODEL
            CALCULATION IN  WHICH  QUASI-FREE   PION   PRODUCTION
            FOLLOWED BY PION REABSORPTION IS ASSUMED.
