TITLE      Fast-photoneutron spectra due to 55-85-MeV photons.

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USARPI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST). A 0.010-in.-thick tantalum foil was used.
SAMPLE     Solid samples were circular disks of 3/4 in. or 1 in.
            diam.  oriented so that the disk axis coincided with
            the photon beam axis.  Disk thicknesses were 1/8 in.
            or 3/16 in.  for heavier nuclei (z>20) and between 1
            and 2 2 in.  for lighter elements.  Water and liquid
            nitrogen in thin-walled  aluminium  containers  were
            used  as  the  samples for the studies of oxygen and
            nitrogen.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight  path  =  100  m,  time resolution = 0.4
            ns/m.
DETECTOR   (STANK).Liquid scintillator   tank   of   5   in.  in
            thickness and 20 in.  in diameter  viewed  by  seven
            Philips 58 AVP photomultipliers was used.
CORRECTION Energy spectra were corrected for:
             (a) the photon attenuation in the samples,
             (b) the scattering of the outgoing neutrons in the
                 samples,
             (c) the detector efficiency.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The quasideuteron model was used.
COMMENT    Energy spectra of fast  photoneutrons  from  eighteen
            elements were measured.  Measurements of the spectra
            from each target at bremsstrahlung energies of  both
            55  and  85  MeV  permitted  extraction  of  neutron
            difference  spectra  effectively  due   to   photons
            between 55 and 85 MeV.
           Difference spectra were obtained for neutron energies
            greater  than  10  MeV.  The  experimental data were
            compared to the  predictions  of  the  quasideuteron
            model  with  secondary-neutron  effects estimated by
            Monte  Carlo  calculations.   Good   agreement   was
            obtained  for  the absolute-neutron-production cross
            sections  and  the  shapes  of  the  neutron  energy
            spectra over the range of targets studied.

ANALYSIS   The neutron   spectra   obtained   at  bremsstrahlung
            endpoint energies of 55 and 85 MeV  were  normalized
            for  equal numbers of photons at the giant-resonance
            peak energy.  The neutron  difference  spectrum  was
            calculated by means of subtraction of 55-MeV neutron
            spectrum from 85 MeV  neutron  spectrum. The  photon
            difference spectrum was calculated as the difference
            between 85- and 55-MeV bremsstrahlung  spectra.  The
