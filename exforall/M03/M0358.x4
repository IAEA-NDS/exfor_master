            from Li-7.

            University.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     (3-LI-7,ENR=0.925)  The target of natural lithium was
            a cylinder of  5.4 cm  diameter  and  11.9 cm  long.
            It  was sealed  in a thin  (1 mm  thick)  plexiglass
            container  with  the  front  walls  in  thin  mylar.
            The  target axis was parallel  to the gamma ray beam
            direction, and its diameter was greater than that of
            the beam.
METHOD     (REC) The  energy  distribution  of the photoneutrons
            was deduces from the recoil spectrum of a-particles,
            corrected  for   geometric  losses  and  the  energy
            dependence of the  (n,4He)  elastic scattering cross
            section.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (TRD) The  diffusion cloud chamber filled with helium
            at 2.4 absolute atmosphere pressure.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors of measurement.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The theoretical polarization values were found
            within  the  single  particle shell model in the j-j
            and l-s coupling schemes.

ANALYSIS   The energy  distribution  of  the  photoneutrons  was
            deduced from the recoil spectrum of alpha-particles.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for:
            a - the geometric losses;
            b - the  energy  dependence  of  the  (n,a) elastic
            scattering cross section.

ANALYSIS   The data were obtained using the  maximum  likelihood
            method.
CORRECTION The polarization was corrected for  the asymmetry  of
            apparatus.
COMMENT    To eliminate a possible asymmetry  of  apparatus  the
            polarization of neutrons coming from a Rad-Be source
            was measured.  The presented data are equal  to  the
            difference between the value of the polarization due
            to photoneutrons coming  from  Li-7  and  the  value
            obtained from the source.
