SAMPLE     THE TARGET OF NATURAL LITHIUM WAS A CYLINDER OF 5.4 CM
           DIAMETER AND 11.9 CM LONG. IT WAS  SEALED IN A THIN (1
           MM THICK) PLEXIGLASS CONTAINER WITH THE FRONT WALLS IN
           THIN MYLAR. THE TARGET AXIS WAS PARALLEL TO THE GAMMA-
           RAY BEAM DIRECTION, AND ITS  DIAMETER WAS GREATER THAN
           THAT OF THE BEAM.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (TRD). THE DIFFUSION CLOUD CHAMBER FILLED WITH  HELIUM
           AT 2.4 ABSOLUTE ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL  ERRORS OF MEASUREMENT.
           (E-ERR) HALF OF RANGE OF EXPERIMENTAL HISTOGRAM.
           (ANG-ERR) THE UNCERTAINTY OF ANGLE MEASUREMENT.
ADD-RES    (THEO). THE THEORETICAL POLARIZATION VALUES WERE FOUND
           WITHIN THE SINGLE  PARTICLE SHELL MODEL IN THE J-J AND
           L-S COUPLING SCHEMES.

ANALYSIS   THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF THE PHOTONEUTRONS WAS DEDU-
           CED FROM THE RECOIL SPECTRUM OF ALPHA-PARTICLES.
CORRECTION THE DATA WERE  CORRECTED FOR (A) THE GEOMETRIC LOSSES;
            (B) THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE (N,A) ELASTIC SCATTE
           RING CROSS SECTION.

ANALYSIS   THE DATA WERE OBTAINED WITH THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ME-
           THOD.
CORRECTION THE POLARIZATION WAS CORRECTED FOR THE ASYMETRY OF AP-
           PARATUS.
COMMENT    TO ELIMINATE A POSSIBLE  ASYMETRY OF APPARATUS THE PO-
           LARIZATION OF NEUTRONS COMING  FROM RA D-BE SOURCE WAS
           MEASURED. THE PRESENTED DATA ARE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERE-
           NCE BETWEEN THE VALUE  OF THE POLARIZATION DUE TO PHO-
           TONEUTRONS COMING FROM LI-7 AND THE VALUE OBTAINED FR-
           OM THE SOURCE.
