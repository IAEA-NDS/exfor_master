INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) Electron tagged bremsstrahlung.
DETECTOR   (TRD) The  Saskatchewan  -  Alberta  Large Acceptance
            Detector (SALAD) consits from three cylindrical wire
            chambers    and   24   EdE   plastic   scintillators
            surrounding the wire chambers.

SAMPLE     The target was a  cylinder  of  0.036  cm  aluminized
            mylar  containing  He-3  gas  at  255  kPa  and room
            temperature.  The 60 cm long cylinder was 10  cm  in
            diameter.
ANALYSIS   The direct registration  of  protons  in  coincidence
            with deuterons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical uncertainty and
            angular-dependent errors in the calculated detection
            efficiency.
           The systematic errors  were estimated to be ~ 9.9 %:
           (ERR-1) absolute tracking efficiency - 9.5%;
           (ERR-2) photon flux - 2%;
           (ERR-3) target density - 2%.
COMMENT    the reaction   cross   section  He-3(g,pd)  has  been
            measured  using   the   Saskatchewan-Alberta   Large
            Acceptance  Detector  (SALAD) with tagged photons in
            the energy range Eg = 166 - 213 MeV.  The energy and
            angle  of  the proton and the deuteron were measured
            with SALAD while the tagger  determined  the  photon
            energy.   differential   cross  sections  have  been
            determined for  theta-p  =  40  -  150  degree.  The
            results  are  in  agreement with the Bonn and Saclay
            photodisintegration measurements.  The  most  recent
            photodisintegration  measurement  performed at Bates
            is higher by a factor of 1.3,  which is just  within
            the  combined errors of the experiments.  The proton
            capture results differ by a factor of 1.7  from  the
            present   experiment.   Comparisons  are  made  with
            microscopic calculations of the cross sections.
