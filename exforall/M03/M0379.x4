DETECTOR   (TRD)  THE SASKATCHEWAN - ALBERTA  LARGE   ACCEPTANCE
            DETECTOR (SALAD)  CONSITS FROM THREE CYLINDRICAL WIRE
            CHAMBERS AND 24 EDE PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS SURROUNDING
            THE WIRE CHAMBERS.

METHOD     (EDE) PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A CYLINDER OF 0.036 CM ALUMINIZED MYLAR
            CONTAINING HE-3 GAS AT 255 KPA AND ROOM  TEMPERATURE.
            THE 60 CM LONG CYLINDER WAS 10 CM IN DIAMETER.
ANALYSIS   THE DIRECT REGISTRATION OF PROTONS IN COINCIDENCE WITH
            DEUTERONS.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS  ARE GIVEN ONLY, THE SYSTEMATIC
            ONES WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 9.9 %.
COMMENT    THE  REACTION  CROSS  SECTION   HE-3(G,PD)  HAS   BEEN
            MEASURED USING    THE    SASKATCHEWAN-ALBERTA   LARGE
            ACCEPTANCE DETECTOR (SALAD) WITH  TAGGED  PHOTONS  IN
            THE ENERGY  RANGE EG = 166 - 213 MEV.  THE ENERGY AND
            ANGLE OF THE PROTON AND THE  DEUTERON  WERE  MEASURED
            WITH SALAD  WHILE  THE  TAGGER  DETERMINED THE PHOTON
            ENERGY. DIFFERENTIAL   CROSS   SECTIONS   HAVE   BEEN
            DETERMINED FOR THETA-P = 40 - 150 DEGREE. THE RESULTS
            ARE IN   AGREEMENT   WITH   THE   BONN   AND   SACLAY
            PHOTODISINTEGRATION MEASUREMENTS.   THE  MOST  RECENT
            PHOTODISINTEGRATION MEASUREMENT PERFORMED AT BATES IS
            HIGHER BY  A FACTOR OF 1.3,  WHICH IS JUST WITHIN THE
            COMBINED ERRORS  OF  THE  EXPERIMENTS.   THE   PROTON
            CAPTURE RESULTS  DIFFER  BY  A FACTOR OF 1.7 FROM THE
            PRESENT EXPERIMENT.   COMPARISONS   ARE   MADE   WITH
            MICROSCOPIC CALCULATIONS OF THE CROSS SECTIONS.
