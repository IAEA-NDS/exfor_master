SAMPLE     NATURAL CA  (96.941 % CA-40).  THE CILINDRICAL TARGET,
            OF DIAMETER 72 MM, LENGTH 145 MM, AND MASS 735 G, WAS
            ENCLOSED IN A SEALED PLASTIC BAG  FILLED  WITH  ARGON
            GAS.
METHOD     (TOF) NEUTRON KINETIC ENERGIES WERE DETERMINED BY  THE
            TIME OF  FLIGHT  BETWEEN  THE  CALCIUM TARGET AND THE
            NEUTRON   DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) ORGANIC LOQUID SCINTILLATOR NE213.
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS OF  PHOTONEUTRONS  WITH  MEASURED
            KINETIC    ENERGY    WERE    USED   TO   OBTAIN   THE
            DOUBLE-DIFFERENTIAL REACTION CROSS SECTION.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)   STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN. THE SYSTEMATIC
            UNCERTAINTY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE EQUAL TO 6 %.
STATUS     (TABLE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  IN THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
COMMENT    THE  CA-40(G,N)CA-39  REACTION  CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN
            MEASURED WITH  TAGGED  PHOTONS  WITH ENERGIES RANGING
            FROM 31.2 TO 102 MEV,  FOR NEUTRON EMISSION ANGLES OF
            45, 60,  75,  90, AND 135 DEG. EXCLUSIVE DIFFERENTIAL
            CROSS SECTIONS  FOR  THE  CA-40(G,N)  AND  CA-40(G,P)
            REACTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE OF A SIMILAR MAGNITUDE, BUT
            ARE NOT  WELL  PREDICTED   BY   RECENT   RANDOM-PHASE
            APPROXIMATION AND   RELATIVISTIC   DIRECT   KNOCK-OUT
            CALCULATIONS.
