SAMPLE     (20-CA-40,NAT=0.96941). Natural  calcium  cylindrical
            target, of diameter 72 mm,  length 145 mm,  and mass
            735  g, was enclosed  in a sealed plastic bag filled
            with argon gas.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron kinetic energies were determined by the
            time of flight between the calcium  target  and  the
            neutron detectors.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Organic liquid scintillator NE213.
ANALYSIS   The absolute  numbers  of photoneutrons with measured
            kinetic   energy   were   used   to    obtain    the
            double-differential reaction cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
           (ERR-1) The systematic uncertainty was  estimated  to
            be equal to 6 %.
COMMENT    The Ca-40(g,n)Ca-39 reaction cross section  has  been
            measured  with  tagged photons with energies ranging
            from 31.2 to 102 MeV, for neutron emission angles of
            45,  60, 75, 90, and 135 deg. Exclusive differential
            cross sections for  the  Ca-40(g,n)  and  Ca-40(g,p)
            reactions  are  found  to be of a similar magnitude,
            but are not well predicted  by  recent  random-phase
            approximation   and  relativistic  direct  knock-out
            calculations.
           Exclusive differential cross section for the
            missing-energy  region  E-miss = -2.5 - 3.5 MeV were
            presented.
