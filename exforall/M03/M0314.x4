TITLE      Energy spectra and angular distributions of
            photoneutrons from heavy nuclei.

DETECTOR   The energy spectra of photoneutrons have been measured
           with nuclear emulsions. The angular distributions have
           been measured with a variety of neutron detectors.
           They are:
           1) The moderated neutron detector. It consists of a
            cylindrical rhodium foil in a hole in a block of
            paraffin, 11/4 in. * 11/4 in. * 21/4 in. The paraffin
            block is surrounded by 1/32 in. cadmium foil and is
            placed in a paraffin cylinder,12 in. diam. and
            15 in. long.
           2) The Al-27(n,p) neutron detector. It consists of a
            series of aluminium cylinders (weight = 11.1 g,
            length = 3 in.,inside diameter = 13/16 in.). The
            threshold of this detector is 1.95 MeV. It is
            primarily sensitive to neutrons with more than 4-MeV
            energy and is less sensitive to neutrons of lower
            energy.
           3) The Si-28(n,p)neutron detector. The detector is in
            the form of quartz cylinders of about 7/4 in. long,
            3/4 in. inside diameter,and 1/32 in. wall thickness.
            The threshold of the (n,p) reaction is 2.69 MeV and a
            probability most sensitive to neutrons of more than
            5.5-MeV energy.
ANALYSIS   The energy spectra have been normalized per MeV, per
            atom and per roentgen. The angular distributions have
            been normalized per mole and per roentgen.
ADD-RES    The angular distributions were fitted by a form
            a0 + a1*p1(cos) + a2*p2(cos),
            where p1(cos) and p2(cos) are Legendre polynomials.

              before the ends of the ranges,

METHOD     Neutron detection experiment.
DECAY-DATA (45-RH-104-G,44.SEC,B-) - for neutron detection
            through neutron capture by 103Rh.
DETECTOR   The epithermal neutron detector was used which consis-
           ted of a rhodium foil in a paraffin cylinder 4.5 cm in
           diameter and 6 cm long. The paraffin block is small
           enough so that neutrons of more than a few hundred keV
           energy do not suffer collisions in passing through the
           paraffin and therefore are not detected. In such a
           neutron detector the sensitivity should be fairly uni-
           form for neutron energies from zero up to 130 keV, and
           above that value decrease rather rapidly.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data from Fig. 8 of PR,93,1279,1954.
