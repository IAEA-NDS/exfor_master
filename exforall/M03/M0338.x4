SAMPLE     The target  of  5*5*10  cm**3 size has the 10 cm side
            parallel to the direction of the gamma-ray beam.

DETECTOR   (TRD) Diffusion  cloud chamber  filled with helium at
            2.4 absolute atmospheres.

COMMENT    The energy spectrum and polarization of photoneutrons
            from Be-9  at  135  degrees  at  the  bremsstrahlung
            endpoint  energy  =  85  MeV  were measured.  It was
            shown,  that the high value of the  polarization  of
            the photoneutrons with energy greater than 1 MeV and
            less than 3 MeV cannot  be  explained  only  by  the
            contribution  of  the  Be-9 valence neutron.  It was
            concluded that there is a noticeable contribution to
            the   polarization  from  neutrons  emitted  in  the
            processes involving the Be-9 core.

ANALYSIS   Data were  deduced  from  the  spectrum of the recoil
            alpha-particles.
CORRECTION the energy distribution was corrected for:
            (a) the geometric losses;
            (b) the energy dependence of the (n,a) elastic cross
                section.

            Polarization.
ANALYSIS   Data were obtained with the maximum likelihood method.
CORRECTION The polarization was corrected for the  asymetry  of
            apparatus.
COMMENT    To eliminate a possible  asymetry  of  apparatus  the
            polarization of neutrons coming from Ra d-Be  source
            was  measured. The  data presented  are equal to the
            difference between the value of the polarization due
            to  photoneutrons  coming  from  Be-9  and the value
            obtained from the source.
