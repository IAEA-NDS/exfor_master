SAMPLE     THE TARGET OF 5*5*10 CM**3 SIZE HAS THE 10 CM SIDE
           PARALLEL TO THE DIRECTION OF THE GAMMA-RAY BEAM.
METHOD     (REC)
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (TRD). DIFFUSION CLOUD CHAMBER  FILLED  WITH HELIUM AT
           2.4 ABSOLUTE ATMOSPHERES.

COMMENT    THE ENERGY  SPECTRUM AND POLARIZATION OF PHOTONEUTRONS
            FROM BE-9 AT 135 DEGREES AT THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-
            POINT ENERGY = 85 MEV WERE MEASURED.  IT WAS SHOWN,
            THAT THE HIGH VALUE OF THE POLARIZATION OF THE PHOTO-
            NEUTRONS WITH ENERGY GREATER THAN 1 MEV AND LESS THAN
            3 MEV CANNOT BE EXPLAINED ONLY BY THE CONTRIBUTION
            OF THE BE-9 VALENCE NEUTRON. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT
            THERE IS A NOTICEABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE POLARIZATION
            FROM NEUTRONS EMITTED IN THE PROCESSES INVOLVING THE
            BE-9 CORE.
