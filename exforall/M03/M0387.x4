INC-SOURCE (LCS) Scattering   of   laser  light  by  the high
            energy electrons circulating in the storage ring
            ADONE - Compton backscattering.
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Frascati National Laboratories LADON.
SAMPLE     The target   materials   consisted  of  0.21  -  0.30
            mg/cm**2 thin films of Th-232 - O-2,  U-nat.  - O-3,
            and  93  %  enriched  U-235 - O-2 oxides prepared om
            mica sheets as supports and were contacted with  100
            micron thick Makrofol N,  Bayer AG,  which served as
            detectors   for   fission   fragments.   The   total
            effective  numbers  of  target  nuclei for different
            stacks were 3.4, 8.1, and 1.9 units of 10**18 cm**-2
            for Th-232, U-238, and U-235, respectively.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) 100  micron thick Macrofol N,  Bayer AG,  foils
            and mica foils.
ANALYSIS   The direct fission fragment track counting.
CORRECTION To obtain the final values of the physical quantities
            and associated errors, the data have been treated by
            considering the geometry  of  exposure,  statistics,
            counting    and   registration   efficiencies,   and
            fission-track background.
COMMENT    Experimental fissility   data    from    photofission
            reactions of Th-232,  U-238,  and U-235 muclei at 52
            MeV have been obtained using monochromatic and fully
            polarized  photon beams and dielectric fission-track
            detectors.  These data,  along with literature  data
            for Np-237,  U-235,238,  Th-232, Bi-209, Pb-208, and
            Yb-174  nuclei  have  been   analyzed   within   the
            framework   of   a   simple   two-step   model   for
            photofission  reactions,  i.e.,  absorption  of  the
            incident  photon by a neutron - proton pair followed
            by an evaporation-fission competition mechanism  for
            excited  nucleus.  For  nuclei in the ta - np region
            the trend of calculated  fissilities  clearly  shows
            shell effects in the vicinity of Pb-208. In the case
            of  U-238  the  effect  of  photon  polarization  on
            fission   direction   has  also  been  studied,  and
            isotropy was  observed  in  the  fragment  azimuthal
            distribution.
