            Half-life value measured.
ANALYSIS   Data were converted into absolute neutron yields by
           relating them to the absolute neutron group abundances
           of U-235, which are well known (see G. R. Keepin,
           Physics of Nuclear Kinetic, Add.Wesley,NY (1965)). The
           neutron-decay curve of 32 unseparated samples of
           irradiated 235U (0.01 mg) was analyzed in terms of the
           six neutron groups characterized by periods of 55,22,6,
           2,0.6 and 0.2 sec. From the initial activities of these
           periods follows a calibration of the neutron counter in
           terms of absolute neutron abundances
                                       (neutrons/10**4/fissions).
