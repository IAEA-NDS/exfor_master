ANALYSIS   (AREA) Monte Carlo according to Lynn and Moxon.

            Unfolding of gamma spectra by Monte Carlo.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)
            The 6-Li glass detector was 1mm thick
            and served as monitor below 50keV.
           (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) Above 50keV.
            Flux measurements were achieved using
            Au n-capture.
           ((MONIT)79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG,,AV)
            The capture yield has been normalised firstly
            against the 1keV resonance in 56-Fe determined
            in an absolute measurement with a Moxon
            Rae detector and secondly to the average
            capture cross section of gold between 25
            and 35keV, to be 589 mb.
MONIT-REF  (,B.W.Thomas+,R,AERE-PR/NP-25,26,1978) Efficiency
            determination for the gold normalization.
CORRECTION  For-
            finite sample effects, such as multiple
            scattering and resonance self shielding,
            prompt scattered neutrons, less than 0.1%.
