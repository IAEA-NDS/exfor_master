TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE LI-6(N,ABSORPTION) AND B-10(N,
            ABSORPTION) CROSS SECTIONS BY THE SHELL TRANSMISSION
            METHOD-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) 3 MEV VAN DER GRAAF.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) LI-7(P,N) REACTION USED AS A NEUTRON SOURCE
                   OUTSIDE THE SPHERE.
           .V-51(P,N) USED AS THE SOURCE WHEN INSIDE THE SPHERE.
                   BOTH METHODS WERE USED TO REDUCE THE CHANCE
                   OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN THE CORRECTIONS FOR
                   ANY ONE METHOD AFFECTING THE RESULTS.
METHOD     .THE SPHERICAL SHELL TRANSMISSION METHOD CHOSEN
            AS THE MEASUREMENT IS THEN INDEPENDENT OF ANY
            KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSOLUTE NEUTRON FLUX.
DETECTOR   (BF3  )
           .FOR MEASUREMENTS USING THE LI-7 SOURCE, I.E DETECTOR
            INSIDE THE SAMPLE SHELL, A CADMIUM COVERED
            BF-3 COUNTER 4 CM IN DIAMETER WAS USED AT 1 ATM.
           .USING THE V-51 SOURCE, I.E. DETECTORS OUTSIDE THE
            SHELL, SEVEN PARAFFIN WAX MODERATED BF-3 COUNTERS
            WERE USED TO INTEGRATE OVER NEUTRON ANGULAR DISTR-
            IBUTIONS. THESE COUNTERS WERE 2.5 CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 12 CM LONG.
PART-DET   (N    ) NEUTRONS THAT HAVE PENETRATED THE SAMPLE

CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE FOLLOWING-
            VARIATION OF DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WITH NEUTRON ENERGY.
            FINITE COUNTER SIZE AND FINITE SOURCE-DETECTOR
            DISTANCE FOR V-51 SOURCE ONLY.
            NON-PERFECT INTEGRATION OVER ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF
            NEUTRONS FROM V-51(P,N).
            EFFECTS OF ANISOTROPIC NEUTRON EMISSION FROM V(P,N).
            MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND ENERGY LOSS OF NEUTRONS IN
            EACH SHELL (CALCULATED BY MONTE-CARLO AND CARLSON
            TRANSPORT METHODS FOR SOURCE INSIDE SHELL, AND BY
            CARLSON TRANSPORT ALONE FOR SOURCE OUTSIDE SHELL).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE UNCERTAINTY GIVEN IN THE DATA TABLES IS
            THE TOTAL ERROR OF A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF ALL THE
            MEASUREMENTS. THIS TOTAL ERROR IS THE SUM IN QUADRATUR
            OF THE PARTIAL COMPONENTS.
           .WITH THE V(P,N) NEUTRON SOURCE, AND A NEUTRON ENERGY
            OF 102 KEV, THE ERRORS WERE-
              COUNTING ERROR.............................. 4.4 PC
              ERROR DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN BACKGROUND...... 1.0 PC
              ERROR DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN NEUTRON ENERGY.. 1.0 PC

           .USING THE LI(P,N) NEUTRON SOURCE, AND A NEUTRON ENERGY
            OF 102 KEV, THE ERRORS WERE-

           .A FURTHER ERROR DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
            RESULTS OBTAINED WITH DIFFERENT NEUTRON SOURCES WAS
            INCORPORATED. FOR THE COMPLETE LIST OF ERRORS AT
