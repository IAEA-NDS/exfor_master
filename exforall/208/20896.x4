TITLE       The reaction Be-7(n,alpha)He-4 and parity
            conservation in strong interactions
FACILITY   (REAC,2ZZZISP) Reactor, thermal column.
INC-SPECT  Reactor thermal column spectrum.
             (A) The thermal neutron flux was
            2.0 x 10**9 neutrons/cm2/s; the source had
            2.0 x 10**15 atoms of 7Be.
             (B) Two runs: with thermal neutron flux
            5. x 10**9 neutrons/cm2/s; the source had
            1.89 x 10**15 atoms of 7Be.
               In the second run the flux was
            2.1 x 10**9 neutrons cm2/s -1. the source had
            1.91 x 10**15 atoms of 7Be.
SAMPLE     The 7Be source, on a VYSTS film of about 30 mu-g/cm2.
           7Be as BeCl2 in diluted chloridric solution with a
           total solid content of about 6 mu-g/mCurie 7Be has been
           used in source preparation.
METHOD     (COINC) Two methods used:
            (A) The first (method A) studies the sum of
                time-coincident alpha- pulses with
                the aid of a multichannel analyzer;
            (B) the second (method B) presents both pulses from
                the alpha-particles on double-trace oscilloscope.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two Hughes SD1-23-1 cm2 solid state counters
            were used
ERR-ANALYS  Not given.
