            The monitor reaction used was either 28Si(n,p)28Al or
           27Al(n,alpha)24Na, depending on the half-lives of the
           reaction products under investigation.

COMMENT     The 7.2hr Er-171 activity through the Er-170(n,gamma)
            reaction determined the thermal and epithermal
            neutron flux to be less than 0.001 of the total.
            (n,2n) reaction cross section data compared with
            statistical evaporation model predictions.
            (n,p) and (n,alpha) reaction cross section data
            compared with predictions of the closed formed and
            master equation pre-equilibrium models.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors quoted include uncertainties due to
             * counting statistics,
             * detection efficiency,
             * source absorption correction,
             * decay constant,
             * irradiation time and
             * standard cross section.
            But not the uncertainties in the decay schemes.
