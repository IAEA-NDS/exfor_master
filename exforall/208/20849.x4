SAMPLE     Samples below were sealed in a quartz tube.
           Pa: Prepared from 231Pa2O5 by chemical purification,
                and mounted on Al (10 mm in diam).
               The number of atoms (2.589+/-0.128)E+17 was
                determined by photopeak counts of 290 keV gamma
                ray (3.25E+4 years).
           Np: Prepared from 237NpO2 by chemical purification to
                exclude 239Pu and 238Pu-241Am.
               The number of atoms (1.112+/-0.046)E+18 was
                determined by photopeak of 233Pa, which was
                produced by alpha-decay and in equilibrium with
                237Np.
