TITLE       Triton emission in the interactions of fast
            neutrons with nuclei .
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERJUL) Juelich Isochronous Cyclotron (Julic)
INC-SOURCE (D-BE)  53MeV deuterons on a 1cm thick Be target.
            Flux of 2 to 3 x10(10)/cm2/sec1.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum extended from 11.5 to 43.5
            MeV with maximum intensity at 22.5MeV and FWHM of
            15.8MeV. From integration 80 percent of neutrons
            lie within the range 14-30MeV.
               Details are given in J.Inorg Nucl Chem,36,3639,

                Method details.
SAMPLE      Target material sealed in quartz ampoule and wrapped
            in an Au monitor foil.
             For gamma spectroscopic analysis sample was
            wrapped in a polyethylene foil.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196-G,,SIG,,SPA) For flux.
           (79-AU-197(N,4N)79-AU-194,,SIG,,SPA) For spectrum
            shape.
CORRECTION  Tritium buildup from the quartz ampoule was
            checked with a blank ampoule irradiation.
            Tritium formation from Li impurities was less than
            3 percent.
