FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT)  3.2 MV Pelletron accelerator of the

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Proton beam current is 10 uA, 2 MHz
                    repetition rate
SAMPLE     The capture sample was a beryllium metal disk
            (weight: 49 g, purity: 99.5%) , size was 60 mm in
           diameter and 9.3 mm (0.115 atoms/barn) in thickness.

METHOD     (TOF,PHWT) The capture cross section of 9Be was
           determined by normalizing the capture gamma-ray yield
           of 9Be to that of 197Au, which was related to the
           capture cross section of 197Au by means of a
           pulse-height weighting technique. Therefore,
           measurements were performed alternately between the
           beryllium and gold sample runs. Both data were
           normalized by neutron counts of another 6Li-glass
           scintillation detector installed at an angle of 45.
           degr. to the proton-beam direction.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 76-mm diam. by 152-mm NaI(Tl) detector,
           which was centered in a 254-mm diam. by 280-mm
           NaI(Tl) hollow anti-Compton detector surrounded by a
           heavy shield.
           (GLASD) A 102-mm diam. by 6.4-mm Li-glass scintillation
           detectors for neutron flux monitoring
CORRECTION  Corrections for neutron's multiple scattering,
            neutron's self-shielding and gamma-ray attenuation
            in samples (10%) were made
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The error of the widths includes:
           (ERR-S,10.,50.) the statistical error
           (ERR-1,3.,9.) the error of the detection efficiency of
                         gamma-rays,
           (ERR-2) the error of the total capture yield of gold
           (ERR-3) the error of the capture cross section of gold
COMMENT     Secondary gamma-energies, spins J and momentums l
            are taken from the literature
