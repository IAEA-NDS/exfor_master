TITLE       (n,alpha) reaction on C-12 induced by 14.1 MeV
            neutrons
AUTHOR     (H.Kitazawa, N.Yamamuro)
REFERENCE  (J,JPJ,26,600,1969)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNTIT)
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNTIT) At 250 keV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron yield about 5x10**8 /sec
SAMPLE      Polyethylene foil 2x2 cm2 in area and 1.3 mg/cm2
            in thickness supported on a tantalum foil.
METHOD      Direct detection of emitted alphas using pulse
            shape discrimination to reject other charged
            particles.
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Harshow CsI(Tl) scintillator, 20 mm in diam.
                   and 0.4 mm thick, used as primary detector.
                   Energy calibration of detector made with Po
                   and Th sources. Energy resolution about 11%
                   for 5.3 MeV alphas.
           (LONGC) BF3 long counter calibrated with a Pu-Be
                   source, and-
           (SCIN ) plastic scintillator were used monitor the
                   neutron flux.
MONITOR    (1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,DA) Associated alphas monitored
                   to give absolute neutron yield.
CORRECTION  Differential cross section corrected for attenuation
            of neutrons in the wall of the reaction chamber and
            in the source assembly.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors and angular resolution
           function of sample-detector.

REACTION   (6-C-12(N,A)4-BE-9,PAR,DA)
            Only the transition to the ground state was measured
            because of contamination of lower energy alphas by
            those from the C-12(n,3a) reaction.
COMMENT     The angular distribution shows peaking around 40 deg
            analysed in terms of pick-up and knock-on models,
            and at backward angles analysed in terms of a heavy
            particle stripping model.
