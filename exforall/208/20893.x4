                                          ionization chamber
METHOD     (ASSOP) .Collection of reaction products.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)  Cylindrical ionization chambers containing
             a thin flat foil of material for measurement.
           (FISCH) Fission chamber for U-235 monitor analogous
                   for that of Lithium.
            Fission and lithium counters were clamped together so
            that foils were concentric and separated only by the
            thickness of counter walls aprx. 0.1 cm. Counter runs
            were repeated with that assembly rotated through 180
            degree about the line perpendicular to the neutron
            beam.

                         from Stehn et al, BNL 325 (1965).
           ((MONIT2)3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG) 950 barns at 0.025 eV,
            from absorption xsec of natural Li given in MONIT-REF
            Count rates from Li-d were actually measured relative
            to the rate from U-235 at 25, 67 and 100 keV. The xs
            for U-235(N,F) at these energies are not given. The
            above cross sections at 0.025 eV were used to make
            the method independent of the mass of material in each
            sample, the mass of U-235 being known.

SAMPLE      A Lithium fluoride foil of aprx. 0.1 milligram/cm2
            thickness over a circular area of 8 cm2;
            A U-235 foil of aprx. 0.3 milligram/cm2 over an area
            of 8 cm2.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for neutron attenuation and
            scattering in counters, for the small anisotropy due
            to center-of-mass motion, for background due to room
            scattering, for alpha-particle and triton absorption
            in foils.
INC-SPECT  .EN-RSL. Energy resolution is half base of resolution
            function. 2 keV energy uncertainty incorporated in
            cross section error.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error given.
COMMENT    .Err-analysis and data values obtained by private
            communication. Though the cross sections were
            determined independently of the mass of material
            in each sample, as a check the mass of Li-6 was
            determined by coulometric analysis. This gave a
            consistent value for each cross section but with
            greater error.
