FACILITY   .NO INFORMATION.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS AT 60 DEGREES AND 120 DEGREES USED.
SAMPLE     .LITHIUM FLUORIDE FOIL OF ABOUT 0.1 MG/CM-SQ WITH A
            CIRCULAR AREA OF 8 CM-SQ.
           .U-235 FOILS WERE ABOUT 0.3 MG/CM-SQ WITH AN IDENTICAL
            AREA.
METHOD     .COLLECTION OF REACTION PRODUCTS.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) GAS IONIZATION CHAMBERS PLACED BACK TO BACK
                   IN PAIRS, ONE CONTAINING A THIN FOIL OF LI-6

            DETERMINED BY COULOMETRIC ANALYSIS. THIS GAVE A
