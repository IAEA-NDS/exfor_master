ERR-ANALYS The Errors on the N-14 and N-15 Cross Sections Result
           Mainly from the Large Correction For the Presence of
           Oxygen in the Targets and from a Possible Uncertainty

SAMPLE     The Oxygen Target was D(2)O-18 Enriched to 97.7% O-18.
ERR-ANALYS The Main Source of Error in the O-18 Cross Section is
           Due to the Reduced Beam Intensity with Which the O-18
           Target Bombarded, So That Less Be-7 Produced Relative
           To the Other Targets.
