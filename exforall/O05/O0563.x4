COMMENT    - By Author - The Desintegration Rate 0F the Iron
           Samples was Followed For 8-10 Half-Lives.  The Decay
           Curve Show One Component Only, Half-Life 45.3+-0.3
           Days.  Neither 55-Fe Nor 60-Fe was Observed in the
           Samples.
           The Spallation Contribution from Target Impurities is
           Negligible, I.E. In Total <0.04% of the Measured Cross
           Section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Errors Quoted are Those Based on
           Uncertainties in Activity Measurements, Chemical  Yield
           Determination and Counting Efficiency.

           Measured Cross Section.
           The Gamma Spectra from the Ca Samples Show Only
           Photopeaks Belonging to 47-Ca and Its Dauther 47-Sc.
           The Desintegration Rate of the Photopeaks Shows a
           Half-Life of 4.7+-0.2 Days Over 6 Periods.
