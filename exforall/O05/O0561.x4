FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER)  600 MeV Synchrocyclotron.
METHOD     (EDEG) To obtain lower energies, a degrader of boron
           carbide was used.

COMMENT     All REACTION codes are given with SF8=MSC. It means
           that total cross sections were determined approximately
           In charged-particle induced reaction, angular
           differential cross section diverges at the most
           forwarded angle because of long-range character of
           Coulomb interaction. Therefore elastic scattering
           cross section and total cross section are infinity for
           charged-particle induced reactions. Authors used
           the extrapolation to zero solid angle and correction
           for Coulomb-Nuclear Interference (see CORRECTION)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detection system consisted of seven
           transmission counters, 5 mm thick.  The counters
           covered solid angles in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  7,
           9, the smallest and largest counters being 15 and 45 cm
           in diameter, respectively.
CORRECTION Experimental data are corrected for Coulomb-Nuclear
           Interference in elastic scattering at small angles.
           The interference correction dominates all other
           problems both in the statistical fitting of the
           various functions, but more important, in the basic
           formulation of the fitting procedure. The details of
           this interference correction are quite different for
           the three cases, hydrogen, deuterium and light complex
           nuclei.
ADD-RES    Method of Coulomb Interaction Correction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of cross section.
           Fairly minor contributions come from -
           (ERR-1).Error in counting statistics is 0.2%,
           (ERR-2).Error in stability of the efficiency of the
           scintillation Counters is 0.05%,
           (ERR-3).Error in accidental coincidences is 0.1%
           (ERR-4).Error in the background correction is 0.15%,
           (ERR-5,0.2,0.5).Error in the  Target Length is 0.2%,
           except for deuterium where one was assumed as 0.5%.
           The Energy measurement when converted to an error in
           the cross section is normally negligible less than
            0.2%, except for the energy  region between 400 and
            600 MeV where it reaches 0.3% for p-d cross sections
           and 0.6% for p-p cross sections.
