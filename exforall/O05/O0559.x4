HISTORY    (19990825C)
           (20010212A) V.McLane's remark is included.
           (20021101U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Targets For Both the Yield Consisted of a Stack of
           Carefully Aligned, 99.9% Pure Metal Foils-(30-MUM AL)+
            (10-MUM AL)+(30-MUM AL)+(94 mg/cm**2 U)+(30-MUM AL)+
            (10-MUM AL)+(30-MUM AL). The Uranium Foil was Cleaned
           To Remove any Oxide Layer.
ADD-RES    (ANGD). F/B Ratios of Reaction Products were Measured.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A Methane-Flow Proportional Counter.
           (GELI)
           (NAICR) 3*3 NaI Detector For the Monitor.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER).The Cern 600 MeV Synchrocyclotron.
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER).The 28-GeV Proton Synchrotron.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP) And Electromagnetic Isotope Separation
           Techniques was Used.
           (STTA)
COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Absolute Yields were Determined by
           Normalizing the Relative Isotopic Yields to the Cross
           Section of Sc-48 Measured in Separate Experiments
           Without Isotope Separation. The 1.31 MeV Gamma-Ray of
           Sc-48 was Measured with a Calibrated Ge(Li) Detector.
