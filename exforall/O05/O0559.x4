TITLE      Yields and Recoil Properties of Scandium Isotopes
           Produced in the Interaction of 590 MeV and 18 GeV
           Protons with Uranium.

SAMPLE     The targets for both the yield consisted of a stack of
           carefully aligned, 99.9% pure metal foils-(30-mu-m Al)+
            (10-mu-m Al)+(30-mu-m Al)+(94 mg/cm**2 U)+(30-mu-m Al)
           +(10-mu-m Al)+(30-mu-m Al). The Uranium foil was
           cleaned to remove any oxide layer.
ADD-RES    (ANGD). F/B ratios of reaction products were measured.

DETECTOR   (PROPC) A methane-flow proportional counter.
           (GELI)
           (NAICR) 3*3 NaI detector for the monitor.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER).The CERN 600 MeV Synchrocyclotron.

METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP) And electromagnetic isotope separation
           techniques was used.
           (STTA)
COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Absolute yields were determined by
           normalizing the relative isotopic yields to the cross
           section of Sc-48 measured in separate experiments
           without isotope separation. The 1.31 MeV gamma-ray of
           Sc-48 was measured with a calibrated Ge(Li) detector.

COMMENT    Possible secondary effects on the monitor reaction were
           checked in some on the 18 GeV experiments by also
           counting 22Na from the reaction 27Al(p,3p3n)22Na in the
           monitor foils, using a calibrated 3 x 3 in. NaI
           detector. Thus secondary reactions increasing the 24Na
           production were not apparent.
