TITLE      Yields and isomeric yield ratios of antimony isotopes
           from the interaction of 159 MeV to 18.2 GeV protons
           with uranium.

INSTITUTE  (2ZZZCER)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,29,2515,1967)
SAMPLE     The target material was natural uranium in the form
           of 47 mg/cm**2 or 94 mg/cm**2 metallic foils,or in the
           form of U-O(3) powder,100-200 mg/cm**2 thickness. The
           U-O(3) was produced from U-O(2)(NO(3)2)*6H(2)O.
           The foil targets were mounted with guard foils and
           monitor foils of aluminium, while the oxide powder was
           irradiated in small tubes of aluminium foil.

COMMENT    - By author - As seen from charge dispersion curves,
           Sn-127-M  yield  at  570 MeV is not more than 10% above
           independent yield of Sb-127.  The contribution from the
           4.6-Min Sn-127 at 18 GeV is more uncertain here than at
           lower energy, but is probably also small less or  equal
           10%.
