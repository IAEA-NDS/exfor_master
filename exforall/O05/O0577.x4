HISTORY    (19990914C)
           (20010110A) Subentry O0577008 has been corrected
           according to O.Schwerer's remarks.
           (20010212A) Comments For Half-Lives are Added.
           (20021001U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Target Material was Natural Uranium in the Form
           Of 47 mg/cm**2 or 94 mg/cm**2 Metallic Foils,or in the
           Form of U-O(3) Powder,100-200 mg/cm**2 Thickness.The
           U-O(3) Was Produced from U-O(2)(NO(3)2)*6H(2)O.
           The Foil Targets were Mounted with Guard Foils and
           Monitor Foils of Aluminium, While the Oxide Powder was
           Irradiated in Small Tubes of Aluminium Foil.

           Isotopic Yield Relative to Sb-122. Sb-122 is Shielded
           Nuclide.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           The Errors Given are Standard Deviations, Taking Into
           Account Errors in Counting Efficiencies, Half-Lives,
           Counting Statistics, Contaminations and Spread Among
           The Parallel Determinations Relative to Sb-122.  The
           Errors in the Monitoring Cross-Sections are not Taken
           Into Account, and the Monitoring Error of the Sb-122
           Relative to Na-24 is Taken Into Account Only For Sb-122
           Itself.

           Standard Deviation from the Least Squars Fitting For
           Each Run and the Spread Among Different Runs.
           Systematic Error May Occur Due to Contamination from
           The Neighbouring Isotopes. However, this Contamination
           Was Always Below 4%, Typically 1-1.5%, and Could be
           Accurately Corrected For.
