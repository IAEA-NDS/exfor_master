TITLE      Nuclear charge distribution in the region of asymmetric
           fission of U-238 by protons of energy 20-85 MeV.

SAMPLE     The target foils consisted of uranium foils of
           natural composition (99.29% U-238). The thicknesses
           used depended on the half-lives of the nuclides being
           investigated 134 mg/cm2 for half-lives greater than
           1 hour and 54 mg/cm2 for shorter half-lives.
ADD-RES    (Z-DIS)
           (A-DIS)
           (COMP) The results have been discussed in terms of a
           growing contribution from direct interaction
           mechanisms.
           Total number of neutrons emitted in the asymmetric
           fission of U-238.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 30 cm3 Ge(Li)
           (NAICR) 3. x 3. inch NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal
           for monitor.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (INTB)
           (CHSEP)
           (STTA) Stack assembly contains 5 foils. The target foil
           was sandwiched between two similar foils to compensate
           the recoil losses within the master foil.
           The copper foil was placed upstream in the target stack
           with respect to the direction of the proton beam and
           separated from the assembly by a thin aluminum foil to
           protect the copper foil from fission product
           contamination.
           (ACTIV) Duration of the irradiation varied from
           5 to 30 minutes with a beam current of the order of
           1 uA.
           (GSPEC) The activity of each nuclide was followed for
           several half-lives.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The average value was adopted throughout the
           bombardment range.

ANALYSIS   Method of analysis is not clear from the article.
COMMENT    Cross sections were generated by determining the ratio
           Pm-149(cum)/Nd-149(cum) in each sample produced in this
           series of measurements. A value of 1.304 was found at
           20 MeV, which was then used as a normalization factor
           for all the others at higher energies. This is based on
           the reasonable assumption that at 20 MeV almost all of
           the yield of the 149 chain is distributed over Nd-149
           and its precursors, except for a 0.04 mb contribution
           from Pm-149, as determined from charge dispersion
           curves constructed with other independent yields.
           The estimated independent yields of Pm-149 have been
           used only as a guide for definition of the charge
           dispersion curves with an assigned 50% error.

CORRECTION The independent cross sections of Pm-148-m have been
           corrected for ground-state contribution using the
           results of Umezawa (see REL-REF) at thermal energy (10%
           correction was applied to increase the fractional
           independent yield value).
           Umezawa has found sig-m/(sig-m + sig-g) = 0.88 in the
           thermal fission of 233U. It is reasonable to expect
           this ratio to increase to close to unity at medium
           energies since the production of the high-spin
            (6-) Pm-148-m should be favoured over the low-spin
            (1-) Pm-148-g.
