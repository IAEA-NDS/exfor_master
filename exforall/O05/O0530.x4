CORRECTION Results have been corrected for decay during
           bombardment, waiting time afterwards and during
           counting.
COMMENT    From author. Phrase "production yield" is actually the
           "physical yield" as it was normally corrected for all
           decays, also during bombardment. The word "rate"
           was simply replaced with "yield" because it is more
           convenient for publisher.
           Concerning the units "uAh" or "micro-ampere-hour":
           it was always just a convenient unit for charge.
           The hour in the units designated never had the
           meaning "one hour".

COMMENT    - By author -
           1.  The data for the production of Fe-55 from cobalt
           target were converted to equal energy interval by means
           of interpolation of the measured production rates in
           specific energy windows.
           2. The radioassays of pressed cobalt tablets were
           performed after a waiting period of 4 months to allow
           the Fe-59 activity to decay to sufficiently low level.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Measured production rate of Fe-55 via Co-55.
