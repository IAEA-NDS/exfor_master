COMMENT    - By Author - In Order to Convert Measured Cross
           Sections to Fractional Chain Yields It was Necessary to
           Construct Mass Yield Curve For the Systems of Interest.
           Choppin and Meyer Reported the Mass Chain Yield For
           238-U Bombarded with Protons of 10 and 12 MeV Incident
           Energies.  In the Course of this Work the Cumulative
           Chain Yields For Several Mass Chains (83, 93, 99, 111,
           113, 131, 134, 138) Were Determined.  Combining the
           Data from these Two Sources It was Possible to
           Construct Very Reliable Mass Chain Yield Curves For 9.5
           And 11.3 Proton Fission of 238-U.
           For the Deutron System Mass Yield Data from Sugihara'S
           Paper.
