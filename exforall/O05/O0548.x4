COMMENT    -By authors.  The predicted neutrino flux due to B-8
           decay is directly proportional to S17(0).  If the
           average value of S17(0) quoted in the paper is
           introduced into the standard solar model, replacing the
           presently adopted value of S17(0), the uncertainty in
           S17(0) will become insignificant compared to other
           sources of error in the evaluation of neutrino flux
           from B-8 decay.
SAMPLE     The 7-Be target was prepared at the ISOLDE by direct
           implantation of 7-Be at 60 KeV in a copper disk of 12
           mm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness.  The target is
           mounted on an arm that is periodically rotated by a
           microstepping motor out of the beam and in front of a
           silicon surface barrier detector, registering the
           delayed alpha-particle following the decay of 8-B.
PART-DET   (A) From decay of Be-8 (the dauther of B-8)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) In the present experiment a 150-mm2, 25 -
           micrometers silicon surface barrier detector was used,
           which provided a sufficiently thick depletion layer to
           stop the alpha-particles from the reaction but
           minimized the interaction with gamma rays from
           the 7-Be activity.

FLAG       (1.) The measurement carried out at EN-CM  close to 850
           KeV;   the  slightly different values of EN-CM  are due
