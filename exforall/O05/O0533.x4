SAMPLE      0.002-inch uranium metal foils were sandwiched between
            30-mum Al-catcher foils. Two 10-mum Al-monitor foils
           and two 30-mum Al-guard foils completed the target
           arrangement.

FLAG       (1.).Partially cumulative radiochemical yield.
COMMENT    -By author. "Partially cumulative" yields are given
           when in dependent and cumulative yields can only be
           determined with rather large uncertainties, but the
           result for a constant ratio of independent-to-
           cumulative (I.E. Parttially cumulative) yield is
           considerably more accurate.
           -By author. Our results is shown that cross section
           increased by (20 +/- 5%) for 119-123-I between 550 MeV
           and 590 MeV. This effect is surprisingly large.

COMMENT    -By authors. As was considered to be useful to
           investigate the influence of secondary particle on the
           production of bromine fission products from uranium at
            18-GeV at CERN-PS, since the cross section for bromine
           isotopes are measured here. Therefore, relative
           isotopic yields for bromine were determined in a thin
           target-22 mg/cm**2 and a normally used thick target
            133-mg/cm**2. The thin target consisted of two 40-mum
           Al-foils and 500-mugr uf between them. Two experiments
           were carried out with thin targets.
           The ratios of relative isotopic yields in thin and
           thick targets have been normalized to Br-80 as being
            1.0.
STATUS     (TABLE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The systematic uncertainty is shown for
           80-Br. For all other isotopes only the relative error
           as compared to 80-Br is given.
