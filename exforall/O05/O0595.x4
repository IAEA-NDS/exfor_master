           (20021004U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Three Thorium Metal Foils of About 200 mg/cm**2 Super-
           Ficial Density were Used.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG) 82-In. Synchrocyclotron Og Mcgill.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           In Case of the Semishielded Isotopes, Two Separations O
           The Nuclide in Question were Performed from the Same
           Master Solution. The First Sample Contained the Activit
           Formed Independently and That Produced by Decay During
           Bombardment and in the Short Time Interval Before the
           Separation from the Precursor in the Chain. The Second
           Sample Contained Activity Formed by Decay of the
           Precursor Only and Gave Information on the Chain Yield.
           Complete Separation of the Nuclide from Its Precursor
           And Accurate Timing of the Separations were Essential.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation Time Varied from 1/2 to 1 Hour.

STATUS     (TABLE)
CORRECTION Corrections For Energy Loss For the Protons in the
           Target Itself were Calculated.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS The Errors Associated with the Fractional Yield Data
           Are Due Mainly to Uncertainty in the Exact Proton
           Energy at Which the Bombardments were Made Due to the
           Radial Distribution of the Proton Beam and Energy
           Losses in the Target Itself.Nevertheless the Beam
           Energy was Probably Known to 2-5 MeV.The Disintegration
           Rates were Measured Relatively So That Errors
           Associated with these are Small Approx. 1%.The
           Graphical Decay Curve Analyses Associated Extrapolation
           Data and Chemical Analyses,Present No Difficulties and
           These Errors are Certainly Less Than 5%.It is Believed
           That an Uncertainty of +-10-15% on an Over-All Basis
           Would Cover the Above and Include Systematic Errors.

COMMENT    - By Authors: the Half-Life has Been Measured by the
           Authors with Accuracy +/- 0.1 Hour.
           -By Authors: Briefly,Gallium and Zinc Carriers were
           Added and Gallium was Separated from Zinc and Most
           Fission Products by Twice Extracting.The Time of the
           Second Ether Extraction was Used As the Time of
           Separation of Ga-72 from Zn-72.Gallium was Further
           Purified by a Number of Scavenging Precipitations and
           Repeated Extractions.The Two Samples Obtained,Ga-1 and
           Ga-2 were Made to Equal Volume in Counting Vials and
           The Activity Determined.Since All Measurements were
           Relative,Absolute Disintegration Rates did not have to
           Be Determined.
           Ga-1 Showed a Very High Proportion of the 4.87-Hour
           Ga-73.When this was Allowed to Decay,the 14.1-Hour
           Ga-72 Could be Quate Easily Measured,Although at the
           Very Lowest Bombardment Energies the Activity of Ga-72
           Was Very Low.The Ga-2 Samples Generally Showed a Pure
            14.1-Hour Decay Curve.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.35.9-Hour Br-82 is Shielded.
           After Dissolution of the Target (ICE-COOLED),Bromine
           Was Separated About 4-Hours After Bombardment.This
           Allowed Complete Decay of Se-83 to Br-83.
           The Bromine Samples Showed Only the 35.9-Hour Br-82 and
            2.4-Hour Br-83 (AN INTERNAL MONITOR FOR BR-82)
           Activities,with 1.9-Hour Kr-83-M Contributing in Some
           Samples.
