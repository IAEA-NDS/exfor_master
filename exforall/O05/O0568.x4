SAMPLE      50 mg/cm**2 Foils of Natural Uranium Placed at
            90 Degree Angle with the Beam,were Used.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDIPS) The External Beam of the 200-cm
           Cyclotron at the Institute of Physics,Stockholm.
           (CYCLO,2GERKFK) The Internal Beam of the Cyclotron at
           Kernforschungszentrum, Karlsruhe.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (INTB)
           (CHSEP) Chemical Yields were Determined Gravimetrically
           For Silver Chloride. Otherwise the 1.3-Yr Cd-109 in the
           Cadmium Carrier was Used As Internal Monitor For Yield
           Determinations. A 12 mg/cm**2 Aluminium Foils was Used
           To Absorb the Conversion Electrons from Cd-109 When
            2.3-Days Cd-115-G and 43-Days Cd-115-M were Beta
           Counted. The Recovered Amount of Cd-109 was Determined
           Either by Counting of the 88-KeV Gamma Peak or by Beta
           Counting with the Aluminium Foil Removed [After the
           Cadmium Activity had Decayed For 8-10 Months].
           (ACTIV) Beam Intensity of Stockholm Institute was 50
           Mua, Approximately.  Beam Intensity at Karlsruhe was
           1-4 Mua. The Standard Irradiation Time was 10 Min, But
           2 Min and 30 Min were Also Performed.
CORRECTION To Determine the Yield Ratio of the Cadmium Isomers,
           These were Separated from 21-Min Ag-115 After a
           Complete Decay of Other Short Lived Precursors.  Since,
           However, the Time Used For Separation is Somewhat Less
           Than the Half-Live of 21-Min Ag-115 Appropriate
           Corrections are Determined by Measuring the Amounts of
           Cadmium Grown from Isolated 21-Min Ag-115.

COMMENT    - By Compiler - 50 Sec Isomer of Ag-115 Decays to
           Ground State of 115-Cd Only.  Therefore 115-M-Cd
           Production May be Assumed As Independent, But 115-G-Cd
           Production Includes Production Due to 50 Sec 115-M-Ag
           Decay.
