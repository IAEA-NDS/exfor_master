SAMPLE      50 mg/cm**2 foils of natural uranium placed at
            90 degree angle with the beam,were used.

METHOD     (EXTB)
           (INTB)
           (CHSEP) Chemical yields were determined gravimetrically
           for silver chloride. Otherwise the 1.3-Yr Cd-109 in the
           cadmium carrier was used as internal monitor for yield
           determinations. A 12 mg/cm**2 aluminium foils was used
           to absorb the conversion electrons from Cd-109 when
            2.3-days Cd-115-G and 43-days Cd-115-M were beta
           counted. The Recovered amount of Cd-109 was determined
           either by counting of the 88-keV gamma peak or by beta
           counting with the aluminium foil removed [after the
           cadmium activity had decayed for 8-10 months].
           (ACTIV) Beam intensity of Stockholm Institute was 50
           muA, approximately.  Beam intensity at Karlsruhe was
           1-4 muA. The standard irradiation time was 10 min, but
           2 min and 30 min were also performed.
CORRECTION To determine the yield ratio of the cadmium isomers,
           these were separated from 21-min Ag-115 after a
           complete decay of other short lived precursors.  Since,
           however, the time used for separation is somewhat less
           than the half-Live of 21-min Ag-115 appropriate
           corrections are determined by measuring the amounts of
           cadmium grown from isolated 21-min Ag-115.

COMMENT    - By Compiler - 50 sec isomer of Ag-115 decays to
           ground state of 115-Cd only.  Therefore 115-M-Cd
           production may be assumed as independent, but 115-G-Cd
           production includes production due to 50 sec 115-M-Ag
           decay.
