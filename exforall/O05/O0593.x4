METHOD     (CHSEP)

ADD-RES    (Z-DIS)
           The Total Formation Cross Section For a=136 was
           Estimated As a Function of Energy from the Charge
           Dispersion Curves.
COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Measured Counting Rates, Either at the
           End of the Irradiation or at Time of Separation from
           The Parent, were Converted to Disintegration Rates by
           Correcting For Counter Efficiencies, Self-Absorption,
           Branching Ratio and Chemical Yield.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
MISC-COL   (MISC).The Number of Determination.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           Errors For Individual Results were Estimated from the
           Uncertainties in Decay Curve Analyses, Counting
           Efficiencies, Chemical Yields, Photopeak Area
           Estimation /For Gamma-Measurements/ and Self-Absorption
           /For Beta Measurements/.  Where More Than One
           Determination was Made the Average Value is Given Along
           With the Mean Deviation.

           The Error in the Computer Analysis was Highest For the
           Day Component, Undoubtely Caused by the Presence  and
           Interference from 6.5- And 12.9-Day Components. Since
           The 6.5-Day Cs-132 Emits a 670-KeV Gamma-Ray, this was
           Also Measured and the Cross Section Calculated in this
           Way Compared with Those Determined from X-Ray Data. The
           Agreement was Reasonably Good.

           Counter was Used to Measure the Counting Rates of
           Cs-136-G, Cs-138-G, and in Some Cases, Cs-134-M. The

           Cs-138-G with Half-Life 32.2 Min and Cs-130 with
           Half-Life 30 Min were Initially Analyzed As One

           Subtracted When It had Been Obtained by Positron
           Measurements.

           12.9 Days from Cs-136-G and a Long-Lived Tail.
           - By Authors - An End-Window Gas-Flow Proportional
           Counter was Used to Measure the Counting Rates of
           Cs-136-G, Cs-138-G, and in Some Cases, Cs-134-M. The
           Decay Curves were Resolved. The Activities Due to
           Cs-138-G with Half-Life 32.2 Min and Cs-130 with
           Half-Life 30 Min were Initially Analyzed As One
           Component. The Contribution Due to Cs-130 was Later
           Subtracted When It had Been Obtained by Positron
           Measurements.

           The Values of the Formation Cross Section of Xe-138
           And Cs-138 were Determined from Two Separate
           Irradiations. In One Irradiation,For Example,the Target
           Was Dissolved As Soon As Possible After the End of
           Irradiation and in the Second an Interval of About 1-
           Hour was Allowed to Elapse Before Dissolution.
