SAMPLE     Rubidium Targets were Prepared by Sawing a 90 Degrees
           Section of a Cylindrical Rb-Mn-F/3 Cristall with a
           Diameter of 25 mm.
           Typical Rb Target Shape was Thus a 90 Degrees Section
           Of a Disk with a Diameter of 25 mm with a Thickness of
           About 0.5 mm and a Weight of About 0.300 Gramm.
           The Rb Target Used For Irradiation at 1600 MeV was an
           About 2 mm Thick Pill with a Diameter of 15 mm. It was
           Made by Compacting Rb/2-S-O/4 Powder.

SAMPLE     Zirconium was Irradiated As Pure Element Foils with 15.
           Mm in Diameter and Typical Weight of 165 Milligramm.
           In All Irradiations,  Each Three Zr Target
           Were Put Together in Order to Minimize Recoil Losses
           And Cross Contaminations by Analyzing Only the Targets
           In the Middle of a Set of Three.
