TITLE      Elastic Scattering of 20.6-MeV Protons by Deuterons
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACLA)
SAMPLE     Deuterium gas, purified by diffusing through walls of
            heated tube of Pd. 2 samples used; one 99.20 mole% D,
            the other 99.25 mole%.
           Gas temperature to pressure ratio known to 0.1% for
            most runs.
METHOD     (BCINT)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Triple coincidence proportional counter
            telescope with Al absorbers between 2nd and 3rd
            counters.
CORRECTION Corrections made for:
           . background,
           . pressure (0.07% vander Waals correction),
           . scattering from 0.8% 1H impurity in samples,
           . unwanted counts due to fact that analyzing slits
             were not perfectly absorbing (small),
           . loss of particles in absorbers due to absorption,
           . electrometer drift,
           . accidental coincidences,
           . finite width of incident and scattered beams.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Error due to standard deviation of mean
            energy and energy resolution combined in quadrature.
           (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
