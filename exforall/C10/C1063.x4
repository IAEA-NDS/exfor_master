SAMPLE     Reactor grade graphite was used as a target.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) 4 pi graphite sphere neutron detector. The
           detector was calibrated for efficiency by comparison
           with a local Pu-Be standard source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) These data are estimated to be accurate to
           +-5%.
COMMENT    If one reduces the measurements of R.L.Macklin and
           J.H. Gibbons, J,NSE,31,343,1968 by a factor of 10,
           their values above ~5 MeV are only slightly below the
           present results and are within the sum of the stated
           errors. However, in going from 5 to 4.5 MeV, the
           earlier values decrease to ~50% of the present data
           and remain at about this level to the lowest
           alpha-particle energies. We conclude that the earlier
           thick-target yields are in error and should be
           replaced by the present data. (Author)
