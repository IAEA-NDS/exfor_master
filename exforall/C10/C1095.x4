REL-REF    (O,C1123001,D.G.Swanson+,J,NP/A,144,355,1970) Angular
           distributions.
INSTITUTE  (1USAPUR)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) 152 cm cyclotron at Argonne National
           Laboratory.
SAMPLE     The target stack consisted of from 4 to 10 targets,
           alternating and in contact with forward catcher foils
           consisting of high-purity aluminum (99.999%) with an
           areal density of 7 mg/cm2. Aluminum degrading foils
           were inserted where appropriate. The targets were
           made by depositing a layer of barium nitrate on the
           above mentioned aluminum foil by an electrophoresis
           procedure. A suspension was prepared by mixing about
           5 mg of finely ground enriched barium nitrate (84.6%
           134Ba) in acetone. The suspension was placed in a
           Teflon cell and a potential of 400 V was maintained
           across copper electrodes for approximately one
           minute. The target thicknesses, determined by
           weighing samples of known area, were in the range
           from 1 to 3 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) After irradiation cerium was
           chemically separated. The disintegration rates of the
           isomers were determined by assay of the K X-ray
           activity of the samples. The measurements were
           performed with several thin NaI(Tl) detectors
           connected to single- channel analysers set to accept
           Ce and La K X-rays.
ERR-ANALYS The (a,n) data at higher energies are
           uncertain by as much as 25% because of (a,2n)
           contribution. The random errors in the cross sections
           and recoil ranges include the uncertainties in
           (ERR-1,5.,10.) target thickness (5-10%).
           (ERR-2) chemical yields (5%).
           (ERR-3,1.,3.) disintegration rates: 1% for 137mCe, 3%
           for 137gCe.
           (ERR-4) The cross sections are subject to an
           additional systematic error of l0% because of
           uncertainties in the counter efficiencies and the
           decay scheme. Many of the random and all of the
           systematic errors cancel in the calculation of the
           isomer ratios so that these constitute our most
           accurate results.
CORRECTION In addition, the (alpha,n) results at the higher
           energies are uncertain by as much as 25% because of
           the sizeable correction for the contribution from the
           135Ba(alpha,2n) reaction.
COMMENT    Compiler comment: The half-lives of Ce-137g and -m
           are swapped by authors compared to recent data
           sources. According to the ENSDF database 137Ce ground
           state T1/2=9.0 HR and isomeric state T1/2=34.4 HR.
           Authors give it the other way according to the
           assignment of 1970.
