SAMPLE     Thick targets (about 0.125 in. in thickness) of the
           elements to be investigated in the form of
           self-supporting disks 4 in. in diameter. The disks
            (up to 18 elements at one time) were attached to a
           light Al frame; each target material could be lowered
           into the beam position under vacuum. The whole target
           assembly was fashioned from thin-walled Al pipe in an
           effort to minimize the effects of neutron
           interactions in the region around the targets.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) Neutrons produced in the (p,n) reaction were
           detected by a long counter set at a distance of 30.25
           in. from the target position. The efficiency of the
           long counter was calibrated by use of a 252Cf neutron
           source of known intensity.
ERR-ANALYS No uncertainties given.
