SAMPLE     Reactor grade graphite was used as a target.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) 4 pi graphite sphere neutron detector. The
           detector was calibrated for efficiency by comparison
           with a local Pu-Be standard source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,4.0) The overall accuracy of the
           measurement is estimated to be the greater of +-4% or
            +-10**-8 neutrons per alpha particle. This estimate
           is based on a proportional error of 4%, due to
           uncertainties in current integration and detector
           efficiency, and a baseline uncertainty of 10**-8
           neutrons per alpha particle.
CRITIQUE   J.K.Bair in J,NSE,51,83,1973 points out that if one
           reduces the present measurements of R.L.Macklin and
           J.H. Gibbons by a factor of 10, their values above ~5
           MeV are only slightly below the present results and
           are within the sum of the stated errors. However, in
           going from 5 to 4.5 MeV, the earlier values decrease
           to ~50% of the present data and remain at about this
           level to the lowest alpha-particle energies. J.K.Bair,
           J,NSE,51,83,1973 conclude that the earlier
           thick-target yields are in error and should be
           replaced by his latest data.
