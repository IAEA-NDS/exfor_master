SAMPLE     KI target of thickness 20 keV at 8-MeV bombarding
           energy. Both thin evaporated, tantalum-backed and
           infinitely thick pressed targets of KI of natural
           isotopic abundance were used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE102 plastic scintillator.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Excitation functions were measured by
           detecting the induced positron activity following a
           bombardment, rather than the outgoing neutrons during
           bombardment. The absolute cross section was
           determined by measuring the positron energy spectrum
           in a well counter made of plastic scintillator. 39Ca
           activity was identified from its half-life of 0.877
           sec.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in the absolute value of the cross
           section is estimated to be +-8% and arises from
           uncertainty in the target thickness. The errors due
           to counting statistics are equal to or less than the
           size of the data points.
