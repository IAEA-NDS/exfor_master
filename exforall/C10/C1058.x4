TITLE      Cross sections for the 26Mg(p,n)26gAl (7.3 x 10**5 yr)

INSTITUTE  (1CANTOR)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1CANMCM) The McMaster University FN Tandem
           accelerator.
SAMPLE     (12-MG-26,ENR=0.9946) The 26Mg target was prepared by
           evaporating magnesium metal enriched to 99.46% in
           26Mg to a 0.25 mm tantalum backing. The target
           thickness was determined to be 400+-40 microg/cm2
           by the crystal oscillator method. An enriched 26Mg
           target was also deposited on to an aluminum backing
           at the same time as the tantalum-backed target was
           produced. The target thickness was taken to be
           395+-35 microg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) detectors were
           placed on either side of the target chamber at right
           angles to the beam line and surrounded by 2.5 cm of
           lead to reduce background.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainties in the measured cross-section
           values are due predominantly to the target thickness
           uncertainty of 8.9%. Errors due to statistical
           fluctuations, efficiency variations, and to the
           calculation of the correction factor for absorption
           in the tantalum are each of the order of 2% or less.
           The combined error is 9.1 or 9.2% in most yield
           determinations.
           (ERR-S) Statistical fluctuations.
           (ERR-1) Target thickness.
           (ERR-2) Efficiency variations.
           (ERR-3) Target absorption correction.
