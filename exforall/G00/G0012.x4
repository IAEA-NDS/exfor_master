FACILITY   (BETAT) 35 MeV betatron at the University of Melbourne
INC-SOURCE (BRST) the uncertainty in the photon energy is es-
           timated to Be about 100 keV below 20 MeV increasing
           to about 150 keV at 28 MeV.
MONITOR    the photon dose was measured using a thin-walled
           transmission ion chamber the response of which was
           intercalibrated against that of a standard replica
           NBS P2 chamber.
SAMPLE     a high-pressure nitrogen gas target (37 g.) Enriched
           to 98.9% In n-15, contained in a steel cylinder.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,BF3) a 4pi-halpern type neutron detector con-
           sisting of sixteen bf3 proportional gas counters
           arranged on two concentric rings, each of eight tubes.
           the neutron detection efficiency was determined from
           measurements using calibrated neutron sources and a
           measurement of the d(gamma,p)n reaction cross section.
METHOD     (EXTB) 37 independent yield curves were collected at
           photon energies ranging from 10 to 26.5 Mev. In the
           range from 10 to 19.5 Mev data were collected at 100
           keV and elsewhere at 200 keV intervals. A total of 10
           sample-out yield curves was measured. Average yield
           curves, obtained from the two data sets, allowed the
           yield curve for the N-15(gamma,xn) reaction being
           determined by subtraction.
CORRECTION the resulting net yield curve was corrected for photon-
           monitor response and dead-time effects.
ANALYSIS   (PLA) the cross section was analyzed using the
           variable-bin-Penfold-Leiss method. The resulting
           N-15( gamma,xn) reaction cross section includes the
           N-15( gamma,n), N-15( gamma,pn) and twice the
           N-15( gamma,2n) reaction cross sections. The contribu-
           tion of the latter reaction, which was studied earlier
           by measuring the yield of annihilation gammas from the
           induced n-13 positron activity, was subtracted from the
           cross section data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) the errors include only statistical
           uncertainties ( 8%).
STATUS     the data are from private communication corresponding
           to fig. 1A of Phys.Rev.C,vol 40,no 2,(1989),pp. 506.
