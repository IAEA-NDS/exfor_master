TITLE      Study of nuclear photofission
AUTHOR     (N.Norov, S.Odmaa, G.Khuukhenkhuu)
INSTITUTE  (3MGLNUM)
REFERENCE  (C,2005ULAANB,,30,2005)
FACILITY   (MICRT,3MGLNUM) MT-22
INC-SOURCE (BRST) 22 MeV electron (12 uA) on 181Ta
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.05)
            Uranium foil with multilayer thin Al foils
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (RELFY,GSPEC) Identification of product by
            half-life, range in Al and gamma energy
COMMENT    By authors:
            Both 235U and 238U fissions were observed. Very pure
            or highly enriched uranium target is needed.
