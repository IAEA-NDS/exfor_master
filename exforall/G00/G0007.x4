TITLE      Absolute photoneutron cross section of i-127
AUTHOR     (R.P.Rassool,M.N.Thompson)
INSTITUTE  (3AULAML)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,39,(4),1631,198904)
SAMPLE     103-gram sample of solid iodine.
MONITOR    absolute measurements.
FACILITY   (BETAT,3AULAML)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     an absolute yield curve was obtained, which was
           unfolded using the variable bin penfold-leiss method
           to give the 53-I-127(g,xn) cross section.
DETECTOR   (BF3)halpern-type neutron detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) the error is statistical,
           (ERR-SYS) an overoll systematic uncertainty of 7%
           due primarily to the uncertainty in the
           efficiency of the neutron detector.
STATUS     (TABLE) data taken from Phys.Rev.C 39(1989)p.1631,
           from text and fig.2.
