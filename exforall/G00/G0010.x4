TITLE      CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT FOR THE CU-63(GAMMA,N)CU-62
           REACTION

SAMPLE     A NATURAL COPPER DISK (69% REL. AB. OF CU-63)
FACILITY   NO INFORMATION
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 17.6 AND 14.7 MEV GAMMA RAYS WERE PRODUCED
           AT 441 KEV RESONANCE.
INC-SPECT  THE INTENSITY RATIO OF THE 17.6 AND 14.7 GAMMA-
           RAYS BOMBARDING THE COPPER DISK WAS 2.2 /1.0
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE COPPER DISK WAS IRRADIATED ABOUT 20
           MINUTES (TWO TIMES THE HALF LIFE OF CU-62) IN ORDER
           THE NUMBER OF CU-62 NUCLEI IN THE DISK TO BE
           SATURATED.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A NAI (TL) SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR TO MONITOR
           THE GAMMA-RADIATION FROM THE LI-7(P,G) REACTION
           AND TO DETECT RESIDUAL ACTIVITY OF CU-62.
           THE IRRADIATED COPPER DISK WAS ATTACHED TO THE
           FRONT SURFACE OF THE DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) THE SATURATED NUMBER OF CU-62 NUCLEI WAS
           DETERMINED FROM THE NUMBER OF 511 KEV GAMMA-RAYS
           ACCUMULATED FOR 800 SEC, 30 MINUTES AFTER THE IRRA-
           DIATION WAS TURNED OFF. FROM THIS NUMBER, THE NUMBER
           OF CU-63 PER UNIT AREA, THE NUMBER OF GAMMA-RAYS
           BOMBARDING THE DISK PER SECOND, AND THE DECAY CONSTANT
           OF CU-62, THE CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR SELF ABSORPTION OF CU FOR
           THE 511 KEV GAMMA'S
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM THE TEXT OF J,KPS,17(4),35G,8412.
