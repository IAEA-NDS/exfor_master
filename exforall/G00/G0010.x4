SAMPLE     a natural copper disk (69% rel. ab. of Cu-63)
FACILITY   no information
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 17.6 and 14.7 MeV gamma rays were produced
           at 441 keV resonance.
INC-SPECT  the intensity ratio of the 17.6 and 14.7 gamma-
           rays bombarding the copper disk was 2.2 /1.0
METHOD     (ACTIV) the copper disk was irradiated about 20
           minutes (two times the half life of Cu-62) in order
           the number of Cu-62 nuclei in the disk to be
           saturated.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) a NaI(Tl) scintillator detector to monitor
           the gamma-radiation from the Li-7(p,g) reaction
           and to detect residual activity of Cu-62.
           the irradiated copper disk was attached to the
           front surface of the detector.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) the saturated number of Cu-62 nuclei was
           determined from the number of 511 keV gamma-rays
           accumulated for 800 sec, 30 minutes after the irra-
           diation was turned off. from this number, the number
           of Cu-63 per unit area, the number of gamma-rays
           bombarding the disk per second, and the decay constant
           of Cu-62, the cross section was determined.
CORRECTION corrections were made for self absorption of cu for
           the 511 keV gamma's
