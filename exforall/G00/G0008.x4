REACTION   (7-N-15(G,N)7-N-14,,SIG)
           THE INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINATED IN THE
           REGION FROM 19.5 TO 26.5 MEV.
SAMPLE     108-G OF (NH4)2-SO4 POWDER, ENRICHED TO 98% IN N-15,
           AND CONTAINED IN A LUCITE CYLINDER WITH AN INTERNAL
           DIAMETER OF 37.9 MM AND A LENGTH 101.6 MM.
MONITOR    ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS.
ERR-ANALYS SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY COULD BE AS LARGE AS 12%, MAINLY
           DUE TO THE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALLOWING FOR THE
           CONTRIBUTION FROM BACKGROUND ELEMENTS IN THE COMPOUND
           SAMPLE.
