INC-SOURCE (BRST) The target assembly was irradiated for 5-7
           hours with bremsstrahlung produced by bombarding the
           65-MeV electrons on the 0.1 mm thick tungsten foil.
SAMPLE     A metal of 209-Bi target (74.417 g) of 25 cm*2 area
           was wrapped with 0.0025 cm thick super pure-aluminum
           foil and was fixed on a stand at proper height behind a
           0.1 mm thick tungsten metal foil situated in a fixed
           position. The tungsten metal foil acts as a an electron
           -bremsstrahlung converter whereas aluminum foil act as
           a recoil catcher of fission product from the bismuth
           metal foil during irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities of the samples with
           fixed geometry were measured one after another by
           using an energy and efficiency calibrated HPGe
           detector coupled to a PC based 4K-channel analyzer.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The post-neutron emission mass yield
           distribution and the photo-neutron cross-section of
           209-Bi with 65-MeV bremsstrahlung have been determined
           using an off-line gamma-ray spectrometric technique.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The photo-peak areas of different gamma-rays
           of the nuclides of interest were calculated by
           Subtracting the linear Compton background from their
           total net peak areas. From the gamma-ray activities
           of the fission products, their yields were calculated
           using decay equation. Similarly from the gamma-ray
           activities of the reaction product, photo-neutron
            (G,3N) cross-section was also calculated using
           similar decay equation. The (G,3N) cross-section
           was also theoretically calculated using TALYS code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties shown in the measured
           cumulative yields of individual fission products and
           photo-neutron cross sections of 209-Bi are the
           precision values from two determinations. The overall
           uncertainty represents contributions from both random
           and systematic errors. The random error in the observed
           activity is due to counting statistics and is estimated
           to be 10-15 %. The systematic errors are due to
           uncertainties in the irradiation time(~ 2%), the
           detection efficiency calibration (~3%), the half-life
           of nuclide of the fission and the reaction product
            (~1%) and the gamma-ray abundance
            (~1%). The overall systematic error is about 4%. The
           total error is around 11-16%.

COMMENT    It can be seen from Table 2 that the photo-neutron
            (G,3N) cross-section of 209-Bi at a 65-MeV
           bremsstrahlung energy increases with increasing gamma
           ray energy of the 206-Bi up to 803 KeV and then remains
           constant above that energy. This is because of the use
           of thick bismuth metal foil of 2 mm, which causes
           attenuation of the gamma rays of 206-Bi to different
           extents depending upon the energy. Above 803 keV, the
           attenuation of gamma -rays in a 2-mm thick bismuth foil
           is negligible. Photo-neutron (G,3N) cross-section of
           1.478(0.054) mb  was obtained after averaging the
           experimentally determined value for the gamma energies
            of 803 keV and above.
