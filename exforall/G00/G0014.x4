            Final average mass value (103.1+/-20.5 amu) given
FACILITY   (LINAC,3KORPUE)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The target assembly was irradiated for 5-7
            hours with bremsstrahlung produced by bombarding the
            65-MeV electrons on the 0.1 mm thick tungsten foil.
SAMPLE     A metal of 209Bi target (74.417 g) of 25 cm*2 area
            was wrapped with 0.0025 cm thick super pure-aluminum
            foil and was fixed on a stand at proper height behind
            a 0.1 mm thick tungsten metal foil situated in a
            fixed position.
           The tungsten metal foil acts as a an electron-
            bremsstrahlung converter whereas aluminum foil act as
            a recoil catcher of fission product from the bismuth
            metal foil during irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities of the samples with
            fixed geometry were measured one after another by
            using an energy and efficiency calibrated HPGe
            detector coupled to a PC based 4K-channel analyzer.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The post-neutron emission mass yield
            distribution and the photo-neutron cross-section of
            209Bi with 65-MeV bremsstrahlung have been determined
            using an off-line gamma-ray spectrometric technique.
ANALYSIS   The photo-peak areas of different gamma-rays of the
            nuclides of interest were calculated by subtracting
            the linear Compton background from their total net
            peak areas.
           From the gamma-ray activities of the fission products,
            their yields were calculated using decay equation.
           Similarly from the gamma-ray activities of the
            reaction product, photo-neutron (g,3n) cross-section
            was also calculated using similar decay equation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties shown in the measured
            cumulative yields of individual fission products and
            photo-neutron cross sections of 209-Bi are the
            precision values from two determinations.
           The overall uncertainty represents contributions from
            both random and systematic errors.
           The random error in the observed activity is due to
            counting statistics and is estimated to be 10-15%.
           The overall systematic error is about 4%.
           The total error is around 11-16%.
           The systematic errors are due to uncertainties in
           (ERR-1) irradiation time (2%)
           (ERR-2) detection efficiency calibration (3%)
           (ERR-3) half-life of fission and the reaction product (
           (ERR-4) gamma-ray abundance (1%)

COMMENT    It can be seen from Table 2 that the photo-neutron
            (G,3N) cross-section of 209-Bi at a 65-MeV
           bremsstrahlung energy increases with increasing gamma
           ray energy of the 206-Bi up to 803 KeV and then remains
           constant above that energy. This is because of the use
           of thick bismuth metal foil of 2 mm, which causes
           attenuation of the gamma rays of 206-Bi to different
           extents depending upon the energy. Above 803 keV, the
           attenuation of gamma -rays in a 2-mm thick bismuth foil
           is negligible. Photo-neutron (G,3N) cross-section of
           1.478(0.054) mb  was obtained after averaging the
           experimentally determined value for the gamma energies
            of 803 keV and above.
