INC-SOURCE (BRST) Incident electron beam energies E0=3.5 and 4.4
            MeV and scattering angles of 90 deg and 135 deg with
            respect to the beam axis, with typical beam currents
            of 40 micro-Ampere. The beam time was 230 and 180 h
            for E0=3.5 and 4.4 MeV, respectively.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.93)
            1.303 gram sandwiched between two layers of 27Al
            (0.4 mm)

            Well-known transitions in 27Al were used for the
             energy calibration and photon flux determination.
            Product of photon flux and detector efficiency was
             calculated by GEANT4.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Include statistical uncertainties expressed
            in the error of the line fits in the spectral
            decomposition and a systematic error. The latter is
            dominated by the photon flux calibration and is
            estimated to be of the order of 10%.

ANALYSIS    Average of results for two end-point energies
COMMENT     By authors:
             For transitions obtained at both end-point energies
             the results agree within error bars,
             indicating that feeding through higher-lying
             transitions can be neglected.
