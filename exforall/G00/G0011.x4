MONITOR    the photon dose was measured using a thin-walled
           transmission ion chamber the response of which was
           intercalibrated against that of a standard Replica
           NBS P2 chamber.
SAMPLE     isotopic enriched lithium metal (99.7% Li-7), 60 g
           packed in a 10 cm long * 3.8 cm diameter perspex
           cylinder and 33.3 g in a 4.1 cm long * 4.0 cm diameter
           aluminium cylinder.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,BF3) a 4pi-halpern type neutron detector con-
           sisting of sixteen BF3 proportional gas counters. the
           tubes were arranged on three concentric rings: two
           placed next to the beam tube, eight in the middle ring
           of radius 7.6 cm and six in the outermost ring of
           radius 13.1 cm. this configuration was chosen to op-
           timize the detection of low-energy neutrons.
           The detection efficiency was determined as a function
           of neutron energy by determining the H-2(gamma,n)P
           cross section from threshold (2.225 MeV) to 7 MeV
           as the energy of the emitted neutron is exactly
           calculable from the photon energy .
METHOD     (EXTB) yield curves between 7.0 and 9.0 MeV photon-
           energy were collected in 25 keV intervals. The neutron
           background, determined by measuring yield curves with
           an alluminium sample ( photoneutron threshold above
           measurement range) with the same neutron scattering
           characteristics, was subtracted from the neutron
           yields.
ANALYSIS   (PLA) the cross section was unfolded from the average
           yield using the Variable-Bin-Penfold-Leiss method de-
           veloped at this laboratory. an analysis bin of 150 keV
           was used across the region of resonance.
CORRECTION the neutron energy scale was modified to include
           moderation effects from the lithium sample ( no more
           than 5%) in determining the yield as function of the
           photon energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) the errors include statistical uncertainties
           and systematic uncertainties in the dose monitoring
           system ( about 5%), and in the detection efficiency
           curve (about 5%).
