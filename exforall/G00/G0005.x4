           below 10 MeV

INSTITUTE  (3ISLNEG)
REFERENCE  (J,PRL,61,(7),810,198808) ang. distribution coeff. at
            diff. gamma energies are given. graph of ang.
            distribution for various photon energies are given.
           (C,84KNOX,,213,198409) graph of ang. distribution at
            two photon energies are given.
SAMPLE     the target was a thin-walled glass vial, 4.4 cm in dia.
           and 5 cm high, filled with high-purity heavy water
            (D2O), 99.8 per-cent D), placed with its axis
           perpendicular to the reaction plane.
FACILITY   (REAC) IRR-2 reactor.
INC-SOURCE photo neutron spectra were taken at angles of 30 deg.
           to 150 deg, in 10 deg. steps, at the following
           energies: 5970, 7279, and 7639 keV from the Fe(n,g)
           source; 6837, 8533, and 8999 keV from the Ni(n,g)
           source; and 7939, 8498, and 8884 keV from the Cr(n,g)
           source.
INC-SPECT  highly monochromatic gamma lines (delta e approx.
           20 eV) were obtained from thermal-neutron capture
           in metallic disk of Fe, Ni, and Cr, placed near the
           core of the IRR-2 reactor. Typical intensities for
           the strong gamma lines were about 10**6 photons/
           cm**2 * s.
ANALYSIS   The neutron yields at the various angles were
           normalized for the running time and the average photon
           flux during each run.
           Absolute differential cross sections were obtained
           from the measured angular distributions.
DETECTOR   He-3 spectrometer, having a typical resolution of
           60 - keV FWHM for 3 - MeV neutrons.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) the errors quoted in angular dist. coeff.
           in the c.m. system include only the statistical
           uncertainties.
           (ERR-SYS) systematic errors, such as may result from
           uncertainties in the calculated relative efficiency
           and multiple scattering contribution, and from
           uncertainties in the photon flux normalization and
           in the absolute cross sections, were estimated to be
           less than 6 percent.
           -the photons were collimated and neutron filtered
           in a tangential beam port, and a parallel beam,
           with an angular divergence less than 1 deg., was
           obtained at the target position.
           -the dimensions of the target were selected on the
           basis of a monte carlo calculation which evaluated
           the effect of neutron multiple scattering on the
           peak areas. This was found to be less than 1 percent,
           reflecting the high resolution of the present system.
           -the experimental setup was tested for systematic
           asymmetries by measuring the angular distribution of
           neutron groups emitted from known isolated resonances,
           which, due to their defined spin and parity, should
           be symmetric around 90 deg. the system was found to
           be symmetric to within +- 3 percent.
           -because of the angular energy variation of the
           emitted neutrons (i.e., fo E(gamma) = 9 MeV,
           E(n)(40 deg.) - E(n)(140 deg) approx. 600 keV), a
           correction was introduced to take into account the
           change of the detector efficiency with energy. this
           was done with use of a relative efficiency curve,
           obtained from a Monte Carlo calculation for the He-3
           spectrometer, at the present geometry. The calculation
           was tested against a measurement of the relative
           efficiency for neutron energies of 0.1 to 2.77 MeV,
           and was found to reproduce the experimental efficiency
           to within 5 percent.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(G,N)1-H-1,,SIG) absolute diff. cross sections
           were obtained from the measured angular distributions
           by using the results of a previous measurement
MONIT-REF  (,Birenbaum+,J,PR/C,32,1825,1985) in which
           the total D(g,n) cross section was obtained with an
           accuracy generally better than 3 percent.
           -at energies not studied by the above measurement by
           Y.Birenbaum et. al, an interpolation was made using a
           smooth exponential function which reproduced the
           exp. cross sections to within 0.5 percent.
COMMENT    the results were found to be in good agreement with
           theory.
