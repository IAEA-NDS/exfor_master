TITLE      Determination of Diffusion Hardening in Water.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Brookhaven Graphite Reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum with a flux at reactor face ~1E+7
            neutrons/(cm2.s).
SAMPLE     H3BO3 poisoned demineralized water in a cylindrical
            tank, 5.5 ft in diam. by 5 ft high, situated atop the
            graphite face of the reactor.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Measured diffusion length as a function of
            boric acid concentration by activation of In foils.
           Relative flux measured with bare indium foils placed
            on a line perpendicular to the plane source. Effect
            of epicadmium neutrons determined with a cadmium
            sheet positioned between source and water tank.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Four gas flow proportional counters.
ANALYSIS   Corrected relative activity of foils least square
            fitted to exponential spatial distribution to find
            relaxation length.
           Relaxation length corrected for leakage effect using
            data obtained from radial activity fit.
           Absorption cross section derived from least square
            fit to the set of experimental points.
MONITOR    Detectors calibrated using standard source.
CORRECTION Activity of the foils corrected for:
           . counter dead time
           . counter background
           . known indium decay
           Relaxation length correction due to leakage effect
            greatest (0.6%) for pure water data.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainties given.
STATUS     Data taken from reference.
