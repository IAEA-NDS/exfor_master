TITLE      Distribution of Partial Radiation Widths
FACILITY   (CHOPF,1USAANL) Rotor speed of 15,000 rpm determined
            a burst width of about 1.5 microsec.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Argonne research reactor CP-5.
SAMPLE     Large elemental slab mounted with normal to its
            surface at an angle of about 70 degrees with respect
            to the direction of the incident beam. Target
            separated from scintillator by 1/4 in. of lead and
            thick wall of a neutron-absorbing material.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Scintillation spectrometer with a single large
            (15x20 cm) NaI(Tl) scintillator; resolution width
            about 8.5% for 137Cs gamma rays and about 3.5% for
            8-MeV gamma rays.
METHOD     Measured high-energy (E1) gamma transitions.
           In addition to singles spectra, spectra associated
            with coincident pulses in two large scintillators
            were recorded for some of the targets and used to
            give auxiliary information of various kinds.
           (TOF) The over-all resolution of the system about
            0.10 microsec/m with a 25-m flight path.
            Measured difference in time between neutron burst at
            chopper and detection of a capture gamma ray by
            scintillator. Pulse height and TOF spectra
            simultaneously recorded for spectral analysis in a
            three-parameter pulse analyzer.
ANALYSIS   For the most elementary complex spectra, in which the
            position and shape of each contributing line is known,
            the intensities of a transition from initial to final
            states were determined by making a linear least-
            squares fit of the experimentally measured pulse-
            height spectrum.
           Line positions determined by finding the set of line
            positions that results in the minimum value of chi2.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . background spectrum at any given resonance
           . distortion of spectra by addition of pulses from
             more than one gamma ray; corrected both for pile up
             of pulses from independent sources and for summing
             of pulses from cascade of gamma rays produced by
             capture of a single neutron.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors given.
           For intensities of the few low-energy (well isolated)
            states, the principal sources of systematic error
            resulted from uncertainties in the true line shapes
            and in the background corrections.
           These uncertainties make it difficult to determine the
            intensities of weak transitions, which are very
            frequent in a population governed by a chi2
            distribution with one degree of freedom.

ANALYSIS   Contribution from sum pulses determined by making
            two runs with different solid angles.
MONITOR    Reference line shape for single gamma-ray energies
            from 7 to 8 MeV determined relative to 7.64-MeV gamma
            from neutron capture in iron. For other enrgies,
            the Iron 9.32-MeV gamma, or the 96-eV resonance of
            198Pt with a strong line at ~5.48 MeV and a weaker
            line at ~4.46 MeV were used.
           Intensities normalized relative to a gamma-ray
            intensity believed to be approximately proportional
            to the number of neutrons captured. This assumes
            that the multiplicity and gross features of the
            capture gamma-ray spectra of the given nuclide are
            approximately the same for all resonances of a
            particular spin and parity.

REACTION   (78-PT-195(N,G)78-PT-196,,SPC,,REL/RES)
SAMPLE     2.3-g/cm2-thick platinum metal.
MONITOR    Reference line shape for single gamma-ray energies
            from 7 to 8 MeV determined relative to 7.64-MeV gamma
            from neutron capture in iron. For other enrgies,

            198Pt with a strong line at ~5.48 MeV and a weaker
            line at ~4.46 MeV were used.
           Spectra normalized using data of Moxon and Rae,
            by comparing the intensity of gamma rays giving
            pulses in NaI greater than 2 MeV with the rate
            of neutron capture.
ERR-ANALYS Comparing the spectra recorded with different solid
            angles revealed that the errors from pile up and from
            sum pulses were undetectably small.
           The principal uncertainties considered, were those that
            result from imperfect resolution in the neutron time
            of flight.
