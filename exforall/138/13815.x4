TITLE      GAMMA-RAY INTENSITY STANDARDS: THE REACTIONS
            14N(n,g)15N, 35Cl(n,g)36Cl and 53Cr(n,g)54Cr
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Reactor CP-5.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor core with a thermal neutron flux ~3E+13
            n/(cm2.s).
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum.
SAMPLE     A lead disk (0.4 mm thick) and sample mixture placed
            in a graphite holder of 1.7-cm inner diameter. Sample
            positioned in such a way that its mixture part was
            nearest the detector in order to minimize gamma-ray
            absorption.
METHOD     Internal-target facility used: target sample placed in
            the middle of the through-tube (adjacent to the
            reactor core) and viewed by a detector located outside
            the reactor.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Annihilation-pair spectrometer with a 4-cm**3
            Ge(Li) detector.
MONITOR    (82-PB-207(N,G)82-PB-208,,SPC,,SPA) Absolute
            intensities measured by comparing with well-known
            100% intensity of the 7368-keV transition in 208Pb.
           (82-PB-207(N,G)82-PB-208,,SIG,,MXW) Capture cross
            section of 709(10) mb used to obtain the absolute
            intensity from the observed counting rate in a gamma
            line.
           (7-N-14(N,G)7-N-15,,SPC,,SPA) Pairs of lines in
            14N(n,g)15N used as reference lines for calibration.
           Detector-efficiency curves computed from previously
            reported relative intensities for transitions in
            14N(n,g)15N and in 53Cr(n,g)54Cr,
           Absolute intensity determined from the observed
            counting rate in a gamma line, the neutron-capture
            rate and the detector efficiency.
           ** Comment by author ** Good agreement found between
            the shapes of the detector-efficiency curves computed
            from previously reported relative intensities for
            transitions in 14N(n,g)15N and 53Cr(n,g)54Cr.
            Reactions 53Cr(n,g)54Cr and 35Cl(n,g)36Cl established
            as absolute intensity standards.
CORRECTION Data corrected for gamma-ray transmission.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties of absolute line intensities;
            includes uncertainties in the cross sections as well
            as in the efficiencies. Error due to determining the
            areas under the gamma-ray peaks considered negligible.
           (E-ERR) Uncertainties in gamma-ray energies due to
            uncertainties in the location of the line position and
            especially to the uncertainty in the energies of the
            reference lines.
