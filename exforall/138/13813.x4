TITLE      A Comparison of the Gamma-Ray Spectra from 2.8-keV
            Neutron Capture and Thermal-Neutron Capture in
            Sodium-23.
FACILITY   (REAC) Reactor CP-5.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor core with a flux ~3E+13 n.cm**2.s**(-1)
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum filtered with a boron-10 shield.
SAMPLE     14.6-g sodium sample in zirconium metal container
            surrounded by a 0.5-in.-thick layer of 10B.
METHOD     Internal-target arrangement used so that the sample
            (capture-gamma-ray source) was located in the
            high-flux region of a reactor and was viewed (through
            a collimator) by a detector located outside of the
            reactor. The 2.8-keV resonance was selectively
            populated by using the boron-shielded target
            technique.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR) High-resolution annihilation pair spectrometer.
MONITOR    The 14N(n,gamma)15N reaction (with nitrogen introduced
            in the tube) was used as a calibration standard for
            both the relative intensities and the energies.
           Absolute intensities obtained by normalization to well-
            known 2.754-MeV gamma line following the beta decay
            of 24Na.
CORRECTION Absolute intensities corrected for self-absorption in
            the sodium sample.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors given; in the peak areas
            these are expected to dominate the systematic errors
            and fit errors.
           (E-ERR) Estimated systematic uncertainty in gamma-ray
            energy; function of the errors in the energies of the
            standard nitrogen lines and errors in determining the
            centroids of the unknown sodium lines.
ADD-RES    The hypothesis that a bound level contributes to the
            thermal-neutron capture cross section was tested by
            comparing the resonance spectrum with the thermal-
            neutron capture gamma-ray spectrum: Departure from
            complete correlation between the absolute intensities
            of lines in the two spectra was used as a measure of
            the contribution of the bound level to the thermal-
            capture cross section.
