TITLE      High-Sensitivity Neutron-Capture Gamma-Ray Facility
FACILITY   (REAC) Reactor CP-5.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor core.
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum with cadmium ratio 7.
SAMPLE     Samples of N, C, B, Li; (natural or enriched);
            differing in size from a few mg to many g and placed
            in the center of a 10.6-cm dia. aluminum tube that
            passes through the reactor core.
METHOD     Internal-target arrangement used so that the sample
            (capture-gamma-ray source) was located in the
            high-flux region of a reactor and was viewed (through
            a collimator) by a detector located outside of the
            reactor.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector having a resolution width of
            6.7 keV for 7-MeV gamma rays. The neutron flux on the
            detector was reduced by collimators with neutron
            absorbing and scattering materials (filters).
ANALYSIS   The intensities were calculated from observed areas of
            the gamma-ray lines, relative efficiencies established
            experimentally in advance, calculated gamma-ray
            transmission of the neutron filter in the gamma-ray
            beam and a normalizing factor that is a constant for
            a given spectrum.
MONITOR    The lines from capture in 12C present in the graphite
            sample holder and 14N (when introduced in the tube)
            were used as reference energy lines known with good
            accuracy.
CORRECTION Correction of the observed gamma-ray-line areas for the
            background - mainly neutron-capture gamma rays emitted
            from structural components in the system.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Calculated by combining the statistical
            error of the observed gamma-ray line area and the
            systematic error of the relative efficiency.
           (E-ERR) Estimated systematic uncertainty
