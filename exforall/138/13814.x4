TITLE      Gamma Rays from Thermal Neutron Capture in 28Si, 29Si
            and 30Si.
FACILITY   (REAC) Reactor CP-5.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor core with a neutron flux ~3E+13
            n/cm**2 s.
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum.
METHOD     Internal-target facility used; target sample placed in
            high-flux region of reactor and viewed (through a
            collimator) by a detector located outside the reactor.
           Counting rate kept below 2000/sec to avoid peak
            broadening.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector having an active volume of
            4 cm**3 and a resolution width of 6.7 keV for 7-MeV
            gamma rays. The neutron flux on the detector was
            reduced by collimators with neutron absorbing and
            scattering materials (filters).
ANALYSIS   A singles spectrum was taken by each sample and a
            double escape spectrum was obtained by requiring
            coincidence between the Ge(Li) detector signal and
            the accompanying annihilation radiation observed with
            two NaI(Tl) detectors.
           Impurity lines were identified from the known
            background of the system as well as by a comparison
            with spectra from enriched isotopes.
MONITOR    (14-SI-29(N,G)14-SI-30,,SPC,,SPA) Relative intensities
            normalized to average of the intensities other
            investigators have reported for strong 6744 keV.
           Gamma-ray calibration based primarily on the peaks
            from the 4945.43 keV transition in carbon. Relative
            intensities were obtained by first summing the counts
            under the individual peaks and then employing the
            relative efficiency curve determined for the Ge(Li)
            detector.
CORRECTION Corrected for the various thicknesses of the borated
            polyethylene absorber.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors in the peak areas given.
COMMENT    The results from the 28Si(n,gamma)29Si reaction agreed
            well with those from other investigations using
            natural or enriched 28Si as targets.
