INC-SOURCE The unperturbed thermal flux 6x10**13 n/cm2-sec and
           the cadmium ratio for cobalt was 15.
METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP) Two capsules containing a known amount
           of highly enriched U-235 and four capsules containing
           a known amount of highly enriched U-233 were
           irradiated in the MTR and subsequently analyzed for
           total and isotopic uranium concentration. Based on
           these data, the effective alpha values (at a Cd ratio
           for Co=15) and the computed 2200 m/sec values were
           deduced.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties quoted include errors in
           the measured alpha, epithermal parameter "r", and
           Westcott quoted uncertainties for the various g values.
