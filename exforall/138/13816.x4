TITLE      Excited-State Spin Assignments Based on (n,gamma-gamma)
            Angular-Correlation Measurements on Medium-Weight
            Nuclei
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Research reactor CP-5. Beam collimated
            to size comparable to that of the sample and with beam
            intensity uniform within a few percent over the width
            of the samples.
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum.
SAMPLE     Right circular cylinders with diameters from 1/4 to
            3/4 in. and heights of 5-8 in. All of the samples
            enriched to at least 94% in the isotope of interest;
            continuously rotated to avoid any systematic errors
            caused by inhomogeneities.
METHOD     (COINC) High-energy primary gamma ray to one of the
            l=1 levels detected in coincidence with a gamma ray
            resulting from de-excitation of the l=1 state.
           Monitored using fixed-angle coincidences to reduce
            likelihood of experimental errors eventually caused
            by neutron flux variations, changes in gain, changes
            in coincidence resolving time and other systematic
            errors.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 6-in-high by 8-in-diameter NaI(Tl) crystal
            detecting the primary gamma; 4x4-in NaI(Tl) crystal
            used for the de-excitation gammas. Lead shield
            (1/4 in. thick) used in front of the 6x8 crystal to
            reduce coincidences between high-energy gamma rays
            and annihilation quanta.
           A second 4x4-in Na(I) crystal served as monitor.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors given. Reproducibility of
            the results for any angle was demanded as a minimal
            criterion for the absence of systematic error.
ADD-RES    A0 and A2 coefficients of the Legendre polynomials that
            describe the angular dependence.
STATUS     Data taken from Table I of reference.
