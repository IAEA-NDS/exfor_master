           Berkeley Laboratory.
SAMPLE     The target used in one set of bombardments was 57.8
           microg/cm2 of recently-prepared 99-ES-254-G, which
           contained about 2.5 microg/cm2 of ingrown 250Cf. The
           targets were prepared by electrodepositing 99-ES-254-G
           from isopropanol solutions of the chloride onto
           4.5-mg/cm2 molybdenum substrates. The deposits were
           overplated with 20 microg/cm2 of palladium to reduce
           sputtering and thermal-evaporation losses.
METHOD     (REC,ASPEC) In experiments where the recoiling
           reaction products were stopped in helium gas, the
           contents of the recoil chamber were continuously
           pumped through a capillary while fresh KC1-laden
           helium was supplied. Actinide reaction products
           attached themselves to the aerosol particles, which
           were swept through the 1-mm-diameter, 3-m-long
           capillary and then deposited on 30-microg/cm2
           polypropylene foils in the Multiple Alpha Detector
           system.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
CORRECTION The cross sections have been corrected for ingrowth
           from parent activities and for contributions from
           reactions with actinide impurities in the target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
