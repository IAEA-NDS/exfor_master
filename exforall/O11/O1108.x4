SAMPLE     The Li-6 target, obtained by evaporating Li-F, 99.9%
           enriched in Li-6, onto a carbon backing of 20-mug/
           cm**2, was about 50-mug/cm**2 thick.
ADD-RES    The alpha-particles spectra from the Li-6(He3,a)Li-5
           reaction have been obtained.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The two surface barrier detectors. One of these
           worked a a flux monitor, the other, 100-mum thick,
           could rotate between angle=20 and 120-degree.
PART-DET   (A)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD) The 7.0 MV CN accelerator.
