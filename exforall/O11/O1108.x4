HISTORY    (20040114C)
           (20040327U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Li-6 target, obtained by evaporating Li-F, 99.9%
           enriched in Li-6, onto a carbon backing of 20-mug/
           cm**2, was about 50-mug/cm**2 thick.
ADD-RES    The alpha-particles spectra from the Li-6(He3,a)Li-5
           reaction have been obtained.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The two surface barrier detectors. One of these
           worked a a flux monitor, the other, 100-mum thick,
           could rotate between angle=20 and 120-degree.

CORRECTION -By authors. The corrections for energy loss in the
           target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The estimated measurement error takes into
           account the statistical error, the finite energy
           resolution power of the electronic system used and the
           energy spread due to the detecting solid angle.
COMMENT    - By authors. The measurements of alpha peak in energy
           spectra were executed in large area of beam energy and
           angles.
