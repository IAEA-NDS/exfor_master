SAMPLE     The target used was produced by evaporation of pure
            (99.99%) metallic 89-Y on a Ta backing.  Directly
           after this procedure, a thin layer of gold of 99.9999%
           purity was additionally evaporated on the target in
           order to prevent oxidization.  The thickness of the
           target used was 436+/-24 mug/cm2 for the 89-Y layer and
           125+/-7 mug/cm2 for the gold "flush".  The target was
           checked for possible deterioration after the end of the
           measurements and was found to be stable within 2%.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,NAICR) Gamma-single spectra were measured by
           means of a large 12 inches X 12 inches 4pi NaI(Tl)
           summing detector.  The NaI(Tl) detector consists of two
           scintillation crystals of cylindrical shape with a
           diameter of 305 mm and a length of 152.5 mm .  Each
           crystal is segmented in four equal parts wrapped with
           aluminum (0.5 mm thick).  With this detector
           arrangement, a solid angle of ~96% of 4pi covered for
           the gamma-rays emitted from the target at the
           crystals'S center.  The main advantage of using such  a
           4pi detector is that, instead of measuring and
           analyzing numerous gamma-cascade transitions, one
           observes angle-integrated gamma-ray fluxes due to the
           4pi geometry covered by the summing crystal;  thus,
           systematic errors due to gamma-angular distribution
           effects are avoided.
METHOD     (EXTB) In order to keep the dead time below 5%-7%,
           especially at Ep>3 MeV, it was necessary to work with
           beam currents of less than 300 nanoampere on target.
           The beam energy spread was <1.2 KeV at Ep=872 keV.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty of beam current integration.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of target thickness measurements.
           (ERR-T) The total errors in the cross sections are of
           the order of 9%-12% except for those in the cross
           sections determined at the four lowest energies.  The
           latter errors range from 15% to 25%.  Apart from
           statistical errors of <3% at Ep>2.5 MeV and ~10%-15% at
            Ep<2.5 MeV.  Additional 6%-9% error in the simulated
           efficiency was also taken into account.
COMMENT    -By authors.  In order to avoid systematic errors in
           our analysis, only gamma-ray fluxes with photon
           energies above 8 MeV were used to determine the cross
           section of the reaction of interest.
