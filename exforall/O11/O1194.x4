SAMPLE     The targets were prepared by evaporating Li-F with
           natural isotopic abundances onto 0.2mm thick Ta
           backings.  The thickness of the targets was estimated
           from the evaporation procedure to be about  150mug/cm2,
           consequently the alpha energy loss in the target (~200
           KeV at Ealpha =1175 keV) is much larger than the widths
           of the resonances and the energy spread of the
           alpha-beam.

           The weighted average of two values is given
           in DATA section.
COMMENT    -By authors.  The strength of the resonance was
           determined from the gamma-yields of the e =414 and  718
           KeV transitions:   E/g 414 =371+/-29 milli-eV and
            E/g 718= 362+/-22 milli-eV.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The quoted error contains the uncertainties of
           the thick target yield determination and of the
           reported  branching ratio of a given transition.  These
           uncertainties are specific for the two independent
           analyses.  To give the final uncertainty, systematic
           errors which are common for both analyses were
           included.  These are from:
           (ERR-1) The stopping power (5%),
           (ERR-2) Current integration (3%)
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency (7%).
