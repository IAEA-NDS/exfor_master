SAMPLE     Spectroscopically purity rhodium foils of 14.88-
           mg/cm**2 each, enrichment 99.99%, were cut into pieces
           of 1.2*1.2-cm**2 each and glued on aluminum frame of
           size 3*2.5-cm**2 having a circular hole of 8-mm
           diameter in its centre. The aluminum foils of varying
           thicknesses were also inserted in the stack which
           acted as energy degraders.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 120-cc HPGE detector having a resolution of
            2-KeV for 1332-KeV photons of Co-60.

METHOD     (ACTIV) A beam current of the order of 200 nanoamperes
           was maintained in the stack for 2.4 hours.
           (BCINT) The charge collected in the Faraday cup was
           also used to calculate the average flux.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors quoted for each cross section are
           absolute errors, which do not include nuclear data
           uncertainty and are essentially composed of

           (ERR-1) The incident alpha-particle flux
