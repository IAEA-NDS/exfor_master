HISTORY    (20040517C)
           (20041028U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically purity rhodium foils of 14.88-
           mg/cm**2 each, enrichment 99.99%, were cut into pieces
           of 1.2*1.2-cm**2 each and glued on aluminum frame of
           size 3*2.5-cm**2 having a circular hole of 8-mm
           diameter in its centre. The aluminum foils of varying
           thicknesses were also inserted in the stack which
           acted as energy degraders.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Preequilibrium Hybrid model of Blann-ALICE/90.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 120-cc HPGE detector having a resolution of
            2-KeV for 1332-KeV photons of Co-60.

METHOD     (ACTIV) A beam current of the order of 200 nanoamperes
           was maintained in the stack for 2.4 hours.
           (BCINT) The charge collected in the Faraday cup was
           also used to calculate the average flux.

           (GSPEC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors quoted for each cross section are
           absolute errors, which are essentially composed of
           uncertainties in:
           (ERR-1) 1.  The incident alpha-particle flux is 6%,
           2.  Detector efficiency is 3-4%,
           3.  Uniformity of the foil thickness from 1 to 2%,
           4.  Dead time less 5%.
           The above mentioned errors in the measurements of
           experimental cross-sections do not include the
           uncertainty of the nuclear data.
           (EN-ERR). The error is indicated by authors in table.
