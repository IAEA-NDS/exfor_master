TITLE      Excitation functions and yields of the reactions
           induced by alpha-particle bombardment of natural silver
REFERENCE  (J,ARI,47,309,1996)

INSTITUTE  (3CPRSIU)
SAMPLE     A natural silver plate of 99.9% purity was rolled down
           to foils with thicknesses from 3- to 4-mg/cm**2. Each
           silver foil was covered by aluminum foils of 1.25 and
            5.2-mg/cm**2 thickness to prevent the loss of
           activation products due to atom recoil. The
           thicknesses of the silver and aluminum foils were
           determined by weighting. The stack was composed of 10
           such sandwiches.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) The thick target yields were calculated by
           means of numerical integration along the excitation
           functions curves.

           emissions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRSIU) 1.2-m cyclotron
METHOD     (STTA) The stack was placed inside a Faraday cup.  The
           stack was cooled during irradiation by a liquid
           nitrogen finger.
           (BCINT) The charge on the stack was recorded every 300
           seconds.
           (EXTB) The beam intensity was about 100-500 nanoanperes
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) About 14 hours after the end of irradiation the
           gamma-ray spectra were measured.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main sources of uncertainties came from:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of target inhomogeneity-3%,
           (ERR-2,,1.)  Uncertainty of integrated beam
                                    determination- less 1%,
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty of detector efficiency-about 3%
           (ERR-S,0.3,7.)  Statistical error of photopeak
                 counting - about 0.3-7%.
           For this reason the overall uncertainty of the cross
           section was estimated to be about 8-9%.
           (EN-ERR).The error is given in table.
