HISTORY    (20040429C)
           (20040514U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A natural silver plate of 99.9% purity was rolled down
           to foils with thicknesses from 3- to 4-mg/cm**2. Each
           silver foil was covered by aluminium foils of 1.25 and
            5.2-mg/cm**2 thickness to prevent the loss of
           activation products due to atom recoil. The
           thicknesses of the silver and aluminium foils were
           determined by weighing. The stack was composed of 10
           such sandwiches.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) The thick target yields were calculated by
           means of numerical integration along the excitation
           functions curves.
           (COMP) Statisical theory including preequilibrium
           emissions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRSIU) 1.2-m cyclotron
METHOD     (STTA) The stack was placed inside a Faraday cup.  The
           stack was cooled during irradiation by a liquid
           nitrogen finger.
           (BCINT) The charge on the stack was recorded every 300
           seconds.
           (EXTB) The beam intensity was about 100-500 nanoanperes
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) About 14 hours after the end of irradiation the
           gamma-ray spectra were measured.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty is given in table.
           The main sources of uncertainties came from:
           1. The target inhomogeneity-3%,
           2.  The integrated beam determination- less 1%,
           3.  The detector efficiency-about 3%
           4.   The  statistical error of photopeak counting-about
           0.3-7%.
           For this reason the overall uncertainty of the cross
           section was estimated to be about 8-9%.
           (EN-ERR).The error is given in table.

COMMENT    -By compiler. According to ENSDF 4.9 hours activity is
           activity of ground state of In-110, but not of isomer
           state.
