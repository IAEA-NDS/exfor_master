HISTORY    (20040213C)
           (20040507U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A cylindrical gas target, diameter 2-cm, was used.
           The entrance and exit windows are made of Havar 2.5 mum
           and Ni-5 mum, respectively. The lateral windows are
           made of Kapton 10 mum.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Faddeev-type equation.
           (THEO)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) For each telescope was used two
           Si-surface-barrier detectors of thicknesses 3-mm and
           100-mum
           (SIBAR) To measure beam polarisation the elastically
           scattered by He-4 protons were detected in two
           Si-surface-barrier detectors of thickness 500-mum.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(P,EL)1-H-2,,DA) The elastically scattered
           protons were used as a monitoring reaction for
           differential cross section.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table. These do not include 1.5% due to the statistical
           error on the normalisation and 1.6% absolute
           uncertainty of the cross section and a 1.7% statistical
           error due to the beam polarisation for the analyzing
           power. A common uncertainty of 1.6% is due to the
           absolute calibration of the beam polarisation.
