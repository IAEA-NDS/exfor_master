HISTORY    (20040216C)
           (20040512U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A small CH(2) targets, 10*10*5.0-mm**3 was used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Two scintillators 5*5-cm**2 and
           8*8-cm**2 detected P-P elastic scattering events in
           coincidence.
COMMENT    -By authors. The scattering angle of 90-degree-cm was
           chosen since cross section has a minimum there and
           effects due to residual vertical polarisation are
           eliminated.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table is statistical error.
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainties from  the fraction of
            the incident beam hitting the CH(2) target, the
            transmission of the scintillation detectors for proton
            energy, the transmission of the target material.
           (ERR-2) The error in the target thickness .
           (ERR-3) The error for particle losses in the CH(2)
            target and detectors for the scattered protons.
           (EN-ERR) The error is reported by authors.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWTVIL)
METHOD     (EXTB) The used beam originates from 8 degree
           scattering by a thin Be target of the primary 592 MeV
           proton beam, which is pulsed at a frequency of 51 MHz.
           It is focused on a Cu degrader, purified by a
           deflecting magnet and focused on the target position.
