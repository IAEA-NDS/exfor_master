SAMPLE     The target was a high-pressure gas cylinder of 25.7 cm
           length and 2 cm radius with carbon-fiber/epoxy walls of
           only 0.5 mm thickness to keep background and particle
           detection thresholds low.
           For the three target nuclei studied, N, Ar, and Xe, the
           target gas pressure was 40 bar, 28 bar, and 13 bar,
           respectively.  The target temperature and pressure were
           monitored during the experiment and stayed constant
           within less than 1% throughout each specific
           target/beam run.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detector consisted of a plastic scintillator
           cylinder divided into 28 deltaE-E-E sectors, each 1.6 m
           in active length.  The ends of the cylinder were closed
           by endcaps, each consisting of 14 deltaE-E plastic
           scintillator sectors.  The scintillators stopped
           normally incident protons of up to 250 MeV.
           (MWPC) The trajectory information for charged particles
           was provided by two coaxial cylindrical multiwire
           proportional chambers inside the plastic cylinder.
           Their angular resolution was about 1 degree FWHM.
           With the solid angle coverage of more than 98% of 4pi
           and the low proton threshold of about 20 MeV, a large
           fraction of the phase space was accessible to LADS
           even at low incident pion energies.
           The pi+ beam was defined by a set of plastic
           scintillation detectors that counted the individual
           pions and rejected particles in the beam halo.

ERR-ANALYS  ERR-T - Total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1,6.,10.) Uncertainty in normalization. The error
           related to the beam normalisation varies with the pion
           beam energy, the dominating error coming from the beam-
           missing-target correction. The pion flux upstream and
           downstream of the target was examined and the error
           taken to be half of the difference between the flux
           missing the target upstream and downstream
                                              (typically 5%-10%).
           The final normalisation errors were in the range 6%-10%
           except at the lowest pion energy where it was 20%.
           (ERR-2,1.,7.) This error depends on the pion beam
           momentum and the absorption final state and between
            7% (at high pion energy and low multiplicity final
           states, e.g., 2p state at 330 MeV) and 1% (for most
           other cases).
            * Uncertainty in SCX (single charge exchange
                                    contamination) subtraction
           (ERR-3,,2.) Uncertainty in pion contamination.
           An error of 2% was adopted as an upper limit for pion
           contamination in all final states.
           (EN-ERR) Uncertainty in Excitation energy
            * The statistical error is very small except for a few
              channels at high multiplicities
           All sources of uncertainties were discussed in
            chapter 3.7 at EPJ/A,9,537,2000
           Some deduced cross-sections have errors around 100%.
           These are usually weak channels where the main part of
           the error comes from model dependency and other Monte
           Carlo related sources (e.g., neutron reaction
           correction). Such cross-sections are shown in Subents
           as upper limits (defined as the sum of the
           cross-section and the error).
