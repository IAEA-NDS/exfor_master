SAMPLE     The target material consisted of 95% butanol and 5%
           water.  The target with a volume of 18X18X3
           millimeters**3 has been cooled down to
           70 milliKelvin by a 3-He - 4-He dilution  refrigerator.
ADD-RES     Spectra of pions scattered from the polarized target
            and the 1-mm carbon target was represented.
            Phase analysis.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Low energy magneic spectrometer LEPS, which
           features excellent momentum resolution (~0.2%) and
           effective muon suppresion.

CORRECTION -By authors. A small correction for the different
            energy loss in the target was applied.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors of the data are essentially given
           by the error of the target polarization, which amount
           to +-5% and is dominated by the error of the thermal
            NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance, the NMR signal have
           been added for each target in order to lower the
           statistical error). Additional systematic and
           statistical error of the NMR signals in the polarized
           state of the target are included, but almost negligible
           compared to the +-5% error mentioned.
FLAG       (1.). Target material was doped by 1% porphyrexide.
           (2.). Target material was doped by 1.5% EHBA-CR-V
           complex.
