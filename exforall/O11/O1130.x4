REL-REF    (R,O1131001,A.BERDOZ+,J,JP/G,8,1363,1982) Details of
           experiment.
SAMPLE     Two small CH(2) targets, 10*10*2.3-mm**3 and
            10*10*1.5-mm**3, were used for data taking while two
           corresponding C-targets, 10*10*1-mm**3 and 10*10*0.5-
           mm*3, were used to find the background contribution.
           The thinner targets used for the three most forward
           angles were oriented at an angle of +35-degree with
           respect to the beam direction to reduce the energy loss
           of the recoil protons.
COMMENT    -By authors. Test without the target showed that the
           air surrounding it contributes to the background. Test
           with a large He-gas target replacing air showed only
           accidentals. Therefore the fact that was chose C-target
           with C amounts equivalent to those of the CH(2) targets
           accounts correctly for the air contribution.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Two scintillators 5*5-cm**2 and
           8*8-cm**2  detected P-P elastic  scattering  events  in
           coincidence.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Errors are statistical only, include errors due
           to background subtraction. An additional common error
           of 1% is due to the uncertainty in the beam
           polarization.
