REACTION   (62-SM-154(D,G)63-EU-156,,SIG)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Time of irradiation - 7 hours.
           (CHSEP) Prior to each measurement chemical separation
           were carried out in order to remove Co-56 resulting
           from Fe impurities in the samarium samples.
COMMENT    -By authors. The Eu-156 measurements were performed
           from 3 to 7 days after each bombardment.
SAMPLE      97.7% enriched SM-154(2)O(3) wrapped into Al foil,
           was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
STATUS     (CURVE) By CAJAD.

REACTION   (92-U-238(D,G)93-NP-240,,SIG)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Time of irradiation - 30 minutes.
           (CHSEP) Prior to each measurement chemical separation
           were carried out in order to separate neptunium from
           uranium and the fission products.
COMMENT    -By authors. The Np-240 measurements were performed
           from 1 to 2 hours after each bombardment.
           -By authors. Our upper limit for U-238(d,g) cross
           section 9.4-mub is 170 times smaller than the reported
           value in REL-REF.
