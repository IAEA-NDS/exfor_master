HISTORY    (20040216C)
           (20040512U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Two small CH(2) targets, 10*10*2.3-mm**3 and
            10*10*1.5-mm**3, were used for data taking while two
           corresponding C-targets, 10*10*1-mm**3 and 10*10*0.5-
           mm*3, were used to find the background contribution.
           The targets were oriented at an angle of 21-degree
           with respect to the beam direction to reduce the energy
           loss of the recoil protons.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Two monitor telescope.
           Two scintillators 5*5-cm**2 and 8*8-cm**2
           detected P-P elastic scattering events in coincidence.

COMMENT    -By authors. Finally the relative cross sections were
           obtained by dividing by the solid-angle Monte-Carlo
           corrections, the jacobian and the monitor value.
           The statistical error on the monitor normalization is
           less than 0.3%.
           The relative cross section are given normalized
           internally with respect to the average 90-degree value.
           The errors are due only to the statistics of each
           particular angle, without propagation of the error at
            90-degree.
           An absolute normalization of the distribution is
           available from previous 90-degree studies with the
           current apparatus providing purely experimental
           results.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWTVIL)
METHOD     (EXTB) The used beam originates from 8 degree
           scattering by a thin Be target of the primary 592 MeV
           proton beam, which is pulsed at a frequency of 51 MHz.
           It is focused on a Cu degrader, purified by a
           deflecting magnet and focused on the target position.
           To avoid the influence of the beam polarisation (42%)
           was rotated in a superconducting solenoid from the
           vertical direction into the horizontal scattering
           plane.
