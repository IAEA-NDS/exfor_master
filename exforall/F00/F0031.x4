SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by evaporating 6LiF (99.32% 6Li)
           onto 2.5-cm-diam aluminum disks.

HISTORY    (19800820C)
           (20080227A) Energy values in all subents were changed
            (incident energy values were replaced by mean energy
           values in target). In table 1 cross section values
           were changed. Facility code was changed. Partial
           systematic errors were added to sub2. ERR-ANALYS code
           was added to sub3. DECAY-DATA codes were added to all
           subenntries. METHOD code was added to sub4. Designation
            "EXP" was removed from the reaction codes.
