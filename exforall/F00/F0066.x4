TITLE      Cross sections and astrophysical S factor for the
           Li-7(p,alpha) reaction at low energies
AUTHOR     (J.F.Harmon)
INSTITUTE  (1USAISU)
REFERENCE  (J,NIM/B,40-41,507,1989)
SAMPLE     Pressed pellets of LiClO-3,LiF and LiAlSiO-3
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAISU) Two accelerators were used during the
           course of the work; the data from 100 to 250 keV was
           obtained with a 2 MV Van de Graaff,
           (CCW,1USAISU) The data between 20 and 100 keV from a
           Cockcroft Walton machine.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 450 mm2 solid state detector at 90 degr.
