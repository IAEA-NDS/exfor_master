TITLE      Charged particle cross sections
AUTHOR     (G.A.Sawyer,J.A.Phillips)
INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
REFERENCE  (R,LA-1578,1953) - original data
           (R,LA-2014,1957) - data for Li-6,7 were given in
           good quality. In LA-2014 compiled data from different
           sources are given.
FACILITY   (CCW,1USALAS) 250 keV Cockcroft Walton accelerator
METHOD     The beam current was monitored by a microammeter.
           (PHD)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) To detect gamma-rays a large NaI phosphor
           photomultiplier detector (3.inch diam., 3.inch long)
           was placed outside the vacuum, at 90.degr. with respect
           to the incident beam, 5/8 inch from the target.
           (PROPC) Reaction charged particles which came off at
           90. degr were collimated and counted by a proportional
           gas counter. To make the assignment of possible
           reactions with particular groups of pulse heights, this
           proportional counter could be replaced by a NaI crystal
           and photomultiplier.

REACTION   (3-LI-6(P,HE3)2-HE-4,,DA,,4PI)
            Data on fig. were presented with a continuous line
CORRECTION The absolute values of the slopes, however, did not
           agree with those predicted from theory. The difficult
           was traced to the fact that the thin targets  became
           'thick' targets at small bombarding energies where the
           cross sections vary rapidly with energy.
           Thick target data were taken and differentiated in
           2-keV intervals and the yields as a function of energy
           for the reactions (taken for thin target data) were
           then corrected.
SAMPLE     Evaporated Li6F into aluminum, copper and platinum
           plates. Target was about 8 mu-g/cm2 thick.
           Thick targets of Li6F were made by fusing the LiF onto
           a copper plate.
REL-REF    (R,,C.J.Taylor+,J,PR,84,1034,1951) - Data were used to
           calculate particle energy from the pulse height.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The probable error assigned to the Li cross
           sections with the assumption of spherical symmetry for
           the reaction products is 25%.
           The number of Li target atoms per square centimeter was
           determined by weighing the amount of LiF evaporated
           from a platinum boat onto platinum target holders. The
           number of counts per microCoulomb of beam per microgram
           per square centimeter of LiF for three such weightings
           agreed within 10%.

REACTION   (3-LI-7(P,G)4-BE-8,,DA,,4PI)
SAMPLE     Evaporated Li7F into aluminum, copper and platinum
           plates. Target was about 8 mu-g/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The probable error assigned to the Li cross
           sections with the assumption of spherical symmetry for
           the reaction products is 25%.
           The number of Li target atoms per square centimeter was
           determined by weighing the amount of LiF evaporated
           from a platinum boat onto platinum target holders. The
           number of counts per microCoulomb of beam per microgram
           per square centimeter of LiF for three such weightings
           agreed within 10%.
