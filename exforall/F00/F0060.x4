SAMPLE     LiF of natural isotopic content. Targets consisting of
            0.025 mg/cm2 LiF, evaporated on to thin carbon foils,
           approximately 0.0135 mg/cm2 in thickness.
ANALYSIS   This experiment was secondary to that of 19F(d,p)20F
            (see REL-REF). Two methods have been used to estimate
           the absolute differential cross sections for the
           lithium groups, since the absolute beam-charge incident
           on the target could not be reliably measured.
            1. Results obtained by Ono et al. (see MONIT-REF) were
           used to determine  the constant of proportionality (K)
           taking into account that the angular distributions
           obtained by these authors and present results are
           closely similar.
            2. The second method for obtaining K uses the measured
           absolute cross section of the 12C(d,p0)12C reaction
            (see REL-REF) and the ratio of the number of 6Li to
           12C atoms in the target.
