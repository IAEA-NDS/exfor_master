REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,25,2168,198205)
MONITOR    (3-LI-7(D,P)3-LI-8,,DA,,,EXP) Absolute differential
           cross sections were obtained by normalization to a
           separately measured 50 degr. excitation fuction.
SAMPLE     Thin films (36-45 mu-g/cm2) of LiF (enriched to 99.99%
           Li-7) evaporated on 10 mu-g/cm**2 Al foils
METHOD     (TOF,PHD)
FACILITY   (DYNAM)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 300 mu-m thick collimated Si surface-barrier
           detector mountedon a movable arm.
           A second similar detector, fixed at an angle of 157.5
           degr. with the respect to the incident beam, served as
           a monitor.
