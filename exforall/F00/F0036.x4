SAMPLE     Targets of LiF (enriched to 99.99% in Li-7) ranging in
           thickness from 20-260 mu-g/cm**2 were sandwiched
           between thin layers of Au (5 mu-g/cm**2) by successive
           vacuum evaporation (Au-LiF-Au) onto carbon (10 mu-g/
           cm**2) and aluminium (0.8-1.2 mu-g/cm**2) foils
FACILITY   (DYNAM) Argonne 4.5 MeV
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two silicon detectors.
