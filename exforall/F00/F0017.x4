SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.879) Thick targets of 6LiF were made by
           sedimentation onto Cu backing, the enrichment to 87.9%
            6Li
FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two 100 mu-m thick CA 80-15 cellulose-nitrate
            (SSNTD) were used
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           If the errors are systematic ones only, then the above
           results should be multiplied by roughly sqrt(5). In
           fact, the errors contain both statistical and systema-
           tic ones, and according the 'true' errors are between
           the two limiting cases.
           The uncertainty in the bombarding
           energy was estimated to be less than 4 keV

           State Nucl. Track Detectors' (79LYON).
