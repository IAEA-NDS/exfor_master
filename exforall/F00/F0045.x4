MONITOR    (3-LI-7(P,N)4-BE-7,,DA,,,EXP) were determined neutron
           detection efficiencies. At 0 degr. for Ep=2.9, 3.MeV
MONIT-REF  (,BURKE+,J,PR/C,10,(4),1299,197410)
SAMPLE     Targets were cut from 2 mm thick, 99.9 pure natural
           lithium ribbon which had been scraped clean of surface
           contaminants.
METHOD     (TOF)
FACILITY   (VDG)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 6.3 cm diameter, 1.3 cm thick Naton 136
           scintillator
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) excluding systematic errors, the
           overal uncertainty in the results
           (DATA-ERR1) from graphic bars ( indicate statistical
            uncertainties only, where they are shown)
           and digitizing
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in detector efficiency
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in neutron yield.
