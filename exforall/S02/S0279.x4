FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility in
                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE A typical beam intensity of about 500 pnA
SAMPLE     The 182W targets with a thickness of 300-350 ug/cm2
           were prepared by sputtering the material onto
           80-ug/cm2-thick carbon foils and then covered by
           10-ug/cm2-thick carbon layer.
DETECTOR   (PS,SISD,MAGSP) The recoiled evaporation residues
            (ERs) were separated efficiently by A gas-filled
           recoil separator, SHANS (Spectrometer for Heavy Atom
           and Nuclear Structure) and collected by three 16-strip
           position-sensitive silicon detectors (PSSDs), which
           were mounted side by side at the focal plane of the
           separator. Each PSSD has an active area of 50 X 50 mm2.
           The typical energy resolution for the PSSDs was 35 keV
            (FWHM) for 6-9 MeV alpha particles.
           (SI) Eight side silicon detectors (SSDs) were mounted
           in front of the PSSDs in an open box geometry.
           (MWPC) In order to distinguish the alpha-decay events
           from the implanted products, two multi-wire
           proportional counters were installed upstream from
           the PSSDs.
