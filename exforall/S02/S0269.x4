FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Radioactive ion beam line in
                           Lanzhou (RIBLL)
INC-SOURCE The secondary beam 17F was produced by the
           2H(16O,17F)n reaction. After the reaction, the
           secondary beam 17F was separated, purified, and
           transported by RIBLL to the secondary target chamber.
SAMPLE     A self-supported 208Pb target (2.0 mg/cm2 thick)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillators (C9H10) with a
           thickness of 10.16 um were installed in the beam line
           to give the time of flight (TOF) information.
           Behind the 208Pb target along the beam line a plastic
           scintillator with an active area of 40 X 40 mm2 and
           a thickness of 5 mm was installed to monitor the beam
           intensity. Its signals were read out by the
           multi-pixel photo counter (MPPC).
           (PPAC) Two parallel plate avalanche counters (PPAC)
           were installed at 984 mm and 290 mm in front of the
           208Pb target, respectively.
           (IOCH,SISD,SI,TELES) There are ten detector units
           around the 208Pb target, each unit contains one grid
           ionization chamber (IC), one double-sided silicon
           strip detector (DSSD), and two-quadrant silicon
           detectors (QSD). By using this design, heavy ions can
           be discriminated easily by the IC-DSSD combined
           telescopes, and light particles can be distinguished
           by the following two QSDs.
METHOD     (TOF) The TOF method was used to identify the beam
           particles.
           (EDE) Depending on two projected energy spectra, the
           conditions of selecting the scattered 17F can be
           determined.
