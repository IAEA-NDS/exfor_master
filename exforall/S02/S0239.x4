FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The Heavy Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE A 13C primary beam of 60 MeV/u at 50 enA supplied by
           HIRFL bombarded a 4 mm thick Be target in the primary
           target chamber of the Radioactive Ion Beam Line at
           Lanzhou (RIBLL), and the purity of 6He was 76%.
SAMPLE     The first 6 Si detectors act as both detectors and
           targets.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,CSICR) The telescope is composed of 7
           Gold silicon surface barrier semiconductor detectors
           and 1 CsI(T1) detector. The thickness of the 7 Si
           detectors are 1000, 700, 2000, 1000, 1000, 2000, 700
           um. The effective area is 150 mm2. CsI(T1) detector
           is 10 mm in thickness and 70 x 70 mm2.
METHOD     (TOF) The time resolution of the TOF device is better
           than 200 ps.
           (EDE) The reaction products are identified by EDE
           method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No detailed information on uncertainty
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are obtained from TABLE 1 of
           Nucl.Phys.Rev.,9,387,2002
