FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Radioactive Ion Beam Line
                           in Lanzhou (RIBLL)
INC-SOURCE (FRAGM) A 16C secondary beam at about 24.0
           MeV/nucleon was produced from a 18O primary beam at
           59.6MeV/nucleon impinging on a 9Be target with a
           thickness of 4.5 mm. The average beam intensity and
           the purity of 16C were up to 1E4 particles per second
           and 90%, respectively.
METHOD     (COINC) Detection of outgoing 16C and recoil
           protons/deuterons in coincidence.
           (EDEG,TOF,EDE) The secondary beam was purified by a
           uniform 650-um aluminum degrader, and was identified
           by the time-of-flight and energy losses. The charged
           particles were detected and identified with standard
           Delta E-E methods.
SAMPLE     A 4.37 +- 0.05 mg/cm2 (CH2)n target was used to
           measure the protons scattering data.
           A 9.53 +- 0.12 mg/cm2 (CD2)n target were used to
           measure the deuterons scattering data.
           A 13.73 +-0.13 mg/cm2 carbon target was employed to
           subtract the background coming from carbon atoms in
           the (CH2)n and (CD2)n targets.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Three PPACs were installed upstream of targets
           to provide beam tracking information, with a
           resolution of the hit position on the target less
           than 1.0 mm.
           (TELES,SISD,SI,CSICR) A set of double-sided annular
           silicon strip detector (DSSD) and five telescopes (T0,
           T1UP, T1DOWN, T2UP, T2DOWN) were used to detect
           and identify the charged particles. T0 and T2 were
           employed to detect the elastic and inelastic
           scattering channels. The telescope T0 consists of
           three 1000-um-thick DSSDs, three 1500-um-thick
           large-surface silicon detectors (SSDs), and a layer of
           4-cm-thick CsI(Tl) crystals. The telescope T2 was
           composed of a 300-um-thick DSSD, a 1500-um-thick SSD,
           and a layer of CsI(Tl) crystals. other telescopes were
           employed to detect transfer reaction channels.

           the thickness of the target, the particle
           identification gate of 16C, and the cuts applied on
           the Q-value spectra.
