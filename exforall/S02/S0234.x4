FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility in
                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The collimated 9Be beam with an initial energy of
           50.4 MeV was delivered by HIRFL. The average beam
           current was about 13 enA.
SAMPLE     Five 89Y targets with thickness of about 1.0 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) The offline gamma-ray spectroscopy
           in continuation to the online stacked-foil activation
           method. The irradiation lasted about 12 h.
           (BCINT) The beam flux was extracted using a precise
           current-integrator device from the charge collected
           at the Faraday cup, which is biased with a negative
           400 V electrode and installed at the back of targets.
DETECTOR   (SI) Two silicon detectors were mounted at +-30 deg
           with respect to the beam line to cross-check the beam
           flux that impinged on the targets.
           (HPGE) For performing offline measurements, a setup
           formed by five high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector
           groups was used. Each group composed of two HPGe
           detectors placed at an angle of 180 deg to each
           other. The gamma sources of 60Co, 133Ba, and 152Eu
           were used to calculate the absolute efficiency of the
           detectors.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The systematic uncertainties are added in
           quadrature to the statistical errors to get the total
           errors
           (ERR-1) Target thickness, about 3.%
           (ERR-2) Beam intensity, about 3.%
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency, about 3.%
