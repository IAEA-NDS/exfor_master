                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The collimated 9Be beam with an initial energy of
           50.3 MeV was delivered by HIRFL. The beam current was
           about 20 enA.
SAMPLE     Two stacks of 181Ta targets having thickness in the
           range of 0.43-0.59 mg/cm2
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) A stacked foil online activation
           followed by an offline gamma-ray spectroscopy method.
           After the 13 hours irradiation for two stacks in two
           individual runs, the activated targets were
           transferred to a separate laboratory for offline
           measurements. The first activity measurement was done
           by the eight CANBERRA High Purity Germanium (HPGe)
           detector groups. The second activity measurement was
           carried out about 2 months after the activation,
           using a commercial ORTEC Compton Suppression Counting
           System.
           (BCINT) The beam flux was determined from the charge
           collected in the Faraday cup installed after the
           targets by using a precise current-integrator device.
           The Faraday cup was biased with negative 400-V
           electrodes.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si (Au) surface-barrier detectors, at
           angles of +-30 deg with respect to the beam direction,
           were used to detect the elastically scattered 9Be
           particles form an Au foil placed upstream from the
           target stack.
           (HPGE) Each HPGe detector group consisted of two HPGe
           detectors in a face-to-face geometry, where single
           gamma-ray and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements
           could be performed simultaneously. The Ge crystal
           part of detector was surrounded by a Pb annular
           cylinder of 3 cm thickness to reduce background from
           natural radioactivity. The absolute efficiency of the
           detector was determined by using a set of calibrated
           radioactive sources (60Co, 133Ba, and 152Eu) placed
           in front of the HPGe detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The systematic uncertainties are added in
           quadrature to the statistical errors to get the total
           errors
           (ERR-1) Target thickness, about 3.%
           (ERR-2) Detector efficiency, about 5.%
