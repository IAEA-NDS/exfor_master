                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The collimated 9Be beam with an initial energy of
           50.4 MeV was delivered by HIRFL. The average beam
           current was about 13 enA.
SAMPLE     Five targets of 89Y, each with 197Au backing of about
           1 mg/cm2.
ANALYSIS   The authors assumed the number of the products escaped
            from the upstream Au foil (30% of the products) is
            equal the number of the products escaped to the
            downstream Au foil.
           The radioactivity of the first foil is much lower than
            the other four foils due to this reason and its
            effective beam energy is not given in Table II.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) A stacked foil online activation
           followed by an offline gamma-ray spectroscopy method.
           After the 12 hours irradiation, the activity of the
           targets was measured offline using five HPGe detector
           groups in a separate laboratory.
           (BCINT) The beam flux was calculated by the total
           charge collected in the Faraday cup placed behind the
           targets using a high precision current integrator.
           The Faraday cup was biased with a negative 400 V
           electrode on the collector to repel the secondary
           electrons.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) During the bombardments, two silicon surface-
           barrier detectors were placed at +-30 deg to the beam
           for monitoring the elastic scattering of the beam
           particles by an Au foil placed upstream from the
           target stack.
           (HPGE) Each HPGe detector group consisted of two HPGe
           detectors positioned 180 deg to each other, where
           single gamma-ray and gamma-gamma coincidence
           measurements could be performed simultaneously. The
           Ge crystal part of each detector was surrounded by a
           Pb annular cylinder of 3 cm thickness to reduce
           background from natural radioactivity. In addition,
           Pb blocks of 6 cm thickness were inserted between
           each adjacent detector group to shield gamma-rays
           from neighboring targets. The absolute efficiency of
           the detectors was determined using a set of activity
           calibrated radioactive sources (60Co, 133Ba, and
           152Eu) mounted with the same geometry as the targets.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors of the deduced cross sections are
           the combination of statistical error and following
           errors
           (ERR-1) Target thickness, about 3.%
           (ERR-2) Beam current, about 3.%
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency, about 3.%
