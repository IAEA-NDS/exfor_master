FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The External Target Facility (ETF) of
           the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou-Cooler
           Storage Ring(HIRFL-CSR)
INC-SOURCE Primary 18O beams were accelerated to 280 MeV/nucleon
           by HIRFL-CSR and fragmented on a 15-mm-thick Be target.
SAMPLE     900 mg/cm2 carbon target
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) The generated secondary beams were
           subsequently selected by their magnetic rigidities in
           the second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou
            (RIBLL2) and then delivered to ETF to impinge on a
           900 mg/cm2 carbon target, where their energies
           dropped to around 240 MeV/nucleon upon hitting the
           target.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) The particle Z number was recorded by the
           multisampling ionization chamber (MUSIC) downstream
           from the reaction target, while the particle TOF were
           given by the plastic scintillators and the TOF Wall.
           (TRD) The heavy reaction products were traced via a
           series of drift chambers, lined up along the
           particles' flying directions, with the latter
           constituting the multi-wire drift chamber (MWDC) Array.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) All the errors are statistical.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 1 of Phys. Rev.
           C 104, 014310, 2021.
