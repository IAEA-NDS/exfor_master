INC-SOURCE Primary beam of 16-O was produced and accelerated to
           360 MeV/nucleon by the synchrotron cooler storage
           main ring (CSRm). The 14-O secondary beam was
           produced by impinging on a beryllium production
           target of 2.79 g/cm2, and separated according to
           magnetic rigidity by using the Second Radioactive Ion
           Beam Line (RIBLL2).
SAMPLE     A 920 mg/cm2 thick carbon reaction target
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SI) The incident particles were identified by
           using a combination of the time of flight from SC1 to
           SC2 measured between two plastic scintillators (SC1
           and SC2) and the energy loss measured with a 290-um-
           thick silicon detector (Si1).
           (SCIN) A plastic scintillator (SC2) placed 15 cm
           upstream of the target and the time-of-flight wall
           with 30 plastic scintillator strips and an active
           area of 120 X 120 cm2 placed about 11 m downstream
           from the target were used to measure the time of
           flight.
           (SI) The energy loss was measured by a 290-um-thick
           silicon detector (Si2) placed 30 cm downstream of the
           reaction target.
METHOD     (TOF)
CORRECTION The background contributions were measured by using
           target-out runs and were subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty includes contributions
           from the statistical error, the particle selection,
           background subtraction, and detection efficiency.
