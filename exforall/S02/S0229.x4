                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE (FRAGM) 9Be and 10Be were produced as secondary beams
           by fragmentation of the 54.2 MeV/n 13C primary beam
           was impinged on the 4500 um thick beryllium target at
           the Radioactive Ion Beam Line of the HIRFL. The
           average intensities of 9Be and 10Be were 7E+3 and
           6E+3 pps, with purity of 98% and 98.5%, respectively.
SAMPLE     The 208 Pb target consisted of a self-supporting foil,
           8.52 mg/cm2 thick, which was made by evaporation and
           measured by weighing.
DETECTOR   (SISD,TELES,SIBAR) Two double-sided silicon strip
           detectors, with 16 horizontal and 16 vertical strips
           and 74 um and 87 um thick, were used to give the
           precise position and direction of the incident beam
           particles. These detectors were set 669 mm and 69 mm
           away from the target position, respectively. An array
           of three delta E-E particle telescopes was used to
           detect the scattered particles. Three double-sided
           silicon strip detectors with thickness of 301 um, 129
           um and 144 um were used as the delta E detectors in
           each telescope. For the E signal, three silicon
           detectors with thickness of 1536 um, 1535 um and 1528
           um were used. The full detector array was mounted 267
           mm downstream from the target, covering an angular
           range of 5 to 27 deg. The angular resolution was
           about 0.4 deg.
METHOD     (EDEG) An aluminum wedge, 1510 um thick, was placed
           at the first focal plane of the Radioactive Ion Beam
           Line of the HIRFL as a degrader.
           (TOF,EDE) Secondary beams were identified and
           discriminated using a combination of time-of-flight
           and energy loss (ToF-Delta E) signals. Elastic
           scattering events were detected using three sets of
           delta E-E silicon telescopes.
