INC-SOURCE The incident beam current was limited to less than 30
           nA as monitored by a Faraday cup. During the
           experiment, the chamber was kept at a high vacuum of
           less than 3.0E-5 Pa.
SAMPLE     A thin solid target Ni/TiTx/Al2O3 was prepared by the
           conventional hydrogenation method, the atomic ratios
           of Ti, T and H is 10:8:1, and the atomic thickness of
           the TiTx layer is about 3.5E17 atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) An Au/Si surface barrier detector was
           employed to detect the backscattered ions at a
           laboratory angle of 165 deg, with a solid angle of
           0.00183 sr. At a laboratory angle of 30 deg, another
           Au/Si surface barrier detector with a solid angle of
           0.00246 sr was placed to detect the elastic recoil
           spectrum. The angular resolution of both detectors
           were approximately +-0.5 deg and the energy
           resolution of the detection system was about 30 keV
           for 12C ions.
METHOD     The relative determination method.
