FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou.
INC-SOURCE The secondary beam 17F was produced by the
           1H(17O,17F)n reaction and was separated, purified
           and transported to the secondary target chamber. The
           primary beam 17O8+ with a beam intensity of 1 puA was
           accelerated up to 7.6 MeV/u, passed through
           21-um-thick aluminum foil, and bombarded a H-2 gas
           target. The gas is confined into a cylindrical cell
           with 30-mm-diameter windows and a length of 80 mm.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Two multiwire proportional chambers were
           installed 1666 and 1285 mm in front of target Y-89.
           (TELES,SISD,SI) Four sets EDE detector telescope
           around the Y-89 target, were symmetrically mounted
           along the beam line and cover the angular range of
           15-115 degree. Each telescope consisting of double-
           sided silicon strip detectors (DSSD) and square
           silicon detectors (SSD) . The DSSD was 65 um thick
           and 50*50 mm2 in area, the SSD was 300 um thick and
           50*50 mm2 in area. The SSD is mounted behind DSSD,
           which had a strip 3 mm wide and 0.1 mm thick. The
           distances from the center of DSSD to the target
           center are 72 and 77 mm, respectively.
           (SCIN) Behind the Y-89 target along the beam line a
           plastic scintillation detector with 5 mm thick and
           100*100 mm2 in area was installed to monitor the beam.
SAMPLE     The target Y-89 with the thickness of 0.981 mg/cm2 was
           tilted at 65 degree with respect to the beam line.
METHOD     (TOF) Two plastic scintillators (C9H10) 10 um thick
           were installed in the beam line to give the time of
           flight information with 1680 cm flight length. The
           time resolution of TOF is less than 140 ps for 25
           MeV/u 40Ar. Each plastic scintillator is connected
           with an R2083 photomultitube.
           (EDE) The scattered particles were detected by a
           zero-degree EDE detector telescopes.
