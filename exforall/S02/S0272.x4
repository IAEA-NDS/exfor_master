           of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL)
SAMPLE     A 186W target with average thickness of 200 ug/cm2
           was evaporated on a 50 ug/cm2 of carbon, and covered
           with a 10 ug/cm2 of carbon layer.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporated residues (ERs) yielded in the
           fusion evaporation reaction 40Ar+186W were filtrated
           by the Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear
           Structure (SHANS).
           (PS,SISD,SI,MWPC) The ERs were implanted into three
           300 um thick position-sensitive strip detectors (PSSDs)
           with each active area of 50 X 50 mm2. Eight additional
           non-position-sensitive side silicon detectors (SSDs)
           were mounted upstream. The total detection efficiency
           for the emitted alpha was measured to be about 72%.
           To distinguish the alpha events from the implanting
           events, two multi-wire proportional counters (MWPCs)
           were mounted 15 cm and 25 cm upstream from the PSSDs.
           Three extra non-position-sensitive silicon detectors,
           featuring the same size as the PSSDs, were installed
           side by side after the PSSDs to provide the veto
           signals from the light particles passing through
           the PSSDs.
           (HPGE) Near the charged particle detection system,
           two High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors and one
           clover detector were mounted at the right side,
           downward, and downstream, respectively.
INC-SOURCE A beam of 40Ar with an energy of 198.7 MeV and an
           intensity of 300 pnA.
