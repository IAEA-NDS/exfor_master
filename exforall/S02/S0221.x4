FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) External Target Facility (ETF)
INC-SOURCE (FRAGM) A primary beam of 18O was accelerated to 280
           MeV/nucleon by the main Cooler Storage Ring (CSRm)
           synchrotron of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL) and directed onto a Be target of 15 mm
           thickness. The unstable secondary beams produced
           by fragmentation of 18O were separated using the
           Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou-II (RIBLL2) and
           transported to the experimental area where the ETF is
           located.
SAMPLE     A 900 mg/cm2 thick carbon target.
DETECTOR   The acceptance of the ETF detector system for the 15B
           fragments amounted to about 100%. The detection
           efficiency of the ETF was calibrated using the
           various secondary beams, and the derived efficiencies
           were 80%-90%, depending on the charge number of the
           beam particles.
           (SCIN,IOCH) The time of flight was measured between
           two plastic scintillator detectors (SC1 and SC2) and
           the energy loss was recorded by a multiple sampling
           ionization chamber (MUSIC1). The time of flight was
           measured between a plastic scintillator (SC2) and a
           30-strip plastic scintillator wall (TOFW) placed
           about 10 m downstream from the target. The energy
           loss was measured by a multiple sampling ionization
           chamber (MUSIC2) placed 50 cm downstream of the
           reaction target.
           (MWDC) Two multiwire drift chambers, located upstream
           of the carbon target and each having an active area
           of 13 x 13 cm2, were used to measure the trajectories
           of the incoming particles. The magnetic rigidity of
           the outgoing charged fragments passing through the
           ETF magnet was reconstructed from the positions
           measured using two MWDCs placed upstream and three
           MWDCs placed downstream of the magnet. The two MWDCs
           placed upstream of the magnet have an active area of
           13 x 13 cm2. Each of the three MWDCs downstream of
           the magnet has an active area of 80 x 60 cm2.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The secondary cocktail beams, magnetically
           centered on 16C, were identified using the TOF-dE
           method.
           (COINC) The trigger of the data acquisition system
           was generated only by requiring the coincidence of
           the signals from SC1 and SC2, both in front of the
           reaction target.
ANALYSIS   To avoid effects arising from reactions on the target
           frame, the beam-spot size on the target was limited
           to 4 cm in diameter in the off-line analysis by
           setting a software gate using the information from
           the MWDCs. The background contributions were measured
           by using target-out runs and subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties are dominated by
           statistical errors, while systematic errors mainly
           arise from the correction for the ETF detection
           efficiency and are added to the statistical
           uncertainty in quadrature.
