FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL).
SAMPLE     (73-TA-181,NAT=0.99) Two stacks of 181Ta targets were
           irradiated individually, with thicknesses in the
           range of 430 to 590 mu-g/cm2. Each stack was composed
           of eight 181Ta foils backed with Al foils of 0.92 to
           1.07 mg/cm2 thick and prepared by high vacuum
           evaporation technique at the China Institute of
           Atomic Energy (CIAE), Beijing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si(Au) surface-barrier detectors, at
           angles of +-30 degree with respect to the beam
           direction, were used to detect the elastically
           scattered particles from an Au foil placed upstream
           from the target stack.
           (HPGE) One dedicated high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           array coupled to a Versa Module Europa (VME)-based
           data acquisition system (DAQ), to measure the induced
           activity in the target-catcher assembly. There were
           eight detector groups in this array, which could
           detect the gamma rays independently. Each group
           consisted of two HPGe detectors in a face-to-face
           geometry, where single gamma-ray measurement and
           gamma-gamma coincidence measurement could be made
           simultaneously. A thick Pb shield was inserted
           between two detector groups to reduce scattered gamma
           rays from neighboring targets and background from
           natural radio activity.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The offline gamma ray spectroscopy
           method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors are minimum of about 5.4% for the
           highest beam energies, and increase as one goes down
           in energy to a maximum of about 44% at lower energy.
           The errors are mainly due to the statistical
           uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) The target thickness.
           (ERR-2) The efficiency of the HPGe detector.
