SAMPLE     A cylindrical lead target with 10 cm diameter and 10
           cm length.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma activity of Au foils was measured
           with several high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors.
           The detectors relative efficiency were about 65% and
           energy resolutions were 1.90 keV at 1.33 MeV. The
           absolute efficiency was calibrated with the standard
           sources 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, and 152Eu.
           (IOCH) An air ionization chamber was placed in front
           of the target to monitor the beam current.
METHOD     Water-bath gold activation-foil method.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation lasted about 22 h. The total
           number of protons was (1.69+-0.05)E12.
           (GSPEC) The Au-foil activities were determined by
           measuring the peak intensities of the 412 keV line
           from 198Au.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall uncertainty included the
           systematic error in the measurement is +-8%.

COMMENT    Initially, the measured yield of the neutrons emitted
           from the target was deduced to be 1.91+-0.16
           n/proton. After taking into account the influence of
           the Au foils with Cd cover on the production of
           thermal neutrons. Finally, the value was determined
           to be 2.23+-0.19 n/proton.
CORRECTION The measured neutron flux in those positions
           influenced by the Cd cover.
