FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL) of the Heavy-Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE Secondary 7Be and 8B radioactive beams were produced
           by fragmentation of a primary 59.7 MeV/u 12C6+ beam
           from the HIRFL on a 2528-um-thick 9Be production
           target. The primary beam had an average intensity of
           about 130 enA. The 7Be and 8B projectile-like
           fragments were separated by their magnetic rigidity
           and delivered by the RIBLL to the scattering chamber.
           The average intensities of 7Be and 8B radioactive
           beams were 6500 and 550 pps, with purities of 57.6%
           and 4.9%, respectively.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of an 8.26-mg/cm2-thick
           self-supporting foil, made by the evaporation method.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillators were placed at the
           second and fourth focal planes of RIBLL as time-of-
           flight detectors.
           (SI,SISD,TELES,CSICR) A 317-um-thick silicon detector
           was placed at the fourth focal plane to measure the
           energy loss of the fragments for particle
           identification purpose during the beam tuning, and
           removed from the beam line during the runs.
           Two double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs),
           segmented into 16 horizontal and 16 vertical strips
           of 3 mm width on each side, were used to provide the
           precise position and direction of the incident beam
           particles, with thicknesses of 87 um and 74 um, were
           placed 1516 and 714 mm away from the target.
           The detection setup was comprised of two delta E-E
           telescopes were used to measure the reaction
           products. Each telescope was made up of a thin DSSD,
           a silicon detector, a thick DSSD, and a CsI(Tl)
           crystal array. The thin DSSDs (301 and 142 um thick)
           and the thick DSSDs (1004 and 998 um thick) with 32
           strips on each side and an active area of 64 mm X 64
           mm were used as Delta-E detectors. The silicon
           detectors have thicknesses of 1528 and 1535 um and
           were used to measure the residual energy of the
           scattered and breakup 8B and 7Be particles. The CsI
           arrays served as the E detectors. These two telescopes
           were mounted 272 mm downstream from the target,
           covering a polar angular range from 3 to 20 deg in the
           laboratory frame with a resolution of about 0.4 deg.
           The detectors were calibrated with the elastically
           scattered 1H, 4He, 6Li, 7Be, and 8B particles.
METHOD     (EDEG) A 500-um-thick aluminum plate was placed at
           the first momentum-dispersive focal plane of RIBLL as
           a degrader.
           (TOF,EDE,MAGFR) A complete particle identification
           was enabled using a combination of the time-of-flight,
           energy loss, and magnetic rigidity.
