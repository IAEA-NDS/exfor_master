FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Cooler Storage Ring at the Heavy Ion
           Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR)
INC-SOURCE The 58Ni19+ beam was accelerated up to an energy of
           95 MeV/u by the heavy-ion synchrotron CSRm and then
           extracted and transported to the experimental storage
           ring CSRe via the second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL2). The radioactive ion beams can be
           produced by using projectile fragmentation reactions
           at the RIBLL2. The 58Ni19+ ions were stored in the
           CSRe with an intensity of about 1E7 particles in each
           measurement cycle.
SAMPLE     A typical diameter of the gas-jet target is about 4 mm
           at the interaction point, the target density is about
           1012 atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SI) In order to measure very low energy recoil
           protons, a single-sided silicon detector (SSSD) with
           a thickness of 300 um has been installed in the ultra-
           high-vacuum (UHV) chamber, which is connected to the
           CSRe. The SSSD with an active area of 48 x 48 mm2,
           mounted at a distance of 503 mm from the reaction
           collision point, covers the laboratory angular range
           from 85 to 90 deg for proton recoils. It was
           calibrated by using 207Bi, 239Pu, and 241Am
           radioactive sources.
           (SILI) To determine accurately the reaction
           luminosity, the k-shell x-rays from inner-shell
           ionization of 58Ni19+ ions, which were produced in
           the collisions with the H2 target, have been measured
           simultaneously with a Si(Li) detector. It is placed
           at 35 deg, at a distance to the collision point of
           488 mm. It was separated from the UHV environment of
           the CSRe by a 100-um beryllium window and collimated
           by a hole of 4 x 8 mm2. It was calibrated with 55Fe,
           109Cd, 133Ba, and 241Am radioactive sources.
