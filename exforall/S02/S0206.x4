FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility
                           of Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE (FRAGM) The secondary beams of radioactive isotopes
            were produced by the fragmentation of the 12C6+
            primary beam on a 9Be target with a thickness of 2652
            um using the HIRFL. The secondary beams 7Be, 8B, and
            9C, were separated by magnetic rigidity and delivered
            by the Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL).
            The beam intensities of 7Be, 8B, and 9C were
            1.5E4 pps, 1.0E3 pps, and 5.0E2 pps, respectively.
SAMPLE     The natural Pb target was a self-supporting foil with
            a thickness of 4.2 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The ToF was measured with two 50-um-thick
            plastic scintillators located on the second and
            fourth focal planes of the RIBLL.
           (SI) The energy loss for each beam was measured with
            a 280-um-thick silicon detector.
           (PS,PPAC) Two position-sensitive parallel-plate
            avalanche counters (PPACs), with a position
            resolution of 1 mm, were fixed in front of the natPb
            target, at distances of 100 and 500 mm, respectively.
            Each PPAC had 80 gold-plated tungsten wires as anode
            in both the X and the Y directions. The tungsten
            wires, 20 um in diameter, were spaced 1 mm apart,
            providing a sensitive area of 80 x 80 cm2.
           (TELES,SISD,SIBAR) Two sets of delta E-E silicon
            telescopes, which consisted of a double-sided silicon
            strip detector (48 strips of 1 mm width, each
            including a 0.1 mm interval) with a thickness of 150
            um and a large surface silicon detector with a
            thickness of 1500 um. Each telescope covered a polar
            angle of 7-30 deg in the laboratory frame, on either
            side of the beam axis. The distances from the natPb
            target to the center of the telescopes were 247 and
            201 mm, respectively.
METHOD     (EDEG) A 301-um-thick aluminum plate, located on the
            second focal plane of the RIBLL, was utilized to
            degrade the incident energy and to improve the purity
            of the secondary beams.
           (TOF,EDE) Secondary beams were identified using a
            time-of-flight and energy loss (ToF-Delta E)
            technique with a certain magnetic rigidity. Elastic
            scattering events were detected using two sets of
            delta E-E silicon telescopes.
