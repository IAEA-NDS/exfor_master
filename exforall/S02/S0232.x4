SAMPLE     Stack of two Al targets sandwiched with three CR-39
           sheets, one CR-39 sheet placed before and after each
           target. The thickness of first and second Al targets
           were 2.0 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively.
COMMENT    The beam energy on each target front surface was
           calculated using SRIM-2008 simulation code. The beam
           energy on first and second Al targets front surface
           were 497 MeV/n and 478 MeV/n, respectively.

SAMPLE     Stack of two C targets sandwiched with three CR-39
           sheets, one CR-39 sheet placed before and after each
           target. The thickness of two C targets were 5.0 mm.
