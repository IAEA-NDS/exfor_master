FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 1.7 MV tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE A proton beam was accelerated to energies ranging
           from 1.4 MeV to 2.8 MeV with a typical intensity of 5
           uA and with a beam-spot diameter of 4 mm.
SAMPLE     (32-GE-74,ENR=0.998) The 99.8% enriched 74Ge was
           evaporated and deposited onto an air-cooled Ta disk
           with the thickness of 300 um. The diameter and
           thickness were 18.6 mm and 295+-16 ug/cm2,
           respectively. The target and its backing of Ta was
           placed at the end of the beam pipe, also served to
           seal the vacuum. The beam pipe with a length of 400
           mm and an inner diameter of 18 mm was electrically
           isolated from the rest of the beam line for
           monitoring the beam intensity. A pure Ta disk with
           the thickness of 300 um was used to evaluate the
           in-beam background.
METHOD     (BCINT) The escape probability for secondary
           electrons is approximately 0.013% by assuming an
           isotropic emission.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detectors were positioned 8 cm away
           from the target and their angles were 12, 108, 210
           and 302 deg to the beam axis respectively. The
           absolute efficiencies of these four detectors at the
           lower energies were calibrated using a standard 152Eu
           source, while the efficiencies at the higher energies
           were calibrated using the 27Al(p,g)28Si reaction at
           Ep = 992 keV.
ANALYSIS   For each beam energy in the experiment, 36
           gamma-transitions to the g.s. were observed at each
           angle. More than 1008 peaks were analyzed to
           determine the total cross sections of the
           74Ge(p,g)75As reaction for seven different proton
           energies.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties result from the
           statistical and the systematic errors.
           (ERR-S,7.4,14.3) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic error includes the
           uncertainties from the target thickness, the
           calibration of detection efficiencies, the beam
           normalization, and the correction of the beam pipe
           and the Ta backing.
