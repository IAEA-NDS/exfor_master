TITLE      Non-Rutherford elastic scattering cross sections for
           160 deg backscattering of 1.30 - 2.21 MeV protons on
           silicon

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRLNZ) 2*1.7 MV tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE Accelerator high voltage was scaled by the resonance
           991.1 and 1799.8 keV of 27Al(n,g)28Si. The ion beam
           energy at 1.0 MeV, the energy dispersion was less
           than 2 keV.
SAMPLE     The experimental target was made of graphite
           substrate. Purity of 99 99% of silicon was evaporated
           on the carbon substrate, and then 99.99% pure gold
           was evaporated on the silicon film. The thickness of
           silicon target and gold film obtained from 4He
           backscatter analysis were 4.7E8 and 2.4E17 atoms/cm2.
METHOD     The measurement angle was 160 deg. The beam was
           collimated through two apertures spaced 1.5 meters
           apart. The spot area on the target was 0.7mm *0.7 mm.
           The detection solid angle was 0.48 +- 0.01 msr.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)The detector energy resolution was 12 keV. The
           gold silicon surface barrier detector energy
           spectrometer was used to measure the backscatter
           energy spectrum of each energy point.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The experimental standard deviation
