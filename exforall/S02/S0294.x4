FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Radioactive Ion Beam Line
                           in Lanzhou (RIBLL)
INC-SOURCE 9Be(18O,16C). A 16C secondary beam was produced from
            a 59.6-MeV/nucleon 18O primary beam impinging on a
            4.5-mm thick 9Be target. The average beam intensity
            and the purity of 16C were up to about 1E4 particles
            per second and 90%, respectively. The beam energy was
            about 23.5 MeV/nucleon.
SAMPLE     A 9.53 +- 0.12 mg/cm2 (CD2)n target was used to
            measure the inelastic scattering data.
           A 13.73 +- 0.13 mg/cm2 carbon target was employed
            to subtract the background coming from carbon atoms
            in the (CD2)n target.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The time-of-flight provided by two plastic
            scintillator detectors and energy losses in a
            large-surface silicon detector were used to identify
            the second-beam.
           (PPAC) Three PPACs were installed upstream of targets
            to provide beam tracking information, with a
            resolution of the hit position on the target less
            than 1.0 mm.
           (TELES,SISD,SI,CSICR) Several sets of telescopes were
            installed in a large vacuum chamber to detect and
            identify charged particles using a standard dE-E
            method. The telescope T0 and T2 were placed 156 and
            157 mm away from the target to distinguish the carbon
            isotopes at forward angles and the recoil deuterons
            emitting to backward angles, respectively. The
            telescope T0 installed at around 0 degree is made up
            of three 1000-um-thick double sided silicon strip
            detectors, three 1500-um-thick SSDs, and a layer of
            4-cm-thick CsI(Tl) crystals read out by photodiodes.
            The telescope T2, which consists of a 300-um-thick
            DSSD, a 1500-um-thick SSD, and a layer of CsI(Tl)
            crystals, was placed at ~69 degree relative to the
            beam direction. Each DSSD with an active area of
            63.96 mm x 63.96 mm is divided into 32 strips on both
            sides. The angular coverage of the telescopes T0 and
            T2 are 0~12 degree and 57~82 degree, respectively.
            The overall angular resolution of the telescope T2
            was about 0.92 degree (FWHM).
METHOD     (COINC) Detection of outgoing 16C and recoil
           deuterons in coincidence.
