TITLE      The measurement of 12C(p,gamma)13N cross section in
           low energy range

FACILITY   (VDG) 400 kV High Voltage Multiplier
INC-SOURCE Proton beam was 100 mA. The diameter of focus was 3
           mm. Energy of proton was 150 - 250 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The half-life of N-13 was 10.13 +- 0.1 min.
           The maximum energy of positron was 1.20 +- 0.005 MeV.
           After 2 half-lives of irradiation, the high voltage
           and proton beam were removed. The target ball was
           turned 180 deg immediately, to face the beta counter.
           Counting time was 2 half-lives.
DETECTOR   Beta counter was used to detect the beta positron.
           The beta counter was covered with lead in the
           thickness of 52 mm and 12 gamma counters were placed
           round the beta counter, to reduce the background.

SAMPLE     The target in the thickness of 0.5 mm was made from
           coal smoke. 3 carbon targets and 1 quartz plate were
           placed on the target ball.
