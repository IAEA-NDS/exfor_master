FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) The NEC 9SDH-2 2x3 MV tandem
           accelerator, the beam current is about 30 uA.
SAMPLE     Ta/TiHx/Si is used, and the atomic ratio of H to Ti
           in sample is above 150%. The areal density of H
           relative to Ta was determined by their scattering
           with 12C assuming Rutherford scattering.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The RBS detector was fixed at the laboratory
           backscattering angle of 165degree and it subtended a
           solid angle of 1.83E-3 sr. The ERD detector was fixed
           at the laboratory recoil angle of 30 degree and it
           subtended a solid angle of 1.12E-3 sr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T,,5.2) Total uncertainty is less than 5.2%.
