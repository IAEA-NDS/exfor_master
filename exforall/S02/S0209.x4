INC-SOURCE The 40Ar ions were accelerated to an energy of 201
           MeV with a typical intensity of 500 pnA.
SAMPLE     (75-RE-185,NAT=0.948) A 185Re target with a thickness
           of 400 ug/cm2 was prepared by sputtering the material
           onto a 45 ug/cm2 thick carbon foil, and then covered
           by a 10 ug/cm2 thick carbon layer.
METHOD     A total of 2.1E18 ions were delivered to the target
           over a period of 189 hours.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The gas-filled recoil separator SHANS (
           Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear Structure)
           was used for the separation of recoiled evaporation
           residues (ERs) from the primary beam particles and
           other unwanted reaction products. The transport
           efficiency of the separator was estimated to be 14%
           by using the test reaction 40Ar + 175Lu.
           (PS,SI,MWPC) The ERs were implanted into three
           position-sensitive 16-strip detectors (PSSDs),
           which were mounted side by side at the focal plane of
           the separator. The energy, position, and time of the
           implantation of the ERs and their subsequent
           alpha-decay events were measured using these
           detectors. To detect the alpha particles escaping
           from the PSSDs, eight side silicon detectors (SSDs)
           were mounted perpendicular to the surface of PSSDs in
           an open box geometry. The total detection efficiency
           of the detector array was measured to be 72%. In
           order to distinguish the alpha-decay events from the
           implantation ones, two multiwire proportional
           counters were mounted upstream from the PSSDs. Behind
           the PSSDs, three punch-through silicon detectors were
           mounted for the rejection of signals produced by
           energetic light particles.

           Based on the measurement of the correlated alpha-decay
           chains, the decay properties of 220Np with alpha
           energies (10040+-18 keV) and half-life (25+14-7 us)
           were determined. A 100% branching ratio was assumed
           for the calculation of half-lives.
