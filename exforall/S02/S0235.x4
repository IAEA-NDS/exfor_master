            9,10B+208Pb datasets compiled separately
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL) of the Heavy-Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The secondary 9Be, 10Be, and 11Be beams were produced
           by the fragmentation of a primary 13C beam, delivered
           by the HIRFL on a 4500 um Be target at 54.2 MeV/n,
           with the beam intensities were 7E+3, 6E+3 and 2E+3
           particles per second, respectively.
SAMPLE     The 208Pb target is a self-supporting foil with a
           thickness of 8.52 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SISD,TELES) Two double-sided silicon strip
           detectors (DSSDs), are positioned at 669 mm and 69 mm
           away from the target position, respectively.
           Their thicknesses are 74 and 87 um, and both have 16
           horizontal and 16 vertical strips. An array of three
           delta E-E particle telescopes, were used to detect
           the scattered particles. Each of these telescopes
           consisted of a DSSD and a single-sided detector (SSD),
           covering a range of scattering angles from 5 to 27 deg
           in the laboratory system. The detector array
           assembly was mounted 267 mm downstream the target.
           The DSSDs in these telescopes consisted of 32 strips
           on each side with 64 X 64 mm2 of total active areas,
           and are 301, 129, and 144 um thick, respectively.
           They used to determine the positions of the scattered
           particles accurately within areas of 2 X mm2. The SSD
           detectors, which provided the E signals of the
           scattered particles, have thicknesses of 1536, 1535,
           and 1528 um, respectively and have the same effective
           areas as the DSSDs.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The secondary beams were identified using
           the time-of-flight measurement between two 50 um
           thick plastic scintillators 1680 cm apart. Elastic
           scattering events were detected using three three
           delta E-E particle telescopes.
