INC-SOURCE A 40 MeV/nucleon 17C secondary beam with an intensity
           of about 1000 pps and a purity of about 60% was
           produced from the fragmentation of 18O at 69.7
           MeV/nucleon on a 4.615 mm thick 9Be target. The
           incident 17C was extracted by selecting the time of
           fight between two plastic scintillator detectors and
           the energy deposited in a square silicon detector.
           The incident trajectory of each particle was
           reconstructed by three parallel-plane avalanche
           counters (PPAC). Their position resolutions are 1 mm
           in both horizontal and vertical directions.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) A zero-degree telescope consisting
           of a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) and a
           8*8 CsI(Tl) array. The DSSD has a thickness of 527 um
           and an active area of 50*50 mm2, it has 16 strips
           with a width of 3 mm on each side. The angular
           coverage of the telescope is 0-4.7 degree in the
           laboratory system, the angular resolution of the
           detection system is about 0.85 degree.
SAMPLE     A 225 mg/cm2 thick carbon target
METHOD     (TOF) A flight path of 17 m was used for the beam
           particle identification.
           (EDE) The scattered particles were detected by a
           zero-degree EDE detector telescopes.
