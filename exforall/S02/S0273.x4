FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL) of the Heavy-Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 12C at the energy of 53.7 MeV/n,
           accelerated and delivered by the HIRFL, was impinged
           on a 9Be target of 3038 um thickness to produce the
           secondary beam. The 32.7 MeV/n secondary 9Li beam was
           separated and purified with an Al degrader of 2153 um
           thickness using the RIBLL. The intensity of the
           secondary 9Li beam was about 1.1E+3 particles per
           second, with the purity better than 90%.
SAMPLE     A self-supported natural Pb target with a thickness
           of 526.9 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Three parallel-plate avalanche counters with
           position resolutions better than 1 mm were placed
           before the reaction target to determine the position
           and incident angle of the secondary beam event by
           event.
           (TELES,SISD,CSICR) A zero-degree telescope array
           consisting of two E detectors (double-sided silicon
           strip detectors, DSSDs) and an 8 X 8 CsI(Tl)
           scintillator array as an E detector, which covered
           the angular range from 0 to 10 deg, were used to
           measure the charged fragments. The two DSSDs, with a
           thickness of 523 um and 527 um, have the same
           sensitive area of 49 X 49 mm2. Each DSSD is divided
           into 16 strips on both the front and rear sides. Each
           CsI(Tl) scintillator is composed of a frustum of a
           pyramid with 21 X 21 mm2 on the front end and 23 X 23
           mm2 on the back, and the length of each scintillator
           is 50 mm. Each scintillator is coupled with a
           photomultiplier tube. The secondary beams of 9Li,
           6He, 4He, and 3H produced from the 12C primary beam
           were used to calibrate the telescope.
METHOD     (EDEG) An Al degrader of 2153 um thickness.
           (COINC) Detection of 6He and triton in coincidence.
PART-DET   (T,2-HE-6) The events with T and 6He, which result
           from the decay of the excited 9Li for the first peak
           at 9.8 MeV.
