FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility in
                           Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE The collimated 9Be beam with an initial energy of
           50.4 MeV was delivered by HIRFL. The average beam
           current was about 13 enA.
SAMPLE     Five targets of 89Y, each with thickness of about 1
           mg/cm2.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) A stacked foil online activation
           followed by an offline gamma-ray spectroscopy method.
           After the 12 hours irradiation, the gamma activity of
           the targets was measured offline using five HPGe
           detector groups.
           (BCINT) A high-precision current integrator was
           employed to measure the beam flux deposited at the
           Faraday cup, placed after the target. In order to
           repel the secondary electrons, the Faraday cup was
           biased with a negative 400 V electrode on the
           collector.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two silicon surface- barrier detectors were
           mounted at +-30 deg to the beam direction for
           monitoring the elastic scattering of the 9Be
           projectiles by an thin Au foil placed upstream from
           the target stack.
           (HPGE) Each HPGe detector group consisted of two HPGe
           detectors were positioned 180 deg to each other. The
           data acquisition system was set such that single
           gamma-ray and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements
           could be performed simultaneously. The Ge crystal
           part of each detector was surrounded by a Pb annular
           cylinder of 3 cm thickness to reduce background from
           natural radioactivity. The energy calibration and
           absolute efficiency of the detectors was determined
           using a set of activity calibrated radioactive
           sources (60Co, 133Ba, and 152Eu) placed with the same
           geometry as the targets.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors were estimated by taking into
           account following errors
           (ERR-1) Target thickness, about 3.%
           (ERR-2) Beam intensity, about 3.%
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency, about 3.%
