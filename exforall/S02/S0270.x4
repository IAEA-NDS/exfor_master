INC-SOURCE The initial proton energy of 18.6 MeV and a beam
           current of about 100 nA.
SAMPLE     Natural isotopic abundance mental foils were placed
           as Cu (9.87 um), Cu (9.87 um), Ti (9.93 um),
           Ti (9.93 um), Mo (10.56 um), Al (105.60 um) and this
           sequence was repeated seven times. The second foils
           of Cu and Ti have a balance for the reaction products
           recoil-in and recoil-out. Al degrader was also used
           as recoil radionuclides catcher, and the
           radioactivity of Mo foil was measured together with
           the adjacent Al degrader.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) The stack was irradiated in a
           vacuum chamber for 1 h. The targets were cooled 2 h.
           Activity measurements of the target were repeated
           several times over a period of two months according
           to the half-life of the radionuclides.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector
            (ORTEC, GEM25) was located in a low-background lead
           and coper shield cell. The energy and efficiency
           calibrations of HPGe detector were determined by
           using standard gamma sources (109Cd, 133Ba, 152Eu and
           137Cs). All targets were set at a distance of 10.5
           cm from the end-cap of the detector, and the effect
           of geometrical factor is less than 1% at such a
           distance. The detector dead time during measurement
           was below 6% (mostly < 2%).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainties of the cross
           sections were in the range of 7-15%.
           (ERR-S,,10.) Statistical uncertainty of photo peak
           net counts <10%, mostly <2%
           (ERR-1,3.,5.) Detector efficiency uncertainty
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of beam intensity
           (ERR-3) Target thickness uncertainty
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty of nuclear decay data
