TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF NEUTRON ACTIVATION CROSS SECTIONS AT
            14.4 MEV FOR ZN-68 AND ZR-90-
FACILITY   .NEUTRON GENERATOR IN A FACILITY CALLED 'KORONA',
            KOMBINIERTE ROHRPOST-NEUTRONENGENERATOR-ANLAGE,
            DESCRIBED IN GKSS-81-E-53.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE NEUTRON FLUX AT THE IRRADIATION POSITION
            WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 5*10E+10 N/CM-SQ*SEC.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE PREPARED FROM POWDER OXIDE,99.0 PER
            CENT PURITY. THE IRRADIATION CAPSULES WERE MADE OF
            POLYETHYLENE WITH A DIAMETER OF 1.40 CM AND A HEIGHT
            OF 0.90 CM.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION OF THE SAMPLES WHICH AFTER THE
            IRRADIATION WERE TRANSPORTED FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE
            OF THE NEUTRON TUBE TO A 16 M DISTANT DETECTOR WITH A
            PNEUMATIC RABBIT SYSTEM. FOR PRODUCTS WITH SHORT HALF-
            LIVES SO CALLED CYCLIC ACTIVATION WAS USED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GELI DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   .THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTION SYSTEM WAS MADE WITH A
            STANDARD RADIOACTIV SOLUTION IN A SAMPLE CAPSULE.
MONITOR    .THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED BY MEANS OF A BF3 TUBE
            IN A LONG COUNTER WHICH WAS CALIBRATED WITH THE REACT.

CORRECTION .RECORDED GAMMA SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR COINCIDENCE
            SUMMING OF CASCADING PHOTONS. THE CORRECTIONS WERE OF
            THE ORDER OF 6 PER CENT BUT COULD SOMETIMES BE AS HIGH
            AS 30 PER CENT AS FOR THE 111 KEV PEAK OF CU-68-M.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  TOTAL ERROR UNDER MOST ADVERS CONDITIONS,
                       BEING A SUM OF
           (DATA-ERR1) ERROR IN FLUX DETERMINATION
           (DATA-ERR2) ERROR IN GAMMA-RAY YIELD COMPRISING
                       STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS AS WELL
                       AS UNCERTAINTIES IN GEOMETRY FACTORS,
                       EFFICIENCIES AND GAMMA-TRANSITION
                       PROBABILITIES. FOR THE SPECIAL CASE OF
                       CU-68-G THIS ERROR WAS ABOUT 13 PER CENT.
