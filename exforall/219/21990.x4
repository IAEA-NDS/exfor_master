TITLE      -Excitation functions of some neutron threshold
            reactions on isotopes of molybdenum
FACILITY   (CYCLO) Variable energy compact cyclotron CV 28 .
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Quasi-monoenergetic neutron source.
SAMPLE      Mo powder(99.98% pure) of natural isotopic composition
            was packed in polyethylene tubes of 1.1 cm diameter
            and 1.25 or 2.5 cm length. Ni and Fe monitor foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation for 4 to 6 h in each case.
           (GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS    The cross sections were calculated using the known
            activation equation.
           Neutron absorption factor was obtained from differences
           between calculated and exp. ratios of flux densities
           in front and at back of sample.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)
           (26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG)
            Ni and Fe monitor foils were placed in front as well
            as at the back of the sample.

CORRECTION -From the count rates of the activation products
            obtained the contributions due to background neutrons,
            which were produced via the interaction of deuterons
            with structural materials of the gas target as well as
            via the break-up of deuterons on deuterium gas, were
            subtracted.
           -Decay, gamma-ray intensity, efficiency of the detector
            counting geometry, self-absorption, coincidence
            losses, pile-up of gamma-rays, etc. were corrected.
ERR-ANALYS -Described in NSE 88(1984) 143.
           (ERR-T) Include both statistical and systematic errors.
            Minimum overall error was about 12%.

ANALYSIS    Measurements were performed after suitable decay time
            so that the shorter-lived metastable state had
            decayed out. This necessitated a small correction due
            to the formation of some Nb-95 via the decay of Zr-95.
            Contribution of Mo-96[(n,d)+(n,np)+(n,pn)]Nb-95 was
            considered above 7 MeV and was found to be <0.5 %.
            Special analyzing of gamma-ray spectrum was made over
            the energy region of 730 to 790 keV since four
            radioactive products Zr-95, Nb-95, Nb-98m, Mo-99 with
            very different counts rates had to be analyzed.
