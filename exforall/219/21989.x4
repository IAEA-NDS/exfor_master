TITLE      -TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE H(N,D)GAMMA REACTION
            BETWEEN 45 AND 70 MEV
FACILITY   (CYCLO)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 5 MM THICK NATURAL LI TARGET. NEUTRONS FROM
            LI(P,N) REACTION AT 0 DEGREE WERE SELECTED.
SAMPLE     .HIGH-DENSITY LIQUID HYDROGEN TARGET.THE ENTRANCE(EXIT)
            WINDOW IS 2.5(5.0) CM DIAMETER AND 6 MICRO-M THICK.
            THE TARGET THICKNESS IS 5.0 MM.
METHOD     (TOF) BOTH FOR INCIDENT NEUTRONS AND SCATTERED
            PARTICLES
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
ANALYSIS   .THE NP CAPTURE TOTAL CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED USING
            MEASURED NUMBER OF PROTONS AT 45 DGREES AND NP ELASTIC
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION (AT 45 DEGREES) TAKEN FROM
            A GLOBAL (0 - 1 GEV) PHASE-SHIFT ANALYSIS.

CORRECTION .THE NUMBER OF CAPTURE DEUTERONS WHICH PASS UNDETECTED
            THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DETECTOR IS CALCUALTED USING
            A LEGENDRE POLYNOMIAL FITTING OF THE WORLDWIDE DATA.
           .DEUTERONS WHICH UNDERGO A NUCLEAR REACTION IN THE
            DETECTOR CAN POSSIBLY FALL OUT OF THE DEUTERON
            HYPERBOLA IN THE BIPARAMETRIC SPECTRUM(THE TOF IS
            CORRECTLY MEASURED BUT THE PULSE HEIGHT CAN BE
            DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A DEUTERON).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERROR
           .THE NORMALIZATION ERROR IS ABOUT 1.5 PERCENT. THE
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR COULD DECREASE THE DATA BY AT MOST
            1 PERCENT AT 25 MEV, UP TO AT MOST 2.5 PERCENT AT 37
            MEV.
