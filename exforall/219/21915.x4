TITLE       Fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions for
            Pu-242(0,f), Pu-241(n,f) and Pu-242(g,f)
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) The (n,f) experiment was performed with
               the reactor BR1 of the SCK/CEN, MOL, Belgium.
SAMPLE     .The Pu-242 sample consisted of a 90 micro-g/cm-sq PuF3
            layer on a 30 micro-g/cm-sq polyimide backing with 10
            micro-g/cm-sq gold. The sample was prepared by
            evaporation and the isotopic enrichment was 99.74%.
            The Pu-241 target had a thickness of 41 micro-g/cm-sq
             and was prepared by electrospraying of plutonium
             acetate on an identical backing as the Pu-242 sample.
            The isotopic enrichment for the Pu-241 material
            was 91%. The diameter of the active layer was 25 mm
            in both cases.
METHOD     .Detection of fission fragments in two detectors
            mounted symmetrically on both sides of the fission
            target at an angle of 90 adeg and at a distance of
            7 cm to the beam axis.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two Ortec F-series heavy ion detectors (CF-35-
            600-60)
ANALYSIS   .Extreme care was taken of the stability of the
            measuring chain. Therefore every spontaneous fission
            measurement was calibrated with Pu-241(n,f) using the
            method from Schmitt et al.,C,65Salzburg,1,531,196503.
            Based on mass and momentum conservation relations and
            the detector calibration procedure the pulse heights
            of the coincident fission fragments were converted off
            line in two-dimensional provisional mass and kinetic
            energy arrays of 120*120 channels. Using an iterative
            procedure described by Schmitt in PR,141,1146,1966
            two-dimensional preneutron mass and total kinetic
            energy arrays were deduced.

CORRECTION .No information given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties given for data are only the
            rms deviations for at least seven experimental runs.
            For a comparison with the results of other authors
            an additional systematic error should be added. In the
            case of kinetic energy this contribution is about
            300 keV.
