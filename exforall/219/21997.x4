TITLE      -ACTIVATION CROSS SECTIONS OF (N,ALPHA) REACTIONS AT
            14.7 MEV IN THE REGION OF RARE EARTHS
FACILITY   .DYNAGEN NEUTRON GENERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES FOR IRRADIATIONS WERE PREPARED BY PACKING ABOU
            0.8 G OF THE OXIDE FORM OF THE TARGET MATERIAL OF
            NATURAL ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION(99.999 PC PURITY) IN
            POLYETHYLENE BAGS WHICH WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO
            ALUMINIUM FOILS. TO ELIMINATE THERMAL NEUTRONS THE
            SAMPLES WERE WRAPPED IN 2 MM THICK CD FOILS. THIS
            ELIMINATED NEUTRONS OF UP TO 0.5 EV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP) USING A HIGH-PRESSURE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHIC
            SYSTEM FOR SEPARATING UP TO 1 G MIXTURE OF
            RARE-EARTHS(HIGH LOADING OF THE ION EXCHANGE COLUMN).
            THE CHEMICAL YIELD OF THE SEPARATED FRACTION WAS
            DETERMINED(AFTER COMPLETING THE RADIOACTIVE
            MEASUREMENT) BY ACTIVATION ANALYSIS USING THERMAL
            NEUTRONS FROM A NUCLEAR REACTOR.
DETECTOR   (GELI) FOR COUNTING THE LIQUID SAMPLES A WELL TYPE 65
            CM**3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WAS USED AND FOR SOLID SAMPLES
            A CO-AXIA 28 CM**3 GE(LI) DETECTOR. FOR GAMMA-RAYS IN
            THE ENERGY RANGE OF 20 TO 100 KEV USE WAS MADE OF A
            SMALL GE DETECTOR WITH AN ACTIVE AREA OF 2 CM*2(HAVING
            A THIN BERYLLIUM WINDOW).

CORRECTION .THE CORRECTION OF DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES AND THE OTHER
            USUAL CORRECTIONS LIKE THOSE FOR GEOMETRY, ABSORPTION
            ETC. WERE APPLIED.
ERR-ANALYS .THE TOTAL ERRORS IN CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED BY
            CONSIDERING BOTH THE STATISTICAL ERRORS AND POSSIBLE
            MAJOR SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS SUCH AS THE
            UNCERTAINTIES IN NEUTRON FLUXES, EFFICIENCIES OF THE
            DETECTORS, ANALYSES OF GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA,
            RADIOCHEMICAL YIELDS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
            INTERFERING REACTIONS. THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES OF
            THE VARIOUS DETECTORS WERE KNOWN WITHIN ERRORS OF
            +-5 PC. THE ERRORS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN DECAY
            SCHEMES ARE NOT INCLUDED.
