TITLE       High resolution neutron capture and total cross
            section measurements of Cr-50, Cr-52 and Cr-53
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) The 150 keV Geel linear accelerator.
INC-SPECT  .In the capture experiment, the neutron flux were
            measured by replacing the Cr-52 and Cr-53 samples
            by a 0.3 cm thick 10-B(4)C slab and an independent
            measurement was also performed using a 0.05 cm thick
            Li-6 glass. In the case of Cr-50 the Li-6 glass was
            used below 100 keV and a multiplate U-235 fission
            chamber above.
            The transmission measurements were performed with
            a moderated beam for the 48.9 and 197.7 m and with
            an unmoderated beam for the 387.7 m experiment.
SAMPLE     .The samples were canned in thin Al containers of
            either 8 cm diameter (for the capture and the 50 m
            transmission measurements) or 3.5 cm diameter (for
            the 200 m and 400 m transmission measurements).
            the Cr-50 sample was more than 95%, the Cr-52 sample
            more than 99% and the Cr-53 more than 96% enriched.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight techniques, with a 58.0 m
            flight path for the capture experiment, and 48.9,
            197.5 and 387.7 m for the transmission experiments.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A pair of cylindrical C6d6 scintillators of
            10.2 cm diameter and 7.6 cm height for the capture
            experiment.
           (NAICR) Two 4 inch by 3 inch NaI detectors together
            with a 10-B(4)C detector in the 48.9 m transmission
            experiment
           (SCIN) a 2.5 cm thick NE110 scintillator was used in
            the other two transmission experiments.

ANALYSIS   .The capture spectra were normalised to the area of
            the 1.63 keV resonance in Cr-52 (all samples contained
            some Cr-52). The resonance strength for neutron
            capture = 0.058 +- 0.003 milli-eV value was
            determined independently with a transmission
            measurement (priv. comm. A.Brusegan).
            The data were analysed with the single-level Breit-
            Wigner area analysis code TACASI and the Geel version
            of the  R-matrix shape fitting code FANAC.
           .The code MULTI was used to analyse the Cr-50 and Cr-52
            transmission data, and the code FANAL was used for the
            Cr-53 transmission data. MULTI uses R-matrix for all
            L-values, whereas FANAL uses single-level Breit-Wigner
            for non S-wave  resonances.
CORRECTION .The capture flux measurements were corrected for
            background contributions, detector efficiency, self
            screening and multiple scattering effects.
            In the transmission measurements, the background was
            determined from the black resonance minima and the
            400m data were corrected for time and beam independent
            room background. The 200 and 400 m data were also
            corrected for the oxygen contribution.
ERR-ANALYS .The standard deviations on the capture results
            include the statistical and the systematic contri-
            butions due to background, relative flux, resolution
            effects and to the neutron sensitivity correction
            which was assumed to be known to within 50 percent.
             No provision was made for the inclusion of the uncer-
            tainties due to the normalisation procedure and to the
            5 percent error quoted on the area of the 1.63 keV
            resonance of Cr-52.
           .the uncertainties in the transmission results include
            the statistical and the systematic errors arising from
            the background and the resolution effects.
