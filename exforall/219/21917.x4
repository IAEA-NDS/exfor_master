TITLE      -CUMULATIVE YIELD OF 1.6*10E+07 I-129 FROM THERMAL-
            NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-235-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2GERMUN) THE MUNICH RESEARCH REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED IN THE
            GRAPHITE REPLECTOR OF THE MUNICH RESEARCH REACTOR
INC-SPECT  .THE THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX IN THE IRRADIATION POSITION
            WAS 1.2*10E+13 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ*SEC
SAMPLE     .A CHIP OF 118.5 MG URANIUM METAL ENRICHED TO 90
            PER CENT IN U-235 WAS ENCLOSED IN A SMALL AMPOULE
            OF HIGH PURITY QUARTZ WHICH ITSELF WAS SEALED IN
            AN ALUMINUM CAN. THE SPACE BETWEEN THE AMPOULE AND
            THE ALUMINUM CAN WAS FILLED WITH COARSE-GRAINED
            ALUMINUM POWDER
METHOD     (INTB ) IRRADIATION TIME 80 MIN
           (CHSEP) CHEMICAL SEPARATION OF PRODUCED I-129 AFTER A
            DECAY TIME OF ABOUT 5 MONTHS
           (ACTIV) ACTIVATION OF SEPARATED IODINE FOR 2 HR.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) COAXIAL GE(LI) WITH A RESOLUTION OF 2.1 MEV
            FOR THE 1.33 MEV GAMMA RAY OF CO-60 USED FOR
            DETECTION OF GAMMA RAYS FROM THE DECAY OF I-130 AND
            OF GAMMA RAYS FROM THE DECAY OF THE FISSION PRODUCT
            CE-144 USED FOR DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF
            FISSIONS
ANALYSIS   .THE NUMBER OF PRODUCED I-129 ATOMS WAS ESTIMATED FROM
            THE NUMBER OF I-130 ATOMS PRODUCED IN AN IRRADIATION
            OF THE CEMICALLY SEPARATED PBI2. THE CROSS SECTION
            USED FOR THE REACTION 53-I-129(N,G)53-I-130 WAS
            30.4+-1.7 BARNS.
           .THE NUMBER OF FISSIONS INDUCED IN THE IRRADIATED
            U-235 SAMPLE WAS DETERMINED BY AN ABSOLUTE
            MEASUREMENT OF THE CE-144 CONTENT. AN ABSOLUTE YIELD
            OF 5.37 PER CENT FOR CE-144 IN THERMAL-NEUTRON
            INDUCED FISSION WAS USED.
