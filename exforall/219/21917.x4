TITLE      -Cumulative yield of 1.6E+07 I-129 from thermal-
            neutron induced fission of U-235-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2GERMUN) The Munich research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) The samples were irradiated in the
            graphite replector of the Munich research reactor
INC-SPECT  .The thermal neutron flux in the irradiation position
            was 1.2E+13    neutrons/cm-sq*sec
SAMPLE     .A chip of 118.5 mg uranium metal enriched to 90
            per cent in U-235 was enclosed in a small ampoule
            of high purity quartz which itself was sealed in
            an aluminum can. The space between the ampoule and
            the aluminum can was filled with coarse-grained
            aluminum powder
METHOD     (INTB ) Irradiation time 80 min
           (CHSEP) Chemical separation of produced I-129 after a
            decay time of about 5 months
           (ACTIV) Activation of separated iodine for 2 hr.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) Coaxial Ge(Li) with a resolution of 2.1 MeV
            for the 1.33 MeV gamma ray of Co-60 used for
            detection of gamma rays from the decay of I-130 and
            of gamma rays from the decay of the fission product
            Ce-144 used for determination of the number of
            fissions
ANALYSIS   .The number of produced I-129 atoms was estimated from
            the number of I-130 atoms produced in an irradiation
            of the chemically separated Pb-I2. The cross section
            used for the reaction 53-I-129(N,g)53-I-130 was
            30.4+-1.7 barns.
           .The number of fissions induced in the irradiated
            U-235 sample was determined by an absolute
            measurement of the Ce-144 content. An absolute yield
            of 5.37 per cent for Ce-144 in thermal-neutron
            induced fission was used.

STATUS     .Data were taken from main reference
CORRECTION .For
            - detector efficiency
            - chemical yield of fission products
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall uncertainty of the yield value
            was estimated from errors in the
            - activity measurements
            - detector efficiency calibration
            - chemical yield determination
            - neutron flux measurements
            - cross section of the reaction 53-I-129(N,g)53-I-130
            - measurement of the fission rate
