FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNJAE)  Electron Linear Accelerator
            Operated with 120 MeV electron energy, 300 pps of
            repetition rate, 30 ns of electron burst width and
            20-30 microA of average beam current.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Water cooled tantalum target.
            20 cm diameter x 5 cm thick boron-loaded polyethylene
            disk as moderator.30 cm thick lead shadow rings to
            reduce gamma-flash signals in detectors.
METHOD     (TOF)  Neutron spectra were measured by the TOF using
           two flight path lengths of 56.34 m and 191.52 m
           for low and high resolution measurements, respectively.
           (TRN) Neutron resonance spectroscopy has been performed
                by neutron transmission measurements.
           Resonance energies and neutron widths are determined
           for 632 levels from 100 to 3.720 eV, and average level
           spacing and s-wave neutron strength function are
           deduced from these values.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Li-6 glass detector of 11.1cm diameter, 0.635cm
            thick - for low resolution measurements.
           The detector located at 190 m station consisted of
           5 sets of the 'Li glass scintillators of 11.1 cm
           diameter, 1.25 cm thick each.
           (GLASD) Two Li6 glass detectors for neutron intensity
           monitoring at 45 and 100 m.
SAMPLE     Natural Ta metallic plates. Ta-181 abundance 99.988%.
           Two samples of thicknesses 0.00565 and 0.560atoms/barn,
           three samples of thickness 0.0112, 0.0280, 0.0560
           atoms/barn were used for the low and high resolution
           measurements, respectively.
CORRECTION For counting losses by the dead time.
           Background subtraction.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Shape analysis of the transmission.
            Two sets of transmission data for the low resolution
            and three sets for the high resolution were
            simultaneously fitted with a least squares shape
            analysis code SIOB based on the multi-level
            Breit-Wigner formula. Doppler and resolution
            broadenings were taken into account.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,73-TA-181(N,G),,WID) Capture width was assumed
            to be constant 55 meV for all levels, which was taken
            from BNL-325 3rd edition.
            The statistical spin factors were taken also from
            BNL-325 3rd edition, if available. Otherwise g =0.5
            was assumed.
