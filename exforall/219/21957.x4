TITLE      -S-wave neutron strength function of Ta-181 .
REL-REF    (N,,Y.Nakajima,J,ANE,7,25,1980) Exp. details of
                transmission measurements.

           (R,,S.F.Mughabghab+,R,BNL-325,1973) Vol.1. 3rd edition.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNJAE)  Electron Linear Accelerator, operated
           with 120MeV electron energy, 300pps of repetition rate,
           30 ns electron burst width, 20-30 microA average beam
           current.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Water cooled tantalum target .
            Neutrons were moderated by boron-loaded polyethylene
            disk of 20 cm diameter, 5 cm thick. 30 cm thick lead
           shadow rings to reduce gamma-flash signals in detector.
           Neutron beam was made passed through 5 mm thick boron
           nitride or 6 mm thick Boral plate to remove time
           overlap neutrons for low and high resolution
           measurement, respectively.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight path lengths of 56.34 m (low resolution)
            and 191.52 m (high resolution).
            For background estimation: metallic Na was used at low
            resolution measurement, in high resolution experiment
            the transmission of 15 mm thick U plate was measured.
            Black resonances of Ta-181 were also used for
            background estimation.
           (TRN) Neutron resonance spectroscopy was performed by
           neutron transmission measurement.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Li-6 glass scintillator of 11.1 cm diameter,
            0.635 cm thick as neutron detector for low resolution.
            Detector located at 190m consisted of 5 sets of Li-6
            glass scintillators of 11.1 cm diameter, 1.25 cm thick
            each. Neutron intensity was monitored by two Li-6
            glass detectors at 45 and 100 m stations.
SAMPLE      Natural Ta metallic plates. Ta-181 abundance 99.988 %.
            Contribution of Ta-180 was ignored.
            Two samples of thickness 0.00565 and 0.0560 at/b -
            for low resolution measurement.
            Three samples of 0.0112, 0.0280, 0.0560 at/b - for
            high resolution measurement.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Resonance energies and neutron widths were
           determined for 632 levels from 100 to 3720 eV by shape
           analysis of transmission data using least squares shape
           analysis code SIOB, based on multi-level Breit-Wigner
           formula taking into account Doppler and resolution
           broadenings. Capture width was assumed 55 millieV for
           all levels - from BNL-325 3rd edition. Statistical
           spin factors also from BNL-325, if available,
           otherwise 0.5 was assumed.
           Resonance parameters below 100 eV were employed from
           BNL-325 3rd edition.
           Average level spacing and s-wave neutron strength
           function were deduced from these values.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,73-TA-181(N,G),,WID)
STATUS     (COREL,22109001) Data of 21975 were obtained using
            preliminary results of 22109 - 632 resonances from
            100 to 3720 eV.
CORRECTION For counting loses by the dead time and subtraction of
           the background - before transmission deducing.

ANALYSIS    S-wave neutron strength function was obtained from
            slope of plot of sum(g*WIDn0) vs neutron energy,
            Fig.2 of Reference.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error was estimated from conventional
            statistical assumption deltaS0/S0 = (2/N)**0.5, where
            N is number of levels.
            Statistical fluctuation of resonance levels
            is included .
