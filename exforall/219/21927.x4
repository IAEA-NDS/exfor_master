TITLE      Measurement of Double Differential Neutron Emission
            Cross Sections for Fusion Reactor Candidate Elements
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNOSA) The intense 14 MeV neutron source
            OKTAVIAN at Osaka University.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) Neutrons were produced with a pulsed 245 keV
            neutron beam. Pulse width was 1.3 nsec and frequency
            2 MHz.
INC-SPECT  .Energy varies with angle from about 13.5 to 14.9 MeV;
            mean energy taken as 14.1 MeV.
           .Energy resolution +-0.1 MeV.
SAMPLE     .Material of natural isotopic abundance formed in as
            rings. According to REL-REF 2 the standard size
            for a ring sample is 20 cm in major diameter and 2 cm
            in minor diameter. The ring is placed around the
            d-beam direction and can be moved along this
            direction to achieve different scattering angles.
METHOD     (TOF  ) The neutron flight path was 9.8 m, and the
            energy resolution was 3.0 nsec (FWHM) of the D-T
            neutron peak.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) NE-213 liquid scintillator, 12.7 cm in diameter
            and 5.08 cm in length, placed at 0 adeg with respect
            to the D beam direction. The detection threshold for
            neutrons was set to about 3 MeV. The source neutron
            flux was monitored with another NE-213 detector,
            5.08 cm in diameter and 5.08 cm in length, placed
            at 90 degr. to the D beam and at a distance of about
            1.5 m from the target.
ANALYSIS   .The efficiency calibration of the neutron detector
            was done using hydrogen elastic scattering (5.5-
            13.5 MeV, ENDF/B-IV) and elastic scattering from
            carbon (around 14 MeV) with samples of the same
            shape as for the major runs.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given in main reference.
            See Table 1 in main reference for a complete
            discussion of contributions to uncertainty.
           Excluding multiple scattering correction, total
            uncertainty is about 5% in secondary neutron energies
            and in absolute value of cross sections.
