TITLE      -CROSS-SECTION DETERMINATION FOR THE TI-50(N,P)SC-50
            REACTION IN THE 14 MEV NEUTRON ENERGY REGION-
FACILITY   .NEUTRON GENERATOR IN A FACILITY CALLED 'KORONA',
            KOMBINIERTE ROHRPOST-NEUTRONENGENERATOR-ANLAGE.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE NEUTRON FLUX AT THE IRRADIATION POSITION
            WAS ESTIMATED TO 5*10E+10 N/CM-SQ*SEC.
SAMPLE     .ALL SAMPLES WERE PREPARED FROM POWDER OXIDE,99.0 PER
            CENT PURITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NIOBIUM WHICH
            CONSISTED OF METALLIC POWDER, 99.9 PER CENT PURITY.
            THE IRRADIATION CAPSULES WERE MADE OF POLYETHYLENE
            MATERIAL WITH A DIAMETER OF 1.40 CM AND A HEIGHT OF
            0.90 CM.
METHOD     (ACTIV) CYCLIC ACTIVATION ANALYSIS WHICH MEANS THAT
            THERE IS A CLOSE CYCLE OF ANALYSIS AND RETURN OF THE
            SAMPLE IN THE IRRADIATION POSITION, REPEATED SEVERAL
            TIMES.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GELI DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   .THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTION SYSTEM WAS MADE WITH A
            STANDARD RADIOACTIV SOLUTION IN A SAMPLE CAPSULE.
MONITOR    .THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED BY MEANS OF A BF3 TUBE
            IN A LONG COUNTER WHICH WAS CALIBRATED WITH THE REACT.
          1(41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG) FOR FLUX MEASURM. AND
          2(40-ZR-90(N,2N)40-ZR-89-G,IND/M+,SIG) FOR DETERMINATION
            OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY. FOR THE FIRST REACTION A CROSS
            SECTION FROM NETHAWAY,JIN,40,1285(1978) WAS USED
            GIVING A NEUTRON FLUX CORRESPONDING TO A CROSS SECTION
            FOR THE SECOND REACTION OF (724+-73) MB WHICH
            ACCORDING TO THE CROSS-SECTION VARIATION OF THAT
            REACTION GAVE THE NEUTRON ENERGY (14.4+-0.3) MEV.
            THE CALIBRATION FACTOR WAS ALSO MEASURED WITH
