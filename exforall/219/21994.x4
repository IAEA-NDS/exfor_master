TITLE       Isomeric cross-section ratios in (n,t) reactions on
            some medium-and-heavy mass nuclei at 14.6 MeV.
FACILITY   (NGEN,2GERJUL) Dynagen neutron generator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Average energy of the neutrons was 14.6+-0.4 MeV
METHOD     (ACTIV) For all isotopes
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from NP/A,438,(2),384
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Combining the statistical and systematic errors
            in quadrature. Major systematic errors due to:
           (ERR-1,5.,20.) determination of neutron flux via
                        monitor reactions and
           determination of desintegration rates of the products
           involving several uncertainties, for example,
           (ERR-2,3.,5.) uncertainty in efficiencies of the
                         detectors;
           (ERR-3,2.,4.) uncertainty in absorption of gamma-rays;
           (ERR-4,1.,2.) uncertainty in decay data;
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in chemical yield; etc.
           (MONIT-ERR) normalization error
