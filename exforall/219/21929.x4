TITLE      Investigation of the 93-Nb(n,xp)reaction at En=14.1 MeV
AUTHOR     (G.Traxler,A.Chalupka,R.Fischer,B.Strohmaier,
            M.Uhl,H.Vonach)
FACILITY   (CCW,2AUSIRK) 250-kV accelerator to produce 14.1 MeV
             neutrons
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 2.2*10**9 n/s corresponding to a maximum neutrons
            flux of 1.2*10**5 n/cm**2*s at the target
SAMPLE      Target of niobium metal (purity better than 99%)
            had an average thickness of 9.99mg/cm**2  +- 2%
            Target was rotated by 180 degrees in the
            middle of each experiment to reduce inhomogeneities
            assumed to be less than 2%. The niobium target
            was irradiated during 220 hours.
METHOD     (EDE) Energy and angular distributions of the protons
            from 24 to 164 degrees with a resolution of 15 degrees
            energy resolution is assumed to be better than 1.5 MeV
           (PSD) To discriminate protons deuterons in the CsI
            scintillator. The error for the identification is less
            than 2 %
DETECTOR   (PROPC)  48 proportional counters. Filling gas is
            Ar + 5% C-O25 at 100 mb
           (CSICR) Central CsI(Tl) Accuracy better than 200keV
            over the whole energy range up to 15 MeV
           (SCIN) The inc-source strength was monitored by a
            Li-6(Eu) crystal, separately calibrated using the
            Al27(n,alpha)Na24 reaction with an overall error of 3%
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,G.Traxler,T,TRAXLER,1983)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The double cross section of the emitted protons
            are compared first to the predictions of the
            systematics of reduced Legendre coefficients,then to
            the predictions of one step version of the direct
            reaction theory of continuum cross sections.
CORRECTION .For energy loss in the target,all particle were
            assumed to have lost an energy corresponding to half
            the target thickness.
ERR-ANALYS  The following systematic errors were considered
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties in neutron flux
           (ERR-2) Uncertainties in solid angle of the CsI
           (ERR-3) Uncertainties in the target thickness
           (ERR-4) Errors due to data reduction procedure

FLAG       (1.) for this ratio the authors give an error of 2.0,
