TITLE      -Analyzing power of the n-3He elastic scattering from
            3.7 to 22.0 MeV
FACILITY   (DYNAM,2GERBOC) Bochum Dynamitron Tandem
                                          accelerator 4.3 MeV
SAMPLE     .Liquid He-3. The scattering volume is 50 mm high and
             46 mm in diameter.
            In order to prevent tritium loss from the target and
            enclosed contamination of the beam line, the target
            was in a 0.5 bar helium atmosphere by a
                                      12 p.m molybdenum foil.
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detectors were cylinders with a diameter of
           10 cm filled with NE 213. Six cylinders with a length
           of 20 cm were used with their axes in the vertical
           direction, and two short cylinders with a length of
           7.6 cm were oriented horizontally.
ANALYSIS   .Phase shift analysis
MONITOR    (2-HE-3(N,P)1-H-3,,SIG)
CORRECTION .For finite geometry and for multiple scattering
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) statistical errors.
           Corrections are usually smaller than statistical error
