TITLE      -NEUTRON EMISSION, MASS DISTRIBUTION AND ENERGETICS IN
            14.5 MEV-NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF URANIUM-238-
FACILITY   .NOT GIVEN.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )
SAMPLE     .THE URANIUM TARGET WAS MADE IN A CIRCULAR FORM WITH
            A DIAMETER OF 3 CM BY ELECTRO-SPRAYING A SOLUTION OF
            URANYLACETATE ONTO AN ABOUT 90 MICROG/CM-SQ THICK
            NICKEL BACKING. THE URANIUM THICKNESS WAS DETERMINED
            TO BE ABOUT 250 MICROG/CM-SQ BY ALPHA-PARTICLE
            COUNTING.
METHOD     .THE U-TARGET WAS PLACED BETWEEN TWO DETECTORS WITH THE
            CENTER OF THE DETECTORS, THE U-TARGET AND THE N-SOURCE
            PLACED IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT AN ANGLE OF 60 ADEG WITH
            RESPECT TO THE DEUTRON BEAM. NEUTRONS BOMBARDED THE
            TARGET THROUGH THE NEAR DETECTOR. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE AND AND THE TARGET WAS 1.8 CM.
            ENERGIES OF BOTH FRAGMENTS AND THE FLIGHT TIME OF ONE
            FRAGMENT WERE MEASURED EVENT BY EVENT. ABOUT 10000
            EVENTS IN TOTAL WERE OBTAINED.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) ONE OF THE FRAGMENT DETECTORS WAS A SILICON
            SURFACE-BARRIER DETECTOR PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF 0.3
            CM FROM THE TARGET. THE COMPLEMENTARY FRAGMENT WAS
            DETECTED BY A LARGE AREA DETECTOR LOCATED AT THE END
            OF A 101.8 CM EVACUATED FLIGHT TUBE. THIS DETECTOR WAS
            COMPOSED OF NINE IDENTICAL SILICON SURFACE-BARRIER
            DETECTORS ARRAYED IN A MOSAIC STRUCTURE AND HAD A
            SENSITIVE AREA OF 82 CM-SQ.
ANALYSIS   .DATA WAS ANALYSED IN A WAY SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED
            IN YAMAMOTO ET AL.,NIM,134,119(1976). MODIFICATIONS
            IN THE PROCEDURE ARE LISTED IN 'CORRECTIONS'.

CORRECTION .FOR
            - THE EFFECT OF THE CENTER-OF-MASS RECOIL OF THE
              FISSIONING NUCLEUS DUE TO THE IMPINGING NEUTRON
              MOMENTUM.
            - THE EFFECT OF ENERGY LOSS FOR FRAGMENTS IN THE
              TARGET.
           .THE NU-BAR DATA WAS CORRECTED TO INCLUDE SECOND-
            CHANCE FISSION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
