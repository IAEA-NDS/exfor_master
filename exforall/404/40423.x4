AUTHOR     (A.P.Graevsky,B.A.Bochagov,Yu.A.Chestnov)
TITLE       Angular neutron distribution from triple fission
            of Cf-252
METHOD     (COINC)  N-alpha coincidence
           (TOF) Neutron energy was measured by time-of-flight.
           Start signal from alpha, stop - from neutron detector.
SAMPLE      Cf-252 source of 5 mm diameter on Pt backing.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SOLST) Plastic scintillation detector of
           150 mm diameter, 150 mm length, with photomultiplier
           FEU-65, distance from Cf252 sample 0.5 m -for neutrons;
           semiconductor detector of 20x20 mm**2, distance from Cf
           source 27 mm - for alphas .
           Neutron detector efficiency was defined by spectrum of
           Cf-252 binary fission, time resolution +-2.5 nsec.
MONITOR     Relative measurements
MISC-COL   (MISC)      Maximal statistical error.
           Stat.errors do not exceed the size of points on figure.
HISTORY    (19781031C)  Compiled at the centre

           (20130620A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           INC-SOURCE line was deleted (spon.fission).

REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F),TER,DA,N,REL)  Angular distribution
            of emitted neutrons relative to the emitted by ternary
            fission alpha-particles .  In arbitrary units.
COMMENT     ANG-RL value in DATA section is angle between
            alpha and neutron directions
CORRECTION  Geometrical correction was made.
ADD-RES     In Yad.Fiz.,v.18,is.4,p.720,1973, text page 721 :
            Average neutron energy 4.6+-0.3 MeV is given for
           difference of two TOF spectra for 0 deg - 180 deg angle
           of alpha-particles in ternary fission.
