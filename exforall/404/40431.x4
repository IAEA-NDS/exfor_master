INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton-lithium reaction.
           Maximum proton energy equal 2.5 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation method for definition
            of neutron radiative capture cross-section.
            Method of associated activity over gamma-rays with
            energy 477 keV from reaction Li-7(p,n)Be-7
            for definition of neutron flux.
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)      Van de Graaff
DETECTOR   (GELI)  Germanium-lithium detector for measurement
           of U-239 activity. 4PI-beta-counter was used for
           definition of GeLi-detection efficiency.
           (FISCH,BF3) U-235 fission chamber and long BF3counter
           were used for neutron beam monitoring.

           multiple neutron scattering in target (0.3%),
           background of neutrons scattering in chamber
           of Li-7 target (0.1%), neutron scattering
           by materials of construction (5.0%),
           effective thickness of target-sample because of
           apex angle of neutron cone (1.3%)

           (ERR-1) Ge(Li)-detector efficiency error for
           measurement of U-238 - 2.1%
           (ERR-2) Ge(Li)-detector efficiency error for
           measurement of Li-target - 3.38%,
           (ERR-3) self-shielding error (0.1%),

           (ERR-5) neutron scattering error (0.15%),
           (ERR-6) half-life error of U-239 and Be-7 (0.5%)
