MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-spectrometer with Ge-Li detector of
           33 cm3 volume - for induced activity measurement.
           Efficiency was measured by 4PI beta-gamma coincidence
           technique at BR10 reactor thermal column and at
           BR-1 fast reactor critical assembly .
           (PROPC) Hydrogen gas counter of two different types
           for neutron flux measurement.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
CORRECTION Absorption of thermal neutrons was taken into account
           for efficiency measurement of gamma-spectrometer
INC-SPECT   EN-RSL - resolution of the spectrometer
HISTORY    (19761010C)  Compiled at the centre
           (19821109A)  Data defined as preliminary
           (19890407A)  Data superseded due to the appearance
                     of new measurements. Some keywords and codes
                     corrected
