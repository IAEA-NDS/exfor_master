TITLE      Determination of average neutron number per fission
           of californium-252
SAMPLE     Layers of californium of high purity with weights
           0.129 - 0.424 microgram .  Four sources were prepared
           by thermospraying.
METHOD     (MANGB) Manganese bath
EXP-YEAR   (1974) In 1974 - new spherical flow manganese bath was
           made.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two sodium-iodide crystals NaI(Tl) of 150x100mm
MONITOR    No information
PART-DET   (G) Gammas
STATUS     (PRELM) Data obtained by starting and adjusting
           of manganese bath. Future measurement was planned.
HISTORY    (19771213C) Compiled at the centre
           (20130315A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           Units were corrected NO-DIM -> PRT/FIS .
           BIB information was updated. Errors values were added.
           Ref. R,INDC(CCP)-190,1,1982 was added.
