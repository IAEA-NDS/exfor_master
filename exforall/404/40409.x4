TITLE       Alpha-energy-spectrum study from the reaction
            Nd-143(N,ALPHA)Ce-140 on thermal neutrons
INC-SOURCE (REAC) WWR-S .
INC-SPECT   Reactor spectrum 1.E+8 n/sec/cm**2.
            Cd ratio about 5.5 .
SAMPLE      Oxide, Nd-143 enrichment 83.2 %, thickness 6
            micrometers, area 5*5 cm**2, on Al backing of 6 microm
METHOD     (EDE) Measurement during 355 hr with two different
           samples at 4 MW reactor power.
           Background was measured by Cd filter in neutron beam
           during 90 hr.
           Measurement during 760 hr at 2 MW reactor power with
           different E-detector.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) Two silicon  semiconductor detectors:
           deltaE detector of 13 microm thickness, 1 cm**2 area;
           E detector of barrier thickness about 100 microm,
           0.5 or 1 cm**2 area.
           Energy calibration by
           - Am-241 alpha-source (5.48 MeV), energy resolution
           85 keV;
           - monitor reaction;
           - n,alpha reaction on boron admixture  in sample.
EN-SEC     (E,A)
CORRECTION For contribution of high  resonances < 5 %.
