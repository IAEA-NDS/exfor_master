TITLE       Yield determination of some fission-fragments of
            Cf-252 by means of soft electromagnetic radiation
            measurement
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Semiconductor detector on base of SI-Li -
           for gammas registration.Energy resolution about 700 eV,
           50 mm**2 square, 2.5 mm thickness.
           (GE)    Germanium detector for 14 - 300 keV
                   gammas.
           50 mm**2 square, 1.6 mm thickness, energy resolution
           about 700 eV.
           Both were calibrated by Am-241,Ba-133, Cd-109, Co-57
           sources .
MONITOR     Fission yield is measured relative to that of Nd-147
HISTORY    (19781212C)
           (20140110A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           INC-SOURCE was deleted - spontaneous fission.
           BIB information was updated.

           Measured gamma yield value 0.37+-0.03 is compared with:
REL-REF    (R,,M.A.Wakat,J,ND/A,8,445,1971)  0.28+-0.02
           (R,,M.J.Martin+,J,ND/A,8,1,1971)  0.405+-0.045  .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mainly due to calibration uncertainty.
