TITLE       Mass-spectrometric determination of relative yields of
            Xe isotopes in fission of natural uranium by 14.7-MeV
            neutrons

SAMPLE      Disks made of eutectical alloy of natural uranium
            with nickel. Diameter 10 mm, mass 4.2 gram.
            Placed in a chamber surrounded by Cd foil of 0.5 mm
            thickness.
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSTIL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
            Integrated during 120 hr flux was 2.6E+14 neutrons .
METHOD     (ASEP) Irradiation time 120 hr, cooling time 2 months.
            Mass spectrometer MI-1305 was used for separation.
CORRECTION  For background of natural xenon - 2-3% for mass 134
            at beginning of measurements and 8-10% at the end.
            Background of hydrocarbon radicals < 0.5 %.
