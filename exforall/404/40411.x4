TITLE      Cross-section of the U-238(n,2n)U-237 reaction
           for 15 MeV neutrons
EXP-YEAR   (1957) Preliminary measurement in 1952,
            repeated in 1957 .
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 150 keV deuteron beam.
SAMPLE     Samples of uranium nitrate
METHOD     (ACTIV) Counted U-237 decay betas
            6-8 hr irradiation.
           (CHSEP)After irradiation the samples were chemically
            cleaned of the fission fragments and products of the
            disintegration of the uranium

DECAY-DATA (92-U-237,6.7D)
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)   U-238 fission.
CORRECTION  For conversion electrons.
            For Tc-99,La-140, Ce-144, Pr-144 - in the measurement
            of the beta-activity of the fragments.
ANALYSIS    CS was determined by activities of U-237 and fission
            fragments of U-238 - Mo-99, Ba-140, Ce-141 ( absolute
            flux measurement) .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error includes statistical error (spread of
            exp.values) and Sys.error in the cross section and
            yield of the fis.products of U-238.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the text of the AE,5,456,1958
            Preliminary value ( 1952) 1.5+-0.2 b ( without
            corrections), 1b ( with corrections).
