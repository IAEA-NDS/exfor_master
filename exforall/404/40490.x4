SAMPLE       Curium-242 content is   0.15+-0.07  %
             Curium-243             37.29+-1.34  %
             Curium-244             61.61+-1.34  %
             Curium-245              0.94+-0.10  %
             On Al backing of 0.1 mm thickness.
             U, Cm samples of about 10 mm diameter.
             Number of nuclei in sample was defined by spontaneous
             fission number of Cm-244 and Cm-242.
METHOD      Method of cadmium ratio
            Cd ratio for U-235 for 1 mm thickness Cd filtered beam
            was 40.
DECAY-DATA Half-lives for spontaneous fission from REL-REF of
           Yu.S.Zamyatnin are:
             Cm-244: (1.270+-0.007)E+7YR
             Cm-242: (6.09+-0.18)E+6YR
INC-SOURCE (REAC)  Reactor 'CM-2'
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSNIR)  Reactor 'CM-2'
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)
CORRECTION  Introduced on  Cm-244 and Cm-245 fission.
            For the fact, that U c-s do not follow the 1/SQRT(E)
            low -  0.965.
            For Cm - it was supposed that c-s follows  1/sqrt(E)
            low.
