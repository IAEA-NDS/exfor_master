TITLE      ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS OF FISSION CROSS-SECTION
           OF U-235 AND U-238 BY NEUTRONS WITH ENERGY 14.8 MEV

INSTITUTE  (4CCPRI)
REFERENCE  (P,YFI-22,12,7611)   DATA ARE GIVEN
           (C,75KIEV,6,09,7607) DATA ARE  GIVEN ONLY FOR U-235
METHOD     (COINC,ASSOP)    COINCIDENCE OF FISSION FRAGMENT AND
            ACCOMPANYING ALPHA-PARTICLE FROM (D-T) REACTION
PART-DET   (FF) FISSION FRAGMENTS
           (A)  ALPHA-PARTICLE FROM REACTION 1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4
INC-SOURCE (D-T) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION
DETECTOR   (SCIN) THIN SCINTILLATION PLASTIC FOR REGISTRATION
                 OF ALPHA PARTICLES.
           (IOCH)IONIZATION CHAMBER WITH 2PI-GEOMETRY WAS USED
            FOR REGISTRATION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS.
ANALYSIS    FISSION CROSS-SECTION ARE DETERMINED BY RELATION
            SIGMA-FIS.=NCOIN/NAL/NUCL.
            HERE NCOIN - A NUMBER OF COINCIDENCES OF FISSION
            FRAGMENTS AND ALPHA-PARTICLES,NAL - A NUMBER OF ALPHA
            PARTICLES REGISTRATED,NUCL - A NUMBER OF NUCLEI
            ON 1CM**2 OF TARGET.
CORRECTION  BACKGROUND OF RANDOM COINCIDENCE ,CORRECTION FOR
            MULTIPLE NEUTRON SCATTERING,CORRECTION FOR DETECTION
            EFFICIENCY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS.
HISTORY    (770214C)
           (861009A) DATA DELETED BY THE COMPILER DECISION ON THE
                     REASON OF DATA REPETITION. DATA OF SAN 002
                     ARE NOW IN 40547005, OF SAN 003 IN 40547007
