TITLE       Measurement of thermal neutron spectrum effective
            cross-section for Eu-152 (half-life = 12.4 years)
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Beryllium reflector of the reactor
SAMPLE      Sample of Eu-151 was irradiated in the beryllium
            reflector of the reactor,cumulative doses were
            2.33E19, 9.66E19, 1.64E20 neutrons/cm2
METHOD     (BURN)
DETECTOR   (GELI)  Germanium-lithium detector with
                   instrumental resolution 6.0 keV
ANALYSIS    Neutron cross-section was obtained by means of
            analysis of the sample activity with the help
            of the equations of kinetic of nuclear transformations
