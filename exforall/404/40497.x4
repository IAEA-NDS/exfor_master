INSTITUTE  (4UKRIJD)
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Beryllium reflector of the reactor
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons with neutron gas temperature 333K.
SAMPLE      Sample of Eu-151 was irradiated in the beryllium
            reflector of the reactor,cumulative doses were
            2.33E19, 9.66E19, 1.64E20 neutrons/cm2
METHOD     (BURN) Measured activities were 1., 2.25, 3.33
           arbitrary units for three values of cumulative doses,
           respectively.
DETECTOR   (GELI)  Instrumental resolution 6.0 keV
ANALYSIS    Neutron cross-section was obtained by means of
            analysis of the sample activity with the help
            of the equations of kinetic of nuclear transformations
