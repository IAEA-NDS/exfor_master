TITLE      Accelerator production of 8B  neutrinos
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWAS)
SAMPLE     A thick targets of enriched 6Li  metal were prepared
           in an argon atmosphere by pressing 6Li  metal into a
           small aluminum boat and covering the front surface with
           a 0.025-mm havar foil. Thee targets were 2.5 mm thick.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR-DIG) Digitizing error
           (ERR-DIG) Digitizing error
           (ERR-S) From graphic bars (statistical) and
           the digitizing
           an over-all systematic error consists from:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in the quoted 22Na source
                                              strength, 4.6%;
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in the efficiency calibration
                                              procedure, 3%;
           (ERR-4) uncertainty in the procedure for extraction of
                   the 8B activity by least-squares fitting, 3%;
           (ERR-5,5.,9.) uncertainty in the beam current
                   integration ranging from 5% to 9%;
           (ERR-6) uncertainty in the positron annihilation-in-
                                           flight correction, 3%.
             These uncertainties have been combined to obtain a
           final systematic probable error of about 12% at low
           energies and 9% at high energies.
