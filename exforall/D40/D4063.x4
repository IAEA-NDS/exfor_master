METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,BCINT,MOSEP)
           Two stacks each containing 5 sandwiched samples were
           irradiated for 1 hour with 10 MeV primary energy at
           50 nA beam intensity and one stack with ten sandwiched
           samples was irradiated for 1 hour with 21.2 MeV primary
           energy at 75 nA deuteron beam.
           The beam current was also measured via charge
           collection in a Faraday-cup.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy scale contains
           the uncertainty of the initial beam energy and the
           uncertainty resulted by the degradation process and
           straggling effect and ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 MeV.
           (ERR-T)  The Data error was calculated as the square
           root of the sum of the square of the individual
           relative errors. The main error sources are:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in beam current
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in number of target nuclei
           (ERR-S,1.,10.) statistical error
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in detector efficiency
           (ERR-4,1.,3.) uncertainty in correction
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in nuclear data
           (ERR-6) fitting error
           (ERR-7) error in time measurement
REL-REF    (M,D4019001,B.Scholten+,J,ARI,46,255,1995) The data
           errors were calculated as described in this article
           (R,D4047002,B.Scholten+,J,ARI,48,267,1997) - value from
           this article used for correction
CORRECTION The contributions of the 159 KeV Gamma line of Sc-47
           produced in the Ti backing and the long lived Te-123m
           produced in the target material were subtracted from
           the total peak area. Contribution of 123Te(d,2n)
           process was corrected using the value of
           Scholten (see REL-REF). In the energy region from 14 to
           21 MeV extrapolation was used to estimate the
           contribution of the 123Te(d,2n) reaction supposing
           similar cross section shape for the 123Te(d,2n)
           reaction as the shape of the 124Te(d,2n) reaction.

ANALYSIS   (INTEF) Derived from measured excitation function
COMMENT    S. Takacs: 'Physical yields are given. For production
           of I-123 via the Te-122(d,n) process the optimal energy
            range is 12 to 7 MeV and the yield of I-123 at the
           end of bombardment (EOB) is 58. MBq/uA-h, in the
           energy range from  10 to 6.5 MeV the yield of I-123
           at EOB is 34. MBq/uA-h.
