SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched Te-122 deposited on Ti foil and
           covered with thin Al foil (10 micron, Goodfellow).
           Te-122 sample thickness 6.0 to 10 Mg/Cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,BCINT,MOSEP)
           Two stacks each containing 5 sandwiched samples were
           irradiated for 1 hour with 10 MeV primary energy at
           50 nA beam intensity and one stack with ten sandwiched
           samples was irradiated for 1 hour with 21.2 MeV primary
           energy at 75 nA deuteron beam.
           The Ti backing of the Te targets were used as monitor
           foils using the nat-Ti(D,X)V-48 monitor reaction.
           The beam current was also measured via charge
           collection in a Faraday-cup.
           Nuclear data were taken from E.Browne and R.B.Firestone
           Table of Radioactive Isotopes, Ed.V.S.Shirley, Wiley,
           1986. The decay of the activities was followed over
           several half-lives.
           Composition of target materials in %:
           Te-120  <   0.04
           Te-122      88.4   +- 0.5
           Te-123      1.82
           Te-124      1.84

           Te-128      2.22
           Te-130      2.01
           The energy degradation in the foils was calculated
           according to H.H.Andersen and J.F.Zegler (Hydrogen
           Stopping Powers and Ranges in All Elements, Vol 3,

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy scale contains
           the uncertainty of the initial beam energy and the
           uncertainty resulted by the degradation process and
           straggling effect and ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 MeV.
           The error of the energy scale was calculated as
           described earlier by Scholten et al., J,Applied.Radiat.
           Isot,46,255,1995.
           (ERR-T)  The Data error was calculated as the square
           root of the sum of the square of the individual
           relative errors. The main error sources are:
             -Beam Current                          7%
             -Number of Target Nuclei               3%
             -Statistical Error                  1-10%
             -Detector Efficiency                   7%
             -Correction                          1-3%
             -Nuclear Data                          3%
             -Fitting Error                         1%
             -Error in Time Measurement             1%
           The average error was about 13%.
           The Data error was calculated as
           described earlier by Scholten Et Al., J,Applied.Radiat.

CORRECTION The contributions of the 159 KeV Gamma line of Sc-47
           produced in the Ti backing and the long lived Te-123M
           produced in the target material were subtracted from
           the total peak area. Contribution of 123Te(D,2N)
           process was corrected using the value of
           Scholten Et Al.( J,ARI,48,267,97). In the energy
           region from 14 to 21 MeV extrapolation was used
           to estimate the contribution of the 123Te(D,2N)
           reaction supposing similar cross section shape for
           the 123Te(D,2N) reaction as the shape of the
           124Te(D,2N) reaction.
