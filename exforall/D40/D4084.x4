SAMPLE     Gas cells filled with natural krypton to a pressure
           of 1-2 bar absolute.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Natural krypton was irradiated in stacked gas cells
           windowed 15 micron kapton. Primary deuteron energies
           were 14.2 9.9, 9.7 and 7.4 MeV.
           Beam current 0.1 microamp. Ti and Fe monitors were used
           21 and 12 micron thick respectivelly.
           Charge integrated by Faraday-Cup.  Nuclear
           data were taken from E.Brwne and R.B.Firestone Table
           of Radioactive Isotopes Ed.V.S.Shirley, Wiley 1986.
           The mean energy in the monitor foils and in the gas
           cells were calculated using tables of H.H.Andersen,
           J.F.Ziegler,Hydrogen Stopping Powers and Ranges in All
           Elements, Vol.3,Pergamon Press, New York, 1977.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The Error of the energy was calculated taking
           into account the initial uncertainty the sraggling of
           the beam and the errors in the thickness of the targets
           The estimated energy scale error was +-0.3 MeV at the
           first cell and +-0.7 MeV at the last cell in the stack.
           (ERR-T) The error of the cross section data were
           estimated by summing up the squares of the individual
           relative errors and taking the square root of it.
           Detector efficiency was  5%. The overall uncertainty
           reached  13%.
