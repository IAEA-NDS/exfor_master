TITLE      Elastic scattering angular distributions and total
           reaction cross sections for the interaction of
           12.8 MeV deuterons with Ni-58 and Ni-60 nuclei

SAMPLE     enriched Ni-58, 5.95 mg/cm2 and enriched Ni-60,
           5.09 mg/cm2. No more details are given.
METHOD     (ACTIV) the yields of charged particles and neutrons
           emitted in deuteron induced reactions were measured.
           CsI(Tl) detector was used to detect the 13 MeV energy
           neutrons. The angular distribution of charged particles
           was measured in 5 degree steps (from 15 to 135 degree).
           gm counter was used to measure the beta+ activity of
           the products. The elastically scattered deuterons were
           measured with broad range magnetic spectograph from
           10 to 140 degree. Distributions are given on graphs.
           charge of bonbarding particles was collected in a
           Faraday-cup.
ADD-RES    (ANGD)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) to detect charged particles from the reaction
           (CSICR) CsI(Tl)crystal with thickness to correspond
           to the range of 13 MeV neutrons.
           (GEMUC) B+ activity was registered using standard gm
           counter technique.
           (MAGSP) to measure the elastically scattered deuterons.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) no details are given on error analysis
STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from table 1. of Physics Let.
