STATUS     (TABLE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC).4-5 SANPLE SANDWICHES AND
           SEVERAL MONITOR AND ABSORBER FOILS WERE IRRADIATED AT
           BEAM CURRENT OF ABOUT 100NA.3 STAKS WERE IRRADIATED
           AT JULICH CYCLOTRON WITH 25 MEV INCIDENT ENERGY
           DEGRADATED FROM 47 +- 0.2 MEV PRIMARY DEUTERON ENERGY.
           2 STACKS WERE IRRADIATED AT CV-28 CYCLOTRON WITH 13.4
           MEV PRIMARY ENERGY. THE ENERGY DEGRADATION WAS
           CALCULATED ACCORDING TO C.F. WILLIAMSON ET AL. CEA-
           R3042(1966) THE DECAY DATA WERE TAKEN FROM C.M.LEDERER
           AND V.S.SHIRLEY, TABLE OF ISOTOPES, WILLEY, NEW YORK
            (1988) AND C. BROWNIE AND R.B.FRIESTONE, TABLE OF
           RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES, WILLEY, NEW YORK (1986).
SAMPLE     31.4% ENRICHED (1 MG/CM**2) SE-74 WAS ELECTRODEPOSITED
           ON AL FOILS COVERED BY AN OTHER THIN AL FOIL.
