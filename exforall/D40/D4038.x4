TITLE      RADIOCHEMICAL STUDY OF THE BI-209(P,BE-7)HG-203
           PROCESS FROM 20 TO 70 MEV VIA IDENTIFICATION OF THE
           EMITTED PARTICLE (BE-7) AND THE PRODUCT NUCLEUS
            (HG-203)

SAMPLE     BI POWDER (99.999% METAL CONTENT) PRESSED TO PELLETS
           AND HIGH PRITY BI METAL DISCS (99.999%)
           LIGHT ELEMENT IMPURITIES (IN PPM):

            BI-DISC      40+-20       3+-1      31+-4
           SAMPLES WERE SADWICHED BETWEEN TWO CATCHER FOILS OF
           THE SAME MATERIAL
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,CHSEP) AT PSI WILLIGEN:
           PRIMARY PROTON ENERGY 72 MEV AND 46 MEV
           IRRADIATION TIME 6 HR
           BEAM CURRENT 50 - 70 NA
           AT CV-28 CYCLOTRON JUELICH:
           PRIMARY ENERGY 22 MEV
           IRRADIATION TIME 8 HR
           BEAM CURRENT 70 NA
           SEVERAL AL AND CU FOILS WERE INSERTED IN THE STACK
           AS ENERGY DEGRADER AND MONITOR FOILS. THE BEAM CURRENT
           WERE MEASURED IN FARADAY CUP AND VIA MONITOR REACTIONS
           ON NATURAL CU AND AL.
           THE ENERGY DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED USING THE
           RANGE-ENERGY FORMULA OF C.F. WILLIAMSON
           ET AL., REPORT CEA-12-3042,1966.
           THE (BE-7)BEO AND THE (HG-203)HGS WERE OBTAINED AFTER
           A MULTI STEP CHEMICAL SEPARATION. THE RADIOCHEMICAL
           YIELD WAS DETERMINED GRAVIMETRICALLY. THE BE AND HG
           CONTENT OF THE SAMPLES WERE DETERMINED BY USING
           AES-ICP AND AAFS RESPECTIVELLY. THE (BE-7)BEO SAMPLES
           WERE DRECTLY MEASURED ON A GAMMA DETECTOR.
           THE (HG-203)HGS WAS MEASURED ON A LOW BRACKGOUND
           SHIELDED DETECTOR. THE DECAY WAS FOLLOWED FOR FIVE
           HOURS. THE TL-208 BACKGROUND PEAK WAS SEPARATED FROM
           THE PEAK OF HG-203.
