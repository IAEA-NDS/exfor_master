TITLE      Radiochemical study of the 209Bi(p,7Be)203Hg process
            from 20 to 70 MeV via identification of the emitted
            particle (7Be) and the product nucleus (203Hg)

           Samples were sandwiched between two catcher foils of
            the same material.
METHOD     (STTA,EDEG) Several Al and Cu foils were inserted in
            the stack as energy degrader and monitor foils.
           The beam current were measured in faraday cup and via
            monitor reactions on natural Cu and Al, and more
            reliance was attached to measurements through monitor
            reactions.
           (CHSEP) The [7Be]BeO and the [203Hg]HgS were obtained
            after a multi step chemical separation.
           The radiochemical yield was determined gravimetrically.
           The Be and Hg content of the samples were determined
            by using AES-ICP and AAFS respectively.
           The [7Be]Be0 samples were directly measured on a gamma
            detector.
           (GSPEC) The decay was followed for five hours.
           The [203Hg]HgS was measured on a low background
            shielded detector.
           The Tl-208 background peak was separated from the peak
            of 203Hg.

COMMENT    By authors:
           - The real 7Be contribution from Bi is small, and is
             not determinable via assay of the 7Be activity.
           - Rather flat initial part gives presumably the (p,7Be)
             contribution while the rapidly increasing part above
             55 MeV is attributed to the emission of several
             nucleons (4p3n).
