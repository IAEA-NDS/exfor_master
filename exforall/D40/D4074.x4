TITLE      Production cross section of radionuclides in (p,x)
           reactions at copper and nickel nuclei

STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from tables 2 and 3,
           nuclear data of the investigated reactions from
           table 1 of the translated version of the article
           UDC 539.16.01(035.5).
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE)
SAMPLE     the target used were natural Cu 71 mg/cm2 thick
           and Ni 88 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC)
           targets were irradiated with the extracted proton beam
           with a beam current of 97 ma, a current-pulse duration
           of 57 microsec and repetition frequency of 0.25 Hz.
           the primary proton energies were 98., 70. And 36 MeV.
           27 mg/cm2 Al foils were used to degrade the beam
           energy. To calculate the stopping power and ranges
           F. Joseph, Proton range and energy tables, at. Data,
           Nucl. Data Tables, 27,3,1982 was used. The flux was
           monitored via the reactions Cu-65(p,n)Zn-65 in the
           energy region of 10-40 MeV and Al-27(p,x)Na-24 from
           40-100 MeV.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) normal high resolution gamma-spectrometry
           was applied. Nuclear data were taken from U.Reus et al.
           At. Data, Nucl Data Tables 29, 2, 1983.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) the error of the energy includes the
           primary dispersion of the incident beam and also
           the uncertainty of the energy loss in the Al foils
           and in the target foils.
           (DATA-ERR) the overall error in the cross section
           determination includes the errors:
               flux measurements          10-12%
               statistical error           1-3%
               detector efficiency error     5%
               nuclear data uncertaintty     1%
