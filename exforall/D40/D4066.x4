TITLE      Excitation functions for the reactions induced by
           alpha particles on Ag-109
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) irradiation of enriched Ag-109
           (CYCLO,2JPNTOK) irradiation of natural Ag
SAMPLE     enriched silver-109 (99.8%) And natural silver targets
           were used. The enriched Ag-109 was electro-deposited
           onto iron foils. Thickness 8 mg/cm2.
           natural silver targets were rolled foils of 7 - 10
           mg/cm2.
           Al foils were used to degrade the primary energy of
           the alpha particles.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC,CHSEP)
           stack of enriched Ag-109 targets was irradiated at
           22.1 MeV primary alpha particle energy.
           stacks of natural Ag foils were irradiated at 30 and 40
           MeV primary alpha particle energy. Energy degradation
           was calculated using the work of H.Bishsel et al.,
           Phys. Rev. 105,1788,1957.

COMMENT    chemical separation was used before gamma measurement
           to determine the relative activity of the samples.
           gamma-gamma coincidence method was used to determine
           the absolute disintegration rate.
           nuclear data were taken from Nuclear Data Sheets
           NRC-60-2-90, NRC,Washington
           all the measurements were performed after the total
           decay of the 7.6 Min half life isomer state.

COMMENT    beta rays with an energy higher than 0.3 MeV were
           counted with anthracene crystal. The half life of the
           longer-lived isomer state (20.9 Min) was taken from
           literature, while the half life of the ground state
           was determined by decay curve analysis (14.4 Min).
           measurements were done by using NaI(Tl) detector.

COMMENT    gm counter was used to measure the emitted positrons
           of 2.2 MeV from the 66 min ground state. Al filter
           was used to cut off the lower energy disturbing beta
           radiation. Decay curve analysis was used to separate
           the in-108 and in-110.
           the isomer state of the in-100 with 4.9 Hour half life
           was determined trough the 872 keV gamma-line using
           NaI(Tl) detector.
