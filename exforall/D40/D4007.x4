SAMPLE     Quartz gas cells with 25 micron polyimide windows,
           length 2.5 cm were filled with 1 bar natCl gas.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,BCINT) .Two cells were irradiated at
           a time with alpha particle beam of 50-60 Na for 15
           min. Beam current was measured by a Faraday cup and
           monitored by Cu foils.
