REACTION   (18-AR-38(P,N)19-K-38,,SIG,,,EXP)
SAMPLE     STAINLESS STEEL GAS CELLS WITH 100 MICRON AL WINDOWS
           WERE FILLED WITH 95.7% ISOTOPICALLY ENRICHED 38-AR GAS
           UP TO 0.4-0.5 BAR
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB). 19 AND 12 MEV PRIMARY ENERGIES WERE USED
           OTHER ENERGIES WERE OBTAINED BY USING AL DEGRADER
           FOILS. IRRADIATION TIME 10 MIN. BEAM CURRANTS
           200-300 NAMPS. BEAM CURRENT WAS MEASURED BY A FARADAY
           CUP AND CONTROLLED VIA MONITOR REACTIONS.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).METHOD OF ERROR ESTIMATION IS NOT INCLUDED.
           (DATA-ERR).THE OVERALL UNCERTAINTIES OF THE CROSS
           SECTION WERE ESTIMATED BY SUMMING UP THE ERRORS IN
           CURRENT INTEGRATION (10%), COUNTING STATISTICS (1.5
           TO 10%) AND PHOTOPEAK INTEGRATION, DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
            (5%), NUMBER OF TARGET NUCLEI (5%) AND DECAY DATA
            (3%).
