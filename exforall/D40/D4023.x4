SAMPLE     target stacks consisted of 25 microns of Ni-B-Si
           metallic glass foils (Ni 90.60%, B 4.52%, Si 4.90% By
           weight) Al foils were used as energy degrader, 10
           microns of Cu foil was added to the front of the stack
           as monitor foil.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB).18.0, 14.5 And 12.0 MeV primary
           proton energies, 100 to 200 namp beam current. Beam
           current was monitored with faraday cup and monitor
           reactions on Cu. The energy degradation was calculated
           according to J.F. Zigler, Stopping and ranges of ions
           in matters vol.3. Hydrogen stopping, correction was
           made for the contribution of the Co-55 activity half
           life 17.54 Hr E gamma=477.2 keV (20.32%) Nuclear data
           for the isotopes in consideration were taken from
