SAMPLE     NATURAL SILVER STACKED FOILS WERE USED AS TARGET.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC)
           STACKS OF SILVER FOILS WERE IRRADIATED AT 25., 40. AND
           50  MEV  PRIMARY ENERGY. AL FOILS WERE INSERTED INTO
           EACH STACK TO DEGRADE THE BEAM ENERGY AND TO STOP
           THE RECOILED REACTION PRODUTS. THE ENERGY LOSS OF THE
           BEAM WAS CALCULATED BY USING THE RANGE-ENERGY TABLES OF
           C.F.WILLIAMSON ET AL.,REPORT,CEA-R3042/1966.
           THE TARGETS WERE COOLED BY WATER DURING IRRADIATION.
           GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY MEASUREMENTS STARTED 10 HOUR AFTER
           THE END OF BOMBARDMANT.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ENERGY SCALE WAS ESTIMATED
           FROM THE ENERGY SPREAD OF THE INCIDENT BEAM AND THE
           STRAGGLING EFFECT. THE AVERAGE VALUE WAS ABOUT 0.5 MEV.
           ERROR OF THE CROSS SECTION DATA INCLUDES
            -ERROR IN THE MEASURED ACTIVITY
            -STATISTICAL ERROR
            -ERROR OF THE DETECTOR EFFICIRNCY
            -ERROR OF THE NUCLEAR DATA
            -ERROR IN THE TIMINGS
            -ERROR IN THE TARGET THICKNESS
           NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM TABLE OF ISOTOPES,7TH ED
           BY C.M.LEDERER AND V.S SHIRLY, J.WILEY, NEW YORK,1978
           THE OVERALL ERROR FOR THE CROSS-SECTION WAS ESTIMATED
           TO BE LESS THAN 8%.
CORRECTION CORRECTION WAS MADE FOR THE RECOIL EFFECT WHICH WAS
           BETWEEN 1% AND 2 %.
STATUS     DATA WERE TAKEN FROM FIGURES 1 OF J,JRN/L,44,307,80
           APPROVED BY S. TAKACS 06 MAY 1997.
