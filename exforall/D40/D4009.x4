METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) from excitation functions for the
           formation ofradioisotopes of Rb from natural kryptond
           and enriched 82-Kr and 83-Kr (presented in j,ari,
           42,329,1991) differential and integral yield of 82M
           Rb were calculated and compared with experimental
           production yields.
ADD-RES    radiation dose calculations from 81-Rb/81m-Kr, 82m-Rb
           and 82-Rb.

SAMPLE     conical target front diam. 1.0Cm back diam. 2.0Cm
           length 18cm was filled to 2.15 Bar with enriched 82-Kr
           isotopic composition: 78-Kr 0.8%, 80-Kr 9.5%, 82-Kr
           72.9%, 83-Kr 16.7% And 84-Kr 0.1%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,CHSEP,GSPEC)20 MeV proton from cv28
           cyclotron was degraded in copper absorber and the
           front double window. Irradiation time were 1-2 hours
           at 5-10 microampers beam current. After one hour
           cooling time the enriched gas was recovered and Rb
           activity from the target inner wall was removed with
           water.
