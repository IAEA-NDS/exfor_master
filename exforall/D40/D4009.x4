STATUS     (CURVE).PRIVATE COMMINICATION
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) FROM EXCITATION FUNCTIONS FOR THE
           FORMATION OFRADIOISOTOPES OF RB FROM NATURAL KRYPTOND
           AND ENRICHED 82-KR AND 83-KR (PRESENTED IN J,ARI,
           42,329,1991) DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL YIELD OF 82M
           RB WERE CALCULATED AND COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL
           PRODUCTION YIELDS.
ADD-RES    RADIATION DOSE CALCULATIONS FROM 81-RB/81M-KR, 82M-RB
           AND 82-RB.

SAMPLE     CONICAL TARGET FRONT DIAM. 1.0CM BACK DIAM. 2.0CM
           LENGTH 18CM WAS FILLED TO 2.15 BAR WITH ENRICHED 82-KR
           ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION: 78-KR 0.8%, 80-KR 9.5%, 82-KR
           72.9%, 83-KR 16.7% AND 84-KR 0.1%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,CHSEP,GSPEC)20 MEV PROTON FROM CV28
           CYCLOTRON WAS DEGRADED IN COPPER ABSORBER AND THE
           FRONT DOUBLE WINDOW. IRRADIATION TIME WERE 1-2 HOURS
           AT 5-10 MICROAMPERS BEAM CURRENT. AFTER ONE HOUR
           COOLING TIME THE ENRICHED GAS WAS RECOVERED AND RB
           ACTIVITY FROM THE TARGET INNER WALL WAS REMOVED WITH
           WATER.
