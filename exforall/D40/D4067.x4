SAMPLE     NATURAL SILVER STACKED FOILS WERE USED AS TARGET.
           CU AND AL FOILS WERE USED TO REDUCE THE ENERGY OF
           THE ALPHA-PARTICLES AND ALSO FOR MONITORING THE BEAM
           OF THE ALPHA PARTICLES.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC)
           STACKS OF SILVER FOILS WERE IRRADIATED AT 55. MEV
           PRIMARY ALPHA PARTICLE ENERGY.
