SAMPLE     CR WAS DEPOSITED ELECTROLYTICALLY ON AU(10MICRON) FOILS
           WITH THICKNESS OF 10 - 20 MG/CM2. CHEMICAL PURITY WAS
           CHECKED BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRY (97+-3%)
           25 SAMPLES WERE PREPARED
           100 AND 250 MICRON THICK AL AND 20 MICRON TI FOILS WERE
           USED AS MONITOR AND ENERGY DEGRADER FOILS SUPPLIED BY
           GOODFELLOW. (PURITY 99.9%)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP)
           EXCITATION FUNCTION WAS MEASURED VIA THE
           ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE USING STACKED FOIL TARGETS.
           SEVERAL STACKS, EACH CONTAINING 1 ELECTROPLATED CR
           SAMPLE AND SOME TI FOILS WERE IRRADIATED FOR 1-5 MIN
           AT LOW 50-300 NA BEAM OF HE-3 PARTICLES.
           THE BEAM CURRENT WAS DETERMINED USING FARADAY CUP AS
           WELL AS VIA THE NAT-TI(HE-3,X)V-48 MONITOR REACTION.
           THE TWO VALUES WERE IN 5 % AGREEMENT. AL FOILS WERE
           USED TO DECREASE THE PRIMARY BEAM ENERGY. THE ENERGY
           DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO WILLIAMSON
           ET AL. (TABLES OF RANGE AND STOPPING POWER OF CHEMICAL
           ELEMENTS FOR CHARGED PARTICLES OF ENERGY 0.5 TO 500 MEV
           ,RAPPORT CEA-R 3042 1966). CHEMICAL SEPARATION WAS
           APPLIED TO MEASURE THE SHORT LIVED FE-52-M ISOTOPE.
           THE USUAL GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY WAS APPLIED TO MEASURE THE
           RADIOACTIVITY.
           NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM E. BROWNE,R.B.FIRESTONE,
           TABLE OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES, ED. V.S.SHIRLEY,
           WILEY, 1986, NEW YORK.
