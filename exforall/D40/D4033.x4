SAMPLE     natural evaporated antimony on Cu backings. Thickness
           of Sb layers were about 0.8mg/cm**2 determined
           independently by weighing
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA,EXTB,GSPEC).Separately irradiated targets.
           irradiation time: 20 min, beam intensity: 10 Na. Beam
           current measurements by Faraday-cup.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
STATUS     (CURVE).Data and data error were taken from the curve.

COMMENT     (by compiler).Since natural antimony was used as
           target material ( isotopic composition: Sb-121, 57.3%,
           Sb-123,  42.7%) Probably it was assumed by the authors
           that the contribution of Sb-121(He3,n) process was
           very low, du to the  magnitude of the cross section
           of (He3,n) reaction in the investigated region.
