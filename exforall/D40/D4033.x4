SAMPLE     NATURAL EVAPORATED ANTIMONY ON CU BACKINGS. THICKNESS
           OF SB LAYERS WERE ABOUT 0.8MG/CM**2 DETERMINED
           INDEPENDENTLY BY WEIGHING
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA,EXTB,GSPEC).SEPARATELY IRRADIATED TARGETS.

COMMENT     (BY COMPILER).SINCE NATURAL ANTIMONY WAS USED AS
           TARGET MATERIAL ( ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION: SB-121, 57.3%,
           SB-123,  42.7%) PROBABLY IT WAS ASSUMED BY THE AUTHORS
           THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF SB-121(HE3,N) PROCESS WAS
           VERY LOW, DU TO THE  MAGNITUDE OF THE CROSS SECTION
           OF (HE3,N) REACTION IN THE INVESTIGATED REGION.
