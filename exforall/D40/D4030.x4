TITLE      Nuclear data relevant to the production of the
           positron emitting radioisotope Y-86 via the
           Sr-86(p,n)- and nat-Rb(He-3,xn)-processes

ANALYSIS   (AREA) nuclear data were taken from E. Browne, R.B.
           Firestone, Table of radioactive isotopes, (ed. Sirley)
           Willey, London, 1986. The energy degradation was
           calculated according to C.F.Williamson et al., Rapport
           CEA-R-3042,1966.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) calculation of differential and integral yield.
           experimental determination of radioytrium impurities.
           isomeric ratios for the isomeric pairs Y-86-m, Y-86-G
           in the Rb-86(p,n) and Rb-nat(He-3,xn) processes as a
           function of the energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The total error of the cross sections was
           derived as the square root of the sum of square of the
           individual errors. Main errors considered:
           -target thickness 2%
           -inhomogeneity in target thickness <10%
           -determination of abs. Activity  10% near threshold
                      up to 20%
           -beam current <10%
           -detector efficiency and geometry 5%
           -decay data errors 3% except for Y-85-m.
           typical overall errors: 15-22% for Sr-86(p,xn) and
           15-20% for Rb-0(He-3,xn) reactions
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty in energy scale is increasing
           with decreasing energy.
           0.15 To 0.3 For protons and
           0.3 To 0.5 For He-3 particles

SAMPLE     srco3 was used as target material. Isotopic
           composition:
           Sr-84  <0.002%
           Sr-86  96.3%
           Sr-87  1.02%
           Sr-88  2.68%
           thin samples 6-16 mg/cm**2 were prepared by using
           sedimentation onto 25 microns of Cu backing and
           covered with 25 microns of Al foil. Each stack
           contained at the front side a separate Cu monitor
           foil..
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV,GSPEC).Several stacks each contained
           4-6 sandwich samples were irradiated for 15 min at 10
           100 namp beam. The primary proton energy was
           determined from the ratio of sigma(p,2n) and
           sigma(p,n) on Cu-63 according to H. Piel et al.
           radiochimica acta, 57,1,1992. The beam intensity was
           deduced from the Cu-63(p,n) monitor reaction on the
           Cu backing of the Sr samples.

SAMPLE     Rb2Co3 was used as target material. Isotopic

           Rb-85  72.17%
           Rb-87  27.83%
           thin samples 6-16 mg/cm**2 were prepared by using
           sedimentation onto 25 microns of Cu backing and
           covered with 13.4 Microns of Ti foil.
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV,GSPEC)several stacks, each containing
           4-6 sandwich samples, were irradiated for 15 min at 10
           100 namp beam. The primary He-3 energy was 36.1 MeV.
           the beam intensity was deduced from the monitor
           reaction on the Ti foil.
