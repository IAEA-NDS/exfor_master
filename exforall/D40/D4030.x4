TITLE      NUCLEAR DATA RELEVANT TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE

           86(P,N)- AND NAT-RB(HE-3,XN)-PROCESSES

ANALYSIS   (AREA) NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM E. BROWNE, R.B.
           FIRESTONE, TABLE OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES, (ED. SIRLEY)
           WILLEY, LONDON, 1986. THE ENERGY DEGRADATION WAS
           CALCULATED ACCORDING TO C.F.WILLIAMSON ET AL., RAPPORT
           CEA-R,3042,1966.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) CALCULATION OF DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL YIELD.
           EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF RADIOYTRIUM IMPURITIES.
           ISOMERIC RATIOS FOR THE ISOMERIC PAIRS Y-86-M, Y-86-G
           IN THE RB-86(P,N) AND RB-NAT(HE-3,XN) PROCESSES AS A
           FUNCTION OF THE ENERGY.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).THE TOTAL ERROR OF THE CROSS SECTIONS WAS
           DERIVED AS THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE SUM OF SQUARE OF THE
           INDIVIDUAL ERRORS. MAIN ERRORS CONSIDERED:
           -TARGET THICKNESS 2%
           -INHOMOGENEITY IN TARGET THICKNESS <10%
           -DETERMINATION OF ABS. ACTIVITY  10% NEAR THRESHOLD
                      UP TO 20%
           -BEAM CURRENT <10%
           -DETECTOR EFFICIENCY AND GEOMETRY 5%
           -DECAY DATA ERRORS 3% EXCEPT FOR Y-85-M.
           TYPICAL OVERALL ERRORS: 15-22% FOR SR-86(P,XN) AND
           15-20% FOR RB-0(HE-3,XN) REACTIONS
           (EN-ERR).THE UNCERTAINTY IN ENERGY SCALE IS INCREASING
           WITH DECREASING ENERGY.
