TITLE      Reaction mechanisms and shell structure effects in
           54Fe + 6Li and 58Ni+d reactions at medium energies

DETECTOR   (PROPC,NAICR,GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,EDEG,CHSEP) The catcher foils were
           Al (99.5% pure, ~2 mg/cm2 thick) in the first two low
           energy irradiations.
           To eliminate the interference from the iron in the Al
           foils (99.98% pure, 2.93 - 3.61 mg/cm2 thick) were used
           at higher bombarding energies.
           Al foils were used for energy degradation. The
           integrated charge was about 2 micri-ampere-hour. The
           longest irradiation time was 16.0 Hours. The particle
           energy in each foil was calculated according to
           C.F. Williamson et al., Rapport CEA-R-3042D4061 (1966).
ERR-ANALYS The uncertainty of the energy scale contains the
           uncertainty of the initial beam energy and the
           uncertainty resulted by the degradation process, which
           may Be as large as 2 MeV or 4 MeV for the last foils
           in the deuteron and lithium ion runs, respectively.
           the errors reflect the uncertainties, but are not given
