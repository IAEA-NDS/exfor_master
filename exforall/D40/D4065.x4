TITLE      Excitation of the isomers In-110-m-g, In-111-m-g and
           In-1112-m-g in reactions with alpha-particles having

SAMPLE     enriched silver and Cd targets were used.
             Ag-107            98.8 %
             Ag-109            99.3 %
             Cd-110            95.2 %
           Al foils were used to degrade the primary energy of
           the alpha particles.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           relative excitation function was measured via the
           activation technique using stacked foil targets.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
           the usual gamma-spectrometry was applied to measure the
           radioactivity.
           nuclear data were taken from C.M.Lederer et Al. Table
           of isotopes, New York,p.1523, 1978 And n.G.Gusev et Al.

STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from table 2 of the paper
           (APRVD) approved by S. Takacs 05 may 1997.
