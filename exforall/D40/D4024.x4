STATUS     (CURVE). DATA TAKAN FROM PRIVATE COMMUNICATION.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM G. ERDTMAN AND W.
           SOYKA. THE GAMMA-RAY OF THE  RADIONUCLIDES, VOL.7.,
           VERLAG CHEMIE, WEINHEIM, NEW YORK, 1979. HE ENERGY
           DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO J.F. ZIGLER,
           STOPPING AND RANGES OF IONS IN MATTERS VOL.3 HYDROGEN
           STOPPING,PERGAMON PRESS 1977
ERR-ANALYS  (DATA-ERR)NO ERROR ANALYSIS WAS GIVEN BY THE AUTHORS.
           THE TOTAL ERROR OF THE CROSS SECTIONS WAS LESS THAN
           15%
            (EN-ERR) THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ENERGY SCALE WAS
           +-0.2 MEV AT 28 MEV HE-3 ENERGY AND +-1MEV AT 5 MEV.

           BEAM CURRENT. BEAM CURRENT WAS MONITORED WITH FARADAY
           CUP. FOR CROSS SECTION DETERMINATION THE ACTIVITY OF
           EACH KAPTON FOIL WAS MEASURED TOGETHR  WITH THE AL
           CATHER FOIL PLACE BEHIND THE KAPTON IN THE STACK. THE
           AL FOILS WERE MEASURED SEPARETELLY TO DETERMINE THE
           RATIO OF RECOIL IMPLANTATION.
