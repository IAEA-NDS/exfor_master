TITLE      DIFFERENTIAL PRODUCTION YILEDS OF I-123 IN PROTON AND
           DEUTERON INDUCED REACTIONS ON NATURAL XENON

SAMPLE     GAS CELL SERIES FILLED WITH NATURAL XENON GAS TO A
           PRESSURE OF 3 BARS
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA,EXTB,GSPEC,CHSEP).BEAM CURRENTS: BEWEEN
           100 AND 300 NA. IRRADIATION TIME: 20 TO 60 MIN, BEAM
           CURRENT WAS MEASURED BY USING FARADAY CUP AND USING
           MONITOR REACTIONS. THE IRRADIATED GAS CELLS WERE
           TREATED TWO WAYS:
           -TO MEASURE THE PRODUCTION YIELD OF I-123 AFTER A
           DESIRED WAITING TIME THE IRRADIATED GAS WAS
           TRANSFERRED INTO  A 10ML CILINDER. THE ACTIVITY
           ADSORBED ON THE WALLS WERE RINSED BY A WEAK SOLUTION
           OF NAI AND NAHSO3. THE RADIOIODINE WAS SEPARATED IN
           THE FORM OF AGI.
           -FOR MEASURING THE TOTAL I-123 YIELD THE CELLS WERE
           LEFT TO COOL FOR 24 HOURS.AFTER THE FULL DECAY OF XE-
           123 THE GAS WAS REMOVED AND THE CELL WAS RINSED WITH
           THE ABOVE SOLUTION. FOR RADIOACTIVE ASSEY OF I-123 AN
           ALIQOUT OF THE SOLUTION WAS USED.
