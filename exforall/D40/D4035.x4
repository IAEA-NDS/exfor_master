ADD-RES    By authors:
            Data are experimental differential yield of I-123
             6.6 hr after end of bombardment, when the amount of
             I-123 was at its maximum (if the irradiation time is
             more or less than the half-life of the Xe-123).
            Contributing reactions:
               Xe-0(p,xn)Cs-123
               Xe-0(p,pxn)Xe-123
               Xe-0(p,axn)I-123
