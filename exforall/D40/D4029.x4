TITLE      Excitation function of (p,2n) and (p,pn) reactions and

SAMPLE     99.9% Enriched Xe-124 and 20% enriched Xe-124 gas. Gas
           cells (2cm diam and 2.5 Cm length) having 200 microns
           of Al windows were used as targets. In the case of
           99.9% Enriched Xe-124 5 target cells were filled
           simultaneously up to 0.48 Bar. In the case of 20%
           enrichment the irradiated gas was transferred into an
           evacuated gas container via cryogenic technic.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)only one cell was irradiated
           at a time one or several Cu foils were place in front
           and one Cu foil placed at the back of each cell to
           monitor the beam and to degrade the energy. The
           primary incident proton energies were 45, 30,3, 24,
           22.5 And 20 MeV. The cells were irradiated for 5min
           at 200 namp beam current. The beam intensity was
           measured by using faraday-cup as well as monitor
           reactions. The radiocesium was separated for a few
           cells filled with 20% enriched Xe-124. The radioiodine
           was separated for a few cells filled with 99.9%
           enriched Xe-124.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) the energy degradation was calculated according
           to C.F. Williamson et Al., Rapport CEA-R-3042. To
           calculate the independent formation cross section of
           Xe-123 the contribution from the decay of Cs-123 was
           taken into account. The decay data of the reaction
           products were taken from E. Browne, R.B.Firestone,
           Table of radioactive isotopes, (ed. Sirley) Willey,
           London, 1986., C.M.Lederer and V.S.Shirley (eds)
           Table of isotopes, 7Th ed. Wiley, London, 1978.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The total error of the cross sections was
           derived as the square root of the sum of square of the
           individual errors.
           -determination of abs. Activity  10%
           -beam current <10%
           -number of target nuclei <3%
           the total error amounted in Xe-124(p,2n)Cs-123 cross-
           section and I-123 differential yields are 15-18%. In
           the error of the independent formation of
           Xe-124(p,p+n)Xe-123 the errors in Xe-124(p,2n)Cs-123
           process were also taken into account. In general: the
           independent formation of cross section of Xe-123 have
           an error of 25-30%.
            (en-err).Information about the error-analysis and the
           errors of the energy scale are not given.
