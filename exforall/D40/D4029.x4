TITLE      Excitation function of (p,2n) and (p,pn) reactions and

SAMPLE     99.9% Enriched Xe-124 and 20% enriched Xe-124 gas. Gas
           cells (2.cm diam and 2.5 cm length) having 200 microns
           of Al windows were used as targets. In the case of
           99.9% enriched Xe-124 5 target cells were filled
           simultaneously up to 0.48 bar. In the case of 20%
           enrichment the irradiated gas was transferred into an
           evacuated gas container via cryogenic technics.

            (Spectrum ACE) 4K MCA Plug-In Card.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,BCINT) only one cell was
           irradiated at a time one or several Cu foils were
           place in front and one Cu foil placed at the back of
           each cell to monitor the beam and to degrade the
           energy. The primary incident proton energies were 45,
           30,3, 24, 22.5 and 20 MeV. The cells were irradiated
           for 5min at 200 nAmp beam current. The beam intensity
           was measured by using Faraday-cup as well as monitor
           reactions. The radiocesium was separated for a few
           cells filled with 20% enriched Xe-124. The radioiodine
           was separated for a few cells filled with 99.9%
           enriched Xe-124.
ANALYSIS   The energy degradation was calculated according
           to C.F. Williamson et al.(see REL-REF). To calculate
           the independent formation cross section of Xe-123 the
           contribution from the decay of Cs-123 was taken into
           account.
REL-REF    (R,,E.Browne+,B,BROWNE,,123-3,1986) decay data were
           from Table of radioactive isotopes,p.123-3, Wiley,
           New York 1986, and from
           (R,,C.M.Lederer+,B,LEDERER-7,,,1978) Table of isotopes,
           7Th ed. Wiley, London, 1978.

ERR-ANALYS In the error of the independent formation of
           Xe-124(p,p+n)Xe-123 the errors in Xe-124(p,2n)Cs-123
           process were also taken into account.
           (ERR-T) The total error of the cross sections was
           derived as the square root of the sum of square of the
           individual errors:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in determination of the absolute
           activity of each product
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in beam current
           (ERR-3,,3.) Uncertainty in number of target nuclei <3%
           (ERR-4,,3.) Uncertainty in detector efficiency
