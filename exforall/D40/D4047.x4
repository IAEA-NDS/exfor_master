REFERENCE  (J,ARI,48,267,1997)
           (J,ARI,46,255,1995) contains the error analysis
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB), MGC 20E cyclotron Debrecen
           (CYCLO,2GERJUL), CV28 cyclotron in Juelic
SAMPLE     isotopically enriched Te-123 deposited on Ti foil and
           covered with thin Al foil.T-123 sample thickness 0.3 To
           17 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,BCINT,MOSEP)
           three stacks each containing 5 sample and
           5 Fe monitor foils were irradiated for 1 hour at 50 Na
           using primary deuteron energies of 13.2 MeV at CV28
           cyclotron, Juelich and 10.0 MeV at MGC 20E cyclotron,
           Debrecen. The beam current was monitored via charge
           collection in a Faraday-cup and also by
           nat-Fe(d,x)Co-56 and nat-Fe(d,x)Co-57 monitor reactions
           nuclear data were taken from E.Browne and R.B.Firestone
           Table of radioactive isotopes, ed.V.S.Shirley, Wiley,
           1986. The decay of the activities was followed over
           several half-lives.

           the energy degradation in the foils was calculated
           according to williamson et al. (Tables of range and
           stopping power of chemical elements for charged
           particles of energy 0.5 To 500 MeV, rapport CEA-R-3042,
           1966).
