STATUS     (TABLE) APROVED BY THE AUTHOR
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)THE INCIDENT HE-3 PARTICLE
           ENERGY WAS 28 MEV. FOR EXCITATION FUNCTION MEASUREMENT
           TWO STACKS WERE IRRADIATED. EACH CONTAINED 9 BI-ON-CU
           SAMPLES. IRRADIATION TOOK 1-1.5 HOURS AT 120 NAMPS
           BEAM CURRENT. FOR PRODUCTION THE TARGETS WERE
           IRRADIATED FOR TWO HOURS AT 0.5 TO 2.0 MICROAMPS HE-3
           BEAMS. THE ENERGY DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING
           TO C.F.WILLIAMSON ET AL. REPORT CEA-R-3042, 1966, AND
           WAS CHECKED BY USING MONITOR REACTIONS ACCORDING TO
           F. TARKANYI ET AL. ACTA RADIOLOGICA SUPPL,
           376,72,1991. DECAY DATA OF THE REACTION PRODUCTS ON
           BI AND CU WERE TAKEN FROM E. BROWNE AND R.B.FIRESTONE:
           TABLE OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES (SHIRLEY V.S.ED) WILEY,
           LONDON,1986.
SAMPLE     FOR EXCITATION FUNCTION MEASUREMENT 2-10 MICRONS OF
           BI-209 WAS EVAPORATED ONTO 8.3 MICRONS OF CU FOILS.
           FOR PRODUCTION 35 TO 75 MICRONS (IN ONE CASE 300
           MICRONS) OF BI-209 WAS EVAPORATED ONTO 1 MM THICK CU
           OR AL BACKINGS

COMMENT     (BY COMPILER).IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM IAEA REPORT WHICH
           CROSS-SECTION DATA WERE USED FOR CU-63(HE-3,2N)GA-66
           MONITOR REACTION
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ENERGY OF ENTERING
           HE-3 BEAM WAS 0.3 MEV. METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE
           UNCERTAINTY OF THE HE-3 BEAM ENERGY IN THE BI SAMPLES
           IS NOT GIVEN.
           (DATA-ERR).THE TOTAL ERROR OF THE CROSS SECTIONS WAS
           DERIVED AS THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE SUM OF SQUARE OF THE
           INDIVIDUAL ERRORS.
