TITLE      PRODUCTION OF K-38 AT LOW ENERGY CYCLOTRON
AUTHOR     (S.M.QAIM, F.TARKANYI, Z.KOVACS, G.STOCKLIN)
REFERENCE  (J,JLCR,32,478,93) PRESENTED AT THE 9TH INT. SYMPOSIUM
           ON RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY.
INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA WERE TAKEN FROM FIGURE 1 OF THE PAPER.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL)
SAMPLE     HIGHLY ENRICHED AR-38 GAS (95.7%)
           STAINLESS STEEL CELLS (VOL. 8ML) HAVING AL WINDOWS WERE
           FILLED WITH AR-38 TO A PRESSURE OF 0.5 BAR AND CU
           MONITOR FOILS PLACED IN FRONT AND AT THE BACK OF EACH
           CELL.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) ONE CELL WAS IRRADIATED AT A TIME
           FOR 10 MIN AT A BEAM CURRENT OF 200 NA. EACH
           IRRADIATED GAS CELL WAS COUNTED DIRECTLY
ANALYSIS   (AREA) THE ENERGY DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING
           TO C.F. WILLIAMSON ET AL., RAPPORT CEA-R 3042.
           THE DECAY DATA OF THE REACTION PRODUCTS WERE TAKEN
           FROM E. BROWNE, R.B.FIRESTONE, TABLE OF RADIOACTIVE
           ISOTOPES, (ED. SIRLEY) WILLEY, LONDON, 1986.,
