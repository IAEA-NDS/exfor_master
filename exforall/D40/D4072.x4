TITLE      Production of K-38 at low energy cyclotron
AUTHOR     (S.M.Qaim, F.Tarkanyi, Z.Kovacs, G.Stocklin)
REFERENCE  (J,JLCR,32,478,1993) presented at the 9Th int. Sympos.
           on radiopharmaceutical chemistry.
INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from figure 1 of the paper.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL)
SAMPLE     highly enriched Ar-38 gas (95.7%)
           stainless steel cells (vol. 8Ml) having Al windows were
           filled with Ar-38 to a pressure of 0.5 Bar and Cu
           monitor foils placed in front and at the back of each
           cell.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) one cell was irradiated at a time
           for 10 min at a beam current of 200 Na. Each
           irradiated gas cell was counted directly
ANALYSIS   (AREA) the energy degradation was calculated according
           to C.F. Williamson et Al., Rapport CEA-R-3042.
           the decay data of the reaction products were taken
           from E. Browne, R.B.Firestone, Table of radioactive
           isotopes, (ed. Sirley) Willey, London, 1986.,
