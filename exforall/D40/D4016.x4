TITLE      Excitation function of alpha-particle induced nuclear
           reactions on highly enriched Mo-92:comparative
           evaluation of production routes for Tc-94m
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERJUL).
SAMPLE     isotopic composition of target material in percent:
           Mo-92 (97.37), Mo-94 (0.68), Mo-95 (0.52), Mo-96
            (0.37), Mo-97 (0.18), Mo-98 (0.40), Mo-100 (0.50).
           chemical purity greater than 98.8 Percent. The samples
           were prepared by means of sedimentation of mos2
           powder. 3-6 mg/cm**2 thick layer was made on 10
           micron of Ni foils and the sedimented layer was
           covered with 5 micron of Ni foil. For yield
           measurements 80-150 mg/cm**2 targets were prepared
           using the same technique. 12.5 Micron of Ti foils were
           placed in front of and the back of each sandwiches of
           samples as beam monitor foils.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)primary incident particle ener-
           gy 27.1 Mev, checked by measuring the distance between
           two bounces in the beam along the beam line. (Z.
           kormany, nim a 337,258,1994) 10, 25 and 20 microns of
           aluminum foils served as energy degraders. The energy
           degradation was calculated in accordance with C.F.
           Williamson et Al., Rapport CEA-R 3042,1966,
           irradiation times: 20, 40 min, beam current: 100 or
           200 namp. Thick target yields and isotopic impurities
           were determined with 1 hour irradiation at 1-2
           microamp.
DETECTOR   (GELI).Sample detector distance greater than 10 cm.
           dead time was less than 8 percent

           the contribution of the parent before chemical
           separation.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The total error of the cross sections was
           derived as the square root of the sum of square of the
           individual errors.
           -target thickness less than 2 %
           -inhomogeneity in target thickness less than 10 %
           -beam intensity: 10 %
           -detector efficiency including geometry 5%
           -peak area and counting statistics:6-30%
