SAMPLE     NATURAL METAL TI FOILS 1.8 MG/CM THICK.
           AL FOILS WERE USED AS ENERGY DEGRADER IN THE STACK.
           ABOUT 9 MG/CM2 VANADIUM PENTOXID WAS PREPARED BY
           SPATTERING ONTO THIN AL FOILS.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) STACKS WERE IRRADIATED IN VACUUM.
           BEAM CURRENT WAS MONITORED BY FARADAY-CUP.
           THE RECOIL LOS WAS ABOUT 20% AND THE CROSS SECTION WAS
           CORRECTED FOR THE RECOIL LOSS IN THE CASE OF TI
           BOMBARDMENT.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) NORMAL NAI(TL) GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY WAS APPLIED
           THE ENERGY LOSS IN THE AL ENERGY DEGRADER FOILS WAS
           CALCULATED H. BICHSEL ET AL., PHYS. REV. 105(1957)1788,
           V.C. BURKING ET AL. IBID 106(1957)848 AND
           R.M. STERNHEIMER IBID 115(1959)137.
           THE ENERGY LOSS IN THE TARGET FOILS WAS DETERMINED
           USING THE BETHE FORMULA.
COMMENT    THE CONTRIBUTION OF (A,2N) REACTIONS WAS NOT DISCUSSED
