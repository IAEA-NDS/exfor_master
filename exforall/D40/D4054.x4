TITLE      Activation cross sections for deuteron-induced
           reactions on some elements of the first transition
           series, up to 5.5 MeV

SAMPLE     targets of natural composition were electroplated on
           tantalum backing 0.4-1.0 mg/cm2 thick. Enriched targets
           were prepared when was neccessary.
           the uniformity of the targets was checked by
           autoradiography after irradiation of the targets.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,GSPEC)
           5.5 MeV deuteron beams (0.5 And 1.2 Micro-a)
           were used for irradiation. Targets were placed on A
           rotating sample holder cooled by compressed air.
           aluminum foils were used to reduce the primary deuteron
           energy. The energy degradation was calculated according
           to C.F. Williamson et al. CEA-R-3042 1966.
           all the irradiations were performed for the same
           amount of charge to Be able to build up a relative
           cross section curve. A single sample was irradiated in
           faraday cup for absolute determination of the cross
           section to which point the cross section curve was
           normalised.
           NaI(Tl) scintillation and Ge(Li) detectors were used
           for gamma activity measurements.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) the reletive precision of the peak area
           was less than 0.5% When high activities were measured,
           but reached up to 20% in the case of low activities.
           the detector efficiency was less than 3%.
           the relative error of the target thickness was 2.5%.
           the error of the beam current measured in faraday-cup
           was 1.5%.
           every cross section was considered as a separate
           determination and each error value is the root mean
           square error calculated from all the relevant
           experimental conditions pertaining to the measurement.
           the uncertainty in the energy of the primary deuteron
           beam was +- 2.0 Kev
STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from table 1. - 5. of
           Radiochimica Acta, vol. 17., pp. 1-6., 1972.
