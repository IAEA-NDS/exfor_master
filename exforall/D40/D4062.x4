SAMPLE     Targets were made of natural Ni foils
           Thickness of 25 microns (GOODFELLOW), purity
           99.4%. The error of the thickness was about 3%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,EDEG)
           The Stacked Foil Technique was used to measure the
           excitation functions. 12 stacks were prepared.
           Cu and Al (25 micron each) were used as monitor and/or
           energy degrader foils. The integrated charge was
           ranged from 3 to 10 mC. Irradiation time was varied
           between 5 and 55 minutes.
           For measurements of the effect of secondary neutrons
           300 and 125 micron thick Ni foils were placed right
           behind the Ni and Al plates which completely stopped
           the proton beams. The beam energy was 42.9 and 26.7 MeV
           beam current 850 and 810 nA respectively. The neutron
           spectra was measured by Time of Flight technique, the
           activity of the neutron activated foils by normal
           Gamma-Spectrometry. Results published in the Proc.
           of the Int. Conf. on Nuclear Data for Science and
           Technology 19-24 May,1997, Trieste, Italy.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy scale contains
           the uncertainty of the initial beam energy and the
           uncertainty resulted by the degradation process and
           straggling effect and ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 MeV.
           (ERR-T)  The Data error was calculated as the square
           root of the sum of the square of the individual
           relative errors. The main error sources are:
             -Foil Thickness                        3%
             -Detector Efficiency                8-10%
             -Detector Geometry                   2-5%
             -Nuclear Data                          3%
