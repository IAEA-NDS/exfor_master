TITLE      Excitation functions of deuteron induced nuclear
           reactions on natMo and 100Mo(90%) up to 50 MeV: An
           alternative route for the production of 99Mo.

SAMPLE     High Purity, >99.9%, natMo 12micron and enriched 100Mo
           in oxide forme. Enriched 100Mo oxide powder mixed with
           carbon-tetrachloride and nitro-cellulose was sedimented
           onto 92 micron thick Al backing. Composition of the
           enriched 100Mo:
                           92Mo  1.1%
                           94Mo  0.8%
                           95Mo  1.4%
                           96Mo  1.6%
                           97Mo  1.0%
                           98Mo  3.6%
                          100Mo 90.5%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           used. Beam current was measured in Faraday-cup and also
           was monitored by natAl(D,X)22Na and 24Na reactions.
           Recoil effect was found to be less than 1%.
           Decay data were taken from E.Browne, R.Firestone, Table
           of Radioactive Isotopes, V.S.Shirley [Ed], Wiley,
           London, 1986. Six stacks were irradiated at 30 and 50
           MeV primary beam energies for about half an hour with
           about 40nA beam current. Stacks contained Al, Ti, Fe,
           Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr and W Foils besides the Mo target foils.

ERR-ANALYS         The uncertainty of the primary beam energy was
           +-0.1 MeV. The energy attenuation was calculated by
           using the polynomial approximation of Andersen and
           Ziegler along the stacks.
                Total error of the data is varied from 10% to 15%.
           Main contributing error components are:
               Beam intensity                       3%
               Detector efficiency                3-6%
               Peak area and counting statistics 2-10%
               Number of target nuclei            5-8%
               Nuclear data                         5%
