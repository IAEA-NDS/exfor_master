SAMPLE     natural Ne gas at 3 bar pressure in stainless-steel
           gas cells (diam: 2 cm length 2.5 Cm) with Ti or Al
           closing windows. Five cells in one stack and Cu foils,
           8 micron, in between as monitor foils were irradiated.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,BCINT,MOSEP)
           excitation function was measured via the
           activation technique using stacked gas cell targets.
           irradiatin were done at 11.5, 14.5 And 18.0 MeV
           primary proton energies. Irradiation time varied
           betwee 1 and 2 hours, and the beam intensity between
           100 and 200 Na.
           the charge was collection in a faraday-cup and also
           was monitored by 63-Cu(p,2n)62-Zn, 63-Cu(p,n)63-Zn and
           65-Cu(p,n)65-Zn monitor reactions
           nuclear data were taken from E.Browne and R.B.Firestone
           table of radioactive isotopes ed.V.S.Shirley, Wiley
           1986. There was 10 % difference between the two
           method of determining the beam current. In calculation
           of cross section the charge measured in Faraday cup was
           used.
           the energy in the centre of each target cells was
           determined using Ziegler'S formula (handbook of
           stopping cross-sections for energetic ions in all
           elements, vol 5.,Pergamon press, Oxford 1980.)

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) the uncertainties in the energy scale were
           calculated taking into account the uncertainty in the
           primary beam energy, the sraggling effect and the error
           of the energy correction based on the nat-Cu(p,x)
           monitor reactions.
           (ERR-T) the error of the cross section was determined
           by taking the square root of the sum of the squre
           of the individual relative errors. The main errors are:
            -beam current detemination                        10%
            -caunting statistics and peak area determination 1-7%
            -detector efficiency                               7%
            -decay data                                        3%
            -irradiation time                                  1%
            -effective target thickness                        5%
COMMENT    comparison of production routes of Na-22 is given.
