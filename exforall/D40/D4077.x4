SAMPLE     The Target Material were Thin Al Foils, Nitrogen and
           Neon Gas.
           Al and Ti Foils were Used For Monitoring the Beam.
           Al and Ag Foils were Used For Cell Windows.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP) Stacks of Al Foils were
           Irradiated For 70 to 240 Minutes with 1 to 1.5 Microa
           He-3 Beam. The Gases were Irradiated in Stainless Steel
           Cilindrical Gas Cells Having Al and Ag Windows For 95
           To 160 Min and the Beam Current was 200 to 500 Na.
           Thin-Walled Al Clinders were Used As Inner Liner to
           Help the Removal of the be-7 from the Stainless Steel
           Cells. Max Four Cells were Placed in One Stack. The
           Irradiation were done on Air.
           Be-Carrier Added Chemical Separation was Applied to
           Separate the Produced be-7. Standard High Resolution
           Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy was Used to Determine the
           Activity. The Contribution of be-7 Produced in the Al
           Windows was Substracted. Control Irradiation were
           Performed Using Silver Windows on the Gas Cells.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Normal High Resolution Gamma-Spectrometry
           Was Applied. Counting Periods Between Two Hours
           And Seven Days were Applied.
           Nuclear Data were Taken from Lederer and Shirley,Table
           Of Isotopes 7Th Ed. Wiley, New York, 1978.
ERR-ANALYS The Primary Beam Energies were Determined
           By Time-Of-Flight Measurements of Beam Bunches and were
           24.7 and 35.8 MeV.
           The Energy Degradation was Calculated Using the
           Tables of Williamson Et Al.,Report, Cea-R-3042 (1966)
           And Tobailem Et Al., Rapport Cea-N-1466(1) (1971).
           No Detail was Given For the Energy Scale Uncertainties.
           (DATA-ERR) The Overall Error in the Cross Section
           Determination Includes the Errors:
               Flux Measurements          8-20%
               Detector Efficiency Error   6-17%
               Target Weight Error          2-11%
           Total Error in the Cross Sections were 11-24%.
