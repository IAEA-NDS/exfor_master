INC-SOURCE The primary beam energies were determined by time-of-
            flight Measurements of Beam Bunches and were 24.7 and
            35.8 MeV.
           The energy degradation was calculated using the tables
            of Williamson et al.,Report, CEA-R-3042 (1966) and
            Tobailem et al., Report CEA-N-1466(1) (1971).
           No detail was given for the energy scale uncertainties.
SAMPLE     The target material were thin Al foils, nitrogen and
            neon gas.
           Al and Ti foils were used for monitoring the beam.
           Al and Ag foils were used for cell windows.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP) Stacks of Al foils were
             irradiated for 70 to 240 minutes with 1 to 1.5 uA
             He-3 beam.
            The gases were irradiated in stainless steel
             cylindrical gas cells having Al and Ag windows for
             95 to 160 min and the beam current was 200 to 500 nA.
            Thin-walled Al cylinders were used as inner liner to
             help the removal of the Be-7 from the stainless
             steel cells.
            Max four cells were placed in one Stack.
            The irradiation were done on air.
            Be-carrier added chemical separation was applied to
             separate the produced Be-7.
            Standard high resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy was
             used to Determine the activity.
            The contribution of Be-7 produced in the Al windows
             was substracted.
            Control irradiation were performed using silver
             windows on the gas cells.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,GELI)
ANALYSIS   Normal high resolution gamma-spectrometry was applied.
           Counting periods between two hours and seven days were
            applied.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error in the cross Sections were 11-24%,
            including
           (ERR-1,8.,20.) Flux measurements          (8-20%)
           (ERR-2,6.,17.) Detector efficiency error  (6-17%)
           (ERR-3,2.,11.) Target weight error        (2-11%)
