SAMPLE     Enriched 18O target in 18O2 Gas, Si[18O]2 and Al2[18O]3
           Composition of the gas targets. Chemical purity>99.9%
             18O      96.7 +-0.3%
             17O       1.1 +-0.1%
             16O       2.2 +-0.2%
           Si[18o]2    18O content 95 +-3%
           Al2[18o]3   18O content 83 +-5%
           The gas cells made of stainless steel 2cm diam. and
           2.5cm length. Gas pressure: 0.4 - 1.5 Bar. 100 micron
           Al windows were used.
           Si[18O]2 targets were made by sedimentation on
           Aluminium from 5mg of Si[18O]2 powder.
           Al2[18O]3 targets were prepared by electrochemical
           oxidation of Aluminium. The thickness of the Al2[18O]3
           layer was measured by SIMS.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked-gas cells and
           stacked-foil technique as well as single target
           irradiation were used. Al2[18O]3 target were irradiated
           one by one at low energies up to 7 MeV with about
           100 nA for about 30 min. Beam current was measured
           by Faraday-cup.
           Stacked gas targets were irradiated with 100 nA
           protons for 5 to 15 min. Beam current was monitored
           with copper foils.
           Stacks made of Al2[18O]3 and Si[18O]2 were irradiated
           for 15 min by 200 to 300 nA proton beam. Cu an Ti
           foils were used to degrade the beam energy and also
           served as monitor foils.
