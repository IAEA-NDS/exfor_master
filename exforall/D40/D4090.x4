SAMPLE     High purity N2 gas (99.9999%) in stainless steel cells
           windowed with 50-100 micrometer thick Al foils from
           Goodfellow. Target pressure was 1-2 bar.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           The primary deuteron energies were 13.5 and 10 MeV.
           Beam current 50-100 nA was measured in Faraday cup.
           natTi(d,x)48V monitor reaction was also used.
           Aluminium foils were used as energy degrader
            50-300 micrometer.
           The decay was followed to be able to separate the 3
           produced positron emitter isotopes, then decay curve
           analysis was performed.
           Nuclear data were taken from E.Brwne and R.B.Firestone
           Table of Radioactive Isotopes Ed.V.S.Shirley,
           Wiley 1986.
           The mean energy in the foils and cells were calculated
           using C.F. Williamson, J.P. Boujot, J.Picard:
           Tables of Rangeand Stopping Power of Chemical Elements
           for Charged Particles of Energy 0.05 to 500 MeV.

ERR-ANALYS The error in the deuteron energy scale was
           estimated to be between 0.5 and 0.7 MeV.
           The error on cross sections is estimated by combining
           the contributing sources in quadrature:
               Beam current               12%
               Number of target nuclei     3%
               Decay data                  2%
               Detector efficiency was     5%
               Statisztical error          3%
               Peak Area Determination     3%
               Decay curve analysis error  5% for 13N, and 11C
               Decay curve analysis error  5-15% for 15O Ed<7MeV
               Decay curve analysis error  25% for 15O Ed>7MeV
            Total error for 13N and 11C is about 15%, for 15O
            is about 20% below 7 MeV and about 30% above 7 MeV.
