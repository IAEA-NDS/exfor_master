SAMPLE     natural Cd foils of 25.6 mg/cm2 thickness were used
           as target foils. 16.56 mg/cm2 Al foils were inserted
           into the stack for monitoring the deuteron beam
           trough the Al-27(d,ap)Na-24 reaction.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           relative excitation function was measured via the
           activation technique using stacked foil targets.
           the beam flux was determined via the Al-27(d,ap)Na-24
           reaction monitor reaction.

ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
           the primary deuteron energy was 27.5 MeV with an
           uncertainty estimated below 1%. The energy
           degradation was calculated according to williamson
           et Al. (Tables of range and stopping power of chemical
           elements for charged particles of energy 0.5 To 500 MeV
           ,rapport CEA-R-3042 1966).
           the usual gamma-spectrometry was applied to measure the
           radioactivity.
           nuclear data were taken from Nucl. Data Sheets, B5,no5
           1971 and Erdtmann-Soyka Jul-1003-AC,1973
ERR-ANALYS en-err. The energy straggling and the uncertainty due
           to the thickness of the foils were included in the
           error of the nergy scale. The nonuniformity of the
           foils were neglected.
           total-err: the over-all error error was estimated on
           the basis of the following possible errors:
            -counting statistics
            -peak area analysis
            -detector efficiency
            -foil thickness
            -error of the nuclear data and timing
           the uncertainty in cross section varied from 5% to
           40%
STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from table 2 and 3. of
           Radiochimica Acta  vol. 24., pp. 57, 1977.
