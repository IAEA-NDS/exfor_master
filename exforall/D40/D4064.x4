SAMPLE     NATURAL CD FOILS OF 25.6 MG/CM2 THICKNESS WERE USED
           AS TARGET FOILS. 16.56 MG/CM2 AL FOILS WERE INSERTED
           INTO THE STACK FOR MONITORING THE DEUTERON BEAM
           TROUGH THE AL-27(D,AP)NA-24 REACTION.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           RELATIVE EXCITATION FUNCTION WAS MEASURED VIA THE
           ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE USING STACKED FOIL TARGETS.
           THE BEAM FLUX WAS DETERMINED VIA THE AL-27(D,AP)NA-24
           REACTION MONITOR REACTION.

ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
           THE PRIMARY DEUTERON ENERGY WAS 27.5 MEV WITH AN
           UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATED BELOW 1%. THE ENERGY
           DEGRADATION WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO WILLIAMSON
           ET AL. (TABLES OF RANGE AND STOPPING POWER OF CHEMICAL
           ELEMENTS FOR CHARGED PARTICLES OF ENERGY 0.5 TO 500 MEV
           ,RAPPORT CEA-R 3042 1966).
           THE USUAL GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY WAS APPLIED TO MEASURE THE
           RADIOACTIVITY.
           NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM NUCL. DATA SHEETS, B5,NO5
           1971 AND ERDTMANN-SOYKA JUL-1003-AC,1973
ERR-ANALYS EN-ERR. THE ENERGY STRAGGLING AND THE UNCERTAINTY DUE
           TO THE THICKNESS OF THE FOILS WERE INCLUDED IN THE
           ERROR OF THE NERGY SCALE. THE NONUNIFORMITY OF THE
           FOILS WERE NEGLECTED.
           TOTAL-ERR: THE OVER-ALL ERROR ERROR WAS ESTIMATED ON
           THE BASIS OF THE FOLLOWING POSSIBLE ERRORS:
            -COUNTING STATISTICS
            -PEAK AREA ANALYSIS
            -DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
            -FOIL THICKNESS
            -ERROR OF THE NUCLEAR DATA AND TIMING
           THE UNCERTAINTY IN CROSS SECTION VARIED FROM 5% TO
           40%
STATUS     DATA WERE TAKEN FROM TABLE 2 AND 3. OF RADIOCHIMICA
           ACTA  VOL. 24., PP. 57, 1977.
