SAMPLE     targets were Al, V, Nb and Au foils. The impurities
           of the foils were given in B.Scholten et al. RCA,62,
           107,93, the light element (Li, Be, B, C, n, O)
           inpurities were also given. Cu and Al foils serve as
           monitor and enery degrader foils. Thick foils (50-
           500 micron) were place between two thin (10-25 micron)
           catcher foils of the same material.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,CHSEP)a thick stack was irradiated
           with 99 MeV protons for about 4 hours at beam current
           of 100 Na in Uppsala. Several thin stacks were irradia-
           ted in Juelich for about 12 hours with 45 MeV protons
           at a beam current of 0.5 To 2.0 Microamps.
           the energy of the primary beam in Uppsala was
           determined via measurements of ratio of activities
           from known high threshold reactions. Al-27(p,x)Na-22
           to Al-27(p,x)Na-24 and Al-27(p,x)Na-22 to
           Cu-nat(p,x)Zn-65.
           the beam energy along the stacks was calculated
           according to the range-energy formula of C.F.
           Williamson et al. (Report CEA-R-3042, 1966) and was
           checked by flux constancy (+- 3%) the beam intensity
           was determined by Faraday cup and by using monitor
           reactions (+-12% agreement) the Al-27(p,Be-7) process
           was studied without chemical sep. Chemical sep. was
           applied in the case of V, Nb and Au foils. The
           radiochemical yield were about 85 - 97 % for the Be-7.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR). The tot error (15 - 90%) in the cross
           section was obtained by combining all the
           individual errors in quadrature. Beam intensity:
           12%, peak area: 5-10% and up to 90% in weak samples,
           detector efficiency: 7%, chemical yield 4%.
           the presented errors are do not contain the
           uncertainties arrising from the contribution of
           the reactions on Li-7, Be-9, B-10, B-11, C-12, n-14,
           and O-16.
           authors conclusion: the contribution of impurities
           to the formation of Be-7 in the case of Al and Nb is
           within the limit of experimental error, and about
           50% for V target foils. In the case of Au samples
           the cross section are accurate within a factor of 2.
