SAMPLE     Targets were high purity metal foils
                    Al 92.6 microns
                    Ti 12.1 microns
                    Fe 14.3 microns
                    Ni 15.5 microns
                    Cu 47.5 microns
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB) Stacks contaning combinations of the
            foils were irradiated in Faraday cup for 1 to 2 hours
            with 32 to 65 nA deuteron beam. The Faraday cup
            was equipped with long collimator and electron
            supressor. The primary bombarding energy were 30 and
            50 MeV. The results obtained for the reactions on the
            Al foils also serve as internal monitors confirming
            the beam current measurements. The six studied
            reactions hence form a consistent database for
            monitoring. That was comfirmed by critical evaluation
            Of the available literature data.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Uncertainty of the incident deuteron energy
            was estimated taking into account the cumulative
            Effects of the Primary Uncertainty Sources
            incident energy, foil thickness, beam straggling.
            The possible energy shift of a representing point in
            the excitation function ranges from +-0.3 upto
            +-1.5 MeV.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainties of the cross section
            values were calculated as root-mean-square of all
            uncertainties added in quadrature.
