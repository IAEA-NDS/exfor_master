TITLE      EXcitation function and yields for 11In production
           using 113-114-nat-Cd(p,xn)111In reactions with 65 MeV
           protons
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4UKRIJD)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP)
           Stacks containing 23 - 25 foils of natural cadmium and
           enriched 113Cd and 114Cd were irradiated with proton
           beams of 65 MeV primary energy. The energy degradation
           was calculated by using the range-energy tables of
           C.F. Williamson et al.,report CEA-R3042 CEN, Saclay,
           1966. The irradiation time was 0.5 hours. Al foils were
           used to monitor the beam current which was a few
           hundred na. Activity measurement of each foils was
           started after 50 hours cooling time and the decay was
           followed for 500 hours by gamma-spectrometry.
           Chemical separation was also applied with a yield of
           90%.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) the overall uncertainty in the cross section
           data was 20%. The main error sources were:
             * the counting statistics,
             * detector efficiency,
             * target foil thickness,
             * decay data,
             * counting geometry,
             * irradiations time,
             * proton-beam energy losses,
             * error associated with the Al monitor foil excitatio
               function.
