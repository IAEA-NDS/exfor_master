SAMPLE     High purity W foils, 10 and 25 micron thick
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Stacks containing several W foils as targets and Al
           and Zn foils as energy degrader were irradiated by
           18, 32 and 42 MeV proton beams.

STATUS     (SPSDD,D4163003) A serious mistake was noticed by the
           authors when the measurements were reanalyzed for final
           publication. Therefore this subentry was superseded.
