STATUS     (TABLE)APROVED BY THE AUTHOR
SAMPLE     THIN SAMPLES OF ENRICHED MO-94 PREPARED BY
           SEDIMENTATION. THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION: MO-92
            (0.87%),MO-94 (93.9%), MO-95 (2.85%), MO-96 (1.04%),
           MO-97 (0.40%), MO-98 (0.75%), MO-100 (0.22%) CHEMICAL
           PURITY > 99.1%
           3 TO 6 MG/CM**2 MO METAL AND 5 TO 10 MG/CM**2 MOO3
           LAYER WERE SEDIMENTED ON 25 MICRONS OF CU BACKINGS
           THEN COVERED BY 10 MICRONS OF AL FOIL. FOR YIELD
           MEASUREMENT 33-162 MG/CM**2 THICK MO-94 TARGETS WERE
           USED.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB)THE PRIMARY INCIDENT PROTON ENERGY
           WAS 19.2 MEV DETERMINED FROM THE RATIO OF MONITOR
           REACTIONS  OF CU-63(P,2N)ZN-62 AND CU-63(P,N)ZN-63
           INDUCED ON THE FIRST MONITOR FOIL ACCORDING TO H.PIEL
           ET AL., RADIOCHIM ACTA,57,1,1992. SEVERAL STACKS
           CONTAINING 6-8 SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED FOR 15 MIN AT
           100 NAMP BEAM CURRENT, BELLOW 8 MEV EXTRA IRRADIATION
           WAS MADE ON 3 SAMPLES FOR 60 MIN AT 200 NAMP. FOR
           MEASURING THE THICK TARGET YIELD AND ISOTOPIC
           IMPURITIES 1 HR IRRADIATON WITH 45 - 200 NAMP WERE
           MADE.
DETECTOR   (GELI).GAMMA SPECTRAS OF SAMPLESR WERE MEASURED AT
           SOURCE-DETECTOR DISTANCE >10 CM, DEAD TIME WAS LESS
           THEN 7%.
