SAMPLE     thin samples of enriched Mo-94 prepared by
           sedimentation. The isotopic composition: Mo-92
            (0.87%),Mo-94 (93.9%), Mo-95 (2.85%), Mo-96 (1.04%),
           Mo-97 (0.40%), Mo-98 (0.75%), Mo-100 (0.22%) Chemical
           purity > 99.1%
           3 to 6 mg/cm**2 Mo metal and 5 to 10 mg/cm**2 MoO3
           layer were sedimented on 25 microns of Cu backings
           then covered by 10 microns of Al foil. For yield
           measurement 33-162 mg/cm**2 thick Mo-94 targets were
           used.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB)the primary incident proton energy
           was 19.2 Mev determined from the ratio of monitor
           reactions  of Cu-63(p,2n)Zn-62 and Cu-63(p,n)Zn-63
           induced on the first monitor foil according to H.Piel
           et Al., Radiochim acta,57,1,1992. Several stacks
           containing 6-8 samples were irradiated for 15 min at
           100 namp beam current, bellow 8 MeV extra irradiation
           was made on 3 samples for 60 min at 200 namp. For
           measuring the thick target yield and isotopic
           impurities 1 hr irradiaton with 45 - 200 namp were
           made.
DETECTOR   (GELI).Gamma spectras of samplesr were measured at
           source-detector distance >10 cm, dead time was less
           then 7%.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C)determination of optimum energy range for
           production of Tc-94m.
           thick target yield of Tc-94m calculated from the
           measured excitation function. Experimental
           determination of radiotechnetium impurities.
