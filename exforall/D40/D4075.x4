INSTITUTE  (3HUNDEB,3HUNKOS)
STATUS     (TABLE) data were taken from table 1 of Appl. Radiat.

SAMPLE     the target used were natural argon gas of 1 bar
           pressure in stainless steel cells with 10 micron
           Ti windows.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) single and stacked cells were
           irradiated with extracted alpha beam at 500 Na beam
           current. The bombarding charge was integrated by a
           Faraday-cup and was also monitored via monitor
           reactions on copper. The single cell irradiations
           were carried out at the debrecen mgc20 cyclotron,
           and the stacked cells were irradiated at the Julich
           CV28 compact cyclotron using 20.4 And 26.7 MeV primary
           beam energy respectively.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) normal high resolution gamma-spectrometry
           was applied. Nuclear data were taken from E. Browne
           and R.B.Firestone, Table of Radioactive Isotopes,
           edited by V.S shirley, Wiley, New York, 1986.
           the energy degradation was calculated using the
           tables of williamson et al.,Report, CEA-R-3042 and
           J.F. Ziegler Handbook of stopping cross sections for
           energetic ions in all elements, vol.5, Pergamon,Oxford,
           1980.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) the error of the energy includes the
           primary dispersion of the incident beam, the
           uncertainty by the straggling effect and the density
           reduction in the gas cells along the beam strike.
           the typical uncertainty of the energy is about 1. MeV
           near the threshold and 0.3 MeV around 20 MeV.
           (ERR-T) the overall error in the cross section
           determination includes the errors:
               flux measurements             8%
               statistical error           1-5%
               detector efficiency error     5%
               nuclear data uncertaintty     3%
               effective target thickness    5%
           total estimated error in the cross section values  was
           about 12%.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) calculated thick target yields.
