SAMPLE     ENRICHED NI-58 POWDER WITH ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION:
           NI-58    99.87 +-0.02%
           NI-60    0.103 %
           NI-61    0.004 %
           NI-62    0.007 %
           NI-64    0.016 %
           THIN SAMPLES WERE MADE BY USIN ELECTRODEPOSITION ON
           10 MICRON GOLD BACKING.
           SAMPLE TICKNESS: 3.36 MG/CM2
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP) SEVERAL STACKS WERE IRRADIATED
           EACH FOR 15 MIN WITH A BEAM CURRENT OF 100 NA.
           CU, TI AND AL FOILS WERE USED FOR BEAM MONITORING AND
           ENERGY DEGRADATION. THE BEAM CURRENT WAS ALSO MEASURED
           BY FARADAY-CUP. RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION WAS APPLIED
           BEFORE THE ACTIVITY MEASUREMENT OF THE CO-55, CO-56
           AND CO-57 ISOTOPES.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) NORMAL HIGH RESOLUTION GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY
           WAS APPLIED. COUNTING PERIODS BETWEEN TWO HOURS
           AND SEVEN DAYS WERE APPLIED.
           NUCLEAR DATA WERE TAKEN FROM LEDERER AND SHIRLEY,TABLE
           OF ISOTOPES 7TH ED. WILEY, NEW YORK, 1978.
