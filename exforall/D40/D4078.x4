SAMPLE     enriched Ni-58 powder with isotopic composition:
           Ni-58    99.87 +-0.02%
           Ni-60    0.103 %
           Ni-61    0.004 %
           Ni-62    0.007 %
           Ni-64    0.016 %
           thin samples were made by usin electrodeposition on
           10 micron gold backing.
           sample tickness: 3.36 mg/cm2
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP) several stacks were irradiated
           each for 15 min with a beam current of 100 Na.
           Cu, Ti and Al foils were used for beam monitoring and
           energy degradation. The beam current was also measured
           by Faraday-cup. Radiochemical separation was applied
           before the activity measurement of the Co-55, Co-56
           and Co-57 isotopes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) normal high resolution gamma-spectrometry
           was applied. Counting periods between two hours
           and seven days were applied.
           nuclear data were taken from lederer and shirley,table
           of isotopes 7Th ed. Wiley, New York, 1978.
