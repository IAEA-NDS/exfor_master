SAMPLE     enriched Ni-61 electroplated on gold foils(0.04 g/cm2)
           layer thickness from 0.0004 To 0.0012 g/cm2. Isotopic
           composition: Ni-58 3.45%
                        Ni-60 6.12%
                        Ni-61 88.84%
                        Ni-62 1.4%
                        Ni-64 0.2%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA) Al and Cu foils were used as energy
           degrader and monitor foils. Beam current measured by
           faraday cup and via monitor reactions on nat-Cu.
           primary proton energies: 18.7 MeV and 14.9 MeV
           energy degradation calculated according to C.F.Wil-
           liamson et Al., Report cea-12-3042,1966.
           to study Co-58-m four stacks were irradiated for
           1 to 5 hours with 150 - 200 Na.
           to study Co-58-m+g a stack (13 Ni-61 samples,
           Cu monitor and Al degrader foils) were irradiated
           for 5 H with 200 Na.
           gamma-rays of Co-58 ground state and the monitor
           reactions were measured by HPGe detector, while the
           metastable state of Co-58 was measured by Si(Li) X-ray
           detector.
           decay data of the product nuclei were taken from
           E. Browne, Table of radioactive isotopes, ed. V.S
           Shirley, Willey, London, 1986.

DETECTOR   (HPGE,SILI)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR). The total error in the cross section was
           determined by combining all the individual errors in
           quadrature. Counting statistics: 1 - 5%
                       decay data: 3%
                       detector efficiency: 5% (Co-58-g)
                                            8% (Co-58-m)
                       number of target nuclei: 8%
                       beam intensity 8%
           the total error in the cross sections:
                       Co-58-m      15%
                       Co-58-m+g    13%
