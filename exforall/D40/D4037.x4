SAMPLE     ENRICHED NI-61 ELECTROPLATED ON GOLD FOILS(0.04 G/CM2)
           LAYER THICKNESS FROM 0.0004 TO 0.0012 G/CM2. ISOTOPIC
           COMPOSITION: NI-58 3.45%
                        NI-60 6.12%
                        NI-61 88.84%
                        NI-62 1.4%
                        NI-64 0.2%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA) AL AND CU FOILS WERE USED AS ENERGY
           DEGRADER AND MONITOR FOILS. BEAM CURRENT MEASURED BY
           FARADAY CUP AND VIA MONITOR REACTIONS ON NAT-CU.
           PRIMARY PROTON ENERGIES: 18.7 MEV AND 14.9 MEV
           ENERGY DEGRADATION CALCULATED ACCORDING TO C.F.WIL-
           LIAMSON ET AL., REPORT CEA-12-3042,1966.
           TO STUDY CO-58-M FOUR STACKS WERE IRRADIATED FOR
           1 TO 5 HOURS WITH 150 - 200 NA.
           TO STUDY CO-58-M+G A STACK (13 NI-61 SAMPLES,
           CU MONITOR AND AL DEGRADER FOILS) WERE IRRADIATED
           FOR 5 H WITH 200 NA.
           GAMMA-RAYS OF CO-58 GROUND STATE AND THE MONITOR
           REACTIONS WERE MEASURED BY HPGE DETECTOR, WHILE THE
           METASTABLE STATE OF CO-58 WAS MEASURED BY SI(LI) X-RAY
           DETECTOR.
           DECAY DATA OF THE PRODUCT NUCLEI WERE TAKEN FROM
           E. BROWNE, TABLE OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES, ED. V.S
           SHIRLEY, WILLEY, LONDON, 1986.
