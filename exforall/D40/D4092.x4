SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 66Zn(99%), 67Zn(91.5%) and
           68Zn(98%) targets.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Targets were prepared on Ni foils by electrolytic
           deposition. Thickness were measured by weight.
           Stacks containing several enriched-Zn target foils and
           Ti and Cu monitor foils and Al foils as energy degrader
           were irradiated with 26 MeV, 200-600nA proton beams.
           The beam energy was determined by using monitor foils
           with +-0.3 MeV accuracy. Energy degradation was
           calculated using table of Williamson et al. Rapport
           Cea-R-3042, Saclay, France.
           Cross sections were corrected for 100% enrichment.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy uncertainty of the incident proton beam
           after 10MeV energy degradation was estimated to be
           about 0.6 MeV.
           (ERR-T) The estimated uncertainties on cross
           sections were calculated by summing up quadratically
           the possible individual relative errors:
                    Counting statistics       1-5%
                    Detector efficiency       5%
