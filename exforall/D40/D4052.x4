METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Excitation function was measured by
            changing the primary bombarding energy step by step
            using the same target.
CORRECTION Where it was necessary correction was made for the
            residual activity.
           Pile-up correction also was made.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) Four NaI(Tl) scintillation
            detectors were used for counting the 511 keV gamma
            photons in coincidence.
           Detector system was calibrated with Ga-68 standard
            source.

           The error of the thickness was about 20%.
