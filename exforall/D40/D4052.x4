SAMPLE     enriched material evaporated onto gold-clad copper disc
           with thickness of 500 microg/cm2. The error of the
           thickness was about 20%. Thickness of the target was
           checked by elastic scattering.

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) excitation function was measured by
           changing the primary bombarding energy step by step
           using the same target.
CORRECTION Where it was necessary correction was made for the
           residual activity.
           Pile-up correction also was made.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) Four NaI(Tl) scintillation
           detectors were used for counting the 511. keV gamma
           photons in coincidence.  Detector system was
           calibrated with Ga-68 standard  source.
