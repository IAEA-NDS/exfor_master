TITLE      The measurement of partial capture cross-sections for
           neutron energies above 10 keV.
FACILITY   (VDG) 3 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator in Lucas heights.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction.
           Pulsed neutron source.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight, path = 0.63, 1.00 and 1.50 m.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 20 cm * 15 cm NaI crystal with 4 RCA 8054
           photomultipliers.
PART-DET   (G) Gammas.
COMMENT     Compiler's note:   Numerical values of relative
            partial capture cross-sections are requested from the
            author, 77/01/25.
            Author's reply:  The partial capture cross-sectios
            by Broomhall do not exist in numerical form. 77/05/31.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by Allen, 77/05/31.

           gamma energy were recorded, and the resonance energies
           were obtained.
