TITLE      Cross-sections for fast neutron induced reactions on
           Rb-85, Os-190 and Os-192 nuclei.
EXP-YEAR   (1974)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)alpha reaction
SAMPLE     Natural high purity samples
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method. The reaction final products
           were identified by their characteristic gamma-ray
           transitions.
DETECTOR   (GELI)30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector whose efficiency in the
           50 keV to 2 MeV energy range was determined using the
           known intensity relations of gamma-rays from Ra-226,
           Ba-133 and Yb-169 sources
PART-DET   (DG) Decay gammas. Decay data were taken from the Table
           of Isotopes (Sixth Edition-1967).
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by Marcinkowski,1/12/1975.
           (TABLE) Data taken mainly from Table 1 in INDC(SEC)-42,
           205, and from priv.comm. by Marcinkowski, 1/12/1975.

ANALYSIS   These cross-sections were obtained with the assumption
           that the Os-190(n,n') reaction cross-section is
           constant in the neutron energy range 16.6 - 18.8 MeV
           and equals to the value 10.0 mb measured at energies
           lower than 16.6 MeV.

            The (n,3n) reaction cross-sections
           were obtained assuming a constant value of the (n,n')
           reaction cross-section on Os-190 in the neutron energy
           range 16.6-17.8 MeV.
