TITLE      Experimental investigation of the neutron-gamma
           competition in 14.7MeV fast neutrons reactions.
FACILITY   (CCW) 200 keV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)He-4 reaction.

           method.
SAMPLE     Mn and Bi(2)-O(3) powders in thin walled plastic
           containers. The length of the target was chosen to be
           about one half of the mean free path of 14.7MeV neutron

DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE 102/A plastic scintillation detector, 5 cm
           diam. and 10 cm height, on an XP 1020 photomultiplier .
           .For detection of alpha from H-3(d,n)He-4, a thin
           NE 102/A foil with a similar type of a photomultiplier.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
            Water target. The standard values were
           not mentioned.
PART-DET   (N) Neutrons.

REACTION   (25-MN-56(0,0),,TEM)
              for evaporation of 1st neutrons.
ANALYSIS   In Mn-55(n,2n)Mn-54 reactions, the neutron spectra of
           1st and 2nd neutron-emissions were assumed to be fitted
           with the constant-temperature type formula,
           A*E*(exp(-E/T)) after correction for the detector
           efficiency. E, T and A are kinetic energy of the
           neutron, nuclear temperature and normalization constant
           respectively.
MISC-COL   (MISC)   Nuclear temperature for evaporation of 2nd
           neutrons.
COMMENT    The ratio of the number from the first to the second
           neutrons in the Mn-55(n,2n) process is,
                 3.6 +- 1.5.
           and this indicates a strong neutron-gamma competition
           than expectation on the usual statistical assumption.

             for evaporation of 1st neutrons.
ANALYSIS   In Bi-209(n,2n)Bi-208 reactions, the neutron spectra of
           1st and 2nd neutron-emissions were assumed to be fitted
           with the constant-temperature type formula,

           after correcting for the detector efficiency.  E, T and
           A are kinetic energy of the neutron,nuclear temperature
           and normalization constant, respectively.
MISC-COL   (MISC)   Nuclear temperature for the evaporation of
           2nd neutrons.
COMMENT    The ratio of the number from the first to the second
           neutron in the Bi-209(n,2n) process is,
                 1.06 +- 0.15.
           and this indicates that the role of the gamma
           de-excitation proved to be negligible.
