TITLE      EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE NEUTRON-GAMMA
           COMPETITION IN 14.7MEV FAST NEUTRONS REACTIONS.
FACILITY   (CCW) 200 KEV COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION.
           INCOMING NEUTRONS WERE DETERMINED BY RECOIL ALPHA
           METHOD.
SAMPLE     MN AND BI(2)-O(3) POWDERS IN THIN WALLED PLASTIC
           CONTAINERS. THE LENGTH OF THE TARGET WAS CHOSEN TO BE
           ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE MEAN FREE PATH OF 14.7MEV NEUTRON
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT FOR EMITTED NEUTRON.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE 102/A PLASTIC SCINTILLATION DETECTOR, 5 CM
           DIAM. AND 10 CM HEIGHT, ON AN XP 1020 PHOTOMULTIPLIER .
           .FOR DETECTION OF ALPHA FROM H-3(D,N)HE-4, A THIN
           NE 102/A FOIL WITH A SIMILAR TYPE OF A PHOTOMULTIPLIER.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
            WATER TARGET. THE STANDARD VALUES WERE
           NOT MENTIONED.
PART-DET   (N) NEUTRONS.

              FOR EVAPORATION OF 1ST NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS   IN MN-55(N,2N)MN-54 REACTIONS, THE NEUTRON SPECTRA OF
           1ST AND 2ND NEUTRON-EMISSIONS WERE ASSUMED TO BE FITTED
           WITH THE CONSTANT-TEMPERATURE TYPE FORMULA,
           A*E*(EXP(-E/T)) AFTER CORRECTION FOR THE DETECTOR
           EFFICIENCY. E, T AND A ARE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE
           NEUTRON, NUCLEAR TEMPERATURE AND NORMALIZATION CONSTANT
           RESPECTIVELY.

           NEUTRONS.

COMMENT    THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND
           NEUTRONS IN THE MN-55(N,2N) PROCESS IS,
                 3.6 +- 1.5.
           AND THIS INDICATES A STRONG NEUTRON-GAMMA COMPETITION
           THAN EXPECTATION ON THE USUAL STATISTICAL ASSUMPTION.
