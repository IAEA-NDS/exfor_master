SAMPLE     Purified 99.995% electrolytic Cr-flakes were
           consolidated in an argon arc furnace. The sample (size
           = 37x25x10 mm),sealed in a quartz capsule, was annealed
           for 48 hours at 1050 degc and quenched into iced water.
METHOD     (DIFFR). Spin-flip and non-spin-flip neutron intensi-
           ties were measured at 6 scattering angles ranging from
           15 to 65 degrees.
MONITOR    Neutron intensities were calibrated by comparison with
           a vanadium standard.
COMMENT    Compiler's note: The incoming neutron energy given
           below was calculated from the neutron wave length =
           3.6 +- 0.3 Angstrom, given by the authors.

ANALYSIS   The spin-flip and non-spin-flip cross-sections were
           summed to give the total cross-section.
           A slight decrease of the non-spin-flip (and hence the
           total) cross-section with scattering vector was ob-
           served, which was however neglected for the present
           consideration of the isotropic contribution.
           The measured cross-sections (at high scattering
           vectors), after correction, were
                    spin-flip            20 millibarn/sr,atom
                    non-spin-flip       120 millibarn/sr,atom
STATUS     (CURVE)The values (spin-flip,non-spin-flip,total
           scattering cross-section) were read from Fig.1 of
           J.Phys.C,vol.11, page l899.
