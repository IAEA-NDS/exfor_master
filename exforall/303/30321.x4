SAMPLE     PURIFIED 99.995 PERCENT ELECTROLYTIC CR-FLAKES WERE
           CONSOLIDATED IN AN ARGON ARC FURNACE. THE SAMPLE (SIZE
           = 37X25X10 MM),SEALED IN A QUARTZ CAPSULE, WAS ANNEALED
           FOR 48HOURS AT 1050 DEGC AND QUENCHED INTO ICED WATER.
METHOD     (DIFFR). SPIN-FLIP AND NON-SPIN-FLIP NEUTRON INTENSI-
           TIES WERE MEASURED AT 6 SCATTERING ANGLES RANGING FROM
           15 TO 65 DEGREES.
MONITOR    NEUTRON INTENSITIES WERE CALIBRATED BY COMPARISON WITH
           A VANADIUM STANDARD.
COMMENT    COMPILER'S NOTE  THE INCOMING NEUTRON ENERGY GIVEN
           BELOW WAS CALCULATED FROM THE NEUTRON WAVE LENGTH =
           3.6 +- 0.3 ANGSTROM, GIVEN BY THE AUTHORS.

ANALYSIS   THE SPIN-FLIP AND NON-SPIN-FLIP CROSS-SECTIONS WERE
           SUMMED TO GIVE THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION.
           A SLIGHT DECREASE OF THE NON-SPIN-FLIP (AND HENCE THE
           TOTAL) CROSS-SECTION WITH SCATTERING VECTOR WAS OB-
           SERVED, WHICH WAS HOWEVER NEGLECTED FOR THE PRESENT
           CONSIDERATION OF THE ISOTROPIC CONTRIBUTION.
           THE MEASURED CROSS-SECTIONS (AT HIGH SCATTERING
           VECTORS), AFTER CORRECTION, WERE
                    SPIN-FLIP            20 MILLIBARN/SR,ATOM
                    NON-SPIN-FLIP       120 MILLIBARN/SR,ATOM
STATUS     THE VALUES (SPIN-FLIP,NON-SPIN-FLIP,TOTAL SCATTERING
           CROSS-SECTION) WERE READ FROM FIG.1 OF J.PHYS.C,VOL.11,
