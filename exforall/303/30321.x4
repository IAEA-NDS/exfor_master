SAMPLE     Purified 99.995% electrolytic Cr-flakes were
            consolidated in an argon arc furnace.
           The sample (size = 37x25x10 mm), sealed in a quartz
            capsule, was annealed for 48 hours at 1050 deg-C and
            quenched into iced water.
METHOD     (FNB,DIFFR) Separation of spin-flip from nonspin-flip
            on transmission through iron filters.
           Spin-flip and non-spin-flip neutron intensities were
            measured at 6 scattering angles
            ranging from 15 to 65 degs.
MONITOR    Neutron intensities were calibrated by comparison with
            a vanadium standard.
CORRECTION - For air scattering, self attenuation, neutron back-
             ground
           - Multiple scattering corrections.
COMMENT    Compiler's note:
           The incoming neutron energy given below was calculated
            from the neutron wave length = 3.6 +- 0.3 Angstrom,
            given by the authors.

ANALYSIS   The spin-flip and non-spin-flip cross-sections were
           summed to give the total cross-section.
           A slight decrease of the non-spin-flip (and hence the
           total) cross-section with scattering vector was ob-
           served, which was however neglected for the present
           consideration of the isotropic contribution.
           The measured cross-sections (at high scattering
           vectors), after correction, were
                    spin-flip            20 millibarn/sr,atom
                    non-spin-flip       120 millibarn/sr,atom
STATUS     (CURVE)The values (spin-flip,non-spin-flip,total
           scattering cross-section) were read from Fig.1 of
           J.Phys.C,vol.11, page l899.
