TITLE      Cross-sections for fast neutron induced reactions on
           Cd-111 and Cd-112 isotopes.
EXP-YEAR   (1975)
FACILITY   (VDG) 3 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)alpha reaction
           (D-D) D(d,n)He-3 reaction
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method. The reaction final products
           were identified by their characteristic gamma-ray
           transitions.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector whose efficiency in the
           50 keV to 2 MeV energy was determined using the known
           intensity relations of gamma-rays in Ra-226, Yb-169 and
           Ba-133 sources.
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG)
            Numerical data taken from D.C.Santry and
           J.P.Butler, Can.J.Phys.42(1964)1030.

           J.Phys.Soc.Jap.,17(1962)1062.
PART-DET   (DG) Decay gammas. Decay data were taken from the Table
           of Isotopes (sixth edition-1967).
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by Marcinkowski, 1/12/1975.
