TITLE      EMISSION OF LIGHT NUCLEI IN THERMAL NEUTRON FISSION
           OF PU-239.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) EWA REACTOR.  THE ORIGINAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM IS
           RELATIVELY RICH IN FAST NEUTRON. FULL PILE SPECTRUM AND
           EPICADMIUM NEUTRON WERE USE FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE
           HYDROGEN ISOTOPES, FOR CORRECTION OF BACKGROUND DUE TO
            (N,P) PROCESS INDUCED BY FAST NEUTRONS.
           FOR HE ISOTOPES, ONLY FULL REACTOR NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS
           USED.
SAMPLE     ABOUT 6MG/CM2 THICK PU-239 TARGET DEPOSITED ON TANTALUM
           FOIL OF 13.25MG/CM2.
METHOD     COUNTER TELESCOPE WITH SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (TELES) SEMICONDUCTOR TELESCOPE. THE DELTA-E- AND E-
           DETECTORS ARE 50 MU AND 1500 MU THICK, RESPECTIVELY.
           FOR THE DETECTION OF HELIUM ISOTOPES, A THINNER DELTA-
           E-SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR (25 MU) WAS USED.
PART-DET   (FF) H-1,H-2,H-3,HE-4,HE-6 AND HE-8.
HISTORY    (760115C)  KO.

REACTION  1(94-PU-239(N,F),PRE,FY,,REL)
            RELATIVE TO 100 ALPHAS.

            PEAK KINETIC ENERGY.
ANALYSIS  1THE INTENSITIES RELATIVE TO THE EMISSION OF 100 ALPHAS
           WERE CALCULATED BY ASSUMING THAT THE LOW ENERGY
           SPECTRUM WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MEASURED, WAS SYMMETRICAL
           TO THE CORRESPONDING HIGH ENERGY PART.
          2A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION WAS FITTED TO THE ENERGY
           SPECTRA OF H-1,H-2,H-3,HE-4,HE-6 AND HE-8, BY THE LEAST
           SQUARE METHOD.
STATUS     FROM TABLE 1 OF NUCL.PHYS.A218(1969)219.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) TOTAL.  THE LIMIT OF THE OVERALL UNCERTAINTY
           ESTIMATED.
