COMMENT    IN THIS ENERGY REGION, THE S-32(N,A)SI-29 REACTION
           PROCEEDS MAINLY THROUGH THE GROUND STATE LEVEL. THIS IS
           CONFIRMED WITH THE UPPER LIMIT FOR THE VALUE OF THE
           TOTAL CROSS SECTION WITH 14 MEV NEUTRONS FOR THE
           S-32(N,A)SI-29G REACTION,(SEE SUB-ENTRY .004).

REACTION   (16-S-32(N,A)14-SI-29,PAR,SIG)
           ESTIMATED UPPER LIMIT VALUE.
ANALYSIS   THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL SET UP WAS USED TO MEASURE THE
           ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF S-32(N,A)SI-29,USING '14 MEV'
           NEUTRON.  NO ALPHA PARTICLE WAS DETECTED EVEN WITH A
           THICKER TARGET AND WITH SHORTER DISTANCE BETWEEN
           DETECTOR AND TARGET (DECREASED UP TO 5 MM).
           AN UPPER LIMIT FOR THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION
           FOR S-32(N,A)SI-29G WAS ESTIMATED.
COMMENT    THE RESULT AGREES WITH THE RESULT OBTAINED BY KUMABE,
           J,PHYS.SOC.JAPAN,13(1958)325, AS S-32(N,A)SI-29. IF
           ONE ASSUMED THAT THE HIGH ENERGY ALPHA
           PARTICLES APPEARING IN HIS ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
           CURVE ARE FROM THE S-32(N,A)SI-29-G REACTION.
