TITLE      PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF THE AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY OF
           FRAGMENTS IN THE FISSION  OF U-235 BY FAST NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (VDG,3AULAUA)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
SAMPLE     15 MICRO-G/CM2 OF 93 PERCENT ENRICHED U-235 ELECTRO-
           DEPOSITED ON GOLD(17 MICRO-G/CM2) AND RESIN(10 MICRO-G/
           CM2) COATED VYNS PLASTIC FILM(45 MICRO-G/CM2)
METHOD     (COINC) FAST COINCIDENCE BETWEEN TWO FISSION
                   FRAGMENT DETECTORS. EACH RUN USING FAST
                   NEUTRONS WAS PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY A
                   RUN USING NEUTRONS THERMALISED BY PASSAGE
                   THROUGH 7 CM OF POLYETHYLENE.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) TWO SOLID-STATE SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS
ANALYSIS   -LIGHT AND HEAVY FRAGMENT DISTRIBUTION FOR THE THERMAL
            RUNS PRECEDING AND FOLLOWING EACH FAST RUN WERE FITTED
            WITH GAUSSIAN CURVES. AVERAGE CHANNEL WIDTH IN ENERGY
            UNITS WAS DETERMINED FROM THE KNOWN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
           THE LIGHT AND HEAVY FRAGMENT AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGIES
           IN THERMAL FISSION OF U-235.
           -THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE OF THE FAST PULSE
            HEIGHT SUM DISTRIBUTION AND THE AVERAGE OF THE
            PRECEDING AND FOLLOWING THERMAL SUM DISTRIBUTIONS WAS
            CONVERTED TO ENERGY UNITS USING THE ABOVE CALIBRATION.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,AKE,FF)
           DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY OF
           FISSION FRAGMENTS FROM FAST-NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION
           AND THE SAME AVERAGE FROM THERMAL-NEUTRON FISSION.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) UNCORRECTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF ALL FAST
                   RUNS AT THE SAME INCIDENT NEUTRON ENERGY
           (MISC2) CORRECTION FOR ENERGY-LOSS  IN TARGET AND IN
                   GOLD SURFACE OF THE DETECTOR. DEPENDENT ON
                   ANISOTROPY OF THE FRAGMENT ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
           (MISC3) CORRECTION  FOR DECREASE IN THE TOTAL KINETIC
                   ENERGY BECAUSE OF THE DECREASED MASS OF THE
                   FRAGMENTS DUE TO NEUTRON EMISSION.
COMMENT    AUTHOR COMMENT- NO SIGNIFICANT DEPENDENCE OF THE
           AVERAGE TOTAL FISSION FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY ON THE
           EXCITATION OF THE FISSIONING NUCLEUS AND NO INDICATION
           OF CHANNEL EFFECTS,WITHIN EXPERIMENTAL ERROR.
