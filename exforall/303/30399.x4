EXP-YEAR   (1977)
FACILITY   (CHOPS) Slow chopper, 11 cm in diameter with 2 mm
            slits operating at 5000 rpm with stability within
            0.5%.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) VVR-S reactor
SAMPLE     UF4, enriched 235U, evaporated target.
           U targets were prepared at Geel, Belgium.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight, path = 5.004 m to 235U target
            and = 5.472 m to boron target.
           The incident neutron flux was determined by detecting
            the 477.61keV gamma from 10B(n,a)7Li.
           The detection efficiency of fission fragments was
            determined using thin-thick 235U target in the 2
            ionization chambers.
           The U mass for the 235U foils was obtained from the
            alpha activity.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) 2 ionization chambers for thin(10 ug/cm2) and
            thick 235U targets.
           (GELI) 71 cm3 ORTEC Ge(Li) spectrometer to detect
            477.61 keV gamma line from 10B(n,a)7Li for neutron
            flux measurement.
           4pi beta-gamma counter for gamma detection efficiency.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement (independent of any other cross-
            section), but depending on branching ratio of 10B(n,a)
            and the gamma energies from 7Li* and from beta decay
            of 198Au and depending on decay constant of 235U.
