TITLE      The U-235 fission cross-section for 2200 m/sec neutrons
EXP-YEAR   (1977)
FACILITY   (CHOPS) Slow chopper, 11cm in diameter with 2mm slits
           operating at 5000 rpm with stability within 0.5%.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) VVR-S reactor.
SAMPLE     U-F(4), enriched U-235, evaporated target. U targets
           were prepared at Geel, Belgium.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight, path = 5.004 m to U-235 target
           and = 5.472 m to boron target.
           .The incident neutron flux was determined by detecting
           the 477.61keV gamma from B-10(n,a)Li-7.
           .The detection efficiency of fission fragments was
           determined using thin-thick U-235 target in the 2
           ionization chambers.
           .The U mass for the U-235 foils was obtained from the
           alpha activity.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) 2 ionization chambers for thin( 10 micro-g/cm2)
            and thick U-235 targets.
           (GELI) 71 cm3 ORTEC Ge(Li) spectrometer to detect
            477.61 keV gamma line from Li-7 (from B-10(n,a)) for
            neutron flux measurement.
           .4pi beta-gamma counter for detection efficiency(g).
MONITOR    Absolute measurement (independent of any other cross-
           section), but depending on branching ratio of B-10(n,a)
           and the gamma energies from Li-7* and from beta decay
           of Au-198 and depending on decay constant of U-235.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments.
