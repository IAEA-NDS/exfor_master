TITLE      THE U-235 FISSION CROSS-SECTION FOR 2200 M/SEC NEUTRONS
EXP-YEAR   (77)
FACILITY   (CHOPS) SLOW CHOPPER, 11CM IN DIAMETER WITH 2MM SLITS
           OPERATING AT 5000 RPM WITH STABILITY WITHIN 0.5PERC.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) VVR-S REACTOR.
SAMPLE     U-F(4), ENRICHED U-235, EVAPORATED TARGET. U TARGETS
           WERE PREPARED AT GEEL, BELGIUM.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT, PATH = 5.004 M TO U-235 TARGET
           AND = 5.472 M TO BORON TARGET.
           .THE INCIDENT NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED BY DETECTING
           THE 477.61KEV GAMMA FROM B-10(N,A)LI-7.
           .THE DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS WAS
           DETERMINED USING THIN-THICK U-235 TARGET IN THE 2
           IONIZATION CHAMBERS.
           .THE U MASS FOR THE U-235 FOILS WAS OBTAINED FROM THE
           ALPHA ACTIVITY.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) 2 IONIZATION CHAMBERS FOR THIN( 10 MICRO-G/CM2)
            AND THICK U-235 TARGETS.
           (GELI) 71 CM3 ORTEC GE(LI) SPECTROMETER TO DETECT
            477.61 KEV GAMMA LINE FROM LI-7 (FROM B-10(N,A)) FOR
            NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENT.
           .4PI BETA-GAMMA COUNTER FOR DETECTION EFFICIENCY(G).
MONITOR    ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT (INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER CROSS-
           SECTION), BUT DEPENDING ON BRANCHING RATIO OF B-10(N,A)
           AND THE GAMMA ENERGIES FROM LI-7* AND FROM BETA DECAY
           OF AU-198 AND DEPENDING ON DECAY CONSTANT OF U-235.
PART-DET   (FF) FISSION FRAGMENTS.
