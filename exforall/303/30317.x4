TITLE      LI AND BE NUCLEI EMITTED DURING THE THERMAL NEUTRON
           FISSION OF U-235.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) EWA REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  THERMAL SPECTRUM.NEUTRON FLUX WAS ABOUT 6*10E+8/CM2/SEC
           AND THE CADMIUM RATIO WAS 34.
SAMPLE     2 MG/CM2 U(3)-O(8), ENRICHED IN U-235 TO 95 PERCENT,
           WITH A 25 MM DIAM. WAS DEPOSITED ONTO A 18 MG/CM2
           PLATINUM BACKING.
METHOD     MEASUREMENT WITH A TWO-COUNTER TELESCOPE.
DETECTOR   (TELES) TWO-COUNTER TELESCOPE WITH A PROPORTIONAL
           COUNTER AS THE DELTA-E DETECTOR (FILLED WITH KR+5PERC.
           CO2 TO A PRESSURE OF 90 MM HG).  TO AVOID DELTA-E
           DETECTOR FROM OVERLOADING BY FF AND THE NATURAL ALPHA
           RADIOACTIVITY OF THE TARGET, A 13 MG/CM2 TANTALUM
           WINDOW WAS USED.
            AS E-DETECTOR, A SURFACE-BARRIER SILICON DETECTOR WITH
           A DEPLETION LAYER OF 300 MICRON WAS PLACED INSIDE PRO-
           PORTIONAL COUNTER.
PART-DET   (FF) HE,LI, OR BE AS TERNARY PARTICLE OF FISSION.
HISTORY    (760106C) KO.

           LI AND BE INTENSITIES RELATIVE TO 100 ALPHA EMISSIONS.
ANALYSIS   THE LI- AND BE-INTENSITIES RELATIVE TO THE EMISSION OF
           100 ALPHA PARTICLES WERE CALCULATED WITH
             THE EXTRAPOLATED SPECTRUM OF ALPHA PARTICLES,
             THE MEASURED PARTS OF THE LI AND BE SPECTRA
                               (''EXPERIMENTAL  YIELDS''), AND
             THE EXTRAPOLATED SPECTRA OF THESE NUCLEI
                               (''EXTRAPOLATED YIELDS'').
           THE EXTRAPOLATION WAS PERFORMED ASSUMING A SYMMETRICAL
           SHAPE OF THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS OF ALL PARTICLES.
