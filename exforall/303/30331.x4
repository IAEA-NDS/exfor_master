TITLE      Cross-sections for the n+d breakup reaction
FACILITY   (VDG,3SAFSCT) 5.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of
           Southern Universities Nuclear Institute,Faure,CP,
                                                    South Africa.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)  H2(d,n) and
           (D-T)  H3(d,n) reactions.
SAMPLE     Same as detector, deuterated liquid scintillators.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight,and
           integrating the energy distribution of breakup proton
           and recoil deuterons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Deuterated liquid scintillators, NE 230,
           encapsulated in cylindrical glass cells.  The cells
           were all of diameter 27 mm and their lengths were 12,25
           and 37 mm respectively.  Pulse shape discrimination was
           used to distinguish recoil deuteron and breakup proton.
ANALYSIS   Two methods were used to determine the breakup cross-
           section from the ratio of integrals of proton and
           deuteron spectra (R). One is to use the elastic data
           and other one to use the total neutron cross-section.
           The data obtained by two methods are in good agreement
           and the mean values are given.

CORRECTION The integrals to calculate the ratio R were corrected
           for multiple neutron scattering in the scintillator,
           and for the effects of proton and deuteron escape.
           The proton integral was also corrected for such as
           C-12(n,p)B-12 rection and n-p scattering on small
            (1.39%) hydrogen impurity in the scintillator.
