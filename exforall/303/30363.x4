TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE NI-58(N,P)CO-58 CROSS SECTION WITH
           H(N,N)P AS A STANDARD.
EXP-YEAR   (76)
FACILITY   (VDG) 7 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) LI-7(P,N)BE-7 REACTION, USING METALLIC LITHIUM
           TARGET OF 500 MICR-GRAM/CM2 ON TANTALUM BACKING.
SAMPLE     NATURAL NICKEL METAL WITH PURITY OF 99.99 PER-CENT.
           2.54 CM IN DIAMETER.  THICKNESSES OF NICKEL VARY
           BETWEEN 0.4839 AND 0.4925 CM FOR VARIOUS ENERGIES OF
           BOMBARDING NEUTRONS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  THE POST IRRADIATION GAMMAS AFTER DECAY OF
           CO-58 WERE MEASURED.
           .INCIDENT NEUTRON FLUXES WERE MEASURED WITH A PROTON
           RECOIL TELESCOPE.
DETECTOR   (GELI) ABOUT 40 CM3 LABORATORY FABRICATED GE(LI)
           DETECTOR.  CALIBRATION WAS CARRIED OUT WITH GAMMA-GAMMA
           COINCIDENCE METHOD USING THE GE(LI) TO DETECT 0.51 MEV
           GAMMAS AND A NAI(TL) TO DETECT THE 0.81 MEV GAMMA(CO58)
           .FOR THE DETERMINATION OF ABSOLUTE NEUTRON FLUX, THE
            PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE, WHICH WAS SIMILAR AS THE ONE
           BY KAEPPELAR+FROEHNER,IAEA PROC.CONF.ON NUCL.DATA FOR
           REACTOR VOL.I, 221, HELSINKI,(1970), WAS DESIGNED.
           A 500 MICRON N-TYPE SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR
           WAS USED TO DETECT THE SCATTERED PROTONS FROM THE
           RADIATOR.
           .FOR NEUTRON MONITORING, A LONG COUNTER AND A SHIELDED
           NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH (N,GAMMA)
           DISCRIMINATION WERE USED.

            C(18)-H(36)-O(2) ONTO A 0.2 MM STAINLESS-STEEL PLATE.
           AND THE THICKNESSES OF RADIATORS WERE 2760 MICR-G/CM2
           AND 4512 MICR-G/CM2.
