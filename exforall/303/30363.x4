TITLE      Measurement of the Ni-58(n,p)Co-58 cross section with
           H(n,n)p as a standard.
EXP-YEAR   (1976)
FACILITY   (VDG) 7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction, using metallic lithium
           target of 500 micr-gram/cm2 on tantalum backing.
SAMPLE     Natural nickel metal with purity of 99.99%.
           2.54 cm in diameter.  Thicknesses of nickel vary
           between 0.4839 and 0.4925 cm for various energies of
           bombarding neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  The post irradiation gammas after decay of
           Co-58 were measured.
           .Incident neutron fluxes were measured with a proton
           recoil telescope.
DETECTOR   (GELI) About 40 cm3 laboratory fabricated Ge(Li)
           detector.  Calibration was carried out with gamma-gamma
           coincidence method using the Ge(Li) to detect 0.51 MeV
           gammas and a NaI(Tl) to detect the 0.81 MeV gamma(Co58)
           .For the determination of absolute neutron flux, the
            proton recoil telescope, which was similar as the one
           by Kaeppelar+Froehner,IAEA Proc.Conf.on Nucl.Data for
           Reactor,vol.I, 221, Helsinki,(1970), was designed.
           (SIBAR) A 500 micron n-type silicon surface barrier
           detector was used to detect the scattered protons
           from the radiator.
           (SCIN) .For neutron monitoring, a long counter and a
           shielded NE213 liquid scintillation detector with
            (n,gamma) discrimination were used.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            from Gammel's semi-empirical formula,''Fast
           Neutron Physics'',Interscience publ.,Inc.,New York,1963
           part II,chapt.V.T.
           2 radiators prepared by evaporating stearic acid
            C(18)-H(36)-O(2) onto a 0.2 mm stainless-steel plate.
           And the thicknesses of radiators were 2760 micr-g/cm2
           and 4512 micr-g/cm2.

CORRECTION The fraction of activations by one single elastic
           neutron scattering was corrected by a Monte-Carlo
           program.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors (3 to 5%) are given.
           The major sources of errors on cross section
           determination are, (error in %):
