TITLE      -Gamma-ray spectra and (n,gamma) cross-sections at
           14 MeV for Sc, Y, Pr and Ho.-
EXP-YEAR   (1975) Measurements from 1974 to 1976.
FACILITY   (CCW) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator, energy of incident
           deuteron is 100 keV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)He-4 reaction.
INC-SPECT  The ''energy-spread'' is 1.35 MeV,that is +- 0.675 MeV.
           neutron flux is ~10**8 (1+-0.1) n/sec
SAMPLE     Mono isotopic composition, targets are spheres
            (hemispheres) with diameter 5 to 6 cm placed close to
           the tritium target. Therefore the neutron energy is
           spread over a range from 13.5 to 14.7 MeV. Due to
           this geometry the spectra obtained are integrated
           over a solid angle of 2pi (or 4Pi for hemi- spheres).
METHOD     Gamma spectra were measured with the telescopic
           scintillation pair spectrometer.
           Recoil proton spectrometer was used for neutron
           monitoring.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR) Scintillation pair spectrometer which
           resolution has been measured to be 12.5, 9.5 and 8.0
           per cent for gammas of energies 12.1,16.5 and 20.4 MeV,
           respectively.
           Efficiencies for these gamma energies have been
           measured to be 0.45,0.55 and 0.56 percent,respectively.
           (CSICR) Recoil proton spectrometer using a CsI(Tl)
           crystal for neutron-flux monitoring.  The accuracy of
           the determination of the neutron flux was +- 6%.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            For neutron-flux determination.
CORRECTION Spectra were corrected for
           .background,
           .the spectrometer response function,
           .the gammas created and absorbed in the sample,
           .absorption of gammas in the paraffin-collimator, and
           .neutron nonelastic process in the target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall error includes the uncertainties:
            . due to statistical errors,
            . on the background correction,
           (ERR-1,1.,7.)    7% for spheres,    1% for hemisphers,
            . due to spectrometer response function which
                  enlarges statistical error by a factor of 1.8,
            . on the energy scale
                               2% at 14 MeV,    3% at 22 MeV,
           (ERR-2) on the spectrometer efficiency of 11%,
           (ERR-3) on the correction for absorption of gammas, 1%,
           (ERR-4) on the correction for nonelastic processes in
                                          the target,  2%,
           (ERR-5) on the neutron flux,  6%,
           (ERR-6) on the anisotropy of gammas, 3%,
           (ERR-7) due to the assumption of equal solid angle for
                                         the whole sample, 1%.
           The resulting error for the cross-sections
                                        was about 15%.
            The energy resolution of gamma ray has been determined
           by the energy width of the spectrometer response
           function (1.65+-0.05) and by the energy spread of the
           neutron beam (1.35 MeV).  The resulting resolution are
            14% at 15 MeV, and 10% at 21 MeV.
