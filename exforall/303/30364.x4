TITLE      -GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA AND (N,GAMMA) CROSS-SECTIONS AT
           14 MEV FOR SC, Y, PR AND HO.-
EXP-YEAR   (75) MEASUREMENTS FROM 1974 TO 1976.
FACILITY   (CCW) COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR, ENERGY OF INCIDENT
           DEUTERON IS 100 KEV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION.
INC-SPECT  THE ''ENERGY-SPREAD'' IS 1.35 MEV,THAT IS +- 0.675 MEV.
SAMPLE     MONO ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION,
           TARGETS ARE SPHERES (HEMISPHERES) WITH DIAMETER 5 TO 6
           CM PLACED CLOSE TO THE TRITUM TARGET.    THEREFORE THE
           NEUTRON ENERGY IS SPREAD OVER A RANGE FROM 13.5 TO 14.7
           MEV.  DUE TO THIS GEOMETRY THE SPECTRA OBTAINED ARE
           INTEGRATED OVER A SOLID ANGLE OF 2PI (OR 4PI FOR HEMI-
           SPHERES).
METHOD     GAMMA SPECTRA WERE MEASURED WITH THE TELESCOPIC
           SCINTILLATION PAIR SPECTROMETER.
           RECOIL PROTON SPECTROMETER WAS USED FOR NEUTRON
           MONITORING.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR) SCINTILLATION PAIR SPECTROMETER WHICH
           RESOLUTION HAS BEEN MEASURED TO BE 12.5, 9.5 AND 8.0
           PER CENT FOR GAMMAS OF ENERGIES 12.1,16.5 AND 20.4 MEV,
           RESPECTIVELY.
           EFFICIENCIES FOR THESE GAMMA ENERGIES HAVE BEEN
           MEASURED TO BE 0.45,0.55 AND 0.56 PERCENT,RESPECTIVELY.
           .RECOIL PROTON SPECTROMETER USING A CSI(TL) CRYSTAL
           FOR NEUTRON-FLUX MONITORING.  THE ACCURACY OF THE
           DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS +- 6 PERCENT.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            FOR NEUTRON-FLUX DETERMINATION.

CORRECTION SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR
           .BACKGROUND,
           .THE SPECTROMETER RESPONSE FUNCTION,
           .THE GAMMAS CREATED AND ABSORBED IN THE SAMPLE,
           .ABSORPTION OF GAMMAS IN THE PARAFFIN-COLLIMATOR, AND
           .NEUTRON NONELASTIC PROCESS IN THE TARGET.
ERR-ANALYS THE OVERALL ERROR INCLUDES THE UNCERTAINTIES,
            . DUE TO STATISTICAL ERRORS,
            . ON THE BACKGROUND CORRECTION,
               7 PERCENT FOR SPHERES,    1 PERCENT FOR HEMISPHERS,
            . DUE TO SPECTROMETER RESPONSE FUNCTION WHICH
             ENLARGES STATISTICAL ERROR BY A FACTOR OF 1.8,
            . ON THE ENERGY SCALE
               2 PERCENT AT 14 MEV,    3 PERCENT AT 22 MEV,
            . ON THE SPECTROMETER EFFICIENCY OF 11 PERCENT,
            . ON THE CORRECTION FOR ABSORPTION OF GAMMAS, 1 PERC.,
            . ON THE CORRECTION FOR NONELASTIC PROCESSES IN THE
             TARGET,  2 PERCENT,
            . ON THE NEUTRON FLUX,  6 PERCENT,
            . ON THE ANISOTROPY OF GAMMAS, 3 PERCENT,
            . DUE TO THE ASSUMPTION OF EQUAL SOLID ANGLE FOR THE
             WHOLE SAMPLE, 1 PERCENT.
           THE RESULTING ERROR FOR THE CROSS-SECTIONS WAS ABOUT
           15 PERCENT.
            THE ENERGY RESOLUTION OF GAMMA RAY HAS BEEN DETERMINED
           BY THE ENERGY WIDTH OF THE SPECTROMETER RESPONSE
           FUNCTION (1.65+-0.05) AND BY THE ENERGY SPREAD OF THE
           NEUTRON BEAM (1.35 MEV).  THE RESULTING RESOLUTION ARE
            14 PERC. AT 15 MEV, AND 10 PERC. AT 21 MEV.
