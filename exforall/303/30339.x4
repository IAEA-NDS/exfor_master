TITLE      FISSION NEUTRON AVERAGED CROSS SECTION OF
           TL-203(N,2N)TL-202 REACTION
EXP-YEAR   (75)
FACILITY   RA-3 LIGHT WATER REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC) REACTOR. THE FAST FLUX IN THE IRRADIATION BOX
           WAS ABOUT 10**13 NEUTRONS/(CM2*SEC).
INC-SPECT  USING FOUR STANDARD REACTIONS OF DIFFERENT THRESHOLD
           ENERGIES NO DEPARTURES FROM A FISSION SPECTRUM WERE
           FOUND. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GIVEN.
           COMPILER'S COMMENT = NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH THE THRESHOLD
           ENERGY OF THE REACTION CONCERNED IS ABOVE 7 MEV, A
           'DUMMY-ENERGY' FOR THE FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM OF
           2 MEV HAD TO BE ENTERED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD
DETECTOR   (GELI) GERMANIUM-LITHIUM DETECTOR. THE EFFICIENCY
           CURVE WAS OBTAINED USING STANDARDIZED SOURCES FOLLOWED
           BY LEAST SQUARE FITTING, THE ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY BY
           COMPARISON WITH A CS-137 SOURCE.
MONITOR    FOUR DIFFERENT STANDARD REACTIONS WERE USED. FOR THE
           RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS SEE
           SUBENTRIES 002-005.
           THE VALUES OF THE STANDARD CROSS SECTIONS WERE TAKEN
           FROM A.CALAMAND, HANDBOOK ON NUCLEAR ACTIVATION CROSS
           SECTIONS, PG.273, TECHNICAL REPORT SERIES NO.156,
           IAEA, VIENNA (1974).

COMMENT    AUTHORS CALCULATED A MEAN VALUE OF THE MEASUREMENTS
           WITH 4 DIFFERENT STANDARDS = 4.0 +- 0.32 MB.
STATUS     DATA TAKEN FROM J.INORG.NUCL.CHEM.38(1976)1386.
HISTORY    (760831C) OS.
ERR-ANALYS NO ERRORS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS ARE GIVEN.
           THE ERROR OF THE MEAN VALUE INCLUDES
           -ERRORS OF EFFICIENCY DETERMINATION AND DUE TO THE
             DISPERSION OF THE OBTAINED CROSS SECTION VALUES
             (1.8 PERCENT)
           -ERROR OF STANDARD CROSS SECTIONS (6.2 PERCENT).
           NO INFORMATION ON STATISTICAL ERRORS GIVEN.
