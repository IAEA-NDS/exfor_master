TITLE      The epithermal resonance integral of lutetium.
AUTHOR     (E.Abul-Ela,I.Hamouda)
INSTITUTE  (3EGYCAI)
REFERENCE  (R,AREAEE-165,1973)
SAMPLE     Natural lutetium
INC-SOURCE (REAC) E-RR-1 reactor, horizontal channel.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of bare and cadmium covered foil.
COMMENT     Lu-175 and Lu-176 isotopes consists as (1/v) and
            (non 1/v) part of the resonance integral of natural
            lutetium, respectively.
DETECTOR   No information.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No further information.

           .Au,Mn and Cu were used as standard for cadmium-ratio.
COMMENT    Cadmium ratios for Lu-175 and for (1/v)detector
           were measured to be  1.445+-0.07 and 39.6+-1.6,
           respectively.
           The calculated epicadmium resonance integral by the
           authors is   666 +- 46 b, using the following values:
            Av.radiation width = 0.06 eV,
            Av.neutron width = (0.84+-0.2)/10**3 eV,
            Av.level spacing = 6.4 +- 1.5 b.      and then
            (RI)(resolved)=580+-21b, (RI)(unresolved)=86+-29b.
