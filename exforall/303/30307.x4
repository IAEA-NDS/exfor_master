TITLE      Fragment kinetic energy distribution in the fission of
           Np-237 by reactor neutrons.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) APSARA reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Swimming pool reactor.
INC-SPECT  Neutrons in the irradiation position used were under-
           moderated and the neutron flux of energy above 1 MeV
           was estimated as about 10.**11 n/cm2/sec.
           Irradiation period varied from a few hours to 24 hours.
SAMPLE     Np-237 obtained from ORNL was purified from Am,Pu and U
           The content of Pu-239 was less than 0.004%.
           By electrodeposition, 100 to 180 micro-gram of Np was
           deposited over an area of 1.5 cm2  and it was covered
           first with a stack of 1.9 mg/cm2 pure Al foil and was
           wrapped in 63 mg/cm2 pure Al, and finally was covered
           with about 200 mg/cm2 cadmium foil to reduce the
           formation of Np-238.
METHOD     (GSPEC,RCHEM) Radiochemical and gamma-ray
           spectroscopic method. The thin-target integral range
           measurement technique was employed to measure the
           recoil ranges of fission products.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector for direct counting of the
           catcher foils on the detector.  Detail, see S.P.Dange
           et al.,2nd Int.Conf.on Phys.and Chem.of Fission,Vienna
           1969,p.741.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from Table 1 and p.1255 of
                                        Phys.Rev.,11C(1975)1251
CORRECTION The average energy of a fission fragment was corrected
           for the change in mass of emitted neutrons.     (The
           average velocity of a fragment is not changed by the
           emission of neutrons)

           Total primary kinetic energy of fission fragment.
ANALYSIS   The recoil ranges of fission products were converted
           into kinetic energies using two different range-energy
           equations.  They are the following:
          1eq. of Alexander-Gazdik, Phys.Rev,120(1960)874, and
           Phys.Rev,129(1963)259, given as
              R = K * (E **(3/2)), R=range and E=kinetic energy,
           and K is a constant which varies slowly with the mass.
          2eq. of Prakash, thesis, Univ.of Bombay,1971, given as
              R = C * ((square root(E))*(square root(A1))/((F)*
              ((Z1)**(1/3)))
           where the range R of a fission product of mass number
           A1 with the most probable charge Z1 and energy E are
           related with (F).  (F) includes the light and heavy
           primary mass numbers and their most probable charges,
           density of the stopping medium and the electronic
           charge.  (C) is a constant.   See text for detail.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Recoil range, in milli-gram/cm2.
           (MISC2) 'Primary' mass of light fission fragment.
           Accordingly, mass of heavy fragment(primary) is to be,
             (237+1) - (primary mass of light fission fragment).
           The 'primary' mass was obtained by adding to the mass
           of the measured fission product the average number of
           neutrons per fission emitted by this fragment,using
           the neutron emission curve for Pu-239 of Apalin et al.
           Nucl. Phys. 71,553 (1965).
FLAG       (1.) Data obtained using Ge(Li) detector by direct
            gamma counting only.
HISTORY    (20100303A) SD: REACTION codes were changed
               according to EXFOR rules.
