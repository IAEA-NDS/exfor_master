TITLE      ISOMER YIELD RATIOS OF I-132M AND I-134M.
FACILITY   IRR-1 REACTOR IN SOREQ.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  IRRADIATION FOR 20 SEC IN A 5.E+12 N/CM2/SEC THERMAL
           NEUTRON FLUX.
SAMPLE     SOLUTION OF UO(2)((NO(3))(2).  ENRICHED U-235,93.3 PERC
           400 MICRO-G OF U-235.
METHOD     FAST RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION.
           THIS SEPARATION, WHICH EXTRACTS FISSION PRODUCTS BY
           VACUUM WITH A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE AND THEN SEPARATES THE
           IODINE ISOTOPES BY PRECIPITATING THEM AS AG-I.
           TAKES ONLY 150 SEC.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 100MM2 SI(LI) DETECTOR (SEFORAD,ISRAEL),  WITH
           ACTIVE DEPTH OF 4 MM.
           THE ENERGY RESOLUTIONS(FWHM) OF THE SPECTROMETER FOR
           6.4 KEV(FE)K-ALPHA X-RAYS AND FOR 32.2KEV(BA)K-ALPHA
           X-RAYS ARE 450 EV AND 550 EV, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMENT    THE HALF-LIVES OF I-132M AND I-134M HAVE BEEN
           DETERMINED BY THIS WORK.
           THE RATIO OF THE INDEPENDENT FISSION YIELD IS SEEN TO
           BE EQUAL TO THE RATIO OF THE YIELDS OF THE META-STABLE
           STATES.
