TITLE       Determination of isomer cross-section ratio for (n,g)
            reaction on Te-120 using a radiochemical method.

FACILITY   (REAC,3MEXINI)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Triga Mark III reactor of Nuclear Center, Sazar
INC-SPECT   Irradiation time of about 6 hours with an approximate
            neutron flux of 2. X 10.**12 n/cm2/sec.
SAMPLE      Natural 99% purity metallic tellurium, 20 gram.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
            Author's note:  Since chemical changes occuring in
            molecules where an atom is affected by an internally
            converted isomeric transition can be detected, it is
            possible to use the difference in the oxidation
            state of the metastable and ground state isomers in
            order to obtain its separation and therefore, an
            indirect measurement of activation cross-section
            ratio.
            Chemical oxidation of the radioactive materials (such
            as Te-121m and Te-121g) to telluric acid gives
            'hexavalent' tellurium in both metastable and ground
            state species, whereas isomeric transition produces
            'tetravalent' ground state species. =
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector.
PART-DET   (DG) Decay gammas.
COMMENT     Equal aliquot of the original telluric acid solution,
            which contained the equilibrium amount of Te-121
            ground state isomer was used as the standard of
            analysis.
