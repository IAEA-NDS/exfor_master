TITLE      INVESTIGATION OF PROMPT NEUTRONS ACCOMPANYING
           SPONTANEOUS TERNARY FISSION OF CF-252.
EXP-YEAR   (69)
METHOD     FAST-SLOW COINCIDENCE TECHNIQUE WAS USED FOR DETECTION
           OF PROMPT NEUTRONS ACCOMPANYING SPONTANEOUS TERNARY
           FISSION AND ALPHA PARTICLE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) STILBENE CRYSTAL 40 * 40 MM WITH 56 AVP PHOTO-
           MULTIPLIER.
           NEUTRONS WERE SEPARATELY DETECTED FROM GAMMA RAYS WITH
           A PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION.
           (SOLST) SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR FOR FISSION
           FRAGMENTS AND ALPHA PARTICLES FROM TRIPARTITION.
PART-DET   (PN,A) PROMPT NEUTRON AND ALPHAS.

                  FRAGMENT
COMMENT    THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRONS IN THE BINARY
           FISSION (FWHM = 96 A-DEG) IS QUITE SIMILAR WITH ONE IN
           THE TERNARY FISSION(FWHM = 90 A-DEG).

           SYMP.ON PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF FISSION,SALZBURG,
           VOLII,P.93(1965).
COMMENT    1.THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS EMITTED FROM THE
           LIGHT FRAGMENT TO THAT EMITTED FROM THE HEAVY ONE IS
           SIMILAR IN THE BINARY AND TERNARY FISSION,
             ((NU(L,B)/NU(H,B))/((NU(L,T)/NU(H,T))= 1.1 +- 0.1,
           WHERE L,H,B,T STAND FOR LIGHT-,HEAVY-FRAGMENT,BINARY
           AND TERNARY.
           2.PROMPT NEUTRON YIELD ACCOMPANYING SPONTANEOUS TERNARY
           FISSION DECREASES WITH INCREASING THE ALPHA ENERGY,
                (D-NU/D-E(ALPHA)) =(-0.042 +- 0.01)/MEV.
           3.THE TOTAL KINETIC ENERGY RELEASED IN TERNARY FISSION
           IS HIGHER BY 3.8+-1.3 MEV THAN THAT IN BINARY FISSION.
