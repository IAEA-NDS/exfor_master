TITLE      Measurement of the angular distribution for the
           7Be(d,n)8B reaction and determination of the
           astrophysical S factor for the 7Be(p,g)8B reaction

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI -13 tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The 7Be beam with an energy of 20.0 MeV was
           produced via the 1H(7Li,7Be)n reaction by bombarding
           a H2 gas cell at 1.2 atm pressure with a 34 MeV 7Li
           ions from HI-13 tandem accelerator. The beam
           typically comprises more than 90% 7Be(4+) ions with
           the major contaminants 7Be(3+)(<2%,12MeV) and
           7Li(3+) ions (<9%,13MeV)
DETECTOR   (TELES) 9 cm long ionization chamber filled with 75Torr
           P-10 gas backed by a 45x45mm2 Hamamatsu two-dimensional
           position sensitive silicon detector (PSSD) of 450 mu-m
           in thickness.
METHOD     (EDE)
SAMPLE     A deuterated polyethylene (CD2)n) foil of 0.97 mg/cm2
           in thickness was used as the secondary target and a
           polyethylene ((CH2)n) foil was used to determine the
           background.
