TITLE      The 10B(a,n)13N, 13N* cross section for alpha-energies
           from 1.0 to 5 MeV

SAMPLE     Targets were deposited on 0.25 mm tantalum backings
           by electron bombardment of isotopic boron powder
           containing 96.5% 10B and 3.5% 11B
           All measurements were taken with a 28+-3 mu-g/cm**2
           target or 32 keV thick at E(alpha)=3 MeV.
METHOD     (PSD)
FACILITY   (VDG)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Stilbene scintillator 2.5 cm in diam. and
           1.2 cm thick. Some measurements were carried out with
           the bias method on NE-213 liquid scintillators.
