SAMPLE      High purity niobium foils, thickness: 10 micron.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG,EXTB)
           Primary deuteron energies: 50 MeV
           beam intensities: 32 nA,
           irradiation time: 1 h
           gamma spectrometric measurements started: about 5 hours
           after the end of the irradiations.
           The stacks were irradiated in a short Faraday-cup
           target holder. Two or three measurements were made on
           each Nb sample while the monitor foils were measured
           once. Nondestructive measurement without chemical
           separation.
           The determination of the average intensity of the
           bombarding beam and the energy degradation along the
           stack are based on the simultaneously measured monitor
           reactions and comparison with recommended values.

REL-REF    (N,,ANDERSEN+,B,ANDERSEN,,1977)
           The energy degradation was initially determined by
           calculation using the polynomial approximation of
           Andersen  and Ziegler.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainties of the mean deuteron
           energies in the individual foils were estimated from
            * the energy uncertainty of the primary beam,
            * the uncertainty of the thickness and uniformity of
              the foils in the irradiated stacks,
            * energy straggling and
            * increasing energy spread.
           The uncertainties on the energy of the first Nb foil of
           a stack was +-0.5 MeV and increase up to
           1.5 MeV for the last Nb foils of the stack.
           (ERR-T)
           Typical total uncertainty is between 11-14%.
           (ERR-1)number of bombarding particles(7%)
           (ERR-2)surface density of target atoms(5%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency (10%)
           (ERR-S)statistical and peak fitting (5%)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the codes ALICE-D, EMPIRE-D and TALYS.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.
