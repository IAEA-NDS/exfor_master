METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)A stack of 12
           identical groups of(Ho-Zr-Pb-Ti-Al) foil layers
           containing Ho(26.2um), Zr(98.42um), Pb(15.74um) target
           foils, Ti(12um) beam monitor foil and Al(156.6um) beam
           energy degrader foils of natural isotopic composition
           were irradiated with a proton beam of 37 MeV primary
           energy and 146 nA intensity for 70 min.
           Targets were counted four times after typical cooling
           times of 1.3 h, 3.5 h, 97 h and 285 h .
           The final beam current and energy
           scale are based on the analysis of the cross section
           data for the natTi(p,x)48V monitor reaction measured
           simultaneously. with the investigated reactions

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects. Uncertainty of the primary incident beam was
           +- 0.3MeV which increased up to +-0.75MeV in the last
           Pb foil of the stack at LLN and 0.6 MeV at VUB.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way as the square root
           of the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included.
           (ERR-1)surface density of target nuclei(5%),
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (7%),
           (ERR-S,1.0,15.0)statistical and peak fitting (1-15%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL,
           MENDL2p and EMPIRE.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
