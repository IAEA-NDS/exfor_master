FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB)
SAMPLE     Natural silver target, thicknesses: 10 um
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC)
           The stack was irradiated at an external beam line of
           the Cyclone 90 cyclotron of the Universite Catholique
           in Louvain la Neuve (LLN) for 40 min with a 50 MeV,
           50 nA deuteron beam. The stack contained a sequence of
           10 blocks of Al (10 um), Sr(NO3)2 (3 um), Al (50 um),
           Er(32 um), Al (10 um), Ba(NO2) (2 um, sedimented),
           Al (50 um) and Ag(10 um) foils.
           The 10 Ag targets covered the 50-33 MeV energy range.
           Nondestructive measurement without chemical separation.
           Energy losses in the sample foils and stopping powers
           were calculated using the SRIM-2003 code.
           Four series of spectra were recorded.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) It was not specified.
           (ERR-T) The combined uncertainty on cross-section was
           estimated
           (ERR-1)number of target nuclei and non-uniformity(1%);
           (ERR-2)beam current (7%);
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-4) beam loss correction (1.5%)
           (ERR-5,1.,20.)statistical error (1-20%)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the code TALYS, ALICE-D, EMPIRE-D and Systematics.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated and compared
           to experimental yields taken from the literature.
