METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stack containing target foils together with Ti monitor
           foils were irradiated with 39.4 MeV alpha beam.
           Irradiation time: 60 min
           Beam intensity: 100nA.
           3 series of measurements with cooling time of
           0.4-2.2 h, 3-4.5 h and  415-464 hours were done.
           Energy degradation in the stack was calculated
           by using the polynomial approximation of Andersen and
           Ziegler. Final beam intensity was determined by
           The experimental method for the natTa(d,x)178W reaction
           is reported in a previous work, EXFOR entry: D4227.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects. Uncertainty of the primary incident beam was
           +- 0.3MeV which increased up to +-1.5 MeV in the last
           target foil of the stack.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way as the square root
           of the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included. Over all uncertainty: 10-20%.
           (ERR-1)surface density of target nuclei(3%),
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (7%),
           (ERR-3) beam loss (1.5%)
           (ERR-4) detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-S,1.0,20.0)statistical and peak fitting (1-20%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL,
           ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
