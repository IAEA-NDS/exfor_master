            Experimental method for the natTa(d,x)178W reaction
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB)
SAMPLE     Natural metallic Hf (9.62 um thick) and Ta (25.0 um)
            foils from GoodFellow UK.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stack containing target foils together with Ti monitor
            foils were irradiated with 39.4 MeV alpha beam.
           Irradiation time: 60 min
           Beam intensity: 100 nA.
           3 series of measurements with cooling time of
            0.4-2.2 h, 3-4.5 h and 415-464 hours were done.
           Energy degradation in the stack was calculated by
            using the polynomial approximation of Andersen and
            Ziegler.
            Final beam intensity was determined by
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(A,X)24-CR-51,,SIG)

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty on the median energy in the
            foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty
            of incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping
            power of each foil due to thickness variation and
            straggling effects.
           Uncertainty of the primary incident beam was +/-0.3 MeV
            which inceased up to +/-1.5 MeV in the last target
            foil of the stack.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty on the cross section values
            (10-20%) are estimated in the standard way as the
            square root of the quadratic summation of the
            independently contributing parameters excluding time
            parameters.

           (ERR-S,1.0,20.0) statistical and peak fitting (1-20%)
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
            determination of integral physical yields.
