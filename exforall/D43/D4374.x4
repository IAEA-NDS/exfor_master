SAMPLE     High purity natural foils, thicknesses:  Yb 30.,
           Al 25.5, Ti 12. micron.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stack1 and stack2 contained ten and eight high purity
           ytterbium foils, respectively, interloaded with Ti
           monitor foils.
           An Al degrader was placed at the front of stack2 to
           ensure a small energy shift in the successive Yb foils
           of the two stacks.
           Incident alpha energy: 39 MeV,
           beam currents: 137 and 128 nA,
           irradiation times: 90 min in both cases.
           No chemical separation.
           The data acquisition started 1 year after the end of
           bombardment.

           The mean energy of the alpha-particle beam in the
           successive target foils was calculated using the
           polynomial approximation of Ziegler.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainty at the first foil in
           the stack was estimated to be 0.3 MeV increasing up to
           1.5 MeV at the last foil due to the energy straggling
           and the uncertainty on the target thickness.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty on the cross sections was
           determined in the standard way: the linearly
           contributing independent processes were taken into
           account by extracting the square root of quadratically
           summed relative uncertainties, namely:
           (ERR-1) number of the bombarding particles (7%),
           (ERR-2) number of the target nuclei (3%),
           (ERR-3) decay data (3%),
           (ERR-4) detector efficiency (7%) and
           (ERR-S,1.0,10.)peak area (1-10%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL-2013.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
