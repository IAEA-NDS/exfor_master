SAMPLE     (54-XE-124,ENR=0.9997)
           Gas target of 124Xe with pressure of 5 mb was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,LEGE)
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Activation cross section was measured between 11 and 15
           MeV with 0.5 MeV steps.
           Irradiation was made with 0.5puA beam for 3 and 18h.
           Beam intensity was controlled by measuring the
           backscattered alpha particles at 165 degree backward.
           Gamma measurements started about 1h after end of
           irradiation in a close measuring geometry. True
           coincidence summing effect was estimated and corrected.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The quoted uncertainty in the Ec.m. values
           corresponds to the energy  stability of the beam and
           to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target
           including straggling effect 0.3%.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the cross section is the
           quadratic sum of the following partial errors:
           (ERR-1)number of projectiles (3%)
           (ERR-2)number of target atoms (2%)
           (ERR-3)change of the size of the target chamber (0.4%)
           (ERR-4,7.0,11.0)energy dependent detector efficiency
                           (7-11%)
           (ERR-S,0.1,8.0) counting statistics (0.1-8%) for (a,g)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes.
