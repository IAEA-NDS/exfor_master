TITLE      Extension of the energy range of experimental
           activation cross-sections data of deuteron induced
           nuclear reactions on indium up to 50 MeV

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
SAMPLE     Indium metal foils (commercial).
           The 50 micron thick In foils were placed onto a
           50 micron Al backing and wrapped with 6 micron Al for
           protection.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Three stacks were bombarded with deuterons.
           Beam energies: 50 MeV, irradiation time: 1 h
           beam intensities: 32 nA.
           The stack was mounted in a Faraday-cup like target
           holder equipped with a suppressor of secondary
           electrons.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured nondestructively, without physical separation
           of target and covering foils and without chemical
           separation.
           The source-detector distance was kept large enough to
           minimize dead time and pile-up effects and possible
           influence of the non point-like geometry of the
           samples compared to calibration standards.
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat2.6 database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The monitoring method allows estimating the
           uncertainty on the primary beam energy (+-0.3 MeV)
           which is continuously rising in each foil through the
           stack and attains +-0.7 MeV in the last In foil.
           (ERR-T) The following experimental uncertainties
           were considered:
           (ERR-1) number of target nuclei including
                   non-uniformity (5%)
           (ERR-2) incident particle flux (7%),
           (ERR-5,0.1,20.) peak area including statistical 0.1-20%
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency (5%) and
           (ERR-4) gamma-ray abundance and branching rate
                   data (3%).
           Typical total uncertainty is between 10-15%.
           Possible additional uncertainties due to non-linear
           effects (like half-life and waiting time) were not
           accounted for.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental results were compared to the
           curves calculated with the ALICE-D and EMPIRE-D
           theoretical model codes and to the curves given in the
           EAF-2007 and TENDL-2009 and TENDL-2014 databases.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.
