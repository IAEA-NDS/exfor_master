           the vicinity of 1450 keV for accelerator energy
           calibration

FACILITY   (VDG,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     A self-supporting carbon foil (thickness: 1.0*10e18
           atom/cm2) with an evaporated palladium layer on its
           surface (thickness: 2.2*10e17 atom/cm2)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (SIBAR)
METHOD     (FPGAM) Prompt gammas were detected at 55 degree.
           (SITA) A single target was irradiated with deuteron
           beam in the energy range 1400 - 1500 keV.
           Gamma-rays, protons and backscattered deuterons were
           detected simultaneously. The energy loss in the Pd
           layer (4.4 keV) was calculated with the SRIM code.
           The number of target nuclei was determined with RBS
           technique using alpha beam of 1.5 MeV energy.
MONITOR    A thin film of NaCl (thickness: 8.4*10e17 atom/cm2)
           evaporated on a self-supported thin film of Ag was
           used for the measurement of the excitation function of
           the 23Na(p,p0g)23Na reaction in the 1900-1959 keV
           energy range. Since the parameters of the included
           1931 keV resonance have well established values in
           the literature, the reliability of the experimental
           arrangement, fitting and evaluating process could be
           checked by comparing the measured and reported data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty propagated from:
           (ERR-1)number of target nuclei(2.5%)
           (ERR-2)detector efficiency (3%)
           (EN-ERR) The energy of the beam, as well as its energy
           stability was regularly assessed measuring the
           991.81 +- 0.04 keV resonance in the
           27Al(p,g)28Si reaction.

REACTION   (6-C-12(D,P)6-C-13,PAR,DA,G,4PI)  Cross sections for
           production of 3089.keV gamma from the 3089.4keV level.
ANALYSIS   The total cross sections of the present work were
           obtained by multiplying the differential cross section
           measured at 55 degree by 4Pi.
