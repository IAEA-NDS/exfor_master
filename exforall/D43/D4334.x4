TITLE      Excitation functions for (d,x) reactions on 133Cs up
           to Ed=40 MeV

SAMPLE     Pellets (120mg/cm2) of CsCl targets were made by
           pressing. A 100 microns thick Al backing and
           10 microns thick Al protecting covers were applied.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           The stack was bombarded with deuterons of 40 MeV.
           irradiation time: 40 minutes
           beam intensities: 25nA
           The stack was mounted in a Faraday-cup like target
           holder equipped with a suppressor of secondary
           electrons.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured non-destructively, without physical separation
           of target and covering foils and without chemical
           separation.
           The source-detector distance was kept large enough to
           minimize dead time and pile-up effects and possible
           influence of the non point-like geometry of the
           samples compared to calibration standards.
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The monitoring method allows estimating the
           uncertainty on the primary beam energy (+-0.2 MeV)
           which is continuously rising in each foil through the
           stack.
           (ERR-T)
           Typical total uncertainty is between 12-15%.
           (ERR-1)number of bombarding particles(7%)
           (ERR-2)surface density of target atoms(5%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-4,1.0,3.0)nuclear decay and branching data(1-3%)
           (ERR-S,0.1,10.0)statistical and peak fitting (0.1-10%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental results were compared to the
           result calculated by the ALICE-D, EMPIRE-D and TENDL
           theoretical model codes.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.
