FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     High purity metallic V foil of 8.41 um thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured by using charged
           particle activation method.
           (GSPEC) Activity measurement of the reaction products
           was done by Gamma-spectrometry based on HPGe detectors.
           (STTA)A stacked foils targets was irradiated with
           3He beam of 26.7 MeV and 100nA for 1 h.
           One stack contained Ti the other one Cu monitor foils.
           (EDEG)Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           polynomial approximation of Andersen ad Ziegler.
           (EXTB)The irradiation was done on an extracted beam of
           the ATOMKI cyclotron.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured nondestructively without chemical separation.
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam energy
           was estimated as (+-0.3 MeV) which increased due to
           straggling effect continuously in each foil through the
           stack up 1.4 MeV.
           (ERR-T)
           Typical total uncertainty is between 12%.
           (ERR-1)number of bombarding particles(7%)
           (ERR-2)surface density of target atoms(5%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency (7%)
           (ERR-4)nuclear decay and branching data(3%)
           (ERR-S)statistical and peak fitting (3%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental results were compared to the
           result calculated by the TENDL and EMPIRE theoretical
           model codes.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.
