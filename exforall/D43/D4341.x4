FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     The targets were made by vacuum evaporation of Er2O3
           powder with natural isotopic composition and enriched
           to 8.1+-0.2% in 164Er and 166Er content: 33.10+-3.4%
           onto 2 um thick, high purity Al backing.
           The enrichment level was checked by activation at
           Ea = 15.5, 16.5 and 17.0 MeV irradiation using both
           natural and enriched targets and the derived cross
           sections were found to be consistent.
           The thickness of the targets varied between 114 and
           238 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,LEGE)
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) The KI targets were irradiated
           with alpha beams from the MGC20 cyclotron of ATOMKI.
           Energies were in the range of 9.81 <= Ea<=15.5 MeV,
           covered in steps of about 0.5 MeV.
           The typical beam current was between 0.1 and 0.6 microA
           The length of each irradiation was between 0.92 and
           24 h, corresponding to about 2.7 E15 and 2.7 E17 total
           incident alpha particles.
           The current integrator counts were recorded in
           multichannel scaling mode, stepping the channel every
           minute to take into account the changes in the beam
           current.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The quoted uncertainty in the Ec.m. values
           corresponds to the energy  stability of the beam and
           to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is the
           quadratic sum of the following partial errors:
           (ERR-1)HPGE detector efficiency(6%);
           (ERR-2)LEPS detector efficiency (5%);
           (ERR-3) number of target atoms (4.4%);
           (ERR-4) current measurement (3%);
           (ERR-5,,8.0) uncertainty of decay parameters (<=8.0);
           (ERR-S,0.4,7.4) counting statistics (0.4-7.4%).
           The uncertainties given for the averaged values are the
           variances of the weighted means.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes.
