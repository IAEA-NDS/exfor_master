SAMPLE     12 targetswere prepared by vacuum evaporation of natIn.
           Al (2 - 2.5um) backing, Ta (0.5mm) backing.
           Target thicknesses: 4.48xE17 - 2.28xE18 atoms/cm2
           determined by RBS and PIXE methods.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (LEGE)
           for measuring the activity of the target foils.
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB)
           The energy of the alpha beam provided by the cyclotron
           accelerator of ATOMKI was Elab=9.15 and 16.15 MeV.
           Activation of the targets lasted for 0.25 - 20 h by
           alpha beam of 600-800nA. The beam intensity was
           recorded by multichannel scaler to check the beam
           stability.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)Includes the energy calibration of the
           alpha beam and to the uncertainty of the energy loss
           in the target, which was calculated using the
           SRIM code.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross-section was
           estimated by taking the square root of the sum in
           quadrature of all individual contributions, supposing
           equal sensitivities for the different parameters.
           (ERR-1)target thickness (4.8%)
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (3%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency  (5%)
           (ERR-4)decay parameters (6%)
           (ERR-5,0.8,2.2)close geometry correction (0.8-2.2%)
           (ERR-S,0.5,16.8)statistical uncertainty (1.-15.%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared with the
           results of the theoretical model codes.
