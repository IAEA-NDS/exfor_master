SAMPLE     High purity (99.98%) vanadium foil 8.41um.
           High purity Ti foil, 12um, for monitoring the beam.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used to measure
           cross section.
           (GSPEC) HPGe detector based Gamma-spectrometry was
           used to measure the activity.
           (STTA) A stack of 7 V and 3 Ti foils was irradiated
           20MeV, 108nA alpha beam for 80 min.
           (EDEG)Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           SRIM-2013 code. Primary beam energy 20 MeV
           (EXTB)The irradiation was done on an extracted beam of
           the atomki cyclotron.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured nondestructively without chemical separation.

MONIT-REF  (,K.Gul+,R,IAEA-NDS-1211,2001)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam energy
           was estimated as (+-0.2 MeV) which increased due to
           straggling effect continuously in each foil through the
           stack up 1.0 MeV.
           (ERR-T) Total given uncertainty of the cross section.
           (ERR-1)target thickness (5.0%)
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (7%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency  (7%)
           (ERR-4)decay parameters (3%)
           (ERR-S,1.0,12.0)statistical uncertainty (1.-12.%)
           Typical total uncertainty is between 12-17%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental results were compared to the
           result calculated by the TALYS-1.6, and
           EMPIRE-3.2 theoretical model codes.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.
