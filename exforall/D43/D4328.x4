FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     (47-AG-107,NAT=0.51839)
           (47-AG-107,ENR=0.995) Natural silver and isotopically
           enriched 107Ag targets were produced by vacuum
           evaporation onto high purity thin aluminum foils
             (from 1.8 to 2.5 micron). The thickness of the
           targets varied between 0.410 mg/cm2 and 1.042
           mg/cm2, determined by weight measurement.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross
           sections of 107Ag(a,g)111In and 107Ag(a,n)110In were
           determined in energy ranges Ecm=7.79-12.50MeV and
           Ecm=8.57-12.50MeV respectively by using activation
           technique. Some beam energies could not be produced
           by the cyclotron, therefore, aluminum and nickel
           energy degrader foils were used. During the
           irradiation the target stability was monitored by an
           ion-implanted Si detector, placed at 165deg relative
           to the beam direction. Typical beam current was
           150-800nA. After each irradiation the target was
           transported to a low-background counting setup. The
           activity of targets was measured with a HPGE detector
           equipped with 4pi, 10 cm thick lead shielding.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) includes the uncertainty of the primary beam
           energy (0.5%), the energy loss in target (0.6-1.0%)
           and thickness of the degrader foils (1%)
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is
           calculated as the quadratic sums of the following
           errors:
           (ERR-1) gamma-detection efficiency (7%)
           (ERR-2) target thickness (7%)
           (ERR-3,,3.1) decay parameters (<=3.1%)
           (ERR-S,0.6,14.0) counting statistics (0.6-14.0%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The resulting experimental cross sections were
           compared to theoretical Hauser-Feshbach model
           calculations with the code SMARAGD.
           (POT) An alpha + nucleus optical potential with an
           energy dependent alpha width was proposed to fit the
           experimental data.
