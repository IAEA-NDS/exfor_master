SAMPLE     Highly enriched 112Cd electroplated on Cu backing.
           Nominal thickness of the 112Cd layer was 14.67 mg/cm2
           equivalent 16.96 um.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) One stack
           consisting of twenty two 112Cd on Cu-backing targets
           interleaved with Al (151 and 102 um)
           monitor/degraders, was irradiated with a 50 MeV
           deuteron beam of the CGR930 cyclotron in Louvain la
           Neuve (LLN). Irradiation was done in a Faraday-cup
           type target holder with deuteron beam of 50nA for 1
           hour. Beam intensity was monitored by using monitor
           reactions. Activity was measured with no chemical
           separation. Several series of spectra were recorded to
           be able to follow the decay. Decay data were taken
           from NUDAT online data library.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects. Uncertainty of the primary incident beam was
           +- 0.2MeV which increased up to +-1.8MeV in the last
           foil of the stack.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way as the square root
           of the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included. Overall uncertainty were 10-13%.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL-2013.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
