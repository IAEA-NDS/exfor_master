SAMPLE     The target material was a Ni-Mn-Cu alloy with known
           composition (Ni:2%, Mn:12%, Cu:86%).
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stacked target techniqe, activation metod and high
           resolution gamma spectrometry were used.
           Irradiation was performed at 50MeV and 100nA deuteon
           beam. and in principle
           The investigated products 56,54,52Mn, 48V and 51Cr may
           be produced in different nuclear reactions on the three
           components of the alloy.
           Nuclear data were taken from NUDAT.
CORRECTION Contribution of reactions to production of different
           radionuclides on Ni and Cu were deduced.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way following the
           recommendations of the ISO-guide as the square root of
           the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Numerical values of the
           contributing error components are not presented.
           Uncertainty of time parameters is not included.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code using TENDL-2017,
           ALICE-IPPE-D and EMPIRE-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
