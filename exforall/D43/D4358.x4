TITLE      Activation cross sections of proton and deuteron
           induced nuclear reactions on holmium and erbium,
           related to the production of 161Er and 160Er medical
           isotopes

SAMPLE     High purity metallic Ho and Er foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           The stack1 contained 19 times of Al 10um, In 116um,
           Al 99.2um, V 8.41um, Al 99.2um, Ho 26.2um AL 99.2um
           foils. The stack was irradiated with 65MeV, 35nA
           protons for 1h at 2BLGLVN.
           The stack2 contained 13 times of Er 25um, Co 50um,
           Al 10um, In 50um, Al 100um foils. The stack was
           irradiated with 70 MeV, 58nA protons for 1h at 2JPNTOH.
           The covered energy range for erbium was 69.5-59.4 MeV.
           Deuteron irradiations were done at 2BLGVUB and 2JPNTOH
           at 21MeV and 40MeV on Er foils of 25 and 32um thick
           respectively using Ti and Al monitor foils.
           Activity was determined with no chemical separation.
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT2.6 online database.

MONIT-REF  (,F.TARKANYI+,R,IAEA-NDS-1211,2001)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy scale was
           estimated by taking into account the energy
           uncertainty of the primary beam, the possible variation
           in the target thickness and the effect of beam
           straggling and cross checked through the re-measured
           excitation function of monitor reaction.
           (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
