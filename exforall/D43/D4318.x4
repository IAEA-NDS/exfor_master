SAMPLE     (68-ER-162,ENR=0.258)The targets were made by
           reductive vacuum evaporation of Er2O3 powder enriched
           to 25.8% in 162Er onto 2 mm thick, high purity Al
           foils. The Er2O3 powder was mixed with Zr powder and
           placed into a C crucible heated by electron beam. The
           target thicknesses were between 114 and 188 mg/cm2.
           The Zr contamination was always below 4 atom%.
DETECTOR   (LEGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross sections
           of 162Er(a,g)166Yb and 162Er(a,n)165Yb were
           determined in energy ranges Ecm=11.21-16.09MeV and
           Ecm=12.19-16.09MeV respectively. In both cases
           activation technique was used. After the irradiation,
           a waiting time of 0.25 h was used. The activity of
           targets was measured with a Low Energy Photon
           Spectrometer (LEPS). Typical duration of the counting
           was about 150-160 h. Due to the short half-life of
           165Yb, the (a,n) cross section was determined from
           the decay of its daughter (165Tm).
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) includes the uncertainty of the primary beam
           energy and the energy loss in target
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is
           calculated as the quadratic sums of the following
           errors:
           (ERR-1,,7.) gamma-detection efficiency (<=7%)
           (ERR-2) number of target atoms (5%)
           (ERR-3) beam intensity (3%)
           (ERR-4,,7.8) decay parameters (<=7.8%)
           (ERR-S,0.1,27.1) counting statistics (0.1-27.1%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The resulting experimental cross sections were
           compared to theoretical Hauser-Feshbach model
           calculations with the code SMARAGD.
           (POT) An alpha + nucleus optical potential was
           constructed to fit the experimental data.
