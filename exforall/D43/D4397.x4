SAMPLE     High purity natural hafnium foils 10.54 um from
           Goodfellow, 99.5%.
           Ti monitor foils 10.9 um and
           Al 50 um energy degradation foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           One stack consisted of thin foils of
           Hf, Al, Pt, and CuMnNi aloy
           targets repeated 25 times was bombarded for 3600 s
           with a 50 MeV deuteron beam of 100 nA.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the beam energy in the
           middle of each irradiated foil was estimated
           combining the uncertainties of the energy degradation
           depending on the thickness of the target foils in the
           stack and the energy straggling.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross-section was
           estimated by taking the square root of the sum in
           quadrature of all individual contributions, supposing
           equal sensitivities for the different parameters.
           The main error components:
           (ERR-1)surface density of target nuclei (5%)
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (7%)
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency  (5%)
           (ERR-4)nuclear data (5%)
           (ERR-S,1.,20.) statistical uncertainty (1.0-20.%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EMPIRE
           and ALICE.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
