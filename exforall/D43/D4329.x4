SAMPLE     (64-GD-152,ENR=0.306)
           Isotopically enriched 152Gd targets were produced by
            vacuum evaporation onto high purity thin Al backings
            (2.5 um thick) using Gd2O3 powder.
           The thickness of the targets varied between
            0.220 mg/cm2 and 0.310 mg/cm2 determined by weight
            measurement.
           Targets with thickness of 0.310 mg/cm2 were also
            examined by Rutherford back scattering method.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 100% relative efficiency HPGe detector equipped
            with 4pi, 10 cm thick Pb shielding.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG,SITA,EXTB)
           During the irradiation the target stability was
            monitored by an ion-implanted Si detector at 165 deg
            relative to the beam direction.
           Typical beam current was 2 uA.
           After each irradiation the target was transported to a
            low-background counting setup.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Uncertainties in the effective center-of-mass
            energies calculated with the SRIM code based on the
            proton energy loss in the targets (0.08-0.4%)
           (ERR-T) Quadratic sums of the following errors:
           (ERR-1) gamma-detection efficiency       (5%)
           (ERR-2) target thickness                (~7%)
           (ERR-3,,3.) beam current integration    (<3%)
           (ERR-4,0.4,9.) decay parameters      (0.4-9%)
           (ERR-S,0.2,21.) counting statistics (0.2-21%)
