FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     (64-GD-152,ENR=0.306) Isotopically enriched 152Gd
           targets were produced by vacuum evaporation onto high
           purity thin aluminum backings (2.5 micron) using Gd2O3
           powder. The thickness of the targets varied between
           0.220 mg/cm2 and 0.310 mg/cm2, determined by weight
           measurement. Targets with thickness of 0.310 mg/cm2
           were also examined by Rutherford back scattering
           method.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross
           sections of 152Gd(p,g)153Tb and 152Gd(p,n)152Tb were
           determined at beam energies E=3.5-8.0 MeV and
           E=5.0-8.0 MeV respectively by using activation
           technique. During the irradiation the target
           stability was monitored by an ion-implanted Si
           detector, placed at 165deg relative to the beam
           direction. Typical beam current was 2 uA. After each
           irradiation the target was transported to a
           low-background counting setup. The activity of
           targets was measured with a 100% relative efficiency
           HPGe detector equipped with 4pi, 10 cm thick lead
           shielding.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR,0.08,0.4) uncertainties in the effective
           center-of-mass energies were calculated with the SRIM
           code based on the proton energy loss in the targets.
            0.08-0.4%
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is
           calculated as the quadratic sums of the following
           errors:
           (ERR-1) gamma-detection efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-2) target thickness (7%)
           (ERR-3,,3.) beam current integration (<=3%)
           (ERR-4,0.4,9.) decay parameters (0.4-9%)
           (ERR-S,0.2,21.) counting statistics (0.2-21%)
ADD-RES    (THEO) The resulting experimental cross sections were
           compared to theoretical Hauser-Feshbach model
           calculations with the code SMARAGD.
