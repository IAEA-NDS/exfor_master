TITLE      Direct study of the a-nucleus optical potential at
            astrophysical energies using the 64Zn(p,a)61Cu
            reaction

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     (30-ZN-64,ENR=0.9971)
           The targets were prepared by vacuum evaporation onto
            2 um thick Al foils and their thicknesses were
            determined by weighing and Rutherford backscattering
            spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA,GSPEC)
           The irradiations were done with proton beams in the
            energy between 3.5 and 8 MeV with typical beam
            intensities of about 1 uA.
           The lengths of the irradiations varied between 0.5 and
            12 h.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were calculated from the well known
            activation formula with measured activity, particle
            flux and number of target nuclei as input parameters.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the c.m. energies comes
            mainly from the beam energy calibration of the
            cyclotron.
           (ERR-T) The most important sources of cross section
            uncertainty are the normalization uncertainty of the
            relative gamma intensities 18.0% for 61Cu and 18.5%
            for 65Ga.
