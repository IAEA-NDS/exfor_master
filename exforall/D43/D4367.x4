SAMPLE     (8-O-17,ENR=0.778)
           (8-O-17,ENR=0.274) The targets were made by anodic
           oxidation of tantalum disks in water enriched in 17-O,
           producing Ta2O5 layers. Two waters samples with
           different level of 17-O enrichment were used for
           target preparations: 77.8% and 27.4%.The Ta:0
           stochiometry was determined by Rutherford
           backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and was found to
           be 0.411 +/- 0.015. The target thickness has been
           determined both by RBS, and by using the intense
           resonances of the 17O(p,g)18F and 18O(p,g)19F
           reaction. The average target thickness was
            (4.87+/-0.29)*10**17 atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross sections
           of 17O(p,g)18F was determined between proton energies
           of 500 keV and 1.8 MeV using activation technique.
           The length of the irradiation varied between 15
           minutes and 5 hours. The typical beam current was 5
           uA. After the irradiation, a waiting time of 0.25 h
           was used. The activity of targets was measured with a
           100% relative efficiency High-Purity Germanium
           detector, which had a 4pi lead shielding. The targets
           were placed directly on to the detector to maximize
           detection efficiency. The measurement relied on the
           detection of the 511 keV annihilation photons
           following the decay of the positron emitter 18F.
           Counting statistics were collected for typically 16
           hours.
