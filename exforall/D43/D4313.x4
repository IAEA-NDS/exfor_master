DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) Two stacks containing
           enriched 67Zn target on Ni backing and Ti and Cu
           monitor foils were irradiated 30.6 MeV protons with 6
           days difference. Activations lasted for 2 hours and
           100nA beam current. Charge was measured in Faraday-cup
           and were compared with the monitor reactions. An
           agreement was found within 6%. Detector dead time was
           kept below 3%. The contribution of 64Cu produced in
           the Ni backing was checked and found to be negligible.
           Decay curve analysis of the annihilation peak was used
           to determine the 64Cu activity. Cross sections were
           normalized to 100% enrichment.
           Energy degradation was calculation by using the
           polynomial approximation of Andersen and Ziegler.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The energy uncertainty of the primary beam
           was +- 0.4MeV. The uncertainty of the energy of the
           bombarding beam in the middle of each irradiated foil
           was estimated combining the uncertainties of the
           energy degradation depending on the thickness of the
           target foils in the stack and the energy straggling.
           The uncertainty on the median energy in the last foil
           was +-1.3MeV stack1, and +-1.7 stack2.
           (ERR-T)
           The overall uncertainty amounted to 13-17%.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code TALYS
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
