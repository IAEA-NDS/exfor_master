           section were measured in an independent experiment
           using a detector arranged outside the scattering
           chamber with an angular resolution of (+ -1) degr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The error in the absolute values of the
           cross sections was about 10% and was determined
           primarily by the errors in estimating target thickness
           and in calibrating the current integrator. The
           uncertainty in target thickness was 5%.
