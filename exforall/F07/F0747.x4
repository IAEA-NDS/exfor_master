DETECTOR   Angular dependencies of differential cross section were
           measured in an independent  experiment using a
           detector arranged outside the scattering chamber with
           an angular resolution of +- 1 degr.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) The error in the absolute values of the
           cross sections was about 10% and was determined
           primarily by the errors in estimating target thickness
           and in calibrating the current integrator. The
           uncertainty in target thickness was 5%.
           (ERR-SYS) Statistical errors were not more than 8%.
           (DATA-ERR2) Cross section errors were given by authors.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were presented by authors (fig.1 (a)).
