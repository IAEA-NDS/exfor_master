DETECTOR   Angular dependencies of differential cross section
           were measured in an independent experiment using a
           detector arranged outside the scattering chamber with
           an angular resolution of (+ -1) degr.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) The error in the absolute values of the
           cross sections was about 10% and was determined
           primarily by the errors in estimating target thickness
           and in calibrating the current integrator. The
           uncertainty in target thickness was 5%.
           (ERR-S,,8.) Statistical error

DETECTOR   (SIBAR)Protons were recorded by four surface barrier
           silicon detectors with the thickness of sensitive
           region up to 350 mu-m. The angular resolution of the
           detectors was (+ -2) degr.
           (SCIN)Gamma-quanta were detected by four
           scintillation detectors with NaI(TI) crystals
           arranged at a fixed angular spacing of 32.5 degr. on
           a moving horizontal ring platform outside the
           scattering chamber.
