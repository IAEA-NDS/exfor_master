FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)Telescope consisted of six silicon detectors
           for E(alpha)=75,90 and 115 MeV, and of five silicon
           detectors for E(alpha)=30 and 50 MeV. Detector assembly
           was placed at the distance of 60 cm from scattering
           target and at the angle of 20 degrees to beam axis
           inside of a big scattering chamber. The thicknesses of
           dE - detectors were from 50 to 380 mu-m.
           Aluminum diaphragm of 5 mm thickness and inner diameter
           of 10 mm limited the angle spread of scattered
           particles to 1 degr. Energy spread of scattered 4He
           ions was about 400 keV at different beam energies.
METHOD     (TRN) Method of attenuation of alpha particle beam
           was used.
           (EDE) Particle determination was performed using the
           results of the energy losses in delta E counters.
SAMPLE     208Pb with the thickness of 4mg/cm2 was used to scatter
           the He-4 ions. One of the silicon detectors was used
           as a target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Errors indicated include statistical errors
           and the uncertainties related to the way of event
           discrimination.
           (EN-ERR)Errors are determined by the energy loss in
           detectors and by the widths of energy distributions.
