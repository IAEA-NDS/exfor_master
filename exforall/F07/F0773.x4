FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)Telescope consisted of six silicon detectors
           for E(alpha)=75,90 and 115 MeV, and of five silicon
           detectors for E(alpha)=30 and 50 MeV. Detector assembly
           was placed at the distance of 60 cm from scattering
           target and at the angle of 20 degrees to beam axis
           inside of a big scattering chamber. The thicknesses of
           dE - detectors were from 50 to 380 mu-m.
           Aluminum diaphragm of 5 mm thickness and inner diameter
           of 10 mm limited the angle spread of scattered
           particles to 1 degr. Energy spread of scattered 4He
           ions was about 400 keV at different beam energies.
METHOD     (EDE)
SAMPLE     The thickness of the 208Pb was 4mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Errors indicated include statistical errors
           and the uncertainties related to the way of event
           discrimination.
           (EN-ERR)Errors are determined by the energy loss in
           detectors and by the widths of energy distributions.
