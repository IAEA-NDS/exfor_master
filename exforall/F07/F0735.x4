FACILITY   (VDGT)The pulsed tandem accelerator EGP-15 of IPPE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)Neutrons were detected by scintillation detector
           with a stilbene crystal (d=40 mm, h=40 mm) and by
           photomultiplier.
SAMPLE     The target was self-supporting metallic foil (4.98 mg/
           cm2 thickness) with  98.7% enrichment of 118Sn.
METHOD     (TOF)
ERR-ANALYS (E-ERR-DIG) Digitizing error
           (ERR-DIG)   Digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR)  Error from the graphic bars
