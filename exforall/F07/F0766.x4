DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)The detectors of the telescope besides for
           registration of the reaction products simultaneously
           played the role of active targets and energy degraders.
           The telescope dE1-dE2-E, consisting of 63,115,
           and 450 mu-m thick Se detectors, was mounted on a
           rotatable platform, the angle of which with respect to
           the beam direction was remotely controlled.
MONITOR    (82-PB-208(A,EL)82-PB-208,,DA) 4He ions elastically
           scattered at 40 degrees on 208Pb target (2.3 mg/cm2
           thick).
