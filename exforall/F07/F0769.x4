FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)Silicon detector of sandwich type was used.
           The working area of the detector was ~ 3 cm2 and the
           total length of the telescope was 10 cm. Telescope
           detectors had different thicknesses from 400-1200 mu-m
           measured with the accuracy of 3 mu-m.
SAMPLE     Thick beryllium target (140 mg/cm2) was used to obtain
           the secondary beam of He-6 ions for silicon irradiation
           Telescope detectors served as a target; they detected
           reaction products and reduced the energy of 6He ions.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
           (DATA-ERR) Error in cross section definition was
           determined by statistical errors, accuracy of
           detector thickness measurement and accuracy of
           discrimination of events related to nuclear reactions
           in the couple of detectors under study.
HISTORY    (20060420C)
           (20101001A) REACTION code in Sub 003,004 was changed.
           Target description in sub 001 was changed. MONITOR
           record was removed. METHOD code in Sub 003,004 was
           added.
           (20180705A) Reference code was added.

REACTION   (14-SI-28(A,NON),,SIG)
METHOD     (TRN) Method of attenuation of alpha particle beam
           was used. Telescope detectors were used as a target,
           a detector and an energy absorber of incident ions.
           Total cross section was determined by the following
           way. Events in which the studied nucleus passed
           through the telescope to the full stop due to the
           ionizing losses only were subtracted from the whole
           data array of particular nucleus. As a result in data
           array only the events related to the nuclear
           reactions and inelastic scattering of the studied
           nucleus on silicon were kept.
           (EDE) Particle determination was performed using the
           results of the energy losses in delta E counters.
