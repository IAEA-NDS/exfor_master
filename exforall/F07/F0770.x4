             data used for completeness.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) The secondary beam was obtained with
           ionic-optical system of beam transfer
            (Q4DQ-spectrometer).
DETECTOR   (PS,PPAC)Checking of sizes and quality of the secondary
           beam and its monitoring was performed with position
           sensitive parallel-grid  avalanche counters and
           semiconductor silicon detectors. The energy spread of
           the secondary beam was +- 0.6 MeV.
           (SOLST) The detectors were used to measure excitation
           function and to detect fission fragments.
           (SIBAR)
SAMPLE     Targets of 209Bi (700 mu-g/cm2) were placed at the
           secondary beam of 6He. The targets were prepared
           by vacuum evaporation of metallic bismuth onto polymer
           backing of 2.5 mu-m thickness.
