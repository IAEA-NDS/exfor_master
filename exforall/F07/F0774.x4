DETECTOR   (TELES,SI) Reaction products were detected by telescope
           consisted of silicon counters with the thicknesses of
           30 mu-m (deltaE - detector of ionizing losses) and of
           1.2 mm (E-detector of total absorption)included into
           spectrometric system of multivariate analysis. The
           solid angle was 1.3*10**(-4) sr.
SAMPLE     Two self-supporting titanium foils with the same
           thickness of 5.1 mg/cm2, one of which was saturated by
           tritium, were used as targets. Tritium content in the
           Ti-T irradiated foil was 38.4%.
ADD-RES    Resonance states with E=3.6+-0.3 MeV and E~11.8 MeV of
           two neutron system were investigated.

EN-SEC     (E,N+N) Energy of 2N nuclear system for the ground
           state of 2N and resonance at 3.6 MeV is given. Authors
           define a ground state as a state where the energy of
           neutron relative movement in 0-NN-2 system is equal
           to 0.
