COMMENT    Scattered protons were detected at four different
           angles ranging from 90 to 150 degr. The different
           proton spectra associated with a particular angle were
           summed after corrections for kinematic shift.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A surface barrier particle detector placed at
           an angle of 120 degr. with respect to the direction of
           the incident beam was used.
           (GELI) Coincident gamma rays were detected with a 70
           cm3 Ge(Li) detector placed at 90 degr. with respect to
           the average direction of motion of recoiling residual
           nuclei.
SAMPLE     A target of 106 mu-g/cm2 potassium iodide (enriched
           to >99% 39K) evaporated onto a thin carbon backing
           was used.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties in the values of
           experimental average total cross sections are mainly
           due to the Finite Range of Data Error (FRD).

DETECTOR   Charged particles were detected with a 700 mu-m Si
           annular surface barrier detector placed at 180 degr.
           with respect to the beam direction. The effective
           detection angle was 172.5+-4.0 degr. A monitor charged
           particle detector was placed at 125 degr. with respect
           to the beam direction for dead time and target pressure
           variation corrections.
           (GELI) Gamma rays coincident with protons at 180 degr.
           were detected with a 70cm3 Ge(Li)-detector at six
           different angles evenly spaced in cos**2(theta) between
            0 and 90 degr.
METHOD     (BCINT)
SAMPLE     A gas sell constructed of aluminium and containing
           argon (enriched to 99.5% 36Ar) at a pressure of 200-300
           mbar, served as target.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for diffusion of air into the gas
           cell, or argon into the target chamber and for the
           attenuation of gamma radiation as a function of
           detection angle.
