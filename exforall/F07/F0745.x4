TITLE      Angular distribution for the 7Be(d,n)8B reaction at
           Ec.m.=5.8 MeV and the S17(0) factor for the 7Be(p,g)8B
           reaction.

DETECTOR   (TELES,PS)The reaction products were detected and
           identified using a dE-E counter telescope.It consisted
           of a 9 cm long ionization chamber filled with 75 torr
           P-10 gas backed by a 45*45 mm2 Hamamatsu twodimensional
           position sensitive silicon detector (PSSD) of 450
           micro-m in thickness.The distance between the reaction
           target and PSSD was 10 cm.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (BCINT)
SAMPLE     The 7Be beam with energy of 26.0 MeV was produced via
           the 1H(7Li,7Be)n reaction by bombarding a 2H gas cell
           at 1.2 atm pressure with 34 MeV 7Li ions from HI-13
           tandem accelerator. A deuterated polyethylene [(CD2)n]
           foil of 0.97 mg/cm**2 in thickness was used as the
           secondary target to study the reaction, and a
           polyethylene [(CH2)n] foil was used to determine the
           background.
ANALYSIS   The angular distribution data were analyzed with the
           distorted-wave Born approximation calculation.
ERR-ANALYS The error mainly stemmed from statistics (9%),
           background subtraction (7%), as well as target
           thickness (6%).
