INC-SPECT  Current of the bunched triton beam was held below 4 nA.
SAMPLE     Water target was solid (ice) in a thin-walled stainless
           steel cup with one face in direct contact with the
           accelerator vacuum. Cooling the target from the
           outside by direct contact with liquid nitrogen in a
           small cryostat of styrofoam maintened the solid phase
           of the water.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2x2 in.liquid scintillator (NE213) was used.
METHOD     (TOF) Two pulse-height biases were used simultaneously
            (Compton edge of 137Cs and of 22Na). The flight path
           was 3.53 m, the total time resolution was 2.1 ns.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were derived from the high-energy
           portions of the yield curves.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(T,N)2-HE-3,,DA) By comparing the measured yield
           from this reaction with the calculated yield the
           experimental setup was calibrated. Standard gas targets
           were used.
           Energy dependence of the efficiency of the neutron
           detector was determined by measuring neutron yields of
           the reactions 2H(t,n)4He and 1H(t,n)3He at about 30
           energy points between 2.2 and 36.9 MeV and comparing
           them with well-known cross sections.
CORRECTION The attenuation correction due to nonelastic processed
           is quite small and introduces negligible errors.
           However, multiple scattering in the target and its
           structure which was not corrected for is estimated to
           affect the data by as much as 4%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors from table are from counting
           statistics only.
           Common scale error is composed of 3.5% calibration
           error, the current integrator calibration error (<0.5%)
           and the systematic portion of the attenuation error
            (<0.5%), adding up to about 4%.
           Uncertainty of the specific energy loss of the tritons
           in water contributes to the common scale error.
           Uncertainty of the zero-degree position was +-0.2
           degree.
           Uncertainties in the integrated charge and in the dead
           time were each < 0.5%.
