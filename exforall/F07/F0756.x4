INC-SOURCE 7Li-ion beam at intensities up to 70 nA.
           The energy spreading of the beam was about
           10**(-4) and the spot on target, after collimation,
           had a diameter of ~1.5 mm.
DETECTOR   (SI) A silicon dE-E detector placed at a distance
           d=50.5 cm from the target and at 18.5 degr. with
           respect to the beam axis was used to detect the
           elastically scattered particles, thus allowing for a
           continuous monitoring of the target thickness during
           the measurement.
           (PS) Detection of the outgoing alpha particles has
           therefore been performed by using six (50*10)mm
           silicon position sensitive detectors (PSD),three at
           each side of the beam axis. Detectors have been
           centered at fixed angles 44,34,23,45,55 and 65 degr.,
           respectively, for the PSD1,PSD2,PSD3,PSD4,PSD5,and
           PSD6; the monitor was fixed at 18 degr. Detectors PSD1
           and PSD4 were placed at a distance d=70 cm so as
           to compare the data taken from this experiment with
           those of the previous experiment. All other detectors
           were placed closer to the target in order to increase
           their solid angles, which then rose from ~1 msr (of
           detectors PSD1 and PSD4) to ~2.5 msr for detectors PSD2
           PSD3,PSD5, and PSD6. Coincidences were carried out
           between each pair of PSD's placed on opposite side of
           the beam direction.
           Energy calibration was performed by means of a standard
           three-peak alpha source at energies of 5.155, 5.484,
           and 5.806 MeV. At higher energies the elastic
           scattering of 7Li on CD2 and Au targets was employed at
           beam energies of about 15, 20, and 25 MeV.
SAMPLE     A deuterated polyethylene target was placed at 10 degr.
           with respect to the beam. During the experiment four
           different targets had to be used because of
           deterioration problems; their thicknesses were
           determined using an Am source.
