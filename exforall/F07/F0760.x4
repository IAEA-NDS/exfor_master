FACILITY   (VDGT,4RUSEPA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Detector was surrounded by cylindrical lead
           shield with the outer diameter of 105 mm and the wall
           thickness of 5 mm. The distance from target center to
           edge surface of the detector crystal was 94 mm.
           16384-channel spectrometric analyzer MCB-921E was used.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
SAMPLE     The target was prepared by evaporation of metallic
           beryllium of high purification onto tantalum backing
           with the thickness of 300 mu-m. The weigh of target
           layer was 93.5+-2.8 mu-g/cm2. The target was placed in
           cylinder scattering chamber made from steel with the
           wall thickness of 1 mm at an angle of 45+-0.5 degrees
           with respect to the beam direction.

HISTORY    (20060502C)
           (20100205A) Digitized data in Sub003 were replaced
           with tabular data. Units in Sub003 were corrected: mb
           was changed to micro-b. Sub 004 and 005 were added.
           (20220408A) Error presentation was changed. Data in
           sub 002 were superseded.
