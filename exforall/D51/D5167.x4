SAMPLE     The strontium targets were polystyrene films
           impregnated with SrC03. The tin isotope targets were
           free-standing foils 3-4 mg/cm2 thick with 90%
           enrichment.
METHOD     (EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS No information.
COMMENT    The authors do not specify the target nuclide of each
           dataset, so the presented in Fig.1 data were not
           compiled in EXFOR
