SAMPLE     (2-HE-3,ENR=0.98) A cylindrical gaseous target 50 mm
           in diameter, with an entrance section 100 mm long,
           was placed in a vacuum chamber. Entrance and exit
           windows for the beam and for the reaction products
           were fabricated from 2-mu-m nickel foil or 8-mu-m
           aluminum foil. The target was filled with gaseous 3He
            (98% enrichment) to a pressure of 200 Torr.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Silicon semiconductor telescopes (the
           thickness of the deltaE spectrometer was 50 mu-m, and
           that of the E spectrometer could be varied to 4 mm).
           Collimation for the telescopes was provided by a
           system of rectangular slits, which set the aperture
           angle at +-0.4 degree. The energy resolution of the
           telescope for the deuterons was about 140 keV.
ERR-ANALYS No information on uncertainties
ANALYSIS   For determining the positions of the 5Li levels, the
           energy of the beam alpha particles at the center of
           the gaseous target was found experimentally within l%
           by comparing the kinematic curves Ep(theta) for the
           reactions 3He(alpha,p)6Li and 1H(alpha,p) , which
           were detected simultaneously with deuterons in the
           experiment.
ADD-RES    (STRUC) The 5Li ground state lies at E=1.93+-0.21 MeV
           and has a half-width 1.9+-0.25 MeV in the c.m. frame
           of the 4He+p pair; the first excited state of the
           nucleus 5Li lies at E=4.74+-0.22 MeV in the c.m.
           frame of the 4He+p pair. This position corresponds to
           an excitation energy E=2.82+-0.35 MeV in the 5Li
           nucleus with a half-width 1.64+-0.25 MeV.
