INSTITUTE  (4UKRKFT)
FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRKFT) The electrostatic generator
DETECTOR   The positrons were recorded with a tube electrometer,
           assembled with an EM-3 electronic tube, which was
           placed in a vacuum.
           The basic parts of the apparatus are the following:
           a) Faraday cylinder, which was used in a dual
           capacity: first, to measure the current passing
           through it to make sure it was not entering through
           the side walls of the cylinder; secondly, to permit
           the introduction through lead of a retarding
           potential for stopping the electrons knocked out of
           the target by the beam; b) collecting electrode
            (collector), which was used to collect the positrons
           emitted by the target.
SAMPLE     Thick targets of natural carbon
METHOD     (ACTIV,BSPEC)
ADD-RES    12C(p,g)13N yield plotted in Fig.3 of JETP 5(1957)201,
            which was not digitized because the numbers printed
            on the y-axis lead to negative yield values.
