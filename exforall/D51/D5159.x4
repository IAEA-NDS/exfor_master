FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRKFT)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC) The protons scattered by the helium were
           registered with telescopes of proportional counters
           and photomultipliers.
SAMPLE     The gas target was a cylinder 30 mm long. On the side
           surface of the cylinder there is a window covered with
           a thin mica foil.
METHOD     (EXTB) A deuteron beam of specified energy from an
           electrostatic accelerator entered a chamber with He3
           gas through a nickel foil.
           (DSCAT) A helium polarimeter was used to measure the
           polarization. The helium pressure in the sensitive
           volume of the polarimeter was 5 atm.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) In calculating the measurement errors account
           was taken in the calculations of the statistical
           errors only.
