INSTITUTE  (4UKRKFT)
FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRKFT)  The 4-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator
DETECTOR   (CSICR) The scattered protons were recorded with a
           CsI(Tl) crystal 0.1 mm thick and a  FEU-S photo-
           multiplier. The energy resolution of the spectrometer
           was 6% for Ep= 2 MeV.
           (NAICR) The  gamma-rays were recorded by a pair of
           FEU-S photomultipliers with  NaI(Tl)crystals of
           dimensions 40x40 mm. One of them was held fixed,
           while the other rotated around the target. Pulses from
           the fixed photomultiplier entered a  single-channel
           analyzer which gave the full absorption peak which
           corresponded to an energy Eg=1.64 MeV. This
           photomultiplier was used as a monitor. The resolution
           of the spectrometer for the Cs137 gamma-rays was 9%.
SAMPLE     A chamber 15 mm in diameter, filled with a  normal
           isotopic mixture of neon (91% Ne-20) at a pressure of
           8 mm Hg.
ADD-RES    (COMP,STRUC) The partial widths and reduced widths for
           the 4.5- and 5.05-MeV levels of Na-21 were determined.
