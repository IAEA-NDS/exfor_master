TITLE      First excited state of He-5

SAMPLE     Two targets: one made from natural lithium (7.5% Li6)
           was about 0.03 mg/cm2 thick, and the other was pure Li7
           about 0.3 mg/cm2 thick. Both targets were prepared by
           evaporating metallic lithium from a graphite-sleeved
           molybdenum crucible on to 0.075-mil nickel foils.
METHOD     (PHD)
FACILITY   (VDG)
DETECTOR   (SOLST)RCA Victor silicon P-N junction alpha detectors
           with 10**3 omega cm nominal resistivity.
