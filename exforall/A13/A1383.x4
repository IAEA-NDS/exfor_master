TITLE      Li(d,alpha) reactions at deuteron energies between 175
           and 300 KeV

SAMPLE     Thick targets of natural lithium
FACILITY   (VDG)
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
COMMENT    Conclusions: the differential cross section for the
            Li-7(D,A) reaction at 90 degrees was determined by
           relatively simple thick target method, using state
           detectors. The energy dependance of the cross section
           was found to agree with that for the formation of the
           compound nucleus, in the energy range 175-300 KeV.
