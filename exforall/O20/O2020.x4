SAMPLE     Enriched Zn-70 metal was obtained in the form of an
           electrolytically deposited sheet of 99.8% purity with
           less than 10 ppm of Cu impurity content. It was
           enriched to 95.35%, with isotopic impurities of 4.49%
           Zn-68, 0.16% Zn-67 and less than 0.02% each of Zn-64
           and Zn-66. The 0.5 mm thick sheet was divided into
           several smaller pieces, which were cold-rolled to form
           foils of approximately 12 mum thickness. Ti foils of
           12 mum and 99.6% purity were used for beam current
           monitoring together with 10-20 mum Al catchers and
           degraders.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors.
           Primary beam energy straggling is estimated to be less
           than 0.5%, and the uncertainty propagated within the
           stacks up to 5%.
           (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.
           Overall cross-section uncertainty estimates ranged from
            7 to 16%, except for the lowest energy data point
           which had an uncertainty of 28%
