SAMPLE     Enriched Zn-70 metal was obtained in the form of an
           electrolytically deposited sheet of 99.8% purity with
           less than 10 ppm of Cu impurity content. It was
           enriched to 95.35%, with isotopic impurities of 4.49%
           Zn-68, 0.16% Zn-67 and less than 0.02% each of Zn-64
           and Zn-66. The 0.5 mm thick sheet was divided into
           several smaller pieces, which were cold-rolled to form
           foils of approximately 12 mum thickness. Ti foils of
           12 mum and 99.6% purity were used for beam current
           monitoring together with 10-20 mum Al catchers and
           degraders.
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(P,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,CHSEP)
COMMENT    From Dr. J.Kozempel (2014-08-21): For beam monitoring,
           we used both monitor reaction on Ti foil (48-V) and a
           Faraday cup, so we detected 0, 34 uA using monitor
           reaction and 0, 31 uA using Faraday cup. For the yield
           calculation the 0, 31 uA value was used. In any case we
           expect the overall beam current uncertainty to be
           around 10%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).Counting uncertainty including detector
           calibration, geometry and statistical deviations is 12%
           (ERR-2).Error in foil thicknesses is 6.5%.
           (ERR-3).Error in decay time is 0.1%.
           (ERR-4).Error in beam current is 10%.
           (ERR-5).Error in separation yield is 5%.
