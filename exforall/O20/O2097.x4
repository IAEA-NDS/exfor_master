METHOD     (COINC)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) the triple coincidence counter
           telescope
CORRECTION The corrected cross section is derived from
           larger angle scattering and absorption processes.
SAMPLE     A vertical polythene rod of 2 mm square cross section
           was used as T1. The target T2 intercepted protons which
           were scattered inwards by Ti and reduced the background
           in the region of the counters. The thickness of each
           absorber was about 20 g/cm**2 and was known to an
           accuracy of better than 1%. The impurity in each
           absorber was less than 0.506 by weight. The thickness
           was chosen by estimating the contribution to the cross
           section by multiple and single Coulomb scattering and
           by considering the statistical accuracy obtainable in
           the available running time. For the lighter elements
           the thickness was limited by the uncertainty in the
           solid angle subtended by the fourth counter.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table-The errors quoted are the standard deviations in
           the cross sections due to statistical errors in the
           triple and quadruple counts.
