SAMPLE     A thin tungsten target and refocused on to a stacked
           foil target of beryllium  and carbon plates,
           1/2 in.*1/2 in. *1/8 in. were used.
COMMENT    *By author*. Since the same active isotope Be-7 was
           being counted in the beryllium  and carbon  targets in
           identical geometry, the absolute efficiency of the
           counter was not needed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           on figure are relative and arise from errors in the
           monitor reaction and statistical counting errors. In
           addition to these, there is an overall uncertainty of
           8% due to uncertainties in the C-11 half-life, the Be-7
           branching ratio and the gamma-ray efficiency ratio of
           the Geiger counter used in the 6-C-12(P,3N+3P)4-BE-7
           reaction.
