FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL)
INC-SOURCE (P-T)Neutrons of energy between 0.4 and 3.4 MeV
           generated with proton beams incident on tritiated
           titanium target assembly
           (D-D)Neutrons of energy between 4.1 and 7.0 MeV
           generated with deuteron beams incident on deuterium gas
           cell
           (D-T)Neutrons of energy 14.8 MeV generated with
           deuteron beam incident on tritiated titanium target
           assembly
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (SCIN)BC-501A neutron monitor detector
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation for 2 hours and counting of Ar cell
           was performed for 12 hours
SAMPLE     A stainless steel sphere with inner diameter of 20 mm
           and wall thickness of 0.5 mm contained argon gas of
           mass of 1.585g and pressurized to 210 atm enclosed with
           a Cd foil of thickness 0.5 mm.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)The intensity of 1293.64 keV gamma-ray line was
           measured over a time period of more than three
           half-lives and half-life was confirmed.
