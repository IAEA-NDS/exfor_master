INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Los Alamos fast reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford C2 nuclear emulsion plates.
SAMPLE     A nickel-coated disk sample of 239Pu having
           dimensions of 0.5-in. diameter and 0.125-in. thick.
METHOD     (REC) The los Alamos Water boiler provided a 2-in
           diameter thermal neutron beam. The C2 nuclear
           emulsions plates were placed at right angles to the
           beam at a distance of 20 cm from the plutonium
           sample. A 35-hr irradiation at a power of 5.5 kW gave
           suitable proton recoil track density in nuclear
           plates. The data were accumulated from a total of
           5500 proton recoil tracks.
ANALYSIS   The measured relative neutron intensity, N(E), was
           given as function of the neutron energy, E; the
           tracks per unit energy interval have been divided by
           the scattering cross section of hydrogen, sigma p,
           corrected for tracks leaving the emulsion surfaces.
           Unfortunately, this method does not allow to
           discriminate between prompt and delayed neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details are given.
