           112 MeV and energy integrated cross section
           measurements (0.1 < En < 750 MeV) for the neutron
           induced reactions O(n,x)10Be, Si(n,x)10Be, and

            Monitor reaction cross section data at 71 and 112 MeV
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Energy integrated cross sections were
           measured at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center,
           Los Alamos National Laboratory New Mexico using
            white neutron beams
           (CYCLO,3SAFITH) Measurements with quasi-monoenergetic
           neutrons were performed at iThemba LABS cyclotron,
           Somerset West, South Africa
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Short lived nuclides were measured using high
           purity Ge detectors.

SAMPLE     SiO2 sample with 99.9% purity and dimensions 5 x 5 cm2
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) Irradiations performed at 0 deg and 16 deg. At
           0 deg there are two components in neutron spectrum -
           a high energy peak and a low energy tail. The
           spectrum at 16 deg has only low energy tail, similar
           to the tail at 0 deg.
METHOD     Irradiations at iTL were made simultaneously at 0 deg
           and 16 deg. Cross section at specific energy was
           obtained by subtracting the yield measured at 16 deg
            (after normalization) from the yield measured at 0deg.
