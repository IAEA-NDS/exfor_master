FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL)Experiment performed using pulsed
           deuteron beam from the FN Tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator at TUNL
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene foil with a circular cross
           section with diameter of 25.4 mm. Thickness of the foil
           was 22.4 mg/cm2 at 16 MeV and 29.8 mg/cm2 at 19 MeV.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) dE detector consisted of a 4.7-
           mg/cm2-thick BC-404 plastic scintillator coupled to a
           Hamamatsu 1949-51 photomultiplier tube. The E
           detector in each arm consisted of a 10-cm-diameter by
           5-mm-thick disk of BC-404 plastic scintillator
           coupled to a Hamamatsu H6527 PMT. The front face of
           the scintillator was located 61 cm from the dE
           detector. Two telescopes were used in the experiment.
           (SCIN) Neutron detectors used BC-501A liquid organic
           scintillator in aluminum cylinder with diameter of
           12.68 cm and length of 5.08 cm. The scintillator was
           directly coupled to a 12.7 cm diameter model R1250
           Hamamatsu photomultiplier. Polar angles of four
           neutron detectors were approximatelly 18 and 51 deg.
           and azimuthal angles were 0, 60, 120 and 180 deg.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between one neutron and a proton
            detector was required
           (EDE) E-dE method was used to identify protons
           (TOF) Neutron and proton energies were determined by
           time of flight. The deuteron beam was chopped and
           bunched at a rate of 78.1 kHz into packets with a
           width of ns. Time signal was taken from a capacitive
           pickoff unit located before the gas cell and served as
           a start signal for neutron time of flight measurement.
           Proton energy was measured from proton flight time
           between dE and E detectors
INC-SOURCE (D-D) neutrons are produced in deuterium gas cell
           located inside the shielding wall. The neutron
           production gas cell was a copper tube with a 0.5-mm
           thick gold beam stop soldered to one end and a
           6.35 mu-m thick Havar beam-entrance foil on the other
           end. The gas chamber within the cell was 71.4 mm long
           and filled to 7.8 atm with 99.99% pure research grade
           deuterium gas. The neutron beam was shaped by a 115 cm
           long copper collimator with a circular cross section.

COMMENT      ANG1 Polar angle of the neutron detector
             ANG2 Polar angle of the proton detector
ANALYSIS   For reaction with three emitted particles it is
           sufficient to detect two particles (e.g. one neutron
           and one proton) at defined positions, the energy and
           momentum of the third particle can be calculated from
           kinematics. Therefore it is necessary to fix relative
           angular position of two detectors using polar angle of
           both detectors and their relative azimuthal angle.
           The star condition is fulfilled for specific neutron
           energy.
