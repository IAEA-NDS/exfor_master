DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutron detector system consists of two Eljen
           Technology Model 510-50X70X138/301 EJ-301 liquid
           scintillator modules. Each module has an inner vol-
           ume dimension of 17.78 cm high, 35.05 cm long and
           12.7 cm thick. Two Photonis XP4572B photomultiplier
           tubes are mounted on each module to optimize light
           collection throughout the detector volume. Two
           modules are stacked on top of each other to give a
           total detection area of 35.56 cm high by 35.05 cm wide.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission method was used to determine total
           cross section
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutrons were produced using a pulsed
           electron beam from the linear accelerator striking
           the water cooled tantalum plates in the neutron
           producing target. The high energy electrons from the
           linear accelerator generate bremsstrahlung X-rays
           within the target which interact with the tantalum to
           produce photoneutrons. The RPI target was placed
           on-axis with the flight tube and was used without a
           moderator to enhance neutron production in the energy
           range of interest. The repetition rate was 400 pulses
           per second with a pulse width of approximately 8
           nsec. The average electron current on the target was
           about 5 mu-A with energy of 58 MeV.
