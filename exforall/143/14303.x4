FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL)The measurements were performed with
           the pulse-beam neutron time-of-flight technique using
           FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at TUNL
SAMPLE     Natural Ca Target with mass of 2.575g, diameter of
           12.7mm and height of approx. 12 mm
DETECTOR   (SCIN)Scattered neutrons were detected in two heavily
           shielded NE-218 liquid-scintillator detectors located
           in the horizontal reaction plane and at distances of
           3.75 and 2.29 m from the target. Detector diameter
           and thickness were 8.8 cm, 5cm and 12.5 cm, 5 cm,
           respectively. Third scintillation detector with
           diameter of 5 cm and thickness of 5cm located at 0deg
           was used for flux monitoring.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Measured sample was located 12.9 cm
           downstream of the neutron source in a He ballon
           structure of radius 7.6 cm and height 22.9 cm. He gas
           was used to prevent sample oxidation and to reduce
           neutron scattering in the sample vicinity.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)Unpolarized deuteron beams of energies 14.4 and
           9.39 MeV were extracted from the FN tandem Van de
           Graaff accelerator. The beams were pulsed at 2 MHz
           with a pulse width of 2.0 ns and had time-averaged
           intensities of 1.5 nA. The beam traversed a 5.27mg/cm2
           Havar foil to enter a 3.16-cm deuterium-filled gas cell
           that was held at pressure of 7.8 bar.
CORRECTION Data corrected for finite sample size and multiple
           scattering. Corrections were calculated with the
           help of GEANT4 simulations.
