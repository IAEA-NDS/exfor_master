INC-SOURCE (D-D) 2H(d,n)3He reaction was used to produce quasi
           monoenergetic neutrons between 8 and 14.5 MeV.
           Typical deuteron beam currents on target were 2 mu-
           A. The target consisted of a 3 cm long and 1 cm
           diameter cylindrical gas cell made of thin-walled
           stainless steel and filled with high-purity deuterium
           gas. The deuterium gas pressure was adjusted between
           3 atm at the lowest energy and 4.6 atm at the highest
           energy to provide the desired neutron energy spread
           in the energy range investigated.
           (D-T) 2H(t,n)4He reaction was used for measurement at
                 14.8 MeV

ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined relative to two monitor
           reactions up to incident energy of  12 MeV. Monitor
           reaction cross section was interpolated to the energy
           where the cross section was measured. Up to energy of
           12 MeV the final cross section was determined as
           average of two cross sections, obtained for each
           monitor reaction.
