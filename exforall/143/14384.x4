FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the 800 MeV
           proton linac of the Lujan Neutron Scattering Center
           at LANSCE
SAMPLE     Thin deposit containing 1mg of 238U. Sample was
           placed inside of the ionization chamber.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Neutron detector consists of 30 cylindrical 3He
           proportional counters arranged in two concentric
           rings within a high-density polyethylene matrix.
           Twelve 3He tubes with a diameter of 2.54cm,an active
           length of 30 cm and 10 bar of gas pressure, and
           eighteen tubes with a diameter of 2.54cm, an active
           length of 45cm and 4 bar of gas pressure were used in
           this setup. The inner detector ring corresponds to a
           13.5 cm radius and is composed of twelve high
           pressure and six low pressure tubes.The twelve
           remaining lower pressure tubes constitute the second
           ring which has a 19 cm radius. The polyethylene
           matrix is a rectangular block with a square section
           of 50 cm side and 75 cm long
           (IOCH) Both fission fragments were detected by a
           double Frisch- gridded ionization chamber, with
           contained 238U sample
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of primary neutrons was determined by time
           of flight. Neutron flight path was about 10 m. The
           proton beam was delivered in subnanosecond micropulses
           emitted every 1.8 mu-s within macropulses of 625 mu-s
           long at a 40Hz repetition rate
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation neutrons were produced by a pulsed
           800 MeV proton beam with a repetition rate of 20 Hz
           impinging on a pair of tungsten targets. Neutrons are
           reflected by the moderator and travel down a 20.2-m
           flight path to the target location.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
ANALYSIS   Prompt fission neutron multiplicity is given by the
           integral of the background subtracted spectrum
           divided by the detection efficiency.
