METHOD     (CHSEP) In the determination of the independent
           fission yield of a given tin isotope, the separated
           tin was allowed to decay to its known iodine
           descendent. The tin was then dissolved in cold 50%
           H2SO4 containing a measured amount of iodine carrier.
           The amount of iodine found is a direct measure of the
           amount of tin originally present. The chemical yield
           of tin (which varied between 10 and 14%) was
           determined by counting the added tin-113 tracer after
           allowing the fission product tin and its daughters to
           decay to an insignificant level of activity. The
           interference of the tin-113 produced from the tin-112
           in the tin carrier amounted to only 10**-3
           disintegrations per second.
