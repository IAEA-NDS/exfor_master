FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the
           spallation neutron source at LANSCE Weapons Neutron
           Research (WNR) facility, driven by 800-MeV linear
           proton accelerator.
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.998) Depleted 238U sample with
            thickness of 42mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (BAF2)Gamma rays were detected by DANCE - a 4Pi
           calorimetric gamma-ray detector. It consists of 160
           BaF2 crystals, each about 0.75 l in volume and 15 cm
           long. The face of each crystal is 17 cm from the
           sample center.The beam spot at the sample location is
           about 1 cm in diameter. The sample is surrounded by a
           6 cm thick 6LiH sphere to attenuate neutrons
           scattered from the sample.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to determine energy
           of incident neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)Spallation reaction of tungsten target by 800
           MeV protons was used as neutron source. A water
           moderator shapes the neutron spectrum. The beam spot
           at the sample location was about 1 cm in diameter. The
           sample was surrounded by a 6 cm thick 6LiH sphere to
           attenuate neutrons scattered from the sample.
