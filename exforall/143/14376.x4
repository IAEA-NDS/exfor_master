SAMPLE     (26-FE-54,ENR=0.96) F-82H alloy composition is 7.1Cr-
           1.8W-0.55Si-0.40Mn-0.17V-0.1C-0.04Ta. 54Fe in the
           alloy compromised  96% of the iron or 86% of the total
           alloy by weight.

METHOD     (AMS) Alloy samples were analyzed for helium content at
           Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The helium
           content of each specimen was determined by
           isotope-dilution gas mass spectroscopy following
           vaporization in a high-temperature vacuum furnace.
           Hydrogen measurements were performed using a newly
           developed quadrupole mass spectrometer system at PNNL.
           An early experiment showed that the
           accelerated He(appm)/dpa ratio of about 2.3 was
           achieved for 96% enriched 54Fe in iron in the High
           Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), ORNL. Finally, the
           ferritic steel He(appm)/dpa ratio was studied in the
           neutron spectrum of HFIR with the 55Fe thermal
           neutron helium production taken into account. A
           benchmark calculation for the same sample, as used in
           the aforementioned experiment, was then used to
           adjust and evaluate the 55Fe(n,a) cross section
           values in TALYS-based Evaluated Nuclear Data Library.
ANALYSIS   Results were, initially, compared to
           calculations using isotopic helium production cross
           sections from ENDF/B-VI or GNASH and measured neutron
           spectra. Finally, the analysis of the benchmark TENDL
           calculation showed that a decrease of a factor of
           6700 for the TENDL 55Fe(n,a) cross section in the
           intermediate and low energy regions was required in
           order to fit the experimental results. The best fit
           to the cross section value at thermal neutron energy
           was about 27 mb. With the adjusted 55Fe(n,a) cross
           sections, calculation showed that the 54Fe and 55Fe
           isotopes could be enriched by the isotopic tailoring
           technique in a ferritic steel sample irradiated in
           HFIR to significantly enhance the helium production
           rate. This new calculation can be used to guide
           future isotopic tailoring experiments designed to
           increase the He(appm)/dpa ratio in fission reactors.
