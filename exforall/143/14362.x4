FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment was carried out at the Los
           Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) at the Los
           Alamos National Laboratory
SAMPLE     Cryogenic target cell containing either liquid
           deuterium (LD2) or liquid hydrogen (LH2). The target
           was located approximately 18 m from the spallation
           source. The target cell consisted of a horizontal
           cylindrical disk of 1.3 cm in thickness and 12.7 cm
           in diameter, with 51 mu-m Aramica entrance and exit
           windows. Target was rotated at an angle of 50deg with
           respect to the incident neutron beam to provide an
           optimum path for the outgoing charged particles.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) Protons and deuterons were
           detected by six telescopes, each consisting of a thin
           dE plastic scintillator backed by a pure CsI
           calorimeter. These detectors were positioned with
           their front faces 100 cm from the center of the
           target, at mean laboratory angles of theta(lab) = 24,
           30, 36, 42, 48 and 54deg. The dE scintillators were
           0.25 cm in thickness and dimensions 10 x 10 cm**2
           provided accurate information on the particle time of
           flight. The CsI calorimeters were 30 cm in depth and
           provided a measure of both the particle energy and
           its arrival time.
           (SCIN) The scattered neutrons were detected with five
           plastic scintillator bars, each 10 cm high, 10 cm
           thick and 200 cm wide. The bars were stacked
           vertically to form a wall 200 cm wide and 50 cm high.
           Photomultiplier tubes were attached to the ends of
           each bar to allow both the neutron hit position and
           its time-of-flight to be determined. The center of
           the neutron wall was positioned at a distance of 1.32
           m from the target and spanned a laboratory angle
           range from 34deg to 108deg.
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of incident as well as scattered
           neutrons were measured using time of flight method.
           (EDE) Charged particles were identified using E-dE
           method.
           (COINC) Coincidence between scattered neutrons and
           charged particles was required.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)Neutrons were produced as spallation products
           from an 800-MeV H- beam incident on a bare tungsten
           target. H- pulses from the linear accelerator had a
           width of approximately 0.2 ns, with an interpulse
           separation of 1.8 mu-s. Neutrons ranging from very
           low energies up to nearly 800 MeV. Experiment was
           performed on a forward-angle, at 15deg with respect
           to the primary H- beam.
ANALYSIS   Experimental data are kinematically overestimated
           and this fact was used in data analysis.
