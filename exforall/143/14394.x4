FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment was carried out at the
           Weapons Neutron Research Facility at the Los Alamos
           Neutron Science Center
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9991) The 235U target consisted of a
           deposit of 235U(F)4 on a thin carbon backing. The
           thickness of the 235U was 175.5 mu-g/cm2 and the
           backing thickness was 100 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   Fission fragments were detected by two arrays of Si
           PIN photodiodes (Hamamatsu S3590-09) arranged on
           opposite sides of the beam. The area of the individual
           PIN diodes was 1 cm2. The distance of the detectors
           from the target varied with the angle from 2.60 to
           4.12 cm. The coincident detector pairs were at
           approximately 45,60, 90, 115, and 135deg.
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of incident neutrons were measured using
           time of flight.
