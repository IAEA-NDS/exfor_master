METHOD     (TOF,GSPEC) A neutron monochromator specifically
           designed for capture gamma ray investigations. GeLi
           detectors were used to measure absolute gamma-ray
           intensities due to neutron capture in individual
           resonances. Gamma rays were gated using time of
           flight information.

ANALYSIS   (PGS) The spins of resonances were determined by
           examination of the low- and high-energy primary gamma
           rays.
