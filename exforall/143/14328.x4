SAMPLE     The targets were sealed under
           slight  negative pressure of He in quartz ampules (6.7
           x 51 mm). The sealed  quartz ampules were then placed
           in the welded Al rabbits (6.7 x 51  mm) for
           irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,RCHEM) After the irradiation, the quartz
           samples were soaked in HNO3 to remove surface
           contamination. After the appropriate cooling time,
           the activities were measured at a 30 cm distance from
           a well-calibrated HPGe detector.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) All activities were followed for several half-
           lives and the activities at the end of bombardment
           were extrapolated by the CLSQ code. When the multiple
           gamma-rays were used for assay, their intensities
           were used as weighing factors in calculations of the
           average activity values. The relevant nuclear data
           were taken from Lederer et al., Reus and Westmeier,
           and Mughabghab. The fission-averaged cross sections
           for the individual reactions, sigma, leading to
           117mSn, 119mSn and 195mPt were calculated by solving
           sets of three simultaneous equations for each
           radioisotope.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) It includes uncertainty due to counting
           statistics and detector efficiency. The uncertainty
           for thermal cross sections and resonance integrals
           includes
           (ERR-1)  5% error in thermal-to-epithermal ratio.
ADD-RES    This article contains data on fission-averaged
           cross sections for Oak Ridge High Flux Isotope
           Reactor (HFIR) spectrum and 116Sn(n,gamma),
           117Sn(n,n'), 118Sn(n,2n), 118Sn(n,gamma),
           119Sn(n,n'), 120Sn(n,2n), 194Pt(n,gamma), 195Pt(n,n')
           and 196Pt(n,2n) reactions. Unfortunately, these data
           are given for integral cross sections and Oak Ridge
           reactor neutron spectrum. This reactor neutron
           spectrum is not well defined, please see Table 2.
           Consequently, these data were not compiled.
