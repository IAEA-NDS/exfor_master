FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment was performed at the
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge
           National Laboratory using Low-Energy Radioactive Ion
           Beam Spectroscopy Station (LeRIBSS).
SAMPLE     (31-GA-86,ENR=1.0) Ions of 86Ga were extracted from
           the Resonant Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS),
           utilizing a two-step ionization scheme, accelerated
           to 200 keV kinetic energy, and mass analyzed by a
           two-stage mass separator having mass resolving powers
           M/dM of 1000 and 10 000, respectively.The beam was
           implanted into the moving tape collector. Tape
           collector periodically transported implanted ions to
           the detector setup center.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Beta rays were detected by two plastic beta
            ray detectors
           (HPGE)Gamma rays were detected using two high-purity
           germanium clover detectors
           (HE3SP) Neutrons were detected using 48 3He
           ionization chambers. The neutron counters, containing
           in total about 600 liters of 3He, were mounted in a
           thermalizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) support
           with a 1-mm-thick cadmium outer shielding.
