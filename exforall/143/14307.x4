FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiments were performed at the
           Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility in Los Alamos
           Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)
SAMPLE     Natural Fe sample with diameter of 50 mm and
           thickness of 10 mm. Distance between sample and each
           detector was about 0.7 m.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213 liquid organic scintillators 12.7 cm
           thick and 12.7 cm in diameter were used as neutron
           detectors. In the first phase of the experiment
           response function of each NE213 liquid organic
           scintillator was measured by recording the charge
           from the photomultiplier connected to the NE213
           scintillator and the time-of-flight (TOF) between the
           spallation target and the neutron detector.
           In experiment six detectors were used, placed at angles
           of 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 deg. A 10 mm thick
           NE102A plastic scintillation detector was placed in
           front of each neutron detector and used as
           veto detector to suppress detection of charged
           particles.
           (IOCH) Ionization fission chamber with 238U was used
           to determine incident neutron flux.
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of the primary neutron was determined by
           time of flight between spallation target and NE213
           detector. Flash gamma ray peak was used as time
           reference in time of flight.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons generated by 800 MeV protons
           impinging on a tungsten spallation target. The
           neutron energies covered a wide energy range up to
           750 MeV.The distance between the spallation target
           and the experimental room was about 90 m.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The energy spectra of emitted neutrons were
           derived from unfolding their deposition-energy
           spectra with the responses of the detectors, measured
           individually for each detector.
