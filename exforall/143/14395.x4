FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory Shielded Neutron Source
SAMPLE     Deuterated liquid scintillator NE232, encased in a
           glass cylinder of 4.2 cm in diameter and 6.4 cm high.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Central detector with deuterated scintillator
           NE232. Twelve side detectors with NE213 liquid
           scintillator with a diameter of 12.7 cm and a
           thickness of either 5.1 or 6.1 cm.
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of scattered neutrons was determined by
           time of flight
           (PSD) Pulse-shape discrimination made use of a
           charge integrating analog-to-digital converter
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-D)Polarized deuterons were produced by TUNL
           Atomic Beam Polarized Ion Source (ABPIS),
           accelerated through an FN Tandem accelerator and
           directed on he gas cell filled with deuterium to 7.8
           atm. Polarized neutrons were produced via the
           2H(d,n)3He source reaction at 0deg. The entrance to
           the gas cell was a 6.35 mum thick Havar foil, the
           exit was a 0.50-mm-thick gold beam stop.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for finite-geometry and multiple-
           scattering effects using a Monte Carlo simulation
