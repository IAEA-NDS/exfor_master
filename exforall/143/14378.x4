FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was carried out at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University.
DETECTOR   (DRFTC) Two cathode readout drift chambers (CRDCs)
           separated by 2.76 m through a quadrupole triplet
           were used to rack incident 8Li ions.
           (SCIN) Neutrons from the breakup of 8Li were detected
           by the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA). MoNA was arranged
           in 9 vertical layers of 16 horizontal scintillator
           bars each. The front face of the first layer was
           placed at 8.27 m from the reaction target. For the
           present analysis, only the first 6 layer and the
           center 1.6m of the 2m length were used. The
           horizontal and vertical acceptances were +-2.8deg and
           +-3.1deg, respectively. Each bar has a photomultiplier
           tube mounted on each end.
           (DRFTC) Two additional cathode readout drift chambers
           separated by 1m  determined the trajectories of
           projectile-like fragments
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) A telescope consisting of a thin
           and a thick plastic scintillator was used as
           fragment trigger and for particle identification.
           Additional thin plastic scintillator positioned
           before the target provided the start signal for
           time of flight measurement.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
INC-SOURCE A 120 MeV/nucleon 18-O beam from the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility bombarded a 2850 mg/cm2 9Be
           target. The secondary 8Li beam was selected by the
           A1900 fragment separator utilizing an 825 mg/cm2
           aluminum wedge degrader. The average beam intensity
           approx. 150 000/s, the mean energy was 69.5
           MeV/nucleon, and the energy dispersion could be best
           described by a rounded rectangle with FWHM = 1.8
           MeV/nucleon.

SAMPLE     56.7 mg/cm2 lead sample
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL) Photodesintegration of 8Li was accomplished by
           virtual photons in Coulomb scattering of 8Li with
           energy of 69.5+-1.9 MeV on lead and carbon target.
           The decay energy from breakup of 8Li was calculated
           from kinematics. Decay energy spectrum was converted
           to the Coulomb dissociation function and subsequently
           to the photodisintegration cross section. Detailed
           balance was used to convert 8Li photodisintegration
           cross section to neutron capture cross section on 7Li
