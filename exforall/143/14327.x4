INC-SOURCE T(d,n) reaction, deuterons of 2 different energies as
           given in subentries. The fast
           neutrons in the present measurements were obtained by
           bombarding a titanium tritide target with deuterons
           from the 4-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator of The
           University of Texas for the range 14 to 21 MeV, and
           from the tandem accelerator in the energy range above
           21 MeV.
SAMPLE     (6-C-12,NAT=0.9893) A spherical shell of pure graphite
           of 6-in. o.d. and 3-in. i.d.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,NAICR) The neutron detector, a cylinder of
           stilbene 1 in. in length and 1 in. in diameter. The
           gamma-ray measurements were made with a 2x2-in. NaI
           crystal.
METHOD     (REC) For each neutron energy, measurements were made
           with the four geometrical arrangements. The
           recoil spectra obtained under these conditions were
           collected.  Taking the midpoint of the slope at the
           end of the spectrum as representative of the energy
           of the neutrons responsible for the proton recoil
           spectrum, a calibration curve of neutron energy
           against channel number was plotted. Differential
           elastic scattering measurements were made at angles
           which would correspond to the emission of neutrons
           in the center-of-mass system at angles near the zeros
           of the first four Legendre polynomials (90,54.8,39.2,
           and 30.5 degrees).
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) The proton recoil spectra obtained in the
           four geometrical arrangements allow the following
           four determinations of the number of neutrons
           reaching the detector: (A) without shadow cone or
           scatterer, (B) with the shadow cone shielding the
           detector, (C) with the scatterer surrounding the
           shielded detector, and (D) with the scatterer in
           position without the shadow cone. The quantity
            (C minus B)/(A minus B), the fraction of the neutrons
           scattered and (A minus D)/(A minus B) the nonelastic
           scattering, were determined.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(N,EL)6-C-12,,SIG) Absolute cross sections were
           therefore obtained using the known absolute
           differential cross sections at 14 MeV. The geometrical
            arrangement is not conducive to making absolute
           measurements because the mean thickness of material
           between the detector and any point where a neutron is
           scattered is too great to make an approximate
           calculation worthwhile.

CORRECTION Correction for contributions caused by neutrons
           produced by deuterium. The neutron fluxes from both
           tritium and deuterium targets were measured and the
           yield of gamma-rays from the deuterium target was
           obtained using the same geometry. Such corrections
           were about 10%. For deuteron energies above 1.5 MeV,
           neutrons emitted in the forward direction from the
           D(d,n)3He reaction have sufficient energy to excite
           the 4.43-MeV state in 12C by inelastic scattering
            (threshold 4.80 MeV). Consequently a correction must
           be made in the gamma-ray measurements made with a
           tritide source for contributions caused by neutrons
           produced by deuterium.
