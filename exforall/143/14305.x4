FACILITY   (FNS,1USAROC) Experiment performed at OMEGA laser at
           Laboratory for Laser Energetics, University of
           Rochester
SAMPLE     Deuterium-tritium gas filled thin glass capsules made
           of SiO2 with diameter of about 850mu-m, a gas-fill
           pressure of about 20 atm, and a shell thickness of
           3.5 mu-m.The fuel gas mixture was 48.2+-0.3 %
           deuterium, 48.8+-0.3% tritium, 2.5% hydrogen, and
           0.5% helium 3 from the tritium decay.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,TRD)The energy spectra of the emitted tritons
           and deuterons, elastically scattered by the 14.1-MeV
           neutrons, were measured simultaneously by using a
           magnet-based charged-particle spectrometer (CPS),
           installed on the OMEGA chamber. The detector plane of
           the CPS was comprised of two pieces of CR-39, which
           is a plastic polymer that is insensitive to gamma
           rays and x rays produced in an implosion. Different
           particle track characteristics in CR-39 allow the CPS
           to make simultaneous measurements of the scattered
           deuterons and tritons with energies greater than 3.7
           and 2.5 MeV, respectively
INC-SOURCE (D-T)Capsules containing D-T mixture were imploded by
           60 laser beams that uniformly delivered 30 kJ to the
           capsule in a 1-ns square pulse. As the laser energy
           is quickly absorbed by the glass, the outer part of
           the glass shell explodes outward while the remaining
           part moves inward. The imploding part of the shell
           acts a piston and drives a shock through the
           deuterium-tritium fuel that heats the ions.
ANALYSIS   The differential cross section for the elastic n-3H
           and n-2H scattering  was determined from the measured
           deuteron and triton spectra by deconvolving the CPS
           spectrometer response and the Doppler-broadened
           14.1MeV-neutron spectrum
           The n-2H cross section was normalized to a Faddeev
           calculation that is accurate to about 1%, and that
           normalization factor, modified by the deuterium-tritium
           fuel ratio, was subsequently applied to the measured
           n-3H cross section
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty consisting of statistical
                   uncertainty and systematic uncertainty of the
                   normalization factor
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty of the normalization
                      factor
