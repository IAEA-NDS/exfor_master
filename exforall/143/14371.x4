FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment performed at 10 MV Tandem
           Van de Graaff accelerator and neutron time-of-flight
           facility at the Triangle Universities Nuclear
           Laboratory
DETECTOR   (SCIN) scattered neutrons were detected by two liquid
           scintillator detectors, placed on both sides of the
           beam axis. The detector on the 4-m track was filled
           with NE-218 liquid scintillator, and the detector on
           the 6 -m track was filled with NE-213 liquid
           scintillator.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy was determined by time of flight
           (PSD) Neutrons were identified using pulse shape
                 discrimination
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Monoenergetic neutron beams from about 5-15 MeV
           were produced using the 2H(d,n)3He reaction. Neutrons
           were generated by bombarding a 3.15-cm long deuterium
           gas cell with a deuteron beam pulsed at 2.5MHz and
           beam bunches of 2 ns full width at half-maximum. A
           typical deuteron beam current on target for this
           experiment was about 1.0 mu-A. The deuterium gas cell
           pressure (4.0 atm for En = 5.0 and 6.0 MeV, and 7.8
           atm for En = 8.0 MeV) was chosen to minimize the
           energy spread in the neutron beam.
