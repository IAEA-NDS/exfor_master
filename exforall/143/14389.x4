INSTITUTE  (1USAORL,1USAANL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR), and
           a graphite reactor.
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) An activation cross section measurement
           of the isotopes during the course of a neutron
           irradiation. A uranium sample was used to measure Np
           and Pu cross sections. Np and Pu were produced by
           n-capture on U, 2 beta decays, capture again. The
           competing channels are shown in the diagrams.
           (MASSP) Further work involved one month cooling,
           chemical processing, mass spectrographic analysis.
ANALYSIS   The principal analyses required by this method are
           the mass spectrographic determination of the
           234U/233U and 240Pu/239Pu ratios, the analyses of the
           233U and 239Pu produced in the 232Th and 238U
           respectively, and the irradiation times.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) A more realistic appraisal of the numerous
           factors entering into such measurement suggest the
           uncertainty of 10 to 20 percent.
