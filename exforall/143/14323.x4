INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The stored proton beam is directed towards
           tungsten spallation target and approximately 17 fast
           neutrons in the MeV energy range are produced for
           each incident proton.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The neutron detector system consists of 55
           liquid scintillator cells optically coupled to
           photomultipliers (PMT's). The segmented nature of the
           detector allows very high instantaneous counting
           rates, while the thickness of the scintillator is
           such that most of the neutrons are thermalized and
           captured, giving the detector a very high and almost
           energy independent efficiency.
METHOD     (TRN,TOF,TTM) The resonances in 232TH were studied by
           transmitting neutrons through a thick sample. The
           initial energy calibration was performed using
           previous resonance data of Olsen and Mughabghab. For
           the 100-ns data the time-of-flight length was
           L=56.804 m and the channel offset was C0=7.42
           channels, while the corresponding values for the
           200-ns data were L=56.795 m and C0=4.18 channels. The
           statistical error in these values is very small, but
           the total error is not known since the errors in the
           resonance energies used to determine L and C0 were
           not given in Refs. Using the values of L and C0 given
           above, the resonance energies were converted back to
           time-of-flight channels and related to the Olsen
           resonance energies by E=5.23x10-9[L2/d2(C+Co)2],
           where d is the dwell time.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) In the analysis to determine the resonance
           parameters, 30 runs were summed for the 100-ns data
           as well as the 200-ns data as a compromise between
           better statistics and the maintenance of uniform
           experimental conditions. Due to the thickness of the
           thorium target, many of the s-wave resonances
           absorbed all neutrons. After the standard background
           correction there were still some counts under these
           resonances. The remaining counts were fit to a
           polynomial function of 1/TOF. These background
           parameters were held fixed for the rest of the
           fitting process. First a large energy region was fit
           with known s-wave resonance parameters, allowing the
           magnitude and energy dependence of the flux to vary.
           The energy dependence was then fixed. Then a smaller
           energy region was fit, allowing E(s), gGamma-n(s),
           and Gamma-gamma(s) to vary. This process was then
           repeated after adding a higher energy region with
           some additional s-wave resonances. These new
           resonances were then fit, with the resonance
           parameters for the first s-wave resonances held
           fixed. This process was iterated until the s-wave
           parameters were stable. Then the p-wave resonances
           were fit while allowing only the flux and the p-wave
           resonance parameters to vary.

ANALYSIS   L values were deduced using the Bayesian analysis for
           p-wave probabilities. The Bayesian analysis uses the
           measured widths, strength functions, and level
           densities, and relies mainly on the large difference
           in s- and p-wave penetrabilities.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details are given, these resonances and
           their errors were previously known.
           (ERR-T) The errors include the statistical uncertainty
           and the estimated systematic uncertainties:
           (ERR-1) 2% uncertainty due to fitting process.
           (ERR-2) 2% uncertainty included for the p-wave due to
           small fluctuations in the flux.
FLAG       (1.) J=0.5 is assigned to p-wave resonances with
           statistically significant PNC(Parity Non Conservation)
           asymmetries.
