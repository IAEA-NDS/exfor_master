REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F)MASS,IND,FY)  The mass ratio
           distribution for 252Cf.
DETECTOR   (FISCH)
METHOD     (COINC) A weightless amount of 252Cf was volatilized
           on to a 5 microg/cm2 plastic film and was placed
           between the two halves of a two-sided Frisch-gridded
           ionization detector. The ionization produced by the
           two fission fragments was measured and recorded in
           time coincidence.
CORRECTION All energy measurements have been corrected to
           include ionization defect. This correction is ~7%
           for all energies.

REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU/TKE) The average number of
           neutrons per fission as a function of total kinetic
           energy.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (STANK,FISCH) A cylindrical tank of cadmium-loaded
           liquid scintillator, 36 in. in diameter by 36-in. high.
METHOD     (COINC) The spontaneous fission source was located in
           the center of the tank. The fission neutrons were
           moderated and captured by the liquid scintillator
           with a mean life of 10 microseconds. The two-sided
           ionization chamber containing the weightless 252Cf
           sample was placed in the scintillation tank. The
           fission-fragment kinetic energies and the number of
           neutrons were read from film and the data were
           punched into IBM cards.

METHOD     (COINC) The gamma-ray spectrum in coincidence with
           the spontaneous fission of 252Cf was measured with a
           NaI(Tl) spectrometer and an ionization chamber. Care
           was taken to correct for or to eliminate the
           simultaneous detection of two or more gamma rays per
           fission event. For this reason the gamma-ray
           detection efficiency was limited to 0.5%.

METHOD     (TOF,COINC) The neutron energy distribution was
           measured from 300 keV to 8 MeV using a time-of-flight
           technique. The fission events were detected in an
           argon gas scintillator. The neutrons were detected in
           a 2 in. x 2 in. stilbene crystal. The neutron
           detector was located one meter from the spontaneous
           fission source.
