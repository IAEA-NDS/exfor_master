FACILITY   (REAC,1USAINL) Coupled Fast Reactivity Measurements
           Facility (CFRMF).
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron fluxes were 8.78E11 n/cm2sec and
           8.73E11 n/cm2sec for irradiation 1 and 2, respectively.
INC-SPECT  CFRF neutron spectrum is similar to that in a fast
           reactor.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 65 cm3 closed-end coaxial detector.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,INTB,STTA) Radiometric method when
           saturation reaction rates (RR) are determined as RR =
            (A D)/(b e N gamma delta), where A is the measured
           peak area, b is the gamma-ray branching ratio, e is
           detector efficiency, N number of atoms per isotope of
           interest in the sample, gamma is the fission yield, D
           is a decay/count factor and delta includes correction
           factors.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) Peak area determinations were made with
           the GAUSS-V computer program. Peak efficiencies were
           interpolated values based on the previously measured
           efficiency curves.
