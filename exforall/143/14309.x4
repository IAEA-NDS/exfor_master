           LANSCE

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the
           spallation neutron source at LANSCE Weapons Neutron
           Research (WNR) facility, driven by 800-MeV linear
           proton accelerator.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Parallel plate ionization chambers were used
           for fission cross section measurements and neutron flux
           monitoring. The chambers can hold up to four
           samples, and each sample is mounted in identical
           geometry in order to perform relative cross section
           measurements.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used for neutron energy
           determination. Proton beam repetition rate was 20Hz,
           each pulse was approx. 250ns wide. Flight path no. 5
           was used for cross section measurements with fission
           chambers located about 8 meters from spallation target.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)Spallation reaction of tungsten target by 800
           MeV protons was used as neutron source. A water
           moderator shapes the neutron spectrum, and the usable
           neutron energy range was from around 0.2 to 200 MeV.
ANALYSIS   Ratio of unknown cross section to cross section of
           235U(n,f) was measured. Ratio was converted to cross
           section using the ENDF/B-VII evaluation of
           235U(n,f) cross section.
