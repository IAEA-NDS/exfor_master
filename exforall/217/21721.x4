TITLE      -Mean reactor cross sections for (n,p) reactions
            on titanium -.
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) BR-1 reactor, MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) irradiations with and without cadmium cover
            in BR-1 reactor for 2 hours. Thermal and epithermal
            reactor neutrons.
INC-SPECT  .From irradiations with Co and Au monitors
            fast neutron component of the graphite reactor, BR-1
            gives an equivalent fission flux identical to a pure
            fission flux.
SAMPLE     .Known amounts of about 100 mg of titanium oxide,
            packed in quartz vials.
           .Analytical grade ammonium sulphate was used as the
            monitor sample.
           .Scandium standards with and without cadmium cover
            were used to correct for Sc-45 produced by the neutron
            capture reaction.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) activation, following radiochemical
            separation  of titanium. The TiO2 matrix was dissolved
            in sulfuric acid and ammonium sulphate, titanium
            precipitated  with excess ammonia, and impurities
            removed by cation exchange column. Titanium reaction
            activities measured by decay gammas.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) calibrated 3 by 3 inch NaI(Tl) scintillator
            crystal.
MONITOR    (16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG,,FIS) fast neutron flux
            monitored by the disintegration rate of P-32, formed
            by the (n,p) reaction on S-32 in ammonium sulphate,
            by liquid scintillator in the presence of the
            unseparated sulphur matrix. No value for this monitor
            cross section is given.
CORRECTION .Corrected for Sc-45 from neutron capture. Several
            corrections were also made because the 1.33 MeV peak
            of Sc-48 is perturbed by the Compton contribution of
            its own sumpeak and of those of Sc-46 as well as the
            contribution of the 2.32 MeV sumpeak resulting from
            summing the 1.33 and 0.99 MeV gammas. The net
            correction was 10%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) the estimated total error is 15%,
            mainly due to the uncertainty associated with the
            cross section value of the fast flux monitor.
