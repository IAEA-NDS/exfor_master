TITLE      -SEARCH FOR TRI-NEUTRONS -.
FACILITY   (CYCLO) CYCLOTRON AT THE INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR STUDY
            OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 55 MEV PROTONS ON NATURAL LITHIUM TARGET.
INC-SPECT  .BROAD NEUTRON SPECTRUM, WITH A FLUX OF 5 10*8
            BETWEEN 13.7 AND 19 MEV.
SAMPLE     .HIGH PURITY LITHIUM FROURIDE FOR BOTH THE NEUTRON
            SOURCE AND THE TARGET.
METHOD     .THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE (N,3N) REACTION OF LI-7
            WAS INVESTIGATED USING THE (3N,N) REACTION ON BA-138
            AS DETECTOR OF TRI-NEUTRONS. THE ACTIVITY OF LA-140
            WAS MONITORED, AS THE BETA-DECAY PRODUCT OF BA-140.
            TO AVOID OTHER REACTION PROCESSES SAMPLES OF LIF
            AND BACO3 OF 99.0 PERCENT PURITY WERE USED.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 CM BY 7.6 CM NAI(TL) SCINTILLATOR AND
           (GELI ) GE(LI) CRYSTAL FOR COINCIDENCE COUNTING.

REACTION   (3-LI-7(N,3N)3-LI-5,,SIG,,SPA) TRI-NEUTRON PRODUCTION.
ANALYSIS   .A SOLID ANGLE OF 2 PI IS ASSUMED FOR TRI-NEUTRONS
            ON BA-138. THE CROSS SECTION ON BA-138 IS CALCULATED
            USING THE COMPOUND NUCLEUS MODEL OF BLATT AND
            WEISSKOPF.

ERR-ANALYS .THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNCERTAINTY COMES
            FROM THE (3N,N) CROSS SECTION OF BA-138, FOR
            WHICH A VALUE OF 100 MB IS TAKEN. ONE ORDER OF
            MAGNITUDE IS SUGGESTED AS THE OUTER LIMITS OF
            UNCERTAINTY ON THIS CROSS SECTION.
           .IN COMPARISON THE STATISTICAL COUNTING ERRORS
            ARE SMALL.
