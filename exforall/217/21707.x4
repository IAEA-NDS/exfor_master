INC-SOURCE (REAC) Critical assembly.
INC-SPECT  .Fission neutron spectrum from critical
            assembly.
           Caliban: mean neutron energy in the cavity is 1.35 MeV.
           Prospero-U: mean neutron energy within the cavity is
           about 1.25 MeV, outside the assembly - about 0.75 MeV;
           neutron flux was 10**11 neutron/cm2/s within the cavity
           and 10**10 n/cm2/s outside the assembly .

                   Fission yields in a fission neutron spectrum.
SAMPLE     .U(3)-O(8) Targets on aluminum or titanium foils.
            Diameter 14 mm, enrichment 99.9 percent U-233.
           Isotopic ratios U-234/U-233 4.2*10**-3,
           U-238/U-233 1.8*10**-2, U-232/U-233 2.3*10**-6.
ANALYSIS   Final value for each fission product is the combination
           of these different measurements through weighted
           averages, the weight being defined as the inverse of
           the square of the statistical uncertainty associated
           with each individual measurement.
