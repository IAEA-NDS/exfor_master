TITLE       Cross section measurements of (n,n') and (n,2n)
            reactions on zirconium and lead targets at 14.8 MeV
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNNAG) 2 MV Van der Graaff of Nagoya University
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Flux of about 2. x 10**9 neutrons/cm2/sec at
           the sample position.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Samples irradiated for 2.0 seconds, cooled
           for 1.5 seconds, and activity measured for 2.0
           seconds. The above process was repeated 100 times at
           intervals of 18 seconds. Finally, the Na-24-m activity
           from the monitor reaction was measured for 3600 seconds
           (ASSOP) Fluctuations in the neutron flux were
           monitored by counting the associated alpha particles
           from the D-T reaction.
           The values reported are those averaged from three or
           four separate runs.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Coaxial 55 cm3 Ge(Li) detector for decay gammas
           (SIBAR) silicon surface barrier detector for alphas.

           It does not include errors in the half-life and in the
            abundance of each gamma energy per decay.
