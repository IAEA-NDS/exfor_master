TITLE       Precise determination of the branching ratio and
            Q-value of the B-10(n,alpha)Li-7 reaction and of the
            Q-value of the Li-6(n,alpha)H-3 reaction

INSTITUTE  (2ZZZGEL) C.B.N.M. Geel.
FACILITY   (REAC,2ZZZGEL) BR-1 reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron beam extracted from the
            graphite reflector, intensity 10*6 n/cm2/sec.
            Cadmium ratio values were determined with and without
            a 0.4 mm thick cadmium foil.
INC-SPECT   Thermal Maxwellian neutron spectrum, with correction
            made for an epi-cadmium plus room background
            intensity equal to 2.80+-0.02% of the incident beam.
SAMPLE      A thin elemental layer of B-10, 15 ug/cm2, with
            a diameter of 38 mm, prepared by evaporation on a gold
            coated quartz disk, and mounted in a vacuum chamber a
            at 30 mm from the sensitive surface of the detector.
METHOD     (ASSOP) Detection of emitted alphas. Good separation
            of the two alpha peaks allows the sum of counts under
            each peak to be considered proportional to the two
            partial cross sections to the Li-7 ground and first
            excited states.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Gold silicon surface barrier detector, 400 mm2
            in area. The detector was outside the direct beam but
            parallel to the source.
            The detector was operated at a reverse bias of 20 V,
            giving a depletion depth of 55 um, sufficient to
            stop all reaction products of B-10(n,alpha) but thin
            enough to limit pile up of background pulses.

REACTION   ((5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG)//
           (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG))
            the branching ratio defined as sig(n,a(0))/sig(n,a(1))
            given in the text as percent, but converted here into
            an absolute ratio.
CORRECTION  Corrected for epithermal neutrons. The measured
            reactor spectrum value was 6.741+-0.006%, and the
            epicadmium value was 7.02+-0.08%. With the measured
            cadmium ratio of the spectrum the value for epithermal
            neutrons and room background neutrons is given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is one standard deviation,
            primarily from statistical counting uncertainties.
            The supplementary error from background was an order
            of magnitude smaller.
