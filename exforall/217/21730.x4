TITLE      -PRECISE DETERMINATION OF THE BRANCHING RATIO
            AND Q-VALUE OF THE B-10(N,A) REACTION AND OF THE
            Q-VALUE OF THE LI-6(N,T) REACTION -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR-1 REACTOR, MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL NEUTRON BEAM EXTRACTED FROM THE
            GRAPHITE REFLECTOR, INTENSITY 10*6 N/CM2/SEC.
            CADMIUM RATIO VALUES WERE DETERMINED WITH AND WITHOUT
            A 0.4 MM THICK CADMIUM FOIL.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN NEUTRON SPECTRUM, WITH
            CORRECTION MADE FOR AN EPI-CADMIUM PLUS ROOM
            BACKGROUND INTENSITY EQUAL TO 2.80+-0.02 PERCENT
            OF THE INCIDENT BEAM.
SAMPLE     .A THIN ELEMENTAL LAYER OF B-10, 15 MICRO-GM/CM2, WITH
            A DIAMETER OF 38 MM, PREPARED BY EVAPORATION ON A GOLD
            COATED QUARTZ DISK, AND MOUNTED IN A VACUUM CHAMBER A
            AT 30 MM FROM THE SENSITIVE SURFACE OF THE DETECTOR.
METHOD     (ASSOP) DETECTION OF EMITTED ALPHAS. GOOD SEPERATION
            OF THE TWO ALPHA PEAKS ALLOWS THE SUM OF COUNTS UNDER
            EACH PEAK TO BE CONSIDERED PROPORTIONAL TO THE TWO
            PARTIAL CROSS SECTIONS TO THE LI-7 GROUND AND FIRST
            EXCITED STATES.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) GOLD SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR, 400 MM2
            IN AREA AND 600 OHM.CM RESISTIVITY. THE DETECTOR WAS
            OUTSIDE THE DIRECT BEAM BUT PARALLEL TO THE SOURCE.
            THE DETECTOR WAS OPERATED AT A REVERSE BIAS OF 20 V,
            GIVING A DEPLETION DEPTH OF 55 MICRO-M, SUFFICIENT TO
            STOP ALL REACTION PRODUCTS OF B-10(N,A) BUT THIN
            ENOUGH TO LIMIT PILE UP OF BACKGROUND PULSES.

            THE BRANCHING RATIO DEFINED AS SIG(N,A(0))/SIG(N,A(1))

CORRECTION .CORRECTED FOR EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS. THE MEASURED
            REACTOR SPECTRUM VALUE WAS 6.741+-0.006 PERCENT, AND
            THE EPICADMIUM VALUE WAS 7.02+-0.08 PERCENT. WITH
            THE MEASURED CADMIUM RATIO OF THE SPECTRUM THE VALUE
            FOR EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS AND ROOM BACKGROUND NEUTRONS
            IS GIVEN.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE UNCERTAINTY IS ONE STANDARD DEVIATION,
            PRIMARILY FROM STATISTICAL COUNTING UNCERTAINTIES.
            THE SUPPLEMENTARY ERROR FROM BACKGROUND WAS AN ORDER
            OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER.
