TITLE      -excitation functions of (n,t) reactions on
            Al-27, Co-59, and Nb-93.
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) water-cooled Ti(T) layer about 2mg/cm2 thick
            on a 0.3 mm silver backing. Van der Graaff generated
            3 MeV deuterons at a current of 50 microamps.
METHOD     (ACTIV) compact hemispherical geometry of three
            or four sample segments around the neutron
            source. Each segment covered an angular
            range with corresponding incident neutron energy
            range. Sample enclosed in aluminium capsule to
            prevent contamination with tritium from neutron
            source.
           .Samples irradiated for about 50 hours.
           .After irradiation the accumulated tritium was
            separated by vacuum extraction in hydrogen atmosphere,
            and the activity measured by low level beta minus
            anticoincidence counting in the gas phase.
           .Gas counting system efficiency determined by using
            tritium gas standards.
           (MOMIX)
           .Neutron flux, averaged over each segment, was
            measured using internal standards based on
            gamma active isotopes produced by the irradiation.
            gamma activity measured with Ge(Li) detectors.
           .Neutron flux measurements checked using an external
            proton recoil telescope in 130 degree direction
            80 cm from neutron source, and activity measurements
            of an external piece of cobalt at zero degrees 25 cm
            from source. These techniques were less accurate
            because geometry of system was not well known.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) gas phase tritium activity
           (GELI ) gamma activity of internal standards used
                   for neutron flux determination
           (TELES) proton recoil telescope to monitor
                   neutron flux.

DECAY-DATA (1-H-3,12.35YR)
ADD-RES    (COMP) .Results compared with excitation functions
            obtained from Hauser-Feshbach calculations. Good
            agreement only for Al. For the other two isotopes
            calculated cross sections were too low.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from private comm.
CORRECTION .Neutron scatter from target cooling water and
            from aluminium capsule estimated using Monte-Carlo
            calculations, neglecting multiple scattering.
            4 to 6% of neutrons were calculated to have
            energies outside the range of the unscattered flux.
           .Detector efficiencies.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) systematic error in tritium activity
                   measurements
           (ERR-2) error in tritium extraction efficiency
           (ERR-3) systematic error in gamma activity
                   measurements
           (ERR-S) total uncorrelated error, computed from
                   quadratic sum of typical values for the
                   random part of the counting errors.
