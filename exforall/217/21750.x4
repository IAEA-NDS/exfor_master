SAMPLE     .Four beryllium shells of thickness 2.032 cm,
            2.91 cm, 3.31 cm and 5.34 cm.
METHOD     .The neutron multiplication and the neutron
            detector efficiency was measured. These values plus
            the assumed eta value was used to calculate the
            transmission which then was used to calculate the
            total nonelastic cross section.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) The neutron detector was a modified Hanson
            McKibben 'long counter'. Its efficiency at 14 MeV and
            at fission neutron energies was measured in each
            experiment.
