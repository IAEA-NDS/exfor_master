TITLE      -SPIN-DEPENDENT SCATTERING OF SLOW NEUTRONS
            ON POLARISED O-17.
FACILITY   (REAC ) EL-3 REACTOR AT SACLAY.
           (SPECC) BRAGG REFLECTION FROM MAGNETISED FE-CO
                   TO PRODUCE A MONOCHROMATIC POLARISED BEAM.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) POLARIZED SOURCE AND TARGET.
SAMPLE     .POWDERED CA-O-17 IRRADIATED WITH FAST NEUTRONS TO
            GENERATE F-CENTRES AT A CONCENTRATION OF 3.E18
            PER GRAM. THE TECHNIQUE OF DYNAMIC POLARISATION,
            USING THE UNRESOLVED SOLID EFFECT, WAS USED.
METHOD     (DIFFR) MAGNETISED FE-CO CRYSTALSUSED AS POLARISER AND
            ANALYSER. DIFFERENCE IN THE NEUTRON LARMOUR
            PRECESSION FREQUENCY WAS MEASURED FOR A POLARISED
            AND DEPOLARISED TARGET. SEVERAL MEASUREMENTS WITH
            POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLARIZATIONS WERE TAKEN.
DETECTOR   .NO DETAILS GIVEN IN REFERENCE.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) INCLUDES
                1) STATISTICAL ERROR CALCULATED FROM THE LEAST
                   SQUARES FIT TO THE SET OF MEASUREMENTS.
                2) SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE
                   CHANGES IN LARMOUR PHASE SHIFT AND TARGET
                   POLARIZATION.
                3) SYSTEMATIC ERROR IN THE NUMBER OF TARGET ATOMS
                   PER UNIT AREA.
