TITLE      -Polarization effects in neutron-proton scattering
            at 98 MeV.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2UK HAR) 110 inch Harwell synchro-cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,P-BE) Three beryllium targets were used
              producing polarized neutron beams at +/- 26 degrees
              to the incident protons and an unpolarized beam at
              beam at zero degrees.
INC-SPECT  .Approximately triangular extending from 79 MeV to
            121 MeV. The effective neutron energy of 98 +- 3 MeV
            quoted in the common section was calculated from a
            measurement of the attenuation of the beam by
            polythene.
SAMPLE     .Polythene and carbon samples.
METHOD     .Asymmetry of scattered neutrons calculated from
            counting rates at zero and ninety degrees
            azimuthal angle.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Counter telescope was mounted on a
           movable arm which clamped to the table. Each plastic
           scintillator was mounted in a perspex light guide in a
           rigid metal frame and had inscribed at its centre a
           small cross for alignment. The defining crystal al was
           1.5 cm x 6.0 cm and 0.3 cm thick a placed at distance
           from the scatterers.
MONITOR    The monitor used was a trip triple coincidence proton
           recoil telescope. It was similar to the counter
           telescope so that the effect of small cyclotron energy
           variations was largely cancelled out. Proton recoils
           originated in a polythene radiator 1 cm thick placed
           immediately after the collimator.
           A boron trifluoride slow neutron counter near the
           apparatus was also used as a monitor throughout the
           experiment as an additional check on the behaviour of
            the equipment.
CORRECTION .Geometric asymmetries.
           .Effect of the cyclotron magnetic field on
            the scattering.
           .Asymmetries in background count rates.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The major contribution is from counting
                   statistics. Errors in the corrections are
                   also included.
