TITLE      -Reactor neutron activation analysis by a Triple
            Comparator Method -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) Thetis reactor of the Institute for Nuclear
            Sciences at Ghent.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Two irradiation positions at a reactor power
            of 15 kW. Thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes at
            both positions was monitored with Co and Au flux
            monitors.
SAMPLE     -Samples contained 1 milligram of spectroscopically
            pure In2-O3 mixed with one gram of spec. pure Al2-O3.
            Samples were irradiated with and without a 0.75 mm
            cadmium foil. After dissolution of In2-O3in HCl and
            filtering Al2-O3, gamma counting was started one week
            after irradiation to allow decay of the 54 min In-116
            and 15 hr Na-24 activities, the latter formed by the
            (N,A) reaction on Al-27.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Triple comparator method with analysis of the
            K ratios of the three elements irradiated for
            correction for each thermal to epithermal ratio.
           -After irradiation each element was dissolved and
            gamma activity measured in 20 ml glass tubes in a well
            type NaI(Tl) scintillation counter.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Well type NaI(Tl) scintillation counter with
            efficiency determined by the liquid scintillator
            method.

            for "human-readable".
CORRECTION -Corrected for half-life, thermal to epithermal flux
            ratio and extraneous activities.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Standard deviations from counting statistics,
            not including uncertainties in monitor cross sections
ADD-RES    (COMP) In Table 7 the experimental and calculated
            K-factors (K=S1/S2 ,where A1 and A2 are the specific
            photopeak activities of the isotope investigated and
            comparator, respectively) for isotopes of Na-24,Sc-46,
            Cu-64,Ga-72, As-76, Sb-122 and comparators of Co-60,
            In-114m, Au-198 are compared.
