TITLE       Reactor neutron activation analysis by a triple
            comparator method
AUTHOR     (F.De Corte, A.Speecke, J.Hoste)
REFERENCE  (J,JRC,3,205,1969) Full Report.
INSTITUTE  (2BLGGHT) Institute for Nuclear Sciences, Ghent Univ.
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGGHT) THETIS reactor of the Institute for
            Nuclear Sciences at Ghent.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Two irradiation positions at a reactor power
            of 15 kW. Thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes at
            both positions was monitored with Co and Au flux
            monitors.
SAMPLE      Samples contained 1 milligram of spectroscopically
            pure In2-O3 mixed with one gram of spec. pure Al2-O3.
            Samples were irradiated with and without a 0.75 mm
            cadmium foil. After dissolution of In2-O3in HCl and
            filtering Al2-O3, gamma counting was started one week
            after irradiation to allow decay of the 54 min In-116
            and 15 hr Na-24 activities, the latter formed by the
            (N,A) reaction on Al-27.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Triple comparator method with analysis of the
            K ratios of the three elements irradiated for
            correction for each thermal to epithermal ratio.
            After irradiation each element was dissolved and
            gamma activity measured in 20 ml glass tubes in a well
            type NaI(Tl) scintillation counter.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Well type NaI(Tl) scintillation counter with
            efficiency determined by the liquid scintillator
            method.

            ratio and extraneous activities.

ADD-RES    (COMP) In Table 7 the experimental and calculated
            K-factors (K=S1/S2 ,where A1 and A2 are the specific
            photopeak activities of the isotope investigated and
            comparator, respectively) for isotopes of Na-24,Sc-46,
            Cu-64,Ga-72, As-76, Sb-122 and comparators of Co-60,
            In-114m, Au-198 are compared.
