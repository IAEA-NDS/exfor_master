TITLE      -REACTOR NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS BY A TRIPLE
            COMPARATOR METHOD -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) THETIS REACTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR
            SCIENCES AT GHENT.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) TWO IRRADIATION POSITIONS AT A REACTOR POWER
            OF 15 KW. THERMAL AND EPITHERMAL NEUTRON FLUXES AT
            BOTH POSITIONS WAS MONITORED WITH CO AND AU FLUX
            MONITORS.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES CONTAINED 1 MILLIGRAM OF SPECTROSCOPICALLY
            PURE IN2 O3 MIXED WITH ONE GRAM OF SPEC. PURE AL2O3.
            SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED WITH AND WITHOUT A 0.75 MM
            CADMIUM FOIL. GAMMA COUNTING WAS STARTED ONE WEEK
            AFTER IRRADIATION TO ALLOW DECAY OF THE 54 MIN IN-116
            AND 15 HR NA-24 ACTIVITIES, THE LATTER FORMED BY THE
            (N,A) REACTION ON AL-27.
METHOD     (ACTIV) TRIPLE COMPARATOR METHOD WITH ANALYSIS OF THE
            K RATIOS OF THE THREE ELEMENTS IRRADIATED FOR
            CORRECTION FOR EACH THERMAL TO EPITHERMAL RATIO.
           .AFTER IRRADIATION EACH ELEMENT WAS DISSOLVED AND
            GAMMA ACTIVITY MEASURED IN 20 ML GLASS TUBES IN A WELL
            TYPE NAI(TL) SCINTILLATION COUNTER.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) WELL TYPE NAI(TL) SCINTILLATION COUNTER WITH
            EFFICIENCY DETERMINED BY THE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
            METHOD.
STATUS     .TABLE 4, JRC,3,205.

CORRECTION .CORRECTED FOR HALF-LIFE, THERMAL TO EPITHERMAL FLUX
            RATIO AND EXTRANEOUS ACTIVITIES.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM COUNTING STATISTICS,
