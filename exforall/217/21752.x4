            A 382 MICR0-G NP-237 PER CM2 LAYER WAS EVAPORATED
            ONTO A MYLAR BACKING. FOR CALIBRATION A SIMILAR
            LAYER OF 10 MICRO-G U-235 PER CM2 WAS USED
           .FOR MASS AND ENERGY MEASUREMENTS A 111 MICRO-G
            NP-237 PER CM2 LAYER AND A 129 MICRO-G U-235 PER CM2
