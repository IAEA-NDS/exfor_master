TITLE      -The (N-Th,a)-reaction on U-233,U-235 and U-238
            and determination of the U-238(N,a)Th-235
            reaction characteristics.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) 87 m curved neutron guide of the
            high flux reactor. Flux of 6.E+8 N/cm**2/sec,
            cadmium ratio of 1.E+6, gamma flux reduced by a
            factor of 1.E+6.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  .Thermal maxwellian neutron spectrum from hfr.
METHOD     (EDE)   Alpha particles selected by telescope
            detector.
           .In the case of U-233 and U-238 no aluminium absorber
            was placed in between sample and detector. In the case
            of U-235 an aluminium foil was used to protect the
            de-detector against the fission fragments and the
            lra'S.
           .In the case of Th-232 and Pu-239 it was not specified
            if there was such an absorber.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Telescope detector, consisting of
            two Si(Au) surface barrier detectors.
            The de-detector was fully depleted, with a thickness
            of 26.7 microns, an active area of 300 mm**2, an
            energy resolution of 35 KeV for 5.5 MeV alphas.
            The e-detector had a thickness of 700 microns, an
            active area of 450 mm**2, and a resolution of 25 KeV
            for 5.5 MeV alphas.
           .The detectors were calibrated with the alpha lines fro
            the spontaneous decay of the U-isotopes, the 2.055 MeV
            alpha line from Li-6(N,t) and the 9.43 MeV alpha line
            from the Nd-143(N,a) reaction.
CORRECTION .For the energy losses in the aluminium absorber.
