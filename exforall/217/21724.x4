            AND DETERMINATION OF THE U-238(N,A)TH-235
            REACTION CHARACTERISTICS.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) 87 M CURVED NEUTRON GUIDE OF THE
            HIGH FLUX REACTOR. FLUX OF 6.E+8 N/CM**2/SEC,
            CADMIUM RATIO OF 1.E+6, GAMMA FLUX REDUCED BY A
            FACTOR OF 1.E+6.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN NEUTRON SPECTRUM FROM HFR.
METHOD     (EDE  ) ALPHA PARTICLES SELECTED BY TELESCOPE
            DETECTOR.
           .IN THE CASE OF U-233 AND U-238 NO ALUMINIUM ABSORBER
            WAS PLACED IN BETWEEN SAMPLE AND DETECTOR. IN THE CASE
            OF U-235 AN ALUMINIUM FOIL WAS USED TO PROTECT THE
            DE-DETECTOR AGAINST THE FISSION FRAGMENTS AND THE
            LRA'S.
           .IN THE CASE OF TH-232 AND PU-239 IT WAS NOT SPECIFIED
            IF THERE WAS SUCH AN ABSORBER.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) TELESCOPE DETECTOR, CONSISTING OF
            TWO SI(AU) SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS.
            THE DE-DETECTOR WAS FULLY DEPLETED, WITH A THICKNESS
            OF 26.7 MICRONS, AN ACTIVE AREA OF 300 MM**2, AN
            ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 35 KEV FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS.
            THE E-DETECTOR HAD A THICKNESS OF 700 MICRONS, AN
            ACTIVE AREA OF 450 MM**2, AND A RESOLUTION OF 25 KEV
            FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS.
           .THE DETECTORS WERE CALIBRATED WITH THE ALPHA LINES FRO
            THE SPONTANEOUS DECAY OF THE U-ISOTOPES, THE 2.055 MEV
            ALPHA LINE FROM LI-6(N,T) AND THE 9.43 MEV ALPHA LINE
