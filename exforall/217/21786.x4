TITLE      -Experiments with iso-energetic neutrons-.
FACILITY   (ACCEL)  .High voltage discharge tube to accelerate
                     heavy hydrogen ions.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)   The D(D,N) reaction. The strength of
            the source is calculated to 2.E+7 neutrons
            per second under the assumption that the
            neutron emission of 1 milli-curie of radon
            mixed with beryllium powder is 1.5e+4 neutrons
            per second.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.

REACTION   (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .A sheet of paraffin wax , 7.7cm long, 4.8cm
            wide and 1.85cm thick.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Geiger-mueller counter to count the
            indium foil activity.
           .As detector was used an indium foil that was
            enclosed between two paraffin blocks and then
            wrapped in cadmium foil.
ANALYSIS   .The measured intensity with and without
            scatterer gave the mean free path of neutrons
            in wax, which combined with the assumed value
            for the elastic scattering of carbon gave the
            hydrogen elastic scattering cross-section.

CORRECTION .Correction for small variations in the neutron
            source intensity was done using the P-31(N,P)
            reaction as monitor.
ERR-ANALYS .No information given.

REACTION   (47-AG-0(N,G),,SIG)
SAMPLE     .Silver foil of thickness 130 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Geiger-mueller counter, efficiency
            calibrated with a known deposit of uranium
            nitrate.
STATUS     .Data taken from text.
CORRECTION .Internal absorption in the silver foil was
            investigated and corrected for.
           .Experiments concerning the effect of slow
            energy neutrons gave the result that it was
            not necessary to correct for this within the
            statistical accuracy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error quoted to about 7 percent.
           (ERR-T) .Total error may be as much as 50 percent.
