TITLE      -THE AVERAGE CROSS SECTION OF THE RH-103(N,2N) AND
            RH-103(N,2N)RH-102M REACTIONS IN A FISSION NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR-2 REACTOR AT S.C.K. MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR NEUTRONS, FLUX 6 10**12 N/CM2/SEC, FOR
            ONE WEEK.
INC-SPECT  .EQUIVALENT FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM, USING
            THE NI-57 AND CO-58 ACTIVITIES FROM A NI-58 SAMPLE
            AND MN-54 FROM THE MN-55(N,2N) REACTION
            AS MONITOR. THE FAST FLUX WAS ALSO CHECKED WITH
            AL-27(N,A) ( WITH NA-24 BURN-UP CORRECTION).
SAMPLE     .RHODIUM SPONGE, FROM JOHNSON MATTHEY, IN AN ALUMINIUM
            BOX. THE IRRADIATED RHODIUM WAS SEPERATED  AFTER
            IRRADIATION BY VOLATISATION IN POTASSIUM BISULPHATE
            FUSION, THE REDUCED BY MAGNESIUM TURNINGS.
            A RHODIUM-IRIDIUM SEPERATION WITH CALOMEL WAS DONE
            TWICE, AND AG-110M WAS ALSO CHEMICALLY SEPERATED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) CALIBRATED GE(LI) DETECTOR. AS RH-102 DECAYS
            BY ELECTRON CAPTURE ONLY, ANIHILATION GAMMAS WERE
            COUNTED ASSUMING A QUANTUM EFFICIENCY OF 14.1 PERCENT
MONITOR    (25-MN-55(N,2N)25-MN-54,,SIG,,FIS) THIS REACTION WAS
            CHOSEN AS THE PRIMARY MONITOR SINCE THE THRESHOLD
            ENERGY IS SIMILAR. THE VALUE FOR THE FISSION SPECTRUM
            AVERAGE CROSS SECTION WAS TAKEN AS 0.21 MB.
            OTHER MONITORS WERE NI-58(N,2N), AL-27(N,A)NA-24
            AND NI-58(N,P) WITH ASSUMED VALUES FOR THE FISSION
            AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS OF 0.004, 0.60 AND 102 MB
            RESPECTIVELY.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE TOTAL ERROR OF 20 PERCENT INCLUDES
            THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH POSSIBLE PERTURBATION
            TO THE EFFECIVE FISSION SPECTRUM.
