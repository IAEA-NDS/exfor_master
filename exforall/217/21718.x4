TITLE      -THE MEAN FISSION NEUTRON CROSS SECTION FOR THE
            REACTION TA-181(N,P)HF-181 -.
FACILITY   (REAC )BR-2 REACTOR S.C.K.MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR NEUTRONS, IRRADIATION FOR 98HRS.
INC-SPECT  .EQUIVALENT FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
            THE FAST NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MONITORED BY ALUMINIUM
            AND MAGNESIUM THRESHOLD MONITORS.
SAMPLE     .SPEC-PURE TA2O5, WITH A HAFNIUM IMPURITY OF 30 PPM.
            PURIFIED TO REMOVE HAFNIUM BY A LIQUID EXTRACTION
            TECHNIQUE BY MORRISON AND FREISER, REDUCING THE
            HAFNIUM IMPURITY TO LESS THAN 0.5 PPM.
           .THREE SAMPLES OF 10 MG WERE SEALED IN SILICA AND
            IRRADIATED WITH AND WITHOUT CADMIUM COVER.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION OF HF-181. REACTION PRODUCTS WERE
            CHEMICALLY SEPERATED AFTER IRRADIATION USIND DOWEX
            EXCHANGE RESIN TO SEPERATE TANTALUM AND HAFNIUM.
            THE SEPERATED AND PURIFIED HAFNIUM FRACTION STILL
            CONTAINED SOME TA-182 AS BACKGROUND, ELIMINATED BY
            A FAST-SLOW COINCIDENCE COUNTING METHOD.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) NO DETAILS.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG,,FIS) FISSION SPECTRUM
            AVERAGE VALUE TAKEN AS 0.60 MICRO-B. ALSO NI-58(N,P),
            MG-24(N,P), AND NI-58(N,2N) WERE ALSO USED AS FAST
            FLUX MONITORS WITH VALUES OF 102., 1.31, AND 0.0045 M
            RESPECTIVELY.
           .THE THERMAL FLUX WAS MONITORED BY THE CO-59(N,G)
            REACTION WITH AN ASSUMED EFFECTIVE THERMAL CROSS
            SECTION OF 37.9 B.
           .THE CADMIUM RATIO WAS 40.2 .

            BECAUSE OF LARGE DIFFERENCES IN SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WITH
            AND WITHOUT CADMIUM, AN INTERMEDIATE HF-181 REFERENCE
            WAS USED.
