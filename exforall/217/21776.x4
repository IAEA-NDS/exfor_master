TITLE      -Fission fragment energy correlation
            measurements for Th-229(n,f).
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  ILL high flux reactor.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Cold neutron beam hole IH1.
INC-SPECT  .The equivalent thermal neutron flux at target was
                   5.x 10**9 neutrons per cm2 per second, with
                   a thermal to fast ratio of 5.x 10**4 .
SAMPLE     .0.914 micro-g/cm2 thorium dioxide or
            20.2 micro-g/cm2 natural uranium oxide
            evaporated onto nickel backing.
           .Uranium sample used for calibration data.
METHOD     (COINC) Fast and slow coincidence combined with
           (TOF)   Time of flight difference between fission
                   fragments, used as a coherence test to
                   reject badly measured data.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two gold-silicon surface barrier detectors.
ANALYSIS   .Pulse heights converted to kinetic energies and
            masses via an iterative procedure using the
            calibration method of Schmidt+ C,65SALZBURG,1,531,65 .
CORRECTION .Differences between energy loss in backings of
            thorium and uranium samples.
           .No corrections made for the effect of neutron
            emission, except when indicated by a flag.
COMMENT    From the author:"As regards the issue thermal-cold it
           is correctly said in the paper by Asghar that the IH1
           beam of the ILL is cold. However, the beam IH1 has a
           wavelength peak at 3.2 A corresponding to a neutron
           energy of 8 meV, while thermal neutrons have 1.8 A
           with the energy being 25 meV. The beam IH1 is hence
           only "slightly cold". "
