TITLE      --NEUTRON ATTENUATION MEASUREMENTS IN HEAVY AND LIGHT
            WATER AT ENERGIES BETWEEN 109 AND 169 MEV.-
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP) 230 CM UPPSALA SYNCHROCYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) 30 MM THICK BE TARGET.
SAMPLE     .LIGHT AND HEAVY WATER SAMPLES
           .IN CU - TUBES WITH 0.5 MM THICK CU - WINDOWS.
           .SAMPLES CONTAINED THE SAME NUMBER OF O - ATOMS.
           .HEAVY WATER CONSISTED OF 99.75 PERCENT D-2-O.
METHOD     (REC,COINC)
           .RECOIL PROTONS EMERGING FROM A POLYTHENE SCATTERER
            WERE DETECTED BY A TRIPLE COINCIDENCE COUNTER
            TELESCOPE.
           .AN AL-ABSORBER WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE TWO LAST
            DETECTORS TO SET A LOW ENERGY LIMIT TO THE
            RECOIL PROTONS DETECTED.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) COUNTER TELESCOPE CONSISTING OF
            3 POLYSTYRENE CRYSTALS, EACH 7 MM THICK,
            MOUNTED ON TOP OF A PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE.
           (BF3  )  BF3 DETECTOR TO MONITOR THE NEUTRON BEAM.
ANALYSIS   .AN EFFECTIVE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS CALCULATED.
           .THE ENERGY BAND WIDTH VARIED BETWEEN 19 AND
            31 MEV DEPENDING ON THE ABSORBER THICKNESS IN
            THE DETECTOR TELESCOPE.
PART-DET   (P    )
           .RECOIL PROTONS FROM A 17MM THICK POLYTHENE SCATTERER.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM THE REFERENCE.

           (830111E)
CORRECTION .THE PROTON COUNTING RATE WAS CORRECTED TO A
            CONTRIBUTION FROM THE CARBON CONTENT IN THE
            POLYTHENE FOIL.
           .THIS CONTRIBUTION WAS BETWEEN 8 AND 12 PERCENT
            DEPENDING ON THE NEUTRON ENERGY.
