            An electrostatically accelerated deuterium beam
            on a solid titanium tritide or deuteride target.
SAMPLE     .Thin sample of Pa-231, details given in RCA,6,16,66.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Measurement of activity of selected fission
            products.
           .The fission fragments were collected on an aluminum
            foil, 7 mg/cm2 thick, following recoil from the
            fissionable target sample.
           (CHSEP) Well-established radiochemical methods of
            separation were used to isolate the elements of
            interest after dissolution of the catcher foil
            in hydrochloric acid. Recovery yields were determined
            by weighing or by titrometry (Pr) or by
            spectrophotometry (Ru).
DETECTOR   (PROPC) End-window gas flow proportional counter
            of the Sugarman type. To reduce background the
            counter was shielded with Geiger-Muller counters
            operated in anti-coincidence.
CORRECTION .Corrections for independent yields of nuclides
            succeeding that isolated were made on the basis
            of the equal charge displacement hypothesis.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Standard deviations from counting statistics

            product of the ratios...

            - Mo-99 activity from Pa-231 and U-238 at 3 MeV;
            - 99 mass chain yield at 14 MeV
             from U-238 (5.6%) and Pa-231 (3.2%);
            - 99 mass chain yield at 3 MeV
