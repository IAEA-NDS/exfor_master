TITLE      -RADIOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF 3 AND 14 MEV NEUTRON
            INDUCED FISSION OF PA-231 -.
FACILITY   (CCW  ) T TYPE ELECTROSTATIC ROTARY NEUTRON
            GENERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) FOR 3 MEV NEUTRONS.
           (D-T  ) FOR 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS.
            AN ELECTROSTATICALLY ACCELERATED DEUTERIUM BEAM
            ON A SOLID TITANIUM TRITIDE OR DEUTERIDE TARGET.
SAMPLE     .THIN SAMPLE OF PA-231, DETAILS GIVEN IN RCA,6,16,66.
METHOD     (ACTIV) MEASUREMENT OF ACTIVITY OF SELECTED FISSION
            PRODUCTS.
           .THE FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE COLLECTED ON AN ALUMINIUM
            FOIL, 7 MG/CM2 THICK, FOLLOWING RECOIL FROM THE
            FISSIONABLE TARGET SAMPLE.
           (CHSEP) WELL-ESTABLISHED RADIOCHEMICAL METHODS OF
            SEPERATION WERE USED TO ISOLATE THE ELEMENTS OF
            INTEREST AFTER DISSOLUTION OF THE CATCHER FOIL
            IN HYDROCHLORIC ACID. RECOVERY YIELDS WERE DETERMINED
            BY WEIGHING OR BY TITROMETRY (PR) OR BY
            SPECTROPHOTOMETRY (RU).
DETECTOR   (PROPC) END-WINDOW GAS FLOW PROPORTIONAL COUNTER
            OF THE SUGARMAN TYPE. TO REDUCE BACKGROUND THE
            COUNTER WAS SHIELDED WITH GEIGER-MULLER COUNTERS
            OPERATED IN ANTI-COINCIDENCE.
