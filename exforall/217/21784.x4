TITLE      -A systematic study of (n,d), (n,n+p) and (n,p+n)
            reactions at 14.7 MeV-.
FACILITY   (NGEN,2GERJUL) .Neutron generator, DYNAGEN.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) 300 keV deuterons incident on a rotating
            Ti(T) target. The neutron flux density was about
             3.x 10**9 /cm2/sec.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation techniques.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A 35 cm3 Ge(Li) detector was used in almost
            all cases except for the case of V-49 where a Si(Li)-
            detector was employed. The radioactivity of Y-91
            was determined using a low-background anticoinci-
            dence beta-counter.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) Served as a neutron
            monitor.
ADD-RES    (COMP) .Hauser-Feshbach calculations on the
            (n,d) reaction has been performed to compare with
             experimental results.
CORRECTION .For -
            - decay,
            - gamma-ray abundances,
            - counting efficiency,
            - geometry,
            - absorption,
            - chemical yield,
            - interfering reactions leading to the same product
              nucleus.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).Total error were obtained by combining all
            estimated random and systematic errors in quadrature.
