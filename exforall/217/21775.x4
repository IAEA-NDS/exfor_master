TITLE      -THE U-235 FISSION SPECTRUM AVERAGED CROSS SECTION
            FOR THE HG-199(N,N')HG-199M REACTION PROCESSED WITH
            COVARIANCES BETWEEN THE DATA UNCERTAINTIES. -
FACILITY   (REAC ,2JPNKTO) KUR (HEAVY WATER THERMAL REACTOR)
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) + U-235 PLATE (1 CM THICK, 27 CM IN EFFECTIVE
            DIAMETER WITH 1.1 KG OF 90 PERCENT ENRICHED URANIUM)
INC-SPECT  .FISSION SPECTRUM FROM U-235 PLATE.
SAMPLE     .POWDER OF PURE HG2SO4 WAS PRESSED INTO A PELLET OF
            10 MM IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 2.5 MM THICK.  ISOTOPE
            ABUNDANCE OF HG-199 = 16.8 PERCENT.
           .INDIUM FOIL FOR FLUX MONITOR.  ISOTOPE ABUNDANCE OF
            IN-155 = 95.7 PERCENT.
METHOD     .HG AND IN SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED ON THE FISSION
            PLATE.
           .TWO GAMMA LINES OF 158 AND 375 KEV FROM HG-199M WERE
            MEASURED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) 40CC. FOR GAMMA RAYS.
            THE DETECTOR WAS CALIBRATED WITH STANDARD GAMMA-RAY
            SOURCES OF MN-54, CO-60, BA-133 AND CS-137.
MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,INL)49-IN-115-M,,SIG)
