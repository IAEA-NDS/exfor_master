TITLE       Fission fragment mass and energy distributions

METHOD     (COINC) Double energy measurement.
            Mass and momentum conservation relations and the
            Shmitt-Neiler calibration are used to convert the
            pulse heights to energies. The nu-bar versus
            fission fragment mass curve was used to obtain
            the pre-neutron masses and energies.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two large Si(Au) surface barrier detectors,
            which were cooled at a constant temperature to
            obtain a good long-term stability of the measuring
            chains.
COMMENT     The average masses and energies do no vary
            much with the resonance energy or spin.
            However is statement is subject to precaution
            for the case of the spin, since several Pu-239
            spin assignments remain questionable.
            The 6.5 MeV additional excitation in the
            case Pu-239 + N leads only to 1 MeV additional
            fragment energy compared to the system Pu-240 s.f.

COMMENT     Since the nu-bar versus mass curve was not

            Pu-239, taking into account the respective
            total nu-bar values. This is justified since
            for all fissioning isotopes the nu-bar versus
            mass distributions are very similar.
