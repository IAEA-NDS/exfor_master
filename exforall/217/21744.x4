TITLE      -Fission fragment mass and energy distributions
            for the neutron induced fission of Pu-239 as
            functions of the resonance spins.-
METHOD     (COINC) Double energy measurement.
            Mass and momentum conservation relations and the
            shmitt-neiler calibration are used to convert the
            pulse heights to energies. The nu-bar versus
            fission fragment mass curve was used to obtain
            the pre-neutron masses and energies.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two large Si(Au) surface barrier detectors,
            which were cooled at a constant temperature to
            obtain a good long-term stability of the measuring
            chains.
COMMENT    .The average masses and energies do no vary
            much with the resonance energy or spin.
            However is statement is subject to precaution
            for the case of the spin, since several Pu-239
            spin assignments remain questionable.
           .The 6.5 MeV additional excitation in the
            case Pu-239 + N leads only to 1 MeV additional
            fragment energy compared to the system Pu-240 S.F.

            Pu-239, taking into account the respective
            total nu-bar values. This is justified since
            for all fissioning isotopes the nu-bar versus

SAMPLE     .Pu-O(2), 96.023 percent enriched, 40 micrograms/
            cm**2, 60 mm diameter sprayed onto a vyns backing
            of 50 micrograms/cm**2 thickness. The total mass
            of the Pu was 1.13 mg.
           .An additional run was done with a Pu-F(3)
            sample. It was 99.956 percent enriched, 65
            micro-grams/cm**2 thick, with a diameter of
            20 mm, and was prepared by evaporation onto
            a 20 micrograms/cm**2 thick poly-imide backing.
            The total mass of the Pu was 204 micrograms.
FLAG       (1.) Poorly separated resonances
            the spin of the dominating resonance is taken into
            account.
           (2.) Contains also the 14.68 eV resonance.
