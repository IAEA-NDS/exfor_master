FACILITY   (ACCEL,2ITYISR) Li,B,and Be targets were bombarded with
           deuterons of 0.8 MeV produced by the 1 MeV equipment of
           the Instituto Superiore di Ssanita.
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) For neutrons of 4.1 MeV.
            Deuteron-boron for neutrons of 12.5 MeV.
           (D-LI) For neutrons of 13.5 MeV.
SAMPLE      Light paraffin (C(32)-H(66),assumed by the author)
            Heavy paraffin (C(35)-H(72),assumed by the author)
            Graphite.
            The thickness of the samples varied between
            1.4 and 15.9 g/cm2
METHOD     (COINC)
            recoil protons fast enough to pass an Al-absorber were
            detected in a coincidence telescope. The energy of
            the protons was in a narrow energy interval close to
            the end of the source neutron spectrum. The
            minimum energy was defined by the absorber thickness.
            Thus, nearly monoenergetic neutrons with 4.1MeV
            12.5MeV and 13.5MeV could be produced.
            For the highest neutron energy an additional
            detection method was used to check the results
            obtained by the above described method.
            Neutrons from the (Li-d) source passing the
            scattering foil were detected by means of the
            9.9 min activity produced in copper according
            to the Cu-63(n,2n)Cu-62 reaction (see REL-REF).
            Recoil protons projected in the forward direction.
DETECTOR   (COIN,PROPC,PROPC,PROPC)
            coincidence set of three proportional counters.
ANALYSIS    The given energy is a mean energy
FLAG       (1.) For the (Li+d) neutrons the results obtained
            by using two different detection methods has been
            averaged, although the corresponding mean energies
            are slightly different (13.5 MeV and 14.0 MeV).
