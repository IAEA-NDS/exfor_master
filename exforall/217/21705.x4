SAMPLE      A 199 micro-grams/cm**2 thick U-F(4) layer evaporated
            onto a gold foil backing of 2 microns thickness. Its
            isotopic enrichment was 99.524%. This sample was an
            optimum one for the reduction of the background
            from (alpha,p) and (n,p) reactions.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) A fully depleted dE-detector
            with a thickness of 95.6 microns, an active area of
            200 mm**2 and an energy resolution of better than
            25 keV for 5.5 MeV alphas. The dE-detector was covered
            with a 20 microns thick Al-foil to stop the alpha
            particles from spontaneous decay and the binary
            fragments. The E-detector had a thickness of 1500
            microns and an energy resolution of 23 keV.
COMMENT     The energy distribution of the protons was Gaussian.
            The true LRA yield value includes the non Gaussian
            alpha particles, probably produced in the
            decays of He-6 and He-5.
ANALYSIS  1.    This value was obtained using the true LRA-yield,
            i.e. From the integration of a non Gaussian energy
            distribution.
          2.    This value was obtained using an extrapolated
            incorrect LRA-yield, from the integration of an
            extrapolated Gaussian energy distribution.

CORRECTION Since the ternary alpha-particles were detected between
           6.1 MeV and 28.1 MeV, the measured integrated yield was
           corrected for the parts of the spectrum above 28.1 MeV
            (0.1 %) and between 0. and 6.1 MeV, which corresponds
           only to a small fraction of the total yield. This
           fraction was calculated based on the results for the
           235U(n'th,f) ternary alpha-distribution, which resulted
           in a correction of + (3.7 +- 1)%.
