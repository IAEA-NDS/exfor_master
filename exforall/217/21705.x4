SAMPLE     .A 199 micro-grams/cm**2 thick U-F(4) layer evaporated
            onto a gold foil backing of 2 microns thickness. Its
            isotopic enrichment was 99.524 percent. This sample
            was an optimum one for the reduction of the
            background from (a,P) and (N,P) reactions.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) A fully depleted DE-Detector
            with a thickness of 95.6 microns, an active area of
            200 mm**2 and an energy resolution of better than 25
            KeV for 5.5 MeV alphas. The DE-Detector was covered
            with a 20 microns thick Al-foil to stop the alpha
            particles from spontaneous decay and the binary
            fragments. The E-detector had a thickness of 1500
            microns and an energy resolution of 23 KeV.
COMMENT    .The energy distribution of the protons was gaussian.
           .The true LRA yield value includes the non gaussian
            alpha particles, probably produced in the
            decays of He-6 and He-5.
ANALYSIS  1.    This value was obtained using the true LRA-yield,
            I.E. From the integration of a non gaussian energy
            distribution.
          2.    This value was obtained using an extrapolated
            uncorrect LRA-yield, from the integration of an
            extrapolated gaussian energy distribution.

            from vorobiev et Al., Pl/B,40(1972)102.
PART-DET   (P) Protons emitted in ternary fission.
           (D) Deutons emitted in ternary fission.
           (T) Tritons emitted in ternary fission.
           (A) Long range alphas (monitor).
COMMENT    .The monitor value includes the non gaussian
            alpha particles, probably produced in the
            decays of He-6 and He-5.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error.
STATUS     .Data taken from text in reference.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),TER,AKE,LCP,MXW) Average kinetic
            energy of He-8 particles emitted in ternary fission.
SAMPLE     .A 3.6 micro-grams/cm**2 U-F(4) layer on a 10 microns
            aluminium backing.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) A 26.7 microns thick de-
            detector (active area 300 mm**2, energy
            resolution about 35 KeV) and a 500 microns
            thick E-detector (active area 450 mm**2,
            energy resolution 40 KeV) this detector assembly
            was shielded with a 20 microns thick aluminium
            foil against binary fragments and spontaneous
            decay alphas.
           (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) An unshielded telescope,
            DE-Detector of 33.9 microns, E-detector 500
            microns thick.
COMMENT    .The He-8 particles have a gaussian energy distri-
            bution.
           .Detectors energy calibrated using the following alpha
            energies, U-234 and U-235 spont. Alpha emission,
            Nd-142(N,a) and Li-6(N,a) reactions.
           .Fwhm = 9.3 MeV.
STATUS     .Data taken from table 3.4 of thesis of P.d'Hondt.
