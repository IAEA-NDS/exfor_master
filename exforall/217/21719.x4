TITLE      -THE AVERAGE CROSS SECTION OF THE MN-55(N,2N) REACTION
            IN A FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR-2 REACTOR, S.C.K. MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL FLUX OF 1.76 10**14 N/CM2/SEC
            DETEMINED BY COBALT AND SILVER MONITORS.
INC-SPECT  .THE EQUIVALENT FISSION SPECTRUM FLUX WAS
            MEASURED USING THE FOLLOWING THRESHOLD REACTIONS..
            S-32(N,P),NI-58(N,P),FE-54(N,P),AL-27(N,A) AND
            NI-58(N,2N). THE RATIO OF THERMAL TO EPITHERMAL FLUXE
            WAS FOUND TO BE 23.7 . EQUIVALENT FISSION FLUXES
            DERIVED FROM MEASUREMENTS WITH THE FIVE THRESHOLD
            REACTION MONITORS VARIED BY 17 PERCENT, BUT WITHOUT
            ANY SYSTEMATIC TREND WITH THRESHOLD ENERGY.
SAMPLE     .TWO SPEC PURE MN3 O4 SAMPLES OF 11.52 AND 12.20 GM
            WERE IRRADIATED IN A STANDARD GRAPHITE CONTAINER, 5.4
            CM HIGH AND 1.9 CM DIAMETER. ALL SAMPLES WERE PACKED
            IN QUARTZ TUBES AND IRRADIATED FOR 15 HOURS.
            THE MANGANESE CONTENT OF THE SAMPLES WAS DETERMINED BY
            POTENTIOMETRIC TITRATION IN A PYROPHOSPHATE SOLUTION
            AND BY PRECISION SPECTROPHOTOMETRY. THE MEAN VALUE WAS
            71.3 PERCENT COMPARED WITH A THEORETICAL VALUE OF 72.0
            PERCENT.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION. MEASUREMENT OF THE 303 DAY MN-54
            ACTIVITY.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GE(LI) DETECTOR.

CORRECTION .THE NI-58(N,P) MONITOR VALUES WERE CORRECTED FOR
            BURN-UP OF THE CO-58 PRODUCT USING THE KNOWN THERMAL
            NEUTRON FLUX.
            MANGANESE SAMPLES WERE CHECKED FOR FE-54 IMPURITIES
            AND NO INTERFERING ACTIVITY WAS FOUND.
ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATED BY COMPILOR AS 17 PERCENT,
            REPRESENTING THE SPREAD IN EFFECTIVE FISSION FLUXES
            FROM THE FIVE MONITORS.
