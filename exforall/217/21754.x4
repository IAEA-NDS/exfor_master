TITLE       Independent yields of Rh-102m,Rh-102g and Rh-101g
            for thermal-neutron-induced fission of U-235.
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) Munich research reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) In the core of Munich research reactor.
            Average thermal neutron flux and equivalent fission
            flux were 2.0 x 10**13 and 4.0 x 10**12 n/cm**2/s.
SAMPLE      U-235 sample consisted of two small fuel plates.
            Each was composed of Al-U alloy containing 1.45 gr
            of metallic U enriched to 92.81% U-235.
            Rhodium metal, to measure the amount of Rh-102m,g
            by Rh-103(n,2n) reaction.
METHOD     (INTB) Irradiated for 358 hr.
           (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR) A coaxial Ge(Li) detector with a 16.9%
            photopeak efficiency relative to a 3x3 in. NaI(Tl)
            crystal and a resolution of 2.1 keV for 1.33 MeV
            gamma-ray of Co-60. The detector was set up in a 20
            cm thick lead cave.
CORRECTION  Coincidence correction by comparing the photopeak
            efficiencies of the detector for the measured gamma-
            transition of a Rh-102m,g standard source.
            Contributions from Rh-103(n,2n)Rh-102.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Including statistical errors and errors in
            the decay schemes and detector efficiency calibration,
            in the determination of chemical yields and in the
            measurement of the fission rate.
STATUS     .Data were taken from table 1 of main reference.
