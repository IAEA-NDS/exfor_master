TITLE      -INDEPENDENT YIELDS OF RH-102M,RH-102G AND RH-101G
            FOR THERMAL-NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION OF U-235.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) MUNICH RESEARCH REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IN THE CORE OF MUNICH RESEACH REACTOR.
            AVERAGE THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX AND EQUIVALENT FISSION
            FLUX WERE 2.0E+13 AND 4.0E+12 N/CM**2.S.
SAMPLE     .U-235 SAMPLE CONSISTED OF TWO SMALL FUEL PLATES.
            EACH WAS COMPOSED OF AL-U ALLOY CONTAINING 1.45 GR
            OF METALLIC U ENRICHED TO 92.81 PERCENT U-235.
           .RHODIUM METAL, TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF RH-102M,G
            BY RH-103(N,2N) REACTION.
METHOD     (INTB ) IRRADIATED FOR 358 HR.
