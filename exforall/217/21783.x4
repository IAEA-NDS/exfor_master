TITLE      -POLARIZATION IN NEUTRON PROTON SCATTERING AT 95 MEV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO) 110 INCH HARWELL CYCLOTRON
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) PARTIALLY POLARIZED NEUTRON BEAM
            A SOLENOID, ACTING ON THE NEUTRON'S MAGNETIC MOMENT,
            WAS USED TO ROTATE THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION THROUGH
            90 DEGREES IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN 90 DEGREES IN
            THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
            THE MAXIMUM NEUTRON ENERGY WAS 120 MEV WITH A
            SPECTRUM SHAPE APPROXIMATELY TRIANGULAR FROM 75 MEV
            TO THE MAXIMUM.
SAMPLE     .LIQUID HYDROGEN TARGETS.
METHOD     (COINC) COINCIDENCE TO MEASURE RECOIL PROTONS
           (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT TO MEASURE THE SCATTERED
            NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) LIQUID SCINTILLATION COUNTER USED TO DETECT THE
            SCATTERED NEUTRONS. THE COUNTER WAS PLACED 2 M FROM
            THE TARGET.
           (BF3) BORON TRIFLUORIDE SLOW NEUTRON DETECTOR USED AS
            BEAM MONITOR.
           (TELES) TWO FOUR-UNIT SCINTILLATION TELESCOPES
            ARRANGED IN TRIPLE COINCIDENCE PLUS ANTICOINCIDENCE.
ANALYSIS   .UNPOLARIZED DIFFERENTIAL CROSS-SECTIONS FOR FREE N-P
            SCATTERING WERE OBTAINED BY INTERPOLATING BETWEEN
            THE RESULTS OF STAHL (PR,96,1310,54) AT 91 MEV, THE
            RESULTS OF RANDLE ET AL (PPS,A69,760,56) AT 133 MEV,
            AND OF THRESHER ET AL (PRS,A229,492,55) AT 105 MEV.
            THE VALUE OF THE POLARIZATION IN THE INCIDENT BEAM
            WAS 0.088 +-0.007 AT 95 MEV, OBTAINED BY COMBINING
            THE RESULTS OF VOSS AND WILSON (PM,1,175,56) AT
            97 AND 104 MEV WITH THE RESULTS AT 95 AND 99 MEV
            FROM THE SAME AUTHORS IN (NC,4,67,56).
            THE INCIDENT POLARIZATION WAS MEASURED BY
            SCATTERING THE NEUTRON BEAM OFF URANIUM.

CORRECTION .NON LINEAR RESPONSE OF THE SCINTILLATOR AS A FUNCTION
            OF ENERGY CORRECTED FOR. A CORRECTION WAS APPLIED TO
            MEASUREMENTS MADE WITH THE NEUTRON COUNTER AT CENTRE
            OF MASS ANGLES OF 22.5, 29.8 AND 41.0 DEGREES AS THE
            BACKGROUND RUNS WERE MADE WITH THE HYDROGEN TARGET
            FILLED WITH AIR.
ERR-ANALYS .DRIFTS IN ELECTRONICS WAS LESS THAN 1 PERCENT,
            THE ANGULAR RESOLUTION OF THE NEUTRON DETECTOR
            INDUCED ERRORS OF LESS THAN 3 PERCENT.
