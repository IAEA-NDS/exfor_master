TITLE      -Measurement of the depolarization factor D for the
            reaction D(n,n)D at 2.45 MeV-.
FACILITY   (VDG)   Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) The reaction C-12(d,n)N-13 was used to pro-
            duce a neutron beam with polarization -0.45.
SAMPLE     .A deuterated scintillator containing C6D6 liquid
            (NE 230).
METHOD     (TOF)  Time of flight techniques between the
            second scatterer and the two detectors.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Polarimeter containing one liquid helium
            scatterer and two plastic scintillators (NE102A)
            as symmetry detectors.
ADD-RES    .Phase-shift analysis between 0 - 3.27 MeV was also
            undertaken
CORRECTION .Background subtracted,
           .to eliminate false asymmetry, measurements were also
            performed with incoming neutrons of opposite pola-
            rization, using a superconducting coil magnet to
            change the sign of the incident polarization.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The quoted errors are statistical.
