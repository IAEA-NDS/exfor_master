           (P,NEANDC(OR)-152L,3,7906) ABSTRACT, ONLY TABLE WITH
            DEPOLARIZATION FACTORS.
AUTHOR     (D.BOVET,P.CHATELAIN,R.VIENNET,J.WEBER)
TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE DEPOLARIZATION FACTOR D FOR THE
            REACTION D(N,N)D AT 2.45 MEV-.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) THE REACTION C-12(D,N)N-13 WAS USED TO PRO-
            DUCE A NEUTRON BEAM WITH POLARIZATION -0.45.
SAMPLE     .A DEUTRATED SCINTILLATOR CONTAINING C6D6 LIQUID (NE
            230).
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT TECHNIQUES BETWEEN THE
            SECOND SCATTERER AND THE TWO DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) POLARIMETER CONTAINING ONE LIQUID HELIUM
            SCATTERER AND TWO PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS (NE102A)
            AS SYMMETRY DETECTORS.
COMMENT    .EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH PHASE-SHIFT
            ANALYSIS.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM MAIN REFERENCE.
HISTORY    (810109C) CN.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND SUBTRACTED,
           .TO ELIMINATE FALSE ASYMMETRY, MEASUREMENTS WERE ALSO
            PERFORMED WITH INCOMING NEUTRONS OF OPPOSITE POLA-
            RIZATION, USING A SUPERCONDUCTING COIL MAGNET TO
            CHANGE THE SIGN OF THE INCIDENT POLARIZATION.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) THE QUOTED ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
