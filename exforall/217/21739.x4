TITLE      -THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF NEUTRONS BY BORON -.
FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT-WALTON.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) 150 DEUTERIUM BEAM ON TRITIUM TARGET.
            NEUTRONS MODERATED IN THE WATER SOLUTION.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .BORAX SOLUTIONS, B2O3, ANALAR BORAX, TOTAL WEIGHT
            VARIED FROM ZERO TO 11.5 KG IN A TANK OF 600 GALS
            VOLUME. THE TANK WAS LINED WITH PARAFIN WAX AND WAS
            FILLED WITH DEMINERALISED WATER.
           .THE VALUME OF THE TANK WAS MEASURED BY A CALIBRATED
            WATER FLOW METER AND BY DIRECT WEIGHING OF THE CONTEN
           .THE MEAN TEMPERATURE WAS 18 DEG CENTIGRADE.
METHOD     .DYNAMIC METHOD, IN WHICH THE DECAY CONSTANT OF NEUTRO
            IN A WATER TANK IS PLOTTED AGAINST THE CONCENTRATION
            OF ADDED BORAX.
           .THE DECAY CONSTANT OF DECAY GAMMAS FROM THE B(N,A)
            REACTION WAS MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF CONCENTRATION
            OF BORAX FOR SEVERAL DISTANCES OF THE SCINTILLATION
            COUNTER FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NO DETAILS.
PART-DET   (G    ) DECAY GAMMAS FROM BORON(N,A).
