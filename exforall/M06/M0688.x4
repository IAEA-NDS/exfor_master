FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron storage ring  TERAS  at  the
            National  Institute  of  Advanced Industrial Science
            and Technology (AIST).
INC-SOURCE (MPH,LASER) Pulsed   537   nm  Nd-YLF  laser  Compton
            backscattered (LCS) gamma-ray beam.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     A 244 mm in diameter x 400 mm vessel  filled  with  a
            mixed gas of 80 %  enriched 3He (99.7 %  enriched in
            3He) as a target for  photodisintegration  reactions
            and 20   %   CH4   as  an  operational  gas  of  the
            TPC-detector. The total pressure - 1066 bar at  22.3
            C.
DETECTOR   (TRD) The  4PI time projection chamber (TPC) consists
            of a drift region with a uniform electric field with
            an active  area of 60 x 60 mm**2 and a length of 250
            mm, and  a  multiware  proportional  counter  (MWPC)
            region with one anode and two catode planes.
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Quated  uncertainty  is the  result  of  the
            combined uncertainties  on  the  statistics  of  the
            reaction yield,  and  a  systematic  uncertainty  of
            about 3  %,  2 %  from the incident  gamma-ray flux,
            1 % from the target number of 3He, and less than 1 %
            from the effective length of the TPC.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Calculated  results  obtained  using  current
            theory  based  on  AV18 potential.
           (MISC2) Calculated  results  obtained  using  current
            theory  based on  AV18  +  Urbana IX nuclear forces.

COMMENT    A simultaneous  measurement  of the cross sections of
            the 3He(g,p)D  and  3He(g,pp)n  reactions  has  been
            performed  for  the  first  time using monoenergetic
            pulsed gamma-rays at  <Eg>  =  10.2  and  16.0  MeV.
            Charged  fragments  from the reactions were detected
            with an  efficiency  of  100  %  using  a  4PI  time
            projection  chamber  containing  3He  gas  an active
            target.  The incident gamma-ray flux was measured by
            a gamma-ray detector. Both the track and energy loss
            signals of charged fragments  were  obtained  in  an
            off-line  analysis  and used to clarify identity the
            reaction channel.  Thus,  the (g,p) and (g,pp) cross
            sections    have    been   determined   with   small
            uncertainty. A comparison of the new data to current
            theory  based  on  AV18  +  Urbana IX nuclear forces
            including PI- and RHO-like meson  exchange  currents
            shows  a  severe  discrepancy at 10.2 MeV,  while at
            16.0 MeV data and theory agree within  about  12  %.
            Three-nucleon   force  effects  are  small,  but  in
            general shift the theory in the correct direction.
