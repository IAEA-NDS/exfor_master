TITLE      High-resolution study  of  the 12C(g,pg')11B reaction
            using a HpGe detector to resolve excited  states  of
            11B  through  the  observation  of  their  gamma-ray
            decays.

FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND)
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) Tagged   photon   facility   at  the  MAX-lab,
            University of Lund.
SAMPLE     Target was  a 100x100 mm rigid graphite slate (99.5 %
            purity) of  physical  thickness  ~  2.5  mm   (562.5
            mg/cm**2).
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,HPGE) Solid-state   detector   telescope
            which comprised two DSSSDs  (double-sided  Si  strip
            delta-E detector) and HpGe detector,  which measured
            proton emission angle and energies, respectively.
           (HPGE) Coaxial HpGe detector that had a relative peak
            efficiency of  70  %  for  the detection of 1.33 MeV
            gamma-rays, placed  with the front face 70  mm  from
            the  target  at  an angle  of  95 degree to the beam
            direction and subtended a solid angle of ~ 700 msr.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE,GSPEC) Decay gamma-spectra measurements in
            coincidence with reaction photoprotons.
CORRECTION Energy spectra Doppler-shift correction.
ANALYSIS   Final corrected deexcitation  gamma-ray  spectrum was
            unfolded using   the   responce  functions  for  all
            gamma-lines  to produce the final  fit,  from  which
            the number of  counts  included  in  each full-energy
            peak was determined.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No   information   on   the   sources   of
            uncertainties.
COMMENT    Relative population  of  states  in 11B following the
            12C(g,p)11B reaction have been  measured  with  high
            resolution using 70 % HpGe gamma-detector to observe
            decay  gamma-rays  from  the  residual  nucleus. The
            triplet of states near 7 MeV in 11B are resolved and
            measured populations compared to previous data.  The
            analysis includes a  consideration  of  gamma-proton
            angular correlations,  which was  not  made  in  the
            previous  measurement.  The new and previous results
            corrected  for  angular  correlation  effects  agree
            reasonably  well  with calculatons that include one-
            and two-body nuclear currents,  pion  exchange,  and
            DELTA   currents,  under  the  assumption  that  the
            photons are mainly absorbed on exchanged pions.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the Table 3.
            Data were   compiled   at   the  MSU  SINP  CDFE  by

CRITIQUE   There is  discrepancy  between  the  corresponding to
            each other data presented in the Table 3 and on  the
            Fig.  13:  in  the  table  cross  sections  have the
            following values - 1.12 (6.79 MeV)  and  0.78  (7.29
            MeV), but on figure vise versa - 0.78 and 1.12.
