INC-SOURCE (QMPH,COMPT) Quasimonochromatic  gamma-rays  produced
            by means of laser Compton backscattering (LCS).  The
            energy spread of the LCS gamma-ray beam  was  0.8  -
            1.6 MeV in full width at half maximum.

COMMENT    Photoneutron cross   sections  for  181Ta(g,n)180Ta-m
            were determined from  simultaneous  measurements  of
            total cross   sections  (SIG-tot)  and  ground-state
            cross sections     (SIG-gs)     for     180Ta     in
            photodisintegration of  181  Ta  with  laser Compton
            backscattering   gamma-rays.   Techniques  of direct
            neutron counting and photoactivation  were  used for
            measurement of SIG-tot and SIG-gs, respectively. The
            partial cross  sections for the someric state serves
            as a novel probe of nuclear level density of 180 Ta.
            Imlications for    the    p-    and   s-   processes
            nucleosynthesis of 180Ta-m are given.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data from Table 2 have been  compiled  at
            the MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
CRITIQUE   There is  mistake in the data head of first column of
            the Table 2: Eg(MeV) must be, not Eg(mb).
           The initial photon energy values in  Table  2  differ
            from those in text (9.2 instead of 9.19, 9.7 - 9.73,
            10.5 - 10.47,  10.9 - 10.87,  11.5 - 11.54,  12.3  -
            12.29.

METHOD    T(RINGR) Direct  neutron counting measurement of total
            photoneutron cross section using 20 3He proportional
            counters  (three  concentric  rings of 4,  8,  and 8
            detectors)  embedded  at  38,   70   and   100   mm,
            respectevely   from   the  axis  in  a  polyethilene
            moderator.

          M(DIFFR) 180Ta  is the one and only naturally occuring
            isomer. It is present in nature in an isomeric state
            at excitation  energy   of   75.3   keV   with   the
            spin-parity 9-. The isomer has the half-life greater
            than 1.2 x 10**15 yr, in contrast to the short-lived
            ground state (1+;  8.152 h) in 180Ta.  Therefore the
            subtracting procedure was used:  SIG-m = (SIG-tot) -
             (SIG-gs).
ERR-ANALYST(ERR-SYS) The  systematic  uncertainty is 4.4 %  (3 %
            for initial  photon  flux  and  3.2  %  for  neutron
            detection efficiency).
          G(ERR-SYS) The  systematic  uncertainty for the ground
            state cross sections is 3 %.
          M(ERR-SYS) The  systematic uncertainties were obtained
            using the procedure specially described.
