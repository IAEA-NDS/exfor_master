INC-SOURCE (LCS) Quasimonochromatic gamma-rays produced by means
            of laser Compton backscattering (LCS), lambda = 532
            nm laser photons were used. The energy spread of the

           half maximum.

            photoneutron cross section using 20 3He proportional
            counters (three concentric rings of 4, 8, and 8
            detectors) embedded at 38, 70 and 100 mm,
            respectively from the axis in a polyethylene
            moderator.

          M 180Ta is the one and only naturally occurring isomer.
           It is present in nature in an isomeric state at
           excitation energy of 75.3 keV with the spin-parity 9-.
           The isomer has the half-life greater than
           1.2 x 10**15 yr, in contrast to the short-lived ground
           state (1+; 8.152 h) in 180Ta. Therefore the subtracting
           procedure was used: SIG-m = (SIG-tot) - (SIG-gs).     M
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
          T(ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty is 4.4% (3% for
            initial photon flux and 3.2% for neutron detection
            efficiency).
          G(ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty for the ground
            state cross section is 4.6%.
          M(ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainties were obtained
            using the procedure specially described in text.
COMMENT    Photoneutron cross sections for 181Ta(g,n) 180Ta-m
            were determined from simultaneous measurements of
            total cross sections (SIG-tot) and ground-state cross
            sections (SIG-gs) for 180Ta in photodisintegration of
            181Ta with laser Compton backscattering gamma-rays.
            Techniques of direct neutron counting and
            photoactivation were used for measurement of SIG-tot
            and SIG-gs, respectively. The partial cross sections
            for the isomeric state serves as a novel probe of
            nuclear level density of 180Ta. Implications for the
            p- and s- processes nucleosynthesis of 180Ta-m are
            given.
