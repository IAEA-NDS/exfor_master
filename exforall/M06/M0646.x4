METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
INC-SOURCE (LCS) High-Intencity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS) at  Duke
            Free-Electron  Laser (FEL) Laboratory:  scanning 383
            mm (3.24 eV) FEL light from 270 MeV electrons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 5-cm diameter BC501A neutron detectors.
SAMPLE     Liquid scintillator (C-6)(D-12) 3.7  cm  in  diameter
            and 4.18 cm long.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The first  measurement  of the 2H(g-pol,n)p analyzing
            power near threshold has been  performed  using  the
            High-Intensity Gamma-ray  Source  (HIGS) at the Duke
            Free-Electron Laser Laboratory.  A  3.58  MeV  g-ray
            beam having an energy resolution of 2.5 %  and 100 %
            linear polarization  was  incident  on   an   active
            liquid scintillating  (C-6)(D-12)  target.  Outgoing
            neutrons were detected parallel and perpendicular to
            the plane of g-ray polarization at a  lab  angle  of
            150 degree.  The experimentally determined analyzing
            power provide a sensitive  measurement  of  the  the
            relative  E1 and M1 contributions to the total cross
            section.
