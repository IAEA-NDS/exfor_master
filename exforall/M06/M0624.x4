HISTORY    (20020205C)
COMMENT    PHOTOPROTON SPECTRA  OF  CALCIUM HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT
            BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT ENERGIES 19.5 AND 20.5  MEV.
            BY SUBTRACTION  A  PROTON  SPECTRUM  CORRESPONDING TO
            PHOTON ABSORPTION  IN  THE  RANGE  20.0   (0.5)   WAS
            OBTAINED. THE PROTON SPECTRA SHOW WELL RESOLVED PEAKS
            CORRESPONDING TO TRANSITIONS TO THE GROUND STATE  AND
            EXCITED STATES  AT 2.9 AND 5.9 MEV.  THESE STATES ARE
            ASSUMED TO BE THE SINGLE-PARTICLE HOLE STATES IN  39K
            WITH SPIN   VALUES  D-3/2,  S-1/2  AND  D-5/2.  THESE
            ASSIGNMENTS ARE  SUPPORTED   BY   A   COMPARISON   OF
            EXPERIMENTAL BRANCHING     RATIOS     AND     ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTIONS WITH THEORETICAL VALUES  CALCULATED  ON
            THE BASIS OF THE RESULTS OF BROWN ET.AL. PUBLISHED IN
            NUCL.PHYS.,22 (1957) 359.
