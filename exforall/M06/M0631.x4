INC-SOURCE (BRST)
FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) M-30 microtron.
SAMPLE     The sample of natural 45Sc was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced 44sc g-activity was measured:  T-1/2-G
            = 3.92 H, T-1/2-M = 2.44 D.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
COMMENT    The results of experimental studies of the isomer
            ratios of the 44sc-m,g nuclei in the (g,n), (p,n),
            (p,ap3n), (a,p3n) reactions are presented. A
            comparison has been made with the calculation
            performed within the framework of the
            cascade-evaporation model and results obtained in the
            (n,2n), (d,t), and other reactions.
