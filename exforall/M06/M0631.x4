TITLE      Isomer ratios investigation of the 44Sc-m,g nuclei.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) M-30 microtron.
SAMPLE     The sample of natural 45Sc was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced 44sc g-activity was measured:  T-1/2-G
            = 3.92 H, T-1/2-M = 2.44 D.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) GE-detector.
STATUS     (CURVE)  Data  were  prepared  at the msu inp cdfe  by
            V.V.Varlamov.
COMMENT    The results of  experimental  studies  of  the  isomer
            ratios of  the  44sc-m,g nuclei in the (g,n),  (p,n),
            (p,ap3n), (a,p3n)   reactions   are   presented.    A
            comparison has   been   made   with  the  calculation
            performed within     the     framework     of     the
            cascade-evaporation model and results obtained in the
            (n,2n), (d,t), and other reactions.
