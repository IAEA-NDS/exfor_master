SAMPLE     THE SAMPLE OF NATURAL 45SC WAS USED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) INDUCED 44SC G-ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED:  T-1/2-G
            = 3.92 H, T-1/2-M = 2.44 D.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) GE-DETECTOR.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
STATUS     (CURVE)  DATA  WERE  PREPARED  AT THE MSU INP CDFE  BY
            V.V.VARLAMOV.
