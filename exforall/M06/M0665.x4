ANALYSIS   The measured photofission yield was converted into
            absolute photofission cross section by summing the
            contributions to fission events due to all photons of
            energy between the photofission threshold and
            end-point energy in energy spectrum of the incident
            photons.

COMMENT    Monochromatic photon beams have been used to
            investigate the photofission of 27Al at 69 MeV with
            plastic nuclear-track detectors. The measured
            fissility was found to be 5.7 (1.6) x 10**(-2). This
            result, along with the available data for 154Sm and
            174Yb nuclei taken at the same energy, has been
            interpreted within the framework of a two-step model
            for the photofission reaction. According to this
            model the incoming photon is considered to be
            absorbed by a neutron-proton pair, and then followed
            by an evaporation-fission competition for the excited
            residual nucleus. The measured fissility values are
            seen to be in satisfactory agreement with the
            calculated ones, and the predictions from the model
            are confirmed, specially in the region of light
            fissioning systems.
CRITIQUE   There is the discrepancy between fissility data in
            article text - 5.7 (1.6) and abstract - 5.7 (1.1)).
