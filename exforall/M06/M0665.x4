ANALYSIS   The measured  photofission  yield  was converted into
            absolutr photofission cross section by  summing  the
            contributions  to  fission events due to all photons
            of energy between  the  photofission  threshold  and
            end-point  energy in energy spectrum of the incident
            photons.
ERR-ANALYS Sum of statistical ans sistematic errors.
COMMENT    Monochromatic photon  beams   have   been   used   to
            investigate  the photofission of 27Al at 69 MeV with
            plastic  nuclear-track   detectors.   The   measured
            fissility  was found to be 5.7 (1.6) x 10**-2.  This
            result,  along with the available data for 154Sm and
            174Yb  nuclei  taken  at  the same energy,  has been
            interpreted within the framework of a two-step model
            for  the  photofission  reaction.  According to this
            model  the  incoming  photon  is  concidered  to  be
            absorbed by a neutron-proton pair, and then followed
            by  an  evaporation-fission  competition   for   the
            excited  residual  nucleus.  The  measured fissility
            values are seen to be in satisfactory agreement with
            the  calculated  ones,  and the predictions from the
            model are confirmed,  specially  in  the  region  of
            light fissioning systems.
CRITIQUE   There  is  the discrepancy between  fissility data in
            article text - 5.7 (1.6) and abstract - 5.7 (1.1))
STATUS     (TABLE) The data were published in digital form.
