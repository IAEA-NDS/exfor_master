INC-SOURCE (BRST) The    photon    beam    was   generated   via
            bremsstrahlung of  the  electron  beam  in  thin  Cu
            radiator 1m upstream of the deuterium target.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Particles from target were momentum  analyzed
            and identified using the SLAC 1.6 GeV/c spectrometer
            instrumented  with  a  new   detector   package   of
            scintillator  hodoscopes  in  combination with drift
            chambers plus a threshold Cerenkov detector.

METHOD     (MAGFR)
SAMPLE     Two sets of targets.  The criogenic targets consisted
            of  three  pairs of 5 cm diameter flasks,  each pair
            comrising nominal 4 cm and 15 cm long flasks  filled
            with liquid deuterium,  liquid hydrogen, and vacuum,
            respectively.  Seven additional targets -  all  thin
            0.33 g/cm**2 carbon slabs.
ANALYSIS   The cross section at each photon energy and angle was
            extracted from four separate  measurements:  (1)  Cu
            radiator  and  liquid  deuterium (LD2) target in the
            beam (Nrd);  (2) Cu  radiator  and  liquid  hydrogen
            (LH2)  target  in the beam (Nrh);  (3) LD2 target in
            the beam and no radiator (Nod);  and (4) LH2  target
            in the beam and no radiator. The yield from deuteron
            photodesintegration was obtained from the  following
            expression: Nd = (Nrd - Nrh) - (Nod - Noh).
           The measured photofission yield  was  converted  into
            absolute  photofission  cross section by summing the
            contributions to fission events due to  all  photons
            of  energy  between  the  photofission threshold and
            end-point energy in energy spectrum of the  incident
            photons.
ERR-ANALYS Statistical errors.
COMMENT    The differential  cross  sections  for  the  reaction
            2H(g,p)n has been measured at several center-of-mass
            angles  ranging  from  50  to  143 degree for photon
            energies between 0.8 and 1.8 GeV. The experiment was
            performed  at the SLAC-NPAS facility with the use of
            the 1.6 GeV/c spectrometer to detect the high energy
            protons  produced  by a bremsstrahlung beam directed
            at a liquid  deuterium  target.  Contributions  from
            concurrent  disintegration  by the residual electron
            beam were determined by measuring the  proton  yield
            without  the Cu photon radiator.  At angles not very
            far from 90 degree,  the energy  dependence  of  the
            cross  sections  is  consistent  with predictions of
            scaling  using  counting  rules   for   consitituent
            quarks.  At  least one theoretical calculation based
            on a meson-baryon picture of the reaction is able to
            reproduce the magnitude and energy dependence of the
            90 degree cross section.  The  angular  distribution
            exhibits  a  large enhancement at backward angles at
            the higher energies.
