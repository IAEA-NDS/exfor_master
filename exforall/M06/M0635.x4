ANALYSIS   The typical  differences  between Saclay and Livermore
            data are the following at the same time:
            - as  a rule total photoneutron reaction (g,xn) cross
              section values (both amplitude and integrated cross
              section  values) obtained  at Livermore are smaller
              and  must  be  multiplied  by  special  coefficient
              (about 5 - 15%);
            - the  (g,n) reaction (in fact - the sum of reactions
              (g,n) + (g,np))  cross section differ both in shape
              and magnitude,   these   of  Livermore  being  much
              smaller;
            - the  (g,2n)  reaction  cross section differ both in
              shape and magnitude,  these of Livermore being much
              bigger.
            Because two  laboratories  data  for  (g,xn) reaction
            cross section obtained without  neutron  multiplicity
            sorting  for  all gamma  energies disagree each other
            by about several percents,  but data  for  (g,n)  and
            (g,2n)  obtained  using neutron multiplicity sorting,
            disagree much more and in opposite sides  (while  the
            integrated (g,n) cross sections form Saclay are about
            40 % bigger than the Livermore data, their integrated
            (g,2n)   reaction  cross  sections  are  about  50  %
            smaller) on the base that Saclay neutron multiplicity
            sorting  procedure was not correct,  the Saclay (g,n)
            and (g,2n) reaction cross section data were modified.
            The equation
             sig-2n-S-mod = sig-2n-S + 1/2*(sig-n-S - R*sig-n-L)
            gives to  one  the  possibility to obtained evaluated
            (corrected, modified) Saclay cross  section  data  by
            transmitting  back  into  the  (g,2n)  reaction cross
            section  part  of  (g,n)   reaction   cross   section
            incorrectly putted  into  this channel.  The constant
            values R using for each investigated nucleus  in  the
            modification   formula   were   obtained   as  ratios
            (sig-xn-S)/(sig-xn-L) for total photoneutron reaction
            (g,xn)  cross  section  data  obtained  at Saclay and
            Livermore (in good agreement with previously  founded
            for big systematics value R-syst = 1.122 (0.243)).
            Because the  evaluated  (corrected)   Saclay   (g,2n)
            reaction  cross  section  was  obtained  by  addition
            (moving back) the  "false"  part  of  (g,n)  reaction
            cross section
                            1/2*(sig-n-S - r*sig-n-L)
            the evaluated (corrected) Saclay (g,n) reaction cross
            section was obtained by subtraction of  that  "false"
            part
                sig-n-S-mod =  sig-n-S  -  (sig-n-S - r*sig-n-L),
            where part in brackets is calculating in the range of
            energies more  than  (g,2n) reaction threshold,  from
            correspondent (g,n) reaction cross  section  obtained
            at Saclay.
            At the  same  time  Livermore  evaluated data for all
            three kinds of reactions ((g,xn), (g,n),  and (g,2n))
            were obtained by multiplication by coefficient R.
REL-REF    (E,,E.Wolinec+,J,RBF,17,56,1987) method for correction
            of (g,n)  and  (g,2n)  reaction  cross  section  data
            caused by   the   difference  in  the  analysis  that
            separates the total counts of neutrons into (g,n) and
            (g,2n) events.

COMMENT    The accurate system analysis of the (g,xn),  (g,n) and
            (g,2n)  reaction cross section data obtained by using
            quasimonoenergetical  annihilation  photon  beems  at
            Livermore  (USA)  and Saclay (France) was carried out
            for 19 (for 7 - at  first)  nuclei  51V,  75As,  89Y,
            90Zr,   115In,  116,117,118,120,124Sn,  127I,  133Cs,
            159Tb,  165Ho,  181Ta,  197Au, 208Pb, 232Th, 238U. It
            was  observed  that the (g,xn) reaction cross section
            data obtained  at  both  laboratories  without  using
            neutron multiplicity sorting procedure disagree by 10
            - 15 %.  Additionally  it  was  found  out  that  the
            disagreement  of  partial  reactions (g,n) and (g,2n)
            cross sections,  obtained at both laboratories  using
            neutron    multiplicity    sorting    procedure   are
            significantly more (till 30 - 40 %)  and  as  a  rule
            have  opposite  directions.  These disagreements were
            interpreted as the result of  difference  of  neutron
            multiplicity   sorting   procedures   used   in  both
            laboratories:  that is incorrect at Saclay  with  the
            result  of  uncorrect  transmission  of  the  part of
            (g,2n) reaction cross section into the (g,n) reaction
            cross  section.  The  special method was used to move
            the  data  into  consistence.  Its   idea   is   that
            correspondent  "false"  part  of (g,n) reaction cross
            section is recalculated  and  transmitted  back  into
            (g,2n)  reaction  cross  section.  For  all 19 nuclei
            listed the jointly corrected (g,xn), (g,n) and (g,2n)
            reaction  cross  sections were evaluated and prepared
            for  including  into  the  EXFOR   nuclear   reaction
            database.
