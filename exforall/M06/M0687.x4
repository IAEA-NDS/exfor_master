INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) Tagged photons obtained at the Laboratory
            of  Nuclear  Science (LNS) of Tohoku University - an
            electron  beam  of  89.5  MeV  from  300-MeV  linear
            accelerator  injected into the Sendai Stretcher Ring
            (SSTR) and extracted with an average duty factor  of
            ~  80  %,  bremsstrahlung photons were produced by 3
            micro-meter  gold  radiator  and  tagged  by  recoil
            electrons  which  were momentum analyzed in a photon
            tagging spectrometer.
SAMPLE     Target sample consisted of 98 % isotopically enriched
            13C powder,  pressed into  a  thin-walled  aluminium
            cylinder,  226  mm long and 70 mm in a diameter with
            100 micromm thick Mylar film on both ends, thickness
            is 4270 mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Three  identical  NE213  liquid   scintillator
            detectors, thin plastic scintillator as veto counter
            placed in front of each neutron detector.
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path of  2.5 m  with timing uncertainty
            delta-t = 0.72 ns (FWHM).
ANALYSIS   The absolute  cross  sections  were  deduced from the
            experimental yields taking into account  the  number
            of target atoms,  the number of tagged photons,  the
            photon tagging efficiency and the attenuation of the
            photons and neutrons in the target and the materials
            between the target and neutron detectors.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data   received   by   e-mail   from  K.Maeda
            (2006.03.19) with help of N.Otsuka.
ADD-RES    Forward (55  deg)  to backward (125 deg) asymmetry of
            13C(g,n)12C reaction -  [Y(55)  -  Y(125)]/[Y(55)  +
            Y(125)].
COMMENT    The photoneutron cross section for 13C  was  measured
            in the  tagged photon energy range Eg = 17 - 70 MeV.
            Substantial forward  to   backward   asymmetry   was
            observed above  the  giant  dipole resonance region.
            The observed asymmetries were analyzed by the direct
            and semi-direct  model,  assuming  two  isovector E2
            resonances, which locate at Ex = 39.9 (1.5) MeV with
            width =  8  (6) MeV and Ex = 43.2 (1.8) with width =
            13 (6) MeV.  They are identified as the  T>  and  T<
            isospin components   of   the  isovector  quadrupole
            strength, which exhaust most of the sum rule.
HISTORY    (20060330C) Data from Fig.5 compiled at the MSU  SINP
            CDFE  by Vladimir Varlamov used data tables obtained
            from Kazushige Maeda with the help of Naohiko Otsuka.
