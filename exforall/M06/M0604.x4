TITLE      HIGH-ENERGY PHOTOFISSION CROSS  SECTIONS  OF  URANIUM
            AND THORIUM.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (GLASD) MICROSCOPE SLIDE GLASS PLATES.
SAMPLE     NATURAL URANIUM  (100  MICROG/CM**2) AND THORIUM (120
            MICROG/CM**2) TARGETS.
ANALYSIS   (PLA) PENFOLD-LEISS METHOD.
CORRECTION THE CONTRIBUTION FROM FISSION BELOW 200 MEV HAS  BEEN
            SUBTRACTED.
ERR-ANALYS NO INFORMATION.
COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION   CROSS   SECTIONS   PER  EQUIVALENT
            QUANTUM OF URANIUM AND THORIUM HAVE BEEN MEASURED IN
            THE  BREMSSTRAHLUNG  ENERGY RANGE 200 TO 900 MEV.  A
            GLASS  DETECTOR  WAS  USED  TO  DETECT  THE  FISSION
            FRAGMENTS.  FISSION CROSS SECTIONS ARE OBTAINED FROM
            THE  INTEGRATED  CROSS  SECTION  USING  PENFOLD  AND
            LEISS'S METHOD.  IT IS FOUND THAT PHOTOFISSION CROSS
            SECTIONS OF BOTH URANIUM AND THORIUM SHOW  RESONANCE
            PEAKS  AT A PHOTON ENERGY OF 350 MEV,  WITH THE PEAK
            VALUES OF 80 AND 60 MB RESPECTIVELY. IT IS SUGGESTED
            THAT  IN  A  HIGH-ENERGY  PHOTOFISSION,  THE FISSION
            MECHANISM  CAN,  AT  LEAST  IN  PART,  BE   DUE   TO
            PHOTOMESON PRODUCTION PROCESSES.
STATUS     (CURVE) DATA  FROM THE FIGURE 4 HAVE BEEN COMPILED AT
            THE RUSSIA MSU INP CDFE BY V.VARLAMOV.
