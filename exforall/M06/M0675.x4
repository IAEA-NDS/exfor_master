TITLE      Photoneutron cross  section  measurements  on   186W,
            187Re and 188Os for cosmocronology.
CRITIQUE   The 188Os data are published only  (as  mentioned  in
            Abstract).

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,COMPT) Quasimonochromatic     Laser     Compton
            scattering (LCS)  g-ray  beam  with  typical  energy
            resolution of 10 % FWHM.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 3He proportional counters.
METHOD     (RINGR) 16 3He  proportional  counters  embeded  in a
            polyethilene moderator  cube  in  double  concentric
            (inner (7  cm distance from beam axis) and outer (10
            cm distance  from  beam  axis))  rings;  ring  ratio
            between neutron  counts  of  the  inner  and   outer
            counters  was  used to determine the average neutron
            energy.
SAMPLE     Metallic powders of 186W, 187Re and 188Os enriched to
            99.79,  99.5 and 95.0 %,  respectively, were pressed
            to self-supporting tablets with a diameter of 8 mm.
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement.
ERR-ANALYS Statistical errors.
COMMENT    Cross sections of the 186W,187Re,188Os(g,n) reactions
            were measured using quasimonochromatic  g-ray  beams
            from laser Compton scattering (LCS), and results for
            the latter reaction are presented.  Neutron  capture
            cross sections   of   the   inverse  reactions  were
            evaluated by    the    Hauser-Feshbach   statistical
            calculation where the experimantal data were used to
            constrain the model parameters, especially by the E1
            strength function.  The  influence  of  the  neutron
            capture by the 9.75 keV first excited state in 187Os
            which is substantially populated in stellar  plasmas
            at typical  s-process  temperatures  is  examined in
            connection with the 187Re - 187Os cosmocronology.
STATUS     (CURVE) The data from Fig.  1 have been digitized  at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
