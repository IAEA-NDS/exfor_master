INC-SOURCE (MPH,COMPT,LASER)  Tagged  photons  produced  by  the
            compton   and    backscattering   gamma   quanta  at
            backscattering  laser  photon facility ROKK-2 at the
            VEPP-3 storage ring.
FACILITY   (ESTRG,4RUSSIB) ROKK-2 facility of  Budker  Institute
            of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk.
SAMPLE     The bismuth  targets  consisted  of high-purity metal
            films prepared by vacuum evaporatuion  on  alumonoum
            plates  300  micron  thick.  The  targets  (4  cm in
            diameter) were licated insude the  FF  vessel  at  a
            distance  of  3 mm  from the multiwire spark counter
            anodes.
DETECTOR   (MWSC) Nuclear fission fragment detector (FF) based on
            multiwire spark counters (SC).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
ANALYSIS   The direct fission fragment track counting.

STATUS     (CURVE) Data from Fig.  2 were compiled at the Russia

COMMENT    Tagged photons  produced  by the ROKK-2 facility have
            been used to measure the photofission cross  section
            of 209Bi  in the energy range 60 - 270 MeV.  Fission
            events were detected by  using  a  nuclear  fragment
            detector based    on   multiwire   spark   counters.
            Fissility values have been deduced and compared with
            available data  obtained  with monochromatic photons
            in othder  laboratories.  These   data   have   been
            analysed in  the  framework of a two-step model wich
            considers the primary photointegration occuring  via
            the quasi-deuteron  and/or  photomesonic  processes,
            followed by   mechanism    of    evaporation-fission
            competition for  the  excited residual nucleus.  The
            model was found to reproduce the  main  experimental
            features of 209Bi photofissility up to 300 MeV.
