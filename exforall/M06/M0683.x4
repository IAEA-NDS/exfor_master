SAMPLE     Np and Am oxides with width 50  micro-gramm/cm**2  on
            Al foil with width 20 micro-mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Hyperpure   germanium   detector,  100  cm**3,
            resolution of 2.1 keV for Eg = 1332 keV (60Co).
METHOD     (GSPEC) Kr and Xe isotopes were identified by the
            decay gammas emitted by them or by their daughters
            for short-lived (T1/2 < 1 min) Kr and Xe isotopes.
           (HEJET) Only Kr and Xe isotopes having T1/2 > 0.2 sec
            and their decay products were transported and
            measured.
REL-REF    (R,,E.Browne+,B,BROWNE,,,1986) Source of decay data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The independent  yields  of fragments of Kr (A = 89 -
            93) and Xe (A = 135 - 142) from photofission of  odd
            nuclei   237Np   and   243Am   are   presented.  The
            experiments were performed using the  bremsstrahlung
            of 25 MeV electrons of the microtron of FLNR JINR. A
            technique  was used that includes the transportation
            of fragments escaped from the target  with  the  gas
            flow  through  a  capillary  and the condensation of
            inert gases in a  cryostat  at  the  temperature  of
            liquid nitrogen.  Kr and Xe isotopes were identified
            by the g-spectra of  their  daughter  products.  The
            mass  number distributions of the independent yields
            of Kr and  Xe  isotopes  and  of  the  complementary
            fragments  (Y and La at photofission of 237Np and Nb
            and Pr at the photofission of 243Am) were obtained.
