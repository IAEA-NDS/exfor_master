FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron storage ring TERAS at the
            National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
            Technology (AIST).
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Tunable quasimonochromatic photon beam
            generated by Laser Compton scattering (LCS) of laser
            photons. The typical energy resolution was 10 % in
            FWHM.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 3He proportional counters (EURISYS MESURES
            96NH45).
METHOD     (RINGR) 16 3He proportional counters embedded in a
            polyethylene moderator were used. Two sets of eight
            counters were placed in double concentric (inner and
            outer) rings at 7 and 10 cm from the beam axis. Time
            correlations between neutron signal and the laser
            pulse were measured to estimate the number of
            neutrons that arrived randomly at the 3He detector.
SAMPLE     Metallic powders of 1246 mg 186W, 996 mg 187Re, and
            693 mg 188Os enriched to 99.79, 99.52 and 94.99%,
            respectively, were pressed to self-supporting tablets
            with a diameter of 8 mm. The 188Os powder included
            major contaminants of 189Os (2.55%), 190Os (1.27%)
            and 192Os (0.97%).
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors
           (ERR-SYS) Systematical uncertainties are dominated by
            the efficiency of the neutron detector (5%) and the
            gamma-ray flux (3%).
COMMENT    Cross sections of the 186W,187Re,188Os(g,n) reactions
            were measured using quasimonochromatic photon beams
            from laser Compton scattering with average energies
            from 7.3 to 10.9 MeV. The results are compared with
            the predictions of Hauser-Feshbach statistical
            calculation using four different sets of input
            parameters. In addition, the inverse neutron capture
            cross sections were evaluated by constraining the
            model parameters, especially E1 strength function, on
            the basis of the experimental data. The present
            experiment helps to further constrain the correction
            factor F-sigma for the neutron capture on the 9.75
            keV state on 187Os. Implications of Fsigma for Re-Os
            cosmochronology are discussed with a focus on the
            uncertainty in the estimate the age of a galaxy.
CRITIQUE   The 188Os data published differ from the same data
            published in NP/A,778,561,2005: from comparison of
            this ENTRY (M0676) article Fig. 4c with that (M0675)
            article Fig. 1 it looks like that one data line (EN =
            9.93, SIGMA = 60.2, ERR = 4.8, see SUBENT M0675002)
            was omitted or missed (see SUBENT M0676004)
