TITLE      Photodisintegration cross  section  measurements   on
            186W,  187Re  and 188Os:  Inplications for the Re-Os
            cosmocronology.
CRITIQUE   The 188Os  data  published  differ from the same data
            published in  NP/A,778,561,2005:  from comparison of
            this ENTRY (M0676) article Fig. 4c with that (M0675)
            article Fig.  1 it looks like that one data line (EN
            =  9.93,  SIGMA  =  60.2,  ERR  =  4.8,  see  SUBENT
            M0675002) was   omitted   or   missed   (see  SUBENT
            M0676004).

FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron  storage  ring  TERAS at the
            National Institute of  Advanced  Industrial  Science
            and Technology (AIST).
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,COMPT) Tunable quasimonochromatic  photon  beam
            genarated by Laser Compton scattering (LCS) of laser
            photons.  The typical energy resolution was 10 %  in
            FWHM.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 3He  proportional  counters  (EURISYS MESURES
            96NH45).
METHOD     (RINGR) 16 3He  proportional  counters  embeded  in a
            polyethilene moderator were used.  Two sets of eight
            counters were placed in double concentric (inner and
            outer) rings at 7 and 10 cm from the beam axis. Time
            correlations between neutron signal  and  the  laser
            pulse  were  measured  to  estimate  the  number  of
            neutrons that arrived randomly at the 3He detector.
SAMPLE     Metallic powders of 1246 mg 186W,  996 mg 187Re,  and
            693  mg 188Os enriched to 99.79,  99.52 and 94.99 %,
            respectively,  were   pressed   to   self-supporting
            tablets with  a  diameter of 8 mm.  The 188Os powder
            included major contaminants of 189Os (2.55 %), 190Os
            (1.27 %) and 192Os (0.97 %).
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic  uncertainties  included   those
            associated  with the neutron detection efficiency (5
            %), the photon flux (3 %), and beam size effect (1 -
            6 %) added in quadrature.
COMMENT    Cross sections of the 186W,187Re,188Os(g,n) reactions
            were measured using quasimonochromatic photon  beams
            from  laser Compton scattering with average energies
            from 7.3 to 10.9 Mev.  The results are compared with
            the   predictions   of  Hauser-Feshbach  statistical
            calculation  using  four  different  sets  of  input
            parameters. In addition, the inverse neutron capture
            cross sections were evaluated  by  constraining  the
            model  parameters,  especially E1 strength function,
            on the basis of the experimental data.  The  present
            experiment helps to further constrain the correction
            factor F-sigma for the neutron capture on  thr  9.75
            ktV state on 187Os. Implications of Fsogma for Re-Os
            cosmochronology are discussed with a  focus  on  the
            uncertainty in the estimate the age of a galaxy.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data from Table 1 have been  compiled  at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
