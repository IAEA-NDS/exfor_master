COMMENT    The isomeric  ratios  in  the reactions (gamma,n) and
            (n,2n) leading to the production of odd-odd nuclides
            184Re, 190Ir, and 196Au  presented. The measurements
            were performed   by   activation   method   at   the
            irradiation of  natural  Re,  Ir,  and Au samples by
            14.7 MeV  neutrons  and  by  Bremsstrahlung  with  a
            end-point energy  of  22 MeV.  Identification of the
            obtained nuclei in isomeric and  ground  states  was
            made basing on their spectra of X or g radiation and
            the half-life.  A calculation of isomeric ratios was
            performed on the basis of statistical model, and the
            parameters describing the dependence  of  the  level
            density on   the   excitation   energy  and  angular
            momentum were  determined  from  the  comparison  of
            experimental and calculated values. The influence of
            the nuclear  structure  on   these   parameters   is
            discussed.
