INSTITUTE  (2JPNKON,2JPNKTO,2JPNAIS,1USATAM)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron  storage  ring  TERAS at the
            National Institute of  Advanced  Industrial  Science
            and Technology (AIST).
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,COMPT) The laser Compton scattering (LCS)  beam
            developed  at  the  National  Institute  of Advanced
            Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
METHOD     (RINGR) 16 3He proportional counters (EURISYS MESURES
            96NH45)  embeded  in  a polyethilene moderator;  two
            sets  of  eight  counters  are  mounted  in   double
            concentric rings at 7 and 10 cm,  respectively, from
            the beam axis.
SAMPLE     Heavy water   filled   a   4.0  cm  long  cylindrical
            container made of  aluminium  with  50-micron  Mylar
            foils being entrance and exit windows. The purity of
            the heavy water was determined to be 97 (1)  %  with
            NMR spectrometer.
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-1) Systematic errors. The systematic uncertainty
            has three sources:
            - the neutron emission rate of 252Cf source used for
               neutron detection efficiency measurement (~ 5 %),
            - the total flux of the LCS g-rays (~ 3 %),
            - angular distribution of neutrons (~ 2 %).
            The overall  systematic  uncertainty is 6.2 %  after
            adding three sources in quadrature.
COMMENT    Photodisintegration cross sections were measured  for
            deuterium  with  Laser-Compton scattering g-beams at
            seven energies near  threshold.  Combined  with  the
            preceding data,  R(E) = Na SIG  V  for  the  p(n,g)D
            reaction  is  for  the first time evaluated based on
            experimental data with 6%  uncertainty in the energy
            region  relevant  to  the  Big  Bang nucleosynthesis
            (BBN).   The   result   confirms   the   theoretical
            evaluation  on  which  the  BBN in the precision era
            relies.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data are published in digital form.
