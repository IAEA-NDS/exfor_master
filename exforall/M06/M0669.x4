COMMENT    A near-threshold 4He(g,n) cross section measurement
            has been performed at MAX-lab. Tagged photons from
            23 < Eg < 42 MeV were directed toward a liquid 4He
            target, and neutrons were detected by time-of-flight
            in two liquid-scintillator arrays. Seven-point
            angular distributions were measured for eight photon
            energies. The results are compared to experimental
            data measured at comparable energies and
            Recoil-Corrected Continuum Shell Model, Resonating
            Group Method, and recent Hyperspherical-Harmonic
            Expansion calculations. The angle-integrated cross
            section data are peaked at a photon energy of about
           28 MeV, in disagreement with value recommended by
            Calarco, Berman, and Donelly in 1983.
