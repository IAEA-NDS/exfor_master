FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND) Race-track  microtron   tagged-photon
            facility.
SAMPLE     A storage-cell  cryostat  held  the  liquid  4He   at
            liquid-N2 temperature.
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) Quasimonoenergetic      photons      from
            bremsstrahlung tagging.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,SCIN) Two large solid-angle spectrometres, each
            consisting of 9 20 cm x 20 cm deep rectangular cells
            mounted in  3  x  3  lattice  and filled with liquid
            scintillator NEA2132A.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight spectrometer consisted of liquid
            and plastic scintillators.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical uncertainties.
COMMENT    A near-threshold  4He(g,n)  cross section measurement
            has been performed at MAX-lab.  Tagged photons  from
            23 <  Eg  < 42 MeV were directed toward a liquid 4He
            target, and neutrons were detected by time-of-flight
            in two   liquid-scintillator   arrays.   Seven-point
            angular distributions were measured for eight photon
            energies. The  results  are compared to experimental
            data measured    at    comparable    energies    and
            Recoil-Corrected Continuum  Shell Model,  Resonating
            Group Method,  and  recent   Hyperspherical-Harmonic
            Expansion calculations.  The  angle-integrated cross
            section data are peaked at a photon energy of  about
            28 MeV,  in  disagreement  with value recommended by
            Calarco, Berman, and Donelly in 1983.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data  from  Figs 1 and 3.
HISTORY    (20060306C) Data were compiled at the MSU  SINP  CDFE
            by V.V.Varlamov.
