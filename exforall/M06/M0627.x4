DETECTOR   (SCIN,CSICR)
            Protons were detected in high resolution E-dE
             telescopes. The dE detectors consisted of 2.0 mm
             thick NE102A plastic scintillators. The E detectors
             were CsI(Tl) scintillation crystals 7.61 cm in
             diameter and 7.61 cm in length.
           The neutron energy was measured by a time-of-flight
            (TOF) method where the typical flight distances were
            about 7 m. The neutron detector consisted of an array
            of ten BC400 plastic scintillator bars, with
            dimensions 1.5 m x 0.15 m x 76 mm (thick), which were

COMMENT    The exclusive 16O(G,PN)14N-0,1,2,... reaction was
            measured for the photon energy range E(G) = 98.5 -
            141.0 MeV with an excitation energy resolution of 2.8
            MeV. Protons were detected at 76 and 82 degrees and
            coincident neutrons were detected at the opening
            angle for quasifree deuteron photodisintegration.
            Only the T = 0, 1+, 3.95 MeV state in the residual
            14N nucleus was significantly populated.  This
            corresponds to a preferred l = 0 angular momentum
            transfer to the recoil as is expected for quasifree
            kinematics. The absence of significant population  to
            other discrete states is evidence that absorption on
            correlated proton-neutron pairs with an angular
            momentum transfer of l >= 2 is largely suppressed for
            the low recoil momentum range of the current
            measurement.  As a consequence of this fact, and the
            absence of unnatural parity states, only absorption
            on proton-neutron pairs in relative motion l = 0, 2
            is expected for all possible shell model coupling. No
            significant population of the T = 1 state at 2.31 MeV
            is consistent with previous measurement demonstrating
            that absorption on proton-neutron pairs in an isospin
            triplet is suppressed. The results of the measurement
            to discrete states in the residual 14N nucleus are
            compared to microscopic calculations which include
            contributions above that the mean field due to the
            short range and tensor parts of the nuclear
            potential. Clear separation in the contribution of
            (1p)**-2 and (1p)**-1 (1s)**-1 continuum above 20 MeV
            indicates that absorption on l = 1 nucleon pairs is
            also important near quasifree kinematics.
