HISTORY    (20020404C)
COMMENT    THE EXCLUSIVE  16O(G,PN)14N-0,1,2,...   REACTION   WAS
            MEASURED  FOR  THE  PHOTON  ENERGY  RANGE EG = 98.5 -
            141.0 MEV WITH AN EXCITATION ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 2.8
            MEV. PROTONS  WERE  DETECTED  AT  76  AND  82 DEG AND
            COINCIDENT NEUTRONS  WERE  DETECTED  AT  THE  OPENING
            ANGLE FOR   QUASIFREE  DEUTERON  PHOTODISINTEGRATION.
            ONLY THE T = 0,  1+,  3.95 MEV STATE IN THE  RESIDUAL
            14N NUCLEUS   WAS   SIGNIFICANTLY   POPULATED.   THIS
            CORRESPONDS TO A PREFERRED L  =  0  ANGULAR  MOMENTUM
            TRANSFER TO  THE  RECOIL AS IS EXPECTED FOR QUASIFREE
            KINEMATICS. THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT POPULATION  TO
            OTHER DISCRETE  STATES IS EVIDENCE THAT ABSORPTION ON
            CORRELATED PROTON-NEUTRON  PAIRS  WITH   AN   ANGULAR
            MOMENTUM TRANSFER OF L >= 2 IS LARGELY SUPPRESSED FOR
            THE  LOW  RECOIL  MOMENTUM  RANGE  OF   THE   CURRENT
            MEASUREMENT.  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FACT,  AND THE
            ABSENCE OF UNNATURAL PARITY STATES,  ONLY  ABSORPTION
            ON  PROTON-NEUTRON PAIRS IN RELATIVE MOTION L = 0,  2
            IS EXPECTED FOR ALL POSSIBLE SHELL MODEL COUPLING. NO
            SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF THE T = 1 STATE AT 2.31 MEV
            IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS MEASUREMENT DEMONSTRATING
            THAT ABSORPTION ON PROTON-NEUTRON PAIRS IN AN ISISPIN
            TRIPLET IS SUPPRESSED.  THE RESULTS OF THE MEASUREMEN
            TO  DISCRETE  STATES  IN THE RESIDUAL 14N NUCLEUS ARE
            COMPARED TO MICROSCOPIC  CALCULATIONS  WHICH  INCLUDE
            CONTRIBUTIONS  ABOVE  THAT  THE MEAN FIELD DUE TO THE
            SHORT  RANGE  AND  TENSOR  PARTS   OF   THE   NUCLEAR
            POTENTIAL.  CLEAR  SEPARATION  IN THE CONTRIBUTION OF
            (1P)-2  AND  (1P)-1(1S)-1  CONTINUUM  ABOVE  20   MEV
            INDICATES  THAT  ABSORPTION ON L = 1 NUCLEON PAIRS IS
            ALSO IMPORTANT NEAR QUASIFREE KINEMATICS.
