SAMPLE     The samples of BaO,  Ce-2(O-3),  Nd-2(O-3),  Sm-2(O-3)
            oxydes were used (natural and enriched 136Ba  (95  %)
            138Ce (60 %),  144Sm (90 %) elements) all with weight
            of 200 mg.  Gases were enriched by isotopes 134Xe (90
            %) and 136Xe (95 %) and  used  inside  ampoules  with
            volume ~ 1 cm**3 at pressure of 1 atm.

COMMENT    The isomeric ratios (IR) were measured in the isotones
            with N = 81 (135Xe,  137Ba, 139Ce, 141Nd, and 143Sm).
            Isomers with   J-PI  =  11/2-  were  excited  in  the
            reactions (n,g),  (g,n),  and b+ - decay of 139Pr and
            141Pm. The    activation    methods   of   g-spectrum
            measurement was used. The marked difference of Ir was
            observed in  the  isotones  with the different atomic
            numbers Z but in the same reactions. The calculations
            of Ir   using   low-level   spectrum   and  radiation
            transitions on the base of the  quasiparticle  phonon
            model were  performed.  The satisfactory agreement of
            the measured and calculated Ir was obtained  for  all
            studied isotopes.  The  dependence  of  Ir  on  Z  is
            explained by the different  energy  of  reaction  and
            different probability   levels   population   of  the
            activation.
