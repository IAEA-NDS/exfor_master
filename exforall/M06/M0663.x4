FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron  storage  ring TERAS at AIST
            (Tsukuba, Japan).
INC-SOURCE (MPH,LCS)   Tunable  monochromatic photon source from
            laser Compton scattering - Laser Compton  Scattering
            photons, LCS.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Improved neutron  detector  consisted  of  16
            individual  3He  counters embedded in two rings in a
            polyethylene moderator.
METHOD     (RINGR) Direct measurement of photoneutrons using the
            ring-ratio method: ring-ratio (rr) between the count
            rates  of the inner and outer detector rings depends
            on the neutron energy,  and hence  rr  be  used  to
            estimate the neutron energy. That varied between 2.5
            and 4.4 leading to average neutron energies of about
            1.2  MeV at highest photon energies and of about 0.3
            MeV at lower photon energies.
SAMPLE     The target  consisted  of  1246  mg metallic tungsten
            powder highly enriched in 186W to 99.79 % The powder
            was pressed to a small self-supporting tablet with a
            diameter of 8 mm.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) For  estimation of the reaction cross section
            from the experimental reaction yield  the  unfolding
            procedure using the replacement of integral equation
            by Taylor series (because the difference (low-energy
            tail)  of  realistic  photon  spectrum from ideal is
            relatively small) was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematical  uncertainties  are  dominated
            by the efficiency  of the neutron detector (5 %) and
            the gamma-ray flux (3%).
STATUS     (TABLE)  Data of Table 1 of Phys.Rev.,C72(2005)025808
            were  compiled  at  the  Russia  MSU  SINP  CDFE  by

COMMENT    The neutron capture cross  section  of  the  unstable
            s-process  branching  nucleus  185W has been derived
            from  experimental  data  of  inverse  186W(g,n)185W
            photodisintegration  taken with monochromatic photon
            beams from laser Compton scattering.  The result  of
            SIG  =  553  (60)  mb  at  kT  =  30  keV leads to a
            relatively high effective  neutron  density  in  the
            classical  s-process  of Nn = 4.7 x 10**8 sm**-3.  A
            realistic  model  for  the  s-process  in  thermally
            pulsing  asymptotic giant branch stars overestimates
            the abundance of 186Os significantly because of  the
            relatively  small  neutron  capture cross section of
            185W.
