FACILITY   (ESTRG,2JPNAIS) Electron  storage  ring TERAS at AIST
            (Tsukuba, Japan).
INC-SOURCE (MPH,LASER) Tunable  monochromatic photon source from
            laser Compton scattering - Laser Compton  Scattering
            photons, LCS.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Improved neutron  detector  consisted  of  16
            individual  3He  counters embedded in two rings in a
            poliethilene moderator.
METHOD     (RINGR) Direct measurement of photoneutrons using the
            ring-ratio  method:  ring-ratio  between  the  count
            rates  of the inner and outer detector rings depends
            on the neutron energy,  and hence  cfn  be  used  to
            estimate the neutron energy. That varied between 2.5
            and 4.4 leading to average neutron energies of about
            1.2  MeV at highest photon energies and of about 0.3
            MeV at lower photon energies.
SAMPLE     The target  consisted  of  1246  mg metallic tungsten
            powder highly enriched in 186W to 99.79 % The powder
            was pressed to a small self-supporting tablet with a
            diameter of 8 mm.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) For  estimation of the reaction cross section
            from the experimental reaction yield  the  unfolding
            procedure using the replacement of integral eguation
            by Taylor series (because the difference (low-energy
            tail)  of  realistic  photon  spectrum from ideal is
            relatively small) was used.
ERR-ANALYS Statistical errors.
STATUS     (CURVE) The data from Fig.  3 have been digitized  at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
COMMENT    The neutron capture cross  section  of  the  unstable
            s-process  branching  nucleus  185W has been derived
            from  experimental  data  of  inverse  186W(g,n)185W
            photodisintegration  taken with monochromatic photon
            beams from laser Compton scattering.  The result  of
            SIG  =  553  (60)  mb  at  kT  =  30  keV leads to a
            relatively high effective  neutron  density  in  the
            classical  s-process  of Nn = 4.7 x 10**8 sm**-3.  A
            realistic  model  for  the  s-process  in  thermally
            pulsing  asymptotic giant branch stars overestimates
            the abundance of 186Os significantly because of  the
            relatively  small  neutron  capture cross section of
            185W.
