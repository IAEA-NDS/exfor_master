            (E,E'P) REACTION CROSS SECTIONS MEASURED  USING  THE

COMMENT    PHOTOPROTON ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE  BEEN  MEASURED
            FOR THE  (E,E'P)  REACTION AT A NUMBER OF BOMBARDING
            ENERGIES. THE RESULTS ARE  USED  TO  OBTAIN  (E,E'P)
            CROSS SECTIONS AND ISOCHROMATS.  THE  (E,E'P)  CROSS
            SECTIONS   ARE  ANALYZED  TO  GET  THE  (G,P)  CROSS
            SECTIONS.  THE RESULTS AND (G,P) CROSS SECTIONS SHOW
            A STRONG RESONANCE AROUND 25.0 MEV, WHOSE ENERGY AND
            INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION AGREE WELL WITH THEORY  FOR
            IAR.  PROTON  SPECTRA  EMITTED  THROUGH  THE IAR ARE
            EXTRACTED FROM THE PHOTOPROTON SPECTRA AND ALSO FROM
            THE  ISOCHROMATS.  STRONG PROTON GROUPS ARE FOUND AT
            AROUND 15.3 AND 11 MEV CORRESPONDING  TO  THE  H11/2
            PROTON  HOLE  STATE  AT  1.3  MEV  AND  ALSO NEUTRON
            PARTICLE-HOLE STATES AROUND 6 MEV  IN  THE  RESIDUAL
            NUCLEUS.  THE  RESULT  IS  IN  A GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
            ESTIMATES OBTAINED FROM PROTON SCATTERING ON  208PB,
            SHOWING THE CONFIGURATION OF THE IAR STATES.
STATUS     (CURVE) DATA FROM THE FIGURE 4.
            DATA WERE  COMPILED  AT  THE  RUSSIA MSU INP CDFE BY
