METHOD     (MAGFR) Browne-Buchner type    broad-range   magnetic
            spectrometer with 100 Si(Li)  solid-state  detectors
            in the focal plane.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting (12.42  mg/cm**2)   metal   foil   of
            natural tantalum (99.98 % 181Ta).
DETECTOR   (SILI)
ANALYSIS   (LEAST,INTAD) The  Cook least-square method for (g,p)
            reaction differential cross section  obtaining  from
            (e,e'p)  reaction  cross sections measured using the
            direct   proton   detection   with   the   following
            integration over angles.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Root-mean-squared errors.
COMMENT    The energy  distributions  and  the cross sections of
            the (e,e'p)  reaction  on 181Ta have been  measured.
            The derived  (g,p)  cross  section  shows  a  strong
            resonance  at  around  21 MeV which is identified as
            the T> giant  resonance.  Two  large  proton  groups
            were  found  in  the proton spectra measured at  E-e
            >  20.27 MeV.  These proton  groups  and  another
            small   proton   group  are  found  to  result  from
            resonance at around 21 MeV.  The proton  groups  are
            well  described  by  the calculation of the T> giant
            resonance with the Nilsson model.
