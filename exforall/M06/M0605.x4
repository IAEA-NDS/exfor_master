            REACTION DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION  OBTAINING  FROM
            (E,E'P)  REACTION  CROSS SECTIONS MEASURED USING THE
            DIRECT   PROTON   DETECTION   WITH   THE   FOLLOWING
            INTEGRATION OVER ANGLES.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
COMMENT    THE ENERGY  DISTRIBUTIONS  AND  THE CROSS SECTIONS OF
            THE (E,E'P) REACTION ON 181 TA HAVE  BEEN  MEASURED.
            THE DERIVED  (G,P)  CROSS  SECTION  SHOWS  A  STRONG
            RESONANCE AT AROUND 21 MEV WHICH  IS  IDENTIFIED  AS
            THE T> GIANT RESONANCE. TWO LARGE PROTON GROUPS WERE
            FOUND IN THE PROTON SPECTRA MEASURED AT E-E  >  20.0
            MEV. THESE  PROTON  GROUPS  AND ANOTHER SMALL PROTON
            GROUP ARE FOUND TO RESULT FROM RESONANCE  AT  AROUND
            21 MEV.  THE PROTON GROUPS ARE WELL DESCRIBED BY THE
            CALCULATION OF  THE  T>  GIANT  RESONANCE  WITH  THE
            NILSSON MODEL.
