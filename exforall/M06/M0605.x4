            spectrometer with 100 Si(Li)  solid-state  detectors
            in the focal plane.

ANALYSIS   (LEAST) The   Cook   least-square   method  for (g,p)
            reaction differential cross section  obtaining  from
            (e,e'p)  reaction  cross sections measured using the
            direct   proton   detection   with   the   following
            integration over angles.
COMMENT    The energy  distributions  and  the cross sections of
            the (e,e'p)  reaction  on 181Ta have been  measured.
            The derived  (g,p)  cross  section  shows  a  strong
            resonance  at  around  21 MeV which is identified as
            the T> giant  resonance.  Two  large  proton  groups
            were  found  in  the proton spectra measured at  E-e
            >  20.27 MeV.  These proton  groups  and  another
            small   proton   group  are  found  to  result  from
            resonance at around 21 MeV.  The proton  groups  are
            well  described  by  the calculation of the T> giant
            resonance with the Nilsson model.
