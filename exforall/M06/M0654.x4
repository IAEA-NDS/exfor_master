COMMENT    The yields of krypton isotopes with mass numbers 89 -
            93 were measured for photofission of 232Th and 238U.
            Experiments were   carried   out  on  the  NRL  JINR
            microtron at the  accelerated  electrons  energy  25
            MeV. For    identification   of   krypton   isotopes
            g-spectra measurement was used.
STATUS     (TABLE). Data are published in form of the table.
HISTORY    (20040511C) Data  were  compiled at the MSU SINP CDFE
            by V.V.Varlamov.
