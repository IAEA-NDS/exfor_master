           Isomer ratios  and  mean  angular momenta are obtained
            both for photofission products of 237Np, 238U and for
            nuclei 122,120m,gSb and 117m,gIn.
INSTITUTE  (4UKRKGU,4UKRIJD,4UKRIEP)
FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) M-30 microtron.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     The samples of thin aluminium plates covered by 237Np
            and 239U.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Hyperpure Germanium detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
COMMENT    The isomer  ratios  for   fission   fragments   84Br,
            129,130,132Sb,    131,133Te,    134I,   135Xe   from
            photofission of 238U  and  237Np  by  bremsstrahlung
            gamma-quanta  with  end-point  energy of 16 MeV from
            the  microtron  M-30  were  experimentally obtained.
            Average  angular  momenta   of   nuclei  of  fission
            products were calculated using the code EMPIRE II.
