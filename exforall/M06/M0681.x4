            Isomer ratios and mean angular momenta are obtained
            both  for photofission products of  237Np, 238U and
            for nuclei 122,120m,gSb and 117m,gIn.

SAMPLE     The samples of thin aluminium plates covered by 237Np
            and 239U.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.

            photofission of 238U  and  237Np  by  bremsstrahlung
            gamma-quanta  with  end-point  energy of 16 MeV from
            the  microtron  M-30  were  experimentally obtained.
            Average  angular  momenta   of   nuclei  of  fission
            products were calculated using the code EMPIRE II.
           Gamma-lines energy  and relative gamma-intensity data
