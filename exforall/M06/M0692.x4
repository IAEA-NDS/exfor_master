INC-SOURCE (MPH) High-resolution  (4 - 20 eV)  gamma-rays,  with
            discrete energies up to 10.83 MeV,  were produced by
            thermal neutron  capture  in  30  different   target
            materials, when   they   were  positioned  near  the
            reactor core:

COMMENT    Photofission cross  sections  for  237  Np  have been
            measured as a function of energy,  in  the  interval
            from 5.27  to 10.83 MeV.  The gamma-ray spectra were
            those produced by thermal  neutron  capture,  in  30
            different target  materials,  as  a  tangential beam
            hole of the Instituto  de  Pesquisas  Energeticas  e
            Nucleares IAE-R1  1-MW research reactor.  The set of
            experimental data  has   been   unfolded   employing
            least-squares methods   and  the  covariance  matrix
            methodology. The   determined   photofission   cross
            sections for  237Np,  together  with  the   complete
            orrelation  matrix  for  the  involved  errors,  are
            presented   and   are   compared    with    previous
            measurements   reported   in   the   literature.   A
            statisticl calculation for the 237  Np  photofission
            cross  sections  was performed,  and the results are
            compared with the experimental data.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the Table III were  compiled at the
            Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.Varlamov.

REL-REF    (N,,A.S.SOLDATOV+,R,INDC(CCP)-379,1994) The   overall
            agreement  is  reasonable  between  the   237Np(g,f)
            reaction  cross  section data obtained and evaluated
            before.
