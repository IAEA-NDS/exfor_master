COMMENT    New measurements  of  the  photoneutron  reaction  on
            181Ta have been conducted with the  AIST-LCS  (laser
            Compton  scattering)  beam  in  the  7.8  - 12.0 MeV
            energy range.  The major advantage  of  the  present
            g-ray  experiment  is  its  intense  peaking  in the
            energy window of astrophysical interest, i.e., close
            to  the  neutron threshold.  Details on photon beams
            from the laser Compton scattering, neutron counting,
            and   experimental   determination   of   the  181Ta
            photoneutron cross section are  given.  The  present
            experimental  data  are  in  good agreemrnt with the
            IAEA evaluation.  Reaction rate calculations at  the
            Hauser-Feashbach statistical model are performed and
            confronted with  the  experimental  data.  The  data
            provide  constraints  on  the low-energy tail of the
            dipole strength function.  It was found  that  among
            the  three  different  models  for  the  E1-strength
            considered,  only  the   microscopic   quasiparticle
            random phase  approximation  model can reproduce the
            extra  strength  observed  in  the   181Ta(g,n)180Ta
            reaction  at  energies  of  about  8.5 MeV.  Such an
            experiment helps to improve the determination of the
            corresponding  stellar  photodisintegration  rate of
            181Ta  which  directly  influences   the   p-process
            production of 180Ta.
STATUS     (CURVE) The data from Fig.  8 have been digitized  at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
