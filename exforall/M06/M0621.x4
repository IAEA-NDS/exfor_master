ANALYSIS   (AREA)
COMMENT    The 24Na and 28Mg radionuclides have been detected  by
            their   gamma-activity   using   radiochemistry.  The
            purified Th-targets were activated by  bremsstrahlung
            at end-point energies  E-E  =  12, 16.5, and  24 MeV.
            Possible backgrounds are carefully analyzed,  and the
            yields of the light nuclei have been found on a level
            of 10**(-6) per fission event.
