FACILITY   (LASER,3DDRJNA) Jena   University   multi   TW  laser
            system.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Very  high   intensity   near-infrared   laser
            radiation generate relativistic plasma,  which emits
            high-energy beams of photons,  neutrons,  electrons,
            protons and ions. The ponderomotive force of intense
            light  field,  which  is  the  light pressure of the
            pulse,  accelerates the  electrons  to  relativistic
            energies and  pulses  them  in the forward direction
            into the target (iodine).  Whithin the solid  target
            of  high  atomic number (tantalum) the hot electrons
            are stopped and generate Bremsstrahlung.
DETECTOR   (GE) Two germanium detectors.
METHOD     (ACTIV) After   irradiation,   gamma-radiation   from
            short-lived  photoreaction  products  in  the iodine
            (sample)   and   tantalum   (electron   source   and
            electron-to-Bremsstrahlung converter) was detected.
SAMPLE     The iodine  sample  (21 g of PbI-2 with 17%  of 129I)
            was plased behind the tantalum converter.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) 129I  was  photo-excited  to  emit  a  single
            neutron and   transmutate   to  128I,  which  has  a
            half-life of 25 min.  7%  of the 128I nuclei capture
            an electron  and  decay to 128Te.  The remaining 93%
            undergo beta-decay  into  the  stable  126Xe.   This
            beta-decay has  a  characteristic  g-line at 443 keV
            with an emission probability of I-g =  17%,  and  is
            used to   monitor  successful  photo  transmutation.
           The procedure of  129I(g,n)128I  estimation  was  the
            following. At  first the photon spectrum n(E) of the
            laser in terms of  a  temperature  and  an  absolute
            yield was  determined.  For this the additional data
            on the   activation   of   the    thermoluminescence
            spectrometers and  of  the  tantalum  Bremsstrahlung
            converter were   used.   At   last    this    photon
            distribution was used to calculate the maximum (g,n)
            raction cross section value.
ERR-ANALYS The maximum cross section value for the 129I(g,n)128I
            reaction was obtained to be accurate within a factor
            of two.  For maximum cross  section  value  obtained
            SIGMA  = 220 mb.  it means:  SIGMA = 110 - 440 mb.
STATUS     (CURVE) The  data  from Fig.4  have been digitized at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.V.Varlamov.
COMMENT    The first successful laser-induced  transmutation  of
            129I, one  of  the  key radionuclides in the nuclear
            fuel cycle is reported.  129 I with a  half-life  of
            15.7 million years is transmutated into 128 I with a
            half-life of 25 min trough a  (g,n)  reaction  using
            laser-generated  Bremsstrahlung.  The integral cross
            section value for the (g,n) reaction is  determined.
            These  experiments  offer a new approach to studying
            transmutation reactions  with  neutral  and  charged
            particles  without  resiurce  to nuclear reactors or
            particle accelerators.
