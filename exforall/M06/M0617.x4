INC-SOURCE (MPH=(22-TI-0(N,G))) EG   =   6.418   AND   6.759  MEV
            (WEIGHTED AVERAGE 6.56 MEV).
           (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G))) EG   =   8.533   AND   8.998  MEV
            (WEIGHTED AVERAGE 8.8 MEV).
           MONOCHROMATIC PHOTONS FROM NEUTRON  RADIATIVE  CAPTURE
            REACTIONS.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET  C0NSISTS OF A 45X70 MM**2, SELF-SUPPORTING
            METALLIC NATURAL LITHIUM FOIL  (92.5%  7LI  and  7.5%
            6LI), 100 OR 50 MICRON THICK (DEPENDING ON THE PHOTON
            ENERGY).
DETECTOR   (SILI) SEVEN  SILICON  STRIP  DETECTORS.
           THE DISTANCE  FROM  THE  DETECTOR TO THE CENTER OF THE
            TARGET WAS 17 CM,  WITH FULL DETECTOR (ALL 16 STRIPS)
            SOLID   ANGLE   OF  0.09  SR.  THE  DETECTOR  ANGULAR
            ACCEPTANCE (FOR A POINT TARGET) WAS +- 8.4 DEGREE.
METHOD     (EXTB)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT MEASUREMENTS.
           AT EG  = 6.56 MEV SUM 20%  OF INTENSITY IS DISTRIBUTED
            AMONG SEVERAL LOW INTENSITY LINES.
           AT EG  =  8.8 SUM MEV 25%  OF INTENSITY IS DISTRIBUTED
            AMONG SEVERAL LOW INTENSITY LINES.
           THE BACKGROUND  FROM  THE  REACTION  N  + 6LI -> T + A
            CAUSED BY NEUTRONS FROM BOTH BEAM  CONTAMINATION  AND
            BACKGROUND IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AREA WAS EVALUATED AND
            SUBTRACTED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) MEAN-ROOT-SQUARE   ERRORS.    BANDS    WERE
            OBTAINED BY  RECONSTRUCTING  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CROSS
            SECTIONS FROM THE PUBLISHED LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS.
CORRECTION MEASURED  ANGULAR  DISTRIBUTIONS  WERE  NORMALIZED  TO
            UNITY AT ANGLE = 90 DEG.
COMMENT    ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS   OF   TRITONS  EMITTED  IN  THE
            REACTION 7LI(G,T)A HAVE BEEN MEASURED FOR TWO  PHOTON
            ENERGY  INTERVALS (6.4 - 6.7 AND 8.5 - 9.0 MEV),  AND
            THETA-T BETWEEN 30 AND 150 DEG. MONOCHROMATIC PHOTONS
            FROM  NEUTRON  CAPTURE  REACTIONS OF THE IPEN/CNEN-SP
            IEA-R1 RESEARCH REACTOR WERE USED.  THE MEASURED DATA
            WERE  ANALYZED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN A-CLUSTER MODEL
            FOR THE 7LI STRUCTURE.  RESULTS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT
            WITH  A  RECENT  MEASAUREMENT  OF THE AZIMUTHAL CROSS
            SECTION ASYMMETRY.
STATUS     (APRVD) BY M.N.MARTINS.
            DATA FROM  THE  FIGURES  4,  5  WERE  COMPILED AT THE
            RUSSIA MSU INP CDFE BY V.VARLAMOV.
