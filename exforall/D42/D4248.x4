SAMPLE     (69-TM-169,NAT=100) Evaporated metallic thulium onto
           0.002 mm  aluminium backing. The mass of the foils had
           been  measured before and after the evaporation and
           from  the difference - assuming that the evaporated
           layer  is uniform - the number of target atoms were
           calculated. The absolute number of target atoms and
           the uniformity have also been determined by PIXE
           method.The precision of the determination of the
           number of target atoms was better than 3% and the
           thickness was found to be uniform within 2%. The
           agreement between the results of the two methods used
           for thickness determination is within 4%.

METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,GSPEC,XSPEC) Targets have been irradiated
           with alpha beams from the cyclotron of ATOMKI. The
           investigated energy range between E = 11.5 and 17.5
           MeV, was covered with 0.5-1 MeV steps with a beam
           current of typically 2 microA. After the
           beam-defining aperture, the chamber was insulated and
           a secondary electron suppression voltage of -300V was
           applied at the entrance of the chamber. Each
           irradiation lasted between 8 and 24 hours. The
           current integrator counts were recorded in
           multichannel scaling mode, stepping the channel every
           10 minutes to take into account the possible changes
           in the beam current.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The values corresponds to the energy stability
           and determination of the a-beam and to the uncertainty
           of the energy loss in the target.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainty of the cross section is the
           quadratic sum of the following partial errors:
           (ERR-1)gamma detector efficiency(6%);
           (ERR-2)X-ray detector efficiency(4%);
           (ERR-3) number of target atoms(4%);
           (ERR-4) beam current measurement(3%);
           (ERR-5,,5.) decay parameters <5%
           (ERR-S,0.5,7.0) statistical error(0.5-7.0%);
