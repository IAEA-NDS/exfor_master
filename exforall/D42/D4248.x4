SAMPLE     Evaporated metallic thulium onto 0.002 mm Al backing.
           The mass of the foils had been measured before and
            after the evaporation and from the difference -
            assuming that the evaporated layer is uniform -
            the number of target atoms were calculated.
           The absolute number of target atoms and the uniformity
            have also been determined by PIXE method.
           The precision of the determination of the number of
            target atoms was better than 3% and the thickness was
            found to be uniform within 2%.
           The agreement between the results of the two methods
            used for thickness determination is within 4%.

METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,GSPEC,XSPEC)
           The investigated energy range between E = 11.5 and
            17.5 MeV, was covered with 0.5-1 MeV steps with a
            beam current of typically 2 uA.
           After the beam-defining aperture, the chamber was
            insulated and a secondary electron suppression
            voltage of -300 V was applied at the entrance of
            the chamber.
           Each irradiation lasted between 8 and 24 hours.
           The current integrator counts were recorded in
            multichannel scaling mode, stepping the channel every
            10 min to take into account the possible changes in
            the beam current.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Corresponding to the energy stability and
            determination of the a-beam and to the uncertainty
            of the energy loss in the target.

           (ERR-1) gamma detector efficiency       (6%)
           (ERR-2) X-ray detector efficiency       (4%)
           (ERR-3) number of target atoms          (4%)
