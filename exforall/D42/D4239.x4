           Enriched elemental 77Se (91.77%), 78Se (98.58%) and
           80Se (99.90%) powder. Samples for irradiations were
           prepared by using the sedimentation technique onto
           0.1 mm Al backing. Sediment layers were obtained,
           each having an enriched Se isotope content of
           2.9-28.9mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)The induced radioactivity
            was measured non-destructively using HPGe detector
           gamma-ray spectrometry, analysing all major
           gamma-rays of the investigated radionuclides. Beam
           currents were measured in two different ways,
           involving current integration on the one hand, and
           the use of monitor reactions, on the other.
           Irradiations  with protons up to an energy of 45 MeV
           were done at the  injector  cyclotron of COSY of the
           Forschungszentrum Julich,  Germany. Irradiations in
           the higher energy region were  carried  out at the
           Separated Sector Cyclotron (SSC) of iThemba  LABS in
           Somerset West, South Africa. The proton energy  range
           covered by the irradiations was from 21 to 85MeV.
           The thin 77Se and 78Se targets were irradiated at
           both  cyclotrons  with protons of energies up to 66
           MeV. The 80Se  targets were irradiated with energies
           up to 85 MeV. The  formation  of 80mBr was studied
           only in the lower energy range  up to 19 MeV,
           utilizing the Compact Cyclotron CV 28 of  the
           Forschungszentrum Julich. The energy ranges covered
           in  the  stacks were chosen such that they partly
           overlapped,  thereby  allowing a comparison of
           results in the overlapping  regions,  obtained in
           independent measurements. All obtained cross section
           values were normalised to 100% enrichment of the
           respective target isotope.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from Firestone, R. B.:
           Table of Isotopes. CD ROM edition, Version 1.0.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) No detail was given.
           (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainties of the measurements
           were calculated according to Gaussian error propagation
           They are mainly based on the individual uncertainties
           of the incident proton energies, determination of
           particle flux and detector efficiency. Concerning the
           measurement of 80mBr, the efficiency calibration is
           less precise than in general, leading to higher
           uncertainties in those cross section data. Largely, the
           total uncertainty in cross section amounted to between
           9 and 20%.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.
