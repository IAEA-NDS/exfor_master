SAMPLE     Layers of thulium(III)oxide (Tm2O3)99.9%,
           (69-TM-169,NAT=1.0)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Thin layers of thulium(III)oxide (Tm2O3) were prepared
           using the sedimentation  technique onto 0.1 mm thick
           Al backing and covered by 0.01mm Al foil.
           The thickness of the sediment layer
           was about 10-20mg/cm2 Tm2O3 . Stacked-foil technique
           was used.  Irradiation was done at 45 MeV proton
           energy (100nA, 1 hour) at COSY cyclotron Juelich.
           Stack2 was irradiated at 36 MeV proton energy (150
           nA, 20min) at VUB cyclotron.
           Energy degradation in the stack was determined by
           the polynomial approximation of the stopping-power
           Andersen and Ziegler, 1977, corrected on the basis of
           the excitation function of the natTi(p,x)48V (VUB) and
           natCu(p,xn)62,63Zn (COSY)monitor reactions.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy of the
           bombarding beam in the middle of each irradiated foil
           was estimated combining the uncertainties of the
           energy degradation depending on the thickness of the
           target foils in the stack and the energy straggling.
           (ERR-T)
           The overall uncertainty amounted to 11-15%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EPIRE,
           and ALICE.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
