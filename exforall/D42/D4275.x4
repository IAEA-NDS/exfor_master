SAMPLE     High purity, nominally 27 micron thick Ho target foils.
           (67-HO-165,NAT=1.0)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) Two stacks
           containing Ho target and Ti monitor foils were
           irradiated with 40 MeV alpha beam.
           Beam intensity: 85 and 110 nA
           Irradiation time: 1.0 hour
           No chemical separation was done. HPGe
           gamma-spectrometers were used to determine the
           activities of the irradiated foils. The energy
           degradation in the stack was calculated from the
           incident energy and foil thicknesses using a polynomial
           approximation of the stopping power.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The cumulated uncertainties of mean energy in
           the stacks were estimated taking into account the
           uncertainties on incident alpha-particle energy and on
           foil thicknesses as well as beam straggling.
           The uncertainties change from 0.2 to 1.1MeV.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainties were estimated in the
           standard way: the relative uncertainties of the
           linearly contributing processes were quadratically
           summed and its square root was taken.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes
           ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE-II.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
