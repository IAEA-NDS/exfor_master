           deuteron induced nuclear reactions on ytterbium up to

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)Elemental cross-
           sections on natYb targets were measured using the
           activation method and the standard stacked foil
           irradiation technique combined with high-resolution
           gamma-ray spectrometry. The irradiated stack had a
           complex structure, consisting of a nine times
           repeated sequence of Rh(12.3 micro-m), Ho(25 micro-
           m), Au(10.7 micro-m), Yb(23 micro-m), MoRe alloy(50
           micro-m), CuMnNi alloy( 25 micro-m) foils and the
           Al(100 micro-m) foils serving as monitor. The
           irradiation of the targets was performed in He-gas
           atmosphere in a water cooled target holder. The
           activity of each sample was assessed nondestructively
           in two series of measurements. The decay data were
           taken from NUDAT 2.6.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way following the
           recommendations of the ISO-guide as the square root of
           the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL-2011
           ALICE-IPPE-D, EMPIRE-II-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
