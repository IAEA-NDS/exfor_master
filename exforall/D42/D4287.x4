TITLE      Activation cross-sections of longer lived products of
            deuteron induced nuclear reactions on ytterbium up to
            40 MeV

METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Elemental cross-sections on natYb targets were
            measured using the activation method and the standard
            stacked foil irradiation technique combined with high-
            resolution gamma-ray spectrometry.
           The irradiated stack had a complex structure,
            consisting of a nine times repeated sequence of
            Rh (12.3 um), Ho(25 um), Au(10.7 um), Yb(23 um),
            MoRe alloy (50 um), CuMnNi alloy (25 um) foils and the
            Al(100 um) foils serving as monitor.
           The irradiation of the targets was performed in He-gas
            atmosphere in a water cooled target holder.
           The activity of each sample was assessed
            nondestructively in two series of measurements.
           The decay data were taken from NUDAT 2.6.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty on the median energy in the
            foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty
            of incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping
            power of each foil due to thickness variation and
            straggling effects.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty on the cross section values
            are estimated in the standard way following the
            recommendations of the ISO-guide as the square root
            of the quadratic summation of the independently
            contributing parameters.
           Uncertainty of time parameters is not included.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
            determination of integral physical yields.
STATUS     Entry was checked by the corresponding author.
