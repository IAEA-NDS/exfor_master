           The target samples were prepared of highly enriched
           erbium-oxide, 167Er2O3 powder by sedimentation onto
           Al backing of 13.0 mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness.
           The samples were covered by 0.01 mm thick Al
           wrapping for protection.
           Thickness of targets: 13-19 mg/cm2,
           Characteristics of the erbium-oxide powder:
            chemical purity: 99.6%;

               162Er<=0.06%,

METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Three stacks were bombarded with 20.7 MeV deuterons,
           irradiation time: 1.5 h,
           beam intensity: 100 nA.
           The stacks contained six erbium-oxide samples
           alternating with eight Ti monitor foils and were
           inserted in a Faraday-cup-like target holder equipped
           with a long collimator and secondary electron
           suppressing device.
           The beam intensity was controlled by integration of the
           deposited charge in the target holder.
           The extracted beam energy was estimated from the
           accelerator settings.
           The samples were measured non-destructively,
           without chemical separation
           several times after end of bombardment over aperiod of
           4 months.
REL-REF    (N,,Andersen+,B,ANDERSEN,3,1977)
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(D,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
           Ti foils, thickness: 12.5 um, Goodfellow.
           The incident energy and beam current was corrected
           according to the re-measured excitation function of
           the monitor reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Estimation of the uncertainty on the median
           energy in the samples is obtained by taking into
           account the cumulative errors influencing the
           energy calculation(incident deuteron energy,
           sample inhomogeneity and beam energy straggling).
           The uncertainty of the energy is +-0.3 MeV for
           the first pellet, increasing to +-1.8 MeV at the end
           of the stack.
           (DATA-ERR)The independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing processes were summed
           quadratically and the square root was taken.
           (ERR-1)number of target nuclei per areaunit 5%
           (ERR-2)beam current 5%
           (ERR-3) decay parameters 5%
           (ERR-4,3.,5.) detector efficiency 3-5%
           (ERR-S,1.,8.) statistical error 1-8%
           The total uncertainty on each cross section is
           between 10 and 15 %.
ADD-RES    (THEO)The excitation functions of the investigated
           reactions were calculated by means of the pre-compound
           model codes ALICE-D and EMPIRE-D.The experimental
           data are also compared with the cross section
           data in the EAF 2007 and TENDL 2009 nuclear
           reaction data libraries that were developed on the
           base of the TALYS nuclear model code system.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.

REACTION   (68-ER-167(D,3N)69-TM-166,,SIG)
COMMENT    Target isotope 166Er has only low abundance in the
           target material, therefore authors neglected the
           contribution of 166Er(d,2n)166Tm reaction which has
           also lower cross section too.
           The results were normalised to 100% 167Er target
           isotope.

           Contribution of 168Er(d,3n) reaction was corrected.
           According to the analysis, based on a comparison of
           the theoretical results for the EMPIRE-D code, the
           contribution of the 3.08% 168Er in the target would
           increase between 1.2% at 15 MeV and about 11% at 20.4
           MeV. For energies below 14 MeV the correction would be
           lower than 1%.
