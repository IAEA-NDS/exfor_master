DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
            Stacks containing Mo/Re and other targets with Al and
            Ti monitor foils were irradiated at 21 MeV (VUB) and
            40 MeV (CYRIC). Irradiations were performed using
            constant beam current of 160 nA for 60 min (VUB)
            and 24 nA for 30 min (CYRIC).
            The activity was measured without chemical separation
            by high resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy.
            The effective energy for each foil was determined
            using the energy-range formula and tables of Andersen
            and Ziegler, and corrected by comparing the
            simultaneously re-measured cross sections of the
            monitor reactions to the latest recommended values.
            The activities were determined from the photo-peak
            areas, taking into account corrections for decay
            during irradiation, waiting and measuring time.
            Decay data and the Q-values of the were taken from
            NUDAT2 and from Q-value calculator of NNDC.

           Acceptably good agreement was found
           after moderate adjustment on the beam current (10%
           compared to the Faraday cup measurement) and on the
           incident beam energy (0.5 MeV).

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the beam energy in the
           middle of each irradiated foil was estimated
           combining the uncertainties of the energy degradation
           depending on the thickness of the target foils in the
           stack and the energy straggling.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the cross-sections were
           estimated taking the independent relative errors of
           linearly contributing components, number of the
           bombarding particles, number of the target nuclei,
           decay data, detector efficiency and peak area were
           summed quadratically, and the square root of the sum
           was taken.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EMPIRE-D
           and ALICE-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
