SAMPLE     (24-CR-50,NAT=4.345)

           (24-CR-53,NAT=9.501)
           (24-CR-54,NAT=2.365)The Cr-targets were prepared by
           electro deposition on 0.02375 mm thick, high purity Cu
           backing. The actual thickness of the 32 individual
           Cr-targets was derived from separate weighing and
           accurate determination of the area (by scanning of
           the individual irradiated targets to determine the
           exact linear dimensions). The variation of target
           thickness was  between 17.8 and 24.3 microns.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) For the 50 MeV
           irradiation at LLN the targets were placed in a
           custom made Faraday cup like, air cooled target
           holder with a long collimator, assuring that all
           incoming charged particles hit the targets. The beam
           current was kept constant at 110 nA during the 70 min
           irradiation. No charge integration was available for
           this irradiation. The 20 MeV deuteron beam
           irradiation at VUB was performed using our standard
           water cooled target holder with secondary electron
           suppression and long collimator. Irradiation took
           place with a constant 140 nA beam current for 60 min.
           Total charge on target was collected by an
           integrator. In order to get a good agreement of the
           measured and recommended excitation functions the
           incident energy for he VUB irradiation had to be
           changed from 20.5 to 20.7 MeV and the current was
           increased by 28%, while for the LLN beam the current
           was decreased by 8% and no energy change was needed.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)Uncertainty on the energy scale includes
           cumulative  effects of initial beam energy, stopping
           estimation influenced by  target thickness and beam
           straggling. Throughout the stack it increases  from
           0.2 MeV for the first foil to 1.2 MeV at the last foil.
           (DATA-ERR)Estimation of the uncertainties on the cross
           section values are  based on the standard approach as
           the square root of the quadratic summation of  the
           independently contributing parameters:
           (ERR-1) surface density of target nuclei (5%),
           (ERR-2) incident charged particle flux (5%),
           (ERR-3) energy dependent detector  efficiency (5%),
           (ERR-4) nuclear decay and branching data (5%).
           (ERR-S,2.0,8.0) statistical uncertainty  (2-8%),
           This corresponds to an overall uncertainty of 10-13%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes
           ALICE-D, EMPIRE-D and TALYS.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           calculation of thick target yields.
