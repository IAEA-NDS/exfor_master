TITLE      Excitation functions for production of medically
           relevant radioisotopes in deuteron irradiations of
           Pr and Tm targets

SAMPLE     Oxides of Tm and Pr were prepared by sedimentation
           technique on Al or Ni backings.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Irradiations were performed at the external beams of
           the Tohoku University (Sendai) and Vrije Universiteit
           Brussels (VUB) cyclotrons.
           The Tm2O3:
           25-35 microns in Tm equivalent for Sendai experiments;
           15-60 microns thick for VUB experiments, purity 99.9%.
           The Pr6O11:
           250-60 lm thick in Pr equivalent, purity 99.5%.
           Al (100 microns) and Ti (12.5 microns) monitor foils
           were used. The stacks were mounted in a Faraday cup
           like target holder equipped with a suppressor of
           secondary electrons. The energy of the incident
           deuteron beams was up to 40 MeV at Sendai and 20 MeV
           at VUB, respectively. The beam current: of 90-200 nA.
           Independent and comulative cross sections were
           determined.

           (13-AL-27(D,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           Downshifts of 0.5-2 MeV in nominal incident energy and
           corrections in particle flux of a few percent result
           were neccessary to apply.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The monitoring method allows estimating the
           uncertainty on the primary beam energy at +-0.2 MeV.
           The uncertainty on the average energy in each foil is,
           however, continuously rising through the stack and
           attains +-1 MeV for the last foil due to cumulative
           possible variations on target thickness and energy
           degradation.
           (ERR-T)The included experimental uncertainties are:
              * number of target nuclei including non-uniformity
                                   of the deposits,
              * incident particle flux,
              * peak area including statistical errors on counts,
              * detector efficiency,
              * gamma ray abundance and branching rate data.
           A total uncertainty of 10-15% is obtained as positive
           square root of the quadratic sum of the individual
           sources. Possible additional uncertainties due to non
           linear effects of halflives and waiting time were not
           accounted for.
DECAY-DATA Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of  model calculation ALICE.
           (TTY-C) Thick target production yields were calculated
                  from the fitted experimental croos sections.
