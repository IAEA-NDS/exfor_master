TITLE      Pre-equilibrium analysis of the excitation functions
           of (a,xn) reactions on silver and holmium
AUTHOR     (S.Mukherjee,A.V.Mohan Rao,J.Rama Rao)

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDCLC) Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre
SAMPLE     Self-supporting metallic foils, purity greater
           than 99.99%:  silver, 21 mg/cm2;
                         holmium, 23 mg/cm2.
           Interspersed with aluminum foils as energy degraders
           and monitors.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Primary energy of alpha-beam: 70-75 MeV,
           beam current: 200-250 nA.
           The beam spot on the foil stack was restricted to 5 mm
           by a central hole in a tantalum collimator.
           A Faraday cup was used for flux determination.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 95 cm3, coaxial, high-resolution
           (HPGE) 50 cm3
           The energy calibration and relative detector efficiency
           were calculated from the 152Eu standard spectra.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (B0174002,H.J.Probst+,J,ARI,27,431,1976)
REL-REF    (N,,C.F.Williamson+,R,CEA-R-3042,1966)
           The energy of the alpha-particles after they had
           traversed half the thickness of each foil was computed
           from the range energy tables of this ref.
ERR-ANALYS The total error in the experimental cross-section
           is contributed by
            (i) 1-4% error in the photopeak areas of
                characteristic gamma-rays,
            (ii) 1-8% error in their absolute abundances,
            (iii) 3% error in the photopeak efficiency of
                  gamma-rays,
            (iv) 1-2% error due to the nonuniformity of the foil
                 thickness and
            (v) 6% error in the standard monitor reaction
                cross-section assumed in the flux determination.
           The overall projected error is thus between 8-12% for
           various reactions.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code ALICE/85/300
            (pre-equilibrium hybrid model) and index model.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
