SAMPLE     (81-TL-203,NAT=29.52)
           (81-TL-205,NAT=70.48)
           High quality thallium targets 0.01mm were  prepared by
           electrodeposition on thin, 0.012 mm, copper foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)Two stacks containing each 9
           target foils interleaved with natural Ti foils were
           activated. Irradiation was made at 21 MeV deuteron
           beam at the VUB cyclotron, approximately 150 nA for
           about 1 hour. The samples were first measured about 2
           h after EOB and assessment of the activity continued
           over a 1 month decay period, at different
           sample-detector distances (5-45 cm).
           The SRIM 2006 code was used for estimation of the
           energy degradation in each foil of the stacks.
           Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The incident energy was estimated at 21 MeV
           with an uncertainty of +-0.1 MeV. Due to the
           variations in foils thickness and energy spread,
           the uncertainty in the median energy estimation is
           increasing along the stack, reaching a maximum of 3 MeV
           in the last foil.
           (DATA-ERR)The following individual uncertainties are
           taken into account:
           (ERR-1)gamma detector efficiency(5%);
           (ERR-2) number of target atoms(5%);
           (ERR-3) beam current measurement(5%);
           (ERR-4,1.0,5.0) gamma abundances (1-5%)
           (ERR-S,1.0,5.0) statistical error(1.0-5.0%);
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           calculation of thick target yields.
