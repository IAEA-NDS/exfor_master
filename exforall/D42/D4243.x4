DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) 2 stacks were irradiated with
           proton beam of 16 MeV in Faraday-cup type holder.
           Measurements started after 7 week and 18 weeks after
           EOB. The beam intensities obtained via  charge
           collection were corrected with the data from the
           monitor reaction. The energy degradation was
           initially determined by calculation using  the
           SRIM2010 web based calculation tool and
           corrected on the basis of the measured monitor
           reaction excitation function. The nuclear data
           were taken from the NUDAT2 database. Correction for
           led X-rays induced in the detector shielding was made.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the primary
           incident energy is estimated to be 0.2 MeV while due
           to cumulative effects the uncertainty increases to
           1.2 MeV on the last foils of the stack.
           (DATA-ERR)The estimated total uncertainty on the
           cross-sections was about 10% by taking the square root
           of the sum in quadrature of individual contributions,
           supposing equal sensitivities.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code ALICE,
           EMPIRE and TALYS model codes.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
