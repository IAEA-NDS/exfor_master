SAMPLE     Flexible carbon foils of surface density  23.4 mg/cm2
           (Goodfellow, purity 99.8%, nominal thickness 123.3 um)
           (6-C-12,NAT=0.9893)
           (6-C-13,NAT=0.0107)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) Two stacks were
           irradiated at the external beam line of the CGR90
           cyclotron in Louvain la Neuve (LLN, Belgium) with
           deuterons of 50 MeV incident energy. In exp1, foils
           were stacked in a 18 times repeated Al-Ti-C-Ti. The
           Ti foils (10.9 mm thick) also serves as catcher foils
           for the recoiled reaction products. In exp2 the stack
           contained beside the carbon foils also Al (49.06 um),
           Ti (10.9 um), Ni (9.95 um) and Mg (275 um) foils. The
           irradiation took place under vacuum. The beam current
           was constant at about 120 nA during the 1.5 h
           irradiation. The cross-sections were calculated using
           the activation formula. The decay data taken from the
           on-line data library NuDat2 based on Evaluated
           Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF), Database version
           of October 2011.
           Care was taken to correct the 7Be cross-section
           measured directly for recoiled fragments.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils increases along the stack and includes the
           cumulative effects the uncertainty of incident beam
           energy (+-0.2 MeV), uncertainty on stopping in each
           foil due to thickness variation (5%) and straggling
           effects.
           The overall estimation is an uncertainty of +-0.2 MeV
           for the first foils, increasing to +-2.5 MeV in the
           last foil.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the cross-sections were
           estimated taking the independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing components.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EPIRE-D
           and ALICE-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
