SAMPLE     High purity Pb foils (10 micron) as target material,
           Al (25 micron) and Cu (10 micron) monitor foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)High purity Ge gamma spectrometer
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stack containing Pb target and Al, Cu monitor foils
           with other metal foils used as energy degrader and
           target material in a parallel experiments was
           irradiated in a Faraday cup like target holder for
           half an hour at 100-130 nA with 40 MeV deuteron beam.
           HPGe spectrometers at large source-detector distances
           were used to assess the activity of the foils.
           No chemical separation was used.
           Measurement started 20 h after EOB and decay was
           followed for about one month.
           Elemental excitation functions were determined
           relative to the simultaneously re-measured
           natAl(d,x)22,24Na and natCu(d,x)65Zn monitor reactions.

           Correction of 25% in beam intensity and 0.5 MeV in
           incident particle energy were necessary to introduce
           based on monitor reactions.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)No uncertainties were given in the reference.
            Values were received from authors.
           (ERR-T)The following individual uncertainties are taken
           into account:
           (ERR-1) the number of target nuclei including
                                               non-uniformity (5%)
           (ERR-2) detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-3) incident particle intensity (5%).
             * absolute abundance of the used gamma rays (1-5%),
             * determination of the peak areas including
                     statistical errors (1-5%),
          The total uncertainty is evaluated at 8-13%.
DECAY-DATA Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of  model calculation ALICE.
           (TTY-C) Thick target production yields were calculated
                  from the fitted experimental croos sections.
           Activity depth distribution was calculated for TLA use.
