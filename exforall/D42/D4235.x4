SAMPLE     Thin layers of enriched molybdenum oxide (100MoO3)
           targets (10 mm diameter) were prepared using the
           sedimentation technique. A small amount of very fine
           100MoO3 powder (99.9% pure) was suspended in vinyl
           acetate (LEVAPREN 450), dissolved in carbon
           tetrachloride and slowly sedimented onto an aluminium
           foil backing having 13.0 mm diameter and 92 um
           thickness. The 100MoO3 sample was then covered by a
           13 um thick polyimide (Kapton) foil for protection.
           The thickness of the sedimented 100MoO3 layer varied
           between 2.24 and 6.23 mg/cm2.
           Isotopic composition of the enriched target:
            92Mo 1.1%
            94Mo 0.8%
            95Mo 1.4%
            96Mo 1.6%
            97Mo 1.0%
            98Mo 3.6%
            100Mo 90.5%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Four stacks were irradiated with deuterons.
           Irradiation time: about 0.5 h,
           beam intensity: 40 nA,
           beam energies: 30 MeV and 50 MeV.
           Each stack contained 10 foils; the Al backings served
           as degraders and monitors.
           The beam currents were kept constant during the
           irradiations and were measured with a Faraday-cup.
           The activities of the irradiated foils were measured
           without chemical separation with high resolution
           gamma-ray spectroscopy.
           The decays of the produced radioisotopes were followed
           by measuring each sample several times.
           A minimal cooling time of 4 h was introduced before
           the first gamma-spectra measurements due to the
           transportation from the irradiation place.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat2.5 database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty on the particle energy was
           estimated from the uncertainties on the energy of the
           primary beam, from the uncertainty on the thicknesses
           of the subsequent stopping media in the stack and
           from the energy straggling.
           The uncertainty on the energy varies between
           +-0.2 and 0.9 MeV.
           (ERR-T) The cross section uncertainties were estimated
           in the standard way: the independent relative errors
           of the linearly contributing processes i.e.
            number of the bombarding particles 3%,
            number of the target nuclei 3%,
            decay data 3%,
            detector efficiency 7% and
            peak area were summed quadratically and the square
           root of the sum was taken.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The cross sections of the investigated
           reactions were predicted using the pre-compound model
           codes ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE-II. The experimental data
           are also compared with the curves given in the
           TENDL-2009 nuclear reaction data library based on the
           TALYS model code system.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.

COMMENT    By the authors.
           a) Corrections were made to eliminate contributions
           from 140.5 keV (4.52%) and 141.2 keV (66.8%) gamma-
           lines of 99Mo and 90Nb, respectively, and to eliminate
           contribution caused by decay of 99Mo. In the first two
           cases, peak areas of independent gamma-lines of 99Mo
           and 90Nb (739.5 keV, 12.13% and 1129.2 keV, 92.7%)
           were considered to estimate the contributions to peak
           area of the 140.5 keV line.
           b) According to the theoretical predictions,
           contribution of the 98Mo(d,n)99mTc reaction taking
           place on the small amount of 98Mo (3.6%) in the
           enriched target can be neglected. This statement is
           made in spite of the fact that the theoretical codes
           used in this work cannot give excellent predictions.
           The effect of the 98Mo(d,p)99Mo->99mTc process was
           considered when peak area and cross section of 99Mo,
           both uncorrected yet to the contribution of the
           reaction taking place on 98Mo, was used for the
           correction detailed in (a).
           c) The effect of the 97Mo(d,g) reaction was neglected.

COMMENT    By the authors.
           99Mo originates from 100Mo(d,p2n) reaction and can be
           produced by feeding via the 99Zr (2.1 s) ->
           99Nb (metastable state 2.6 min, ground state 15.0 s)
           decay chain. However, the probability of parent
           production is negligible according to the TENDL-2009
           prediction. Therefore, independent cross section was
           measured in the investigated energy range.
           The contribution of the 98Mo(d,p)99Mo reaction was
           subtracted in the following way. The uncorrected curve
           had a bump with maximum of 60 mb at about 14 MeV
           caused by the (d,p) reaction. As the ALICE-D code can
           describe the (d,p) process, this bump was fitted with
           a curve characteristic of (d,p) reaction. The fitted
           cross sections were subtracted from the measured ones
           which resulted in the disappearance of the bump and
           somewhat lower cross sections above 19 MeV.

COMMENT    By the authors.
           Independent cross sections of 98mNb were measured as
           98Zr feeds only the ground state of 98Nb. Although,
           except EMPIRE-D, the theoretical codes underestimate
           the excitation function in the whole energy range, on
           the basis of the predictions the contribution of
           98Mo(d,2p) reaction on the 3.6% 98Mo is negligible.
           Therefore no correction was made.

REACTION   (42-MO-100(D,X)41-NB-97,IND,SIG)
COMMENT    By the authors.
           The excitation function was measured after total decay
           of the shorter lived metastable state.
           Although the theoretical codes cannot give excellent
           predictions, the effect of interfering reactions
           taking place on target nuclei other than 100Mo and the
           effect of interfering decay were estimated by means of
           the TENDL-2009. The interfering reactions such as
           98Mo(d,2pn)97Nb and 97Mo(d,2p)97Nb on 3.6% 98Mo and
           on 1.0% 97Mo as well as the disturbing decay coming
           from 97Zr populated by the reactions taking place on
           100Mo and 98Mo target nuclei, are negligible.
           Therefore an independent cross section was measured.
