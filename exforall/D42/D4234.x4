TITLE      Investigation of activation cross sections of deuteron

SAMPLE     Indium metal foils (commercial).
           The 50 micron thick In foils were deposited onto
           50 or 135 micron Al backing and wrapped with
           6 or 12 micron Al for protection.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Three stacks were bombarded with deuterons.
           Beam energies: 40 MeV (2JPNTOH) and 21 MeV (2BLGVUB),
           irradiation times: 0.5 h and 1.6 h,
           beam intensities: 80 nA and 25 nA.
           The stacks were mounted in a Faraday-cup like target
           holder equipped with a suppressor of secondary
           electrons.
           The activities of the produced radionuclides were
           measured nondestructively, without physical separation
           of target and covering foils and without chemical
           separation.
           The source-detector distance was kept large enough to
           minimize dead time and pile-up effects and possible
           influence of the non point-like geometry of the
           samples compared to calibration standards.
           The measurements were started shortly (0.4 h) after
           end of bombardment at (2BLGVUB) and repeated three or
           four times over a time period of several weeks.
           At (2JPNTOH), due to the high radiation dose, before
           dismantling the stacks, a cooling time of at least 4 h
           was needed.
REL-REF    (N,,Andersen+,B,ANDERSEN,3,1977)
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.

           Al and Ti foils.
           In case of the 40 MeV irradiation, the Al backing
           foils served for determination of the beam intensity
           and energy; in case of the 21 MeV irradiations
           12 micron thick Ti foils, additionally inserted after
           each Al-covered In target, were used as beam energy
           and intensity monitors.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat2.5 database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The monitoring method allows estimating the
           uncertainty on the primary beam energy (+-0.3 MeV)
           which is continuously rising in each foil through the
           stack and attains +-2.1 MeV in the last foil of the
           longest stack due to possible cumulative variations
           on target thickness and energy degradation.
           (ERR-T) The following experimental uncertainties
           were considered:
            number of target nuclei including non-uniformity (3%),
            incident particle flux (7%),
            peak area including statistical errors (3-20%),
            detector efficiency (7%) and
            gamma-ray abundance and branching rate data (3%).
           Typical total uncertainty is around 11%.
           Possible additional uncertainties due to non-linear
           effects (like half-life and waiting time) were not
           accounted for.

ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental results were compared to the
           curves calculated with the ALICE-D and EMPIRE-D
           theoretical model codes and to the curves given in the
           EAF-2007 and TENDL-2009 databases.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.

           to the first metastable state with 100% IT.
