SAMPLE     Natural RbCl evaporated target onto Al foil. Target
           thickness was measured by RBS technique.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)High purity Ge gamma spectrometer
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,SITA)
           Targets were irradiated with a proton beam of energy
           between 2 and 4 MeV (in 200keV steps) with 600 nA for
           8 hours. the Ep=2.6 MeV irradiation was carried out
           with both accelerators and no difference in the cross
           section was found. The absolute number of target atoms
           and the uniformity were determined by the Rutherford
           Backscattering Method.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           results of model calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)number of target nuclei (3%)
           (ERR-2)target uniformity (1%)
           (ERR-3)beam current (3%)
           (ERR-4) detector efficiency (6%)
           (ERR-5) decay parameters (4%)
           (ERR-S,0.7,4.) statistical error (0.7-4%)
           (EN-ERR)The quoted uncertainty in the Ecm values
           corresponds to the energy stability of the proton
           beam and to the uncertainty of the energy loss in
           the target.
           (ERR-T)The independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing processes were summed
           quadratically and the square root was taken.
