FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB) 36 MeV irradiation
           (CYCLO,2JPNTOH) 70 MeV irradiation
SAMPLE     High purity Er foils from Goodfellow,
           thicknesses: 30 and 40 micron
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Incident proton energies: 36 and 70 MeV,
           counting was started about 2-3 h and a day after the
           end of bombardment, respectively.
           The radioactivity of the irradiated sample and
           monitor foils was measured nondestructively.

           The energy degradation along the stack was determined
           via calculation and corrected on the basis of the
           simultaneously re-measured monitor reactions.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Not detailed.
           (DATA-ERR) Total error, not detailed.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE-II.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.
