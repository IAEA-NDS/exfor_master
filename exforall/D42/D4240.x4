FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOH) AVF-930 cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Thin barium chloride dihydrate tablets (BaCl2*2H2O,
           99.9%, 40-80 mg/cm2, from Sigma-Aldrich) were
           prepared by pressing powdered material in special cups
           made of aluminum (370 um bottom thickness)
           and covering them with Al foil (10 um).
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           The stacked targets were bombarded with proton beam,
           low beam intensity: 25 nA,
           beam energy: 70 MeV,
           irradiation time: 20 min.
           Irradiation under helium gas atmosphere in a water
           cooled target holder.
           The radioactivity of each sample (total cup with Ba as
           target material of interest and Al cover and backing
           serving as monitors) was measured nondestructively.
           The data acquisition was started only about 20 h after
           the end of bombardment.

           The energy degradation along the stack was calculated
           on the basis of this polynomial approximation.
DECAY-DATA The decay data of the contributing reactions were
           taken from NuDat2.5 database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainties were determined
           taking into account the uncertainties of primary
           energy and foil thicknesses and the energy straggling.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties were calculated in the
           standard way: the uncertainties of the linearly
           contributing independent parameters were quadraticaly
           summed and its square root was taken.
COMMENT    By authors: data point at 37.7 MeV shows a systematic
           deviation from expected values inferred from the mean
           trend of the excitation function, probably due to a
           non-homogenous distribution of target material
           or a broken pellet.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Comparison with experimental results found
           in the literature.
           (THEO) Comparison with new results of the ALICE-IPPE
           and EMPIRE-II codes and with existing data obtained
           with TALYS code (EAF-2007).
           (TTY-C) From the measured cross section data integral
           yields were calculated.

           ground state and partly (1.6%) to the metastable state
