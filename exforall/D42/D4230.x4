SAMPLE     The target samples were prepared of highly enriched
           erbium-oxide, 167Er2O3 powder by sedimentation onto
           Al backing of 13.0 mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness.
           The samples were covered by 0.01 mm thick Al
           wrapping for protection.
           Thickness of targets: 12-17 mg/cm2,
           number of samples: 12.
           Characteristics of the erbium-oxide powder:
            chemical purity: 99.6%;
            isotopic composition of erbium (atom%):
               162Er<=0.06%,
               164Er<=0.06%,
               166Er=1.14%,
               167Er=95.6%,
               168Er=3.08%,
               170Er=0.18%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Two stacks were bombarded with 16 MeV protons,
           irradiation time: 1.0 h,
           beam intensity: 100 nA.
           Both stacks contained six erbium-oxide samples
           alternating with eight Ti monitor foils and were
           inserted in a Faraday-cup-like target holder equipped
           with a long collimator and secondary electron
           suppressing device.
           The beam intensity was controlled by integration of the
           deposited charge in the target holder.
           The extracted beam energy was estimated from the
           accelerator settings.
           The samples were measured non-destructively,
           without chemical separation
           several times after end of bombardment.
REL-REF    (N,,Andersen+,B,ANDERSEN,3,1977)
           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was calculated from the input energy and target
           thicknesses.

           The incident energy and beam current was corrected
           according to the re-measured excitation function of
           the monitor reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of incident proton
           energy, inhomogeneity and thickness uncertainty of the
           foils and beam straggling were taken into account for
           energy uncertainty estimation in the target
           and monitor foils.
           (DATA-ERR) 11-18% The cross section uncertainties were
           estimated in the standard way: the independent relative
           errors of the linearly contributing processes were
           summed quadratically and its square root was taken.

ADD-RES    (THEO)The excitation functions of the investigated
           reactions were calculated by means of the pre-compound

           excitation curves determined with TALYS nuclear model
           code system were taken from the TENDL-2008
           data library.
           (TTY-C) Integral yields were calculated from the
           fitted experimental cross sections.

COMMENT    The authors neglected the effect of 166Er(p,g)
           reaction.
           167Tm is produced through the 167Er(p,n) and
           168Er(p,2n) reactions. The EMPIRE-II curve, weighted
           according to the isotopic composition of the sample,
           was subtracted from the production cross section of
           167Tm to get the excitation function of 167Er(p,n)167Tm
           reaction.

REACTION   (68-ER-167(P,2N)69-TM-166,,SIG)
COMMENT    As proton induced nuclear reactions resulting in 166Tm
           take place only on 166Er and 167Er taking into account
           the main isotopes of the enriched sample and the energy
           range covered by the experiments, the excitation
           function of the 167Er(p,2n)166Tm reaction was
           determined by subtraction of the weighted EMPIRE-II
           curve of 166Er(p,n) process.
