TITLE      Study of the excitation functions for 43K, 43,44,44mSc
           and 44Ti by proton irradiation on 45Sc up to 37 MeV

SAMPLE     High purity Sc2O3 powder (>99.5%) pressed into pellets.
           Al foils 10 microns to wrap the pallets and 100 microns
           for support (backing). Ti 12 microns monitor foils.
           The effective Sc thickness 285 - 303 microns.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)High purity Ge gamma spectrometer
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           One stack containing 10 pellets, together with
           interleaved natTi monitor foils in Faraday-cup like
           target holder equipped with a collimator (5 mm) and a
           secondary electron suppresser was irradiated with
           protons in the external beam of the VUB-Cyclotron
           CGR-560 at 38 MeV, 115 nA for 2 h.
           The monitor reaction natTi(p,n)48V was used to
           determine the effective beam current (115 nA) and the
           energy that was downshifted by 0.3 MeV.
           The mean energy for each foil in the stack was
           calculated with the SRIM 2006 program.
           No chemical separation was used.
           Measurement started shortly after EOB and decay was
           followed by measuring the samples several times.
           Excitation functions were determined relative to the
           simultaneously re-measured monitor reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The initial uncertainty of the bem energy was
           +-0.1 MeV and +-1.4 MeV in the last pellet.
           (ERR-T)The following individual uncertainties are taken
           into account:
           (ERR-1) absolute abundance of the used gamma rays (4%),
           (ERR-S) determination of the peak areas including
                       statistical errors (5%),
           (ERR-2) the number of target nuclei including
                               non-uniformity (5%),
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency (5%)
           incident particle intensity (5%).
           The total uncertainty is evaluated at 8-11%.
