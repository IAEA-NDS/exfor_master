SAMPLE     (54-XE-131,ENR=0.996)
           Highly enriched 131Xe gas up to a pressure of 0.9 bar
DETECTOR   (HPGE,XHPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           The excitation functions were measured by activating
            stacked gas cells.
           Evacuated stainless steel cells diameter 2 cm, length
            2.5 cm closed with 50 um Al windows were filled with
            highly enriched 131Xe gas 99.6% up to a pressure of
            0.9 bar.
           The cells were irradiated with proton beams of 200 nA
            intensity at 28, 24, 20, 15 and 12.5 MeV primary
            energies, obtained by changing the accelerator
            settings, at the external beam line of the CGR 560
            cyclotron of Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
           The beam intensity was controlled to keep it constant
            within 10% during the irradiations.
           The produced Cs isotopes were washed out of the gas
            cells.
           Total maximal loss in the recovery of Cs radioisotopes
            was estimated to be around 3% with an uncertainty of
            2%.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) For estimation of the uncertainty of the
            particle mean energy in the gas cells and in the
            monitor foils the cumulative errors influencing the
            calculated energy (incident proton energy,
            inhomogeneity and thickness uncertainty of the foils,
            beam straggling) were taken into account.
           (ERR-T)The independent relative errors of the linearly
            contributing processes were summed quadratically and
            the square root was taken.
