SAMPLE     Enriched 64Ni targets
           mean thickness 23.4 micron +- 5%
           prepared by electrodeposition on 25 micron Au backing.
           Isotopic enriched 64Ni
                    96.1% 64Ni
                    0.51% 62Ni
                    0.13% 61Ni

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           High purity Au foils (99.95%), electroplated with
           enriched 64Ni layers, were stacked together with
           natural titanium (12.5 micron +- 5%) monitor foils.
           Irradiations for 1 hour using a proton beam with an
           intensity of 100 nA, in a faraday cup like target
           holder was done. The initial estimations of the
           incident beam energy for the three irradiations were,
           based on accelerator parameters settings, 16 MeV,
           15.3 MeV (same beam, 100 micron Al degrader foil)
           and 25 MeV, respectively.
           The SRIM 2006 code was used for estimation of the
           energy degradation in each foil of the stacks.
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(P,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
           A down shift of 0.5 MeV in the nominal incident
           energy and a 5% correction in the particle flux were
           necessary to be applied.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The incident energies were estimated at
           15.5 MeV, 14.8 MeV and 24.5 MeV, respectively, with
           an uncertainty of +-0.1 MeV. Due to the variations
           in foil thickness and energy spread, the uncertainty
           in the median energy estimation is increasing along
           the stack, reaching at a maximum of 2.2 MeV in the
           last foil of the longest stack.
           (ERR-T)The following individual uncertainties are
           taken into account:
           (ERR-1) the number of target nuclei including
                                 non-uniformity (5%)
           (ERR-2) detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-3) incident particle intensity (5%)
             * absolute abundance of the used gamma rays (1-5%)
             * determination of the peak areas including
                                      statistical errors (1-5%)
           The total uncertainty is evaluated at 8-13%.
DECAY-DATA Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of  model calculation ALICE.
           (TTY-C) Thick target production yields were calculated
                  from the fitted experimental croos sections.
