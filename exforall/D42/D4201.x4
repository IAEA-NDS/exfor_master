SAMPLE     Ho foils (25 micron) and Ti foils (12 micron) from
           Goodfellow
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Incident proton energies: 16 and 37 MeV,
           beam currents: 150-180 nA,
           irradiation times:  0.5-1.0 h.
           A Faraday-cup was used to control the beam intensity
           parameters.
           The samples were measured several times without
           chemical separation.
           The primary beam energy was estimated from the
           parameters of the acceleration and of the extraction
           calibrated by TOF method.
DETECTOR   (XHPGE,HPGE) X- and gamma-ray spectrometers
           The efficiency of the detector was determined using
           certified 152Eu, 241Am and 129I sources.

           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was determined by a calculation based on the
           well defined input energy and target thicknesses.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Not detailed.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties were estimated in the
           standard way: the independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing processes
              (number of the bombarding particles,
               number of the target nuclei,
               decay data,
               detector efficiency and
               peak area)
           were summed quadratically and the square root of the
           sum was taken.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE, EMPIRE-II and GNASH.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.

REACTION   (67-HO-165(P,N)68-ER-165,,SIG)
METHOD     As 165Er has no gamma line, it was quantified by the
           characteristic X-ray line of its decay product 165Ho.
           The 165Er activity was determined from spectra
           measured after the total decay of 161Er and 163Er,
           ensuring that also the signals from the directly
           produced 161-164Ho isomers had disappeared.
           To determine the activities in addition to the well
           known corrections for pile-up and background in the
           low energy region, the self-absorption of the 165Ho
           X-rays in the target material were also taken into
           account.
