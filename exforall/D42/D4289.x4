SAMPLE     99.95% enriched 3-He. The gas pressure was typically
           300 mbar.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,GSPEC,SITA) Five irradiations were
           carried out between ?-energies of 4.0 and 6.3 MeV. The
           beam intensity was between 100 and 250 nA. The length
           of irradiations varied between 14 and 25 hours.
           Irradiations were done in Faraday-cup type target
           chamber. The current integrator counts were recorded
           in multichannel scaling mode with 1 min time base.
           Suppressor voltage of -300V was applied.
           The temperature and pressure of the target gas was
           monitored. The target window was 1 micron pinhole-free
           Ni foil. Be7 products were collected on a copper
           catcher disk which was measured after irradiation on
           a HPGe detector using 1 cm distance.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The energy of the alpha beam is defined to a
           precision of 0.3%. Correction for straggling effect,
           target gas density reduction and energy loss was
           applied. Uncertainty of effective energy: 0.4-1.1%
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross-sections were
           estimated taking the independent relative errors of
           contributing components.
           (ERR-1)surface density of target nuclei(3%),
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (3%),
           (ERR-3)detector efficiency (4%)
           (ERR-4)beam heating (1%)
           (ERR-S,2.7,3.9)statistical and peak fitting (2.7-3.9%)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
