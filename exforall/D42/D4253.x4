DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) Two stacks
           containing magnesium foils (Goodfellow, purity 99.8%,
           nominal thickness 275 microns)
           and aluminum foils (Goodfellow, purity
           99.8%, nominal thickness 49.06 microns) were
           irradiated at the external beam line of the CGR960
           cyclotron in Louvain la Neuve (LLN, Belgium)
           with deuterons of 50 MeV incident energy.
           energy. The beam was monitored by Ti (10.9 microns)
           The stacks contained also Ni and C foils. The
           activity was measured without chemical separation by
           high resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy. The effective
           energy for each foil was determined using the
           energy-range formula and tables of Andersen and
           Ziegler, and corrected by comparing the
           simultaneously re-measured cross sections of the
           monitor reactions to the latest recommended values.
           The activities were determined from the photo-peak
           areas, taking into account corrections for decay
           during irradiation, waiting and measuring time. Decay
           data and Q-values of the reactions were taken from
           NUDAT and from Q-value calculator of NNDC. Ni and Ti
           foils were used also as catcher foils for the recoiled
           reaction products. Corrections was made for the
           recoil effect.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils is increasing along the stack and includes the
           cumulative effects of the uncertainty of incident
           beam energy (+-0.2 MeV), uncertainty on stopping in
           each foil due to thickness (5%) and straggling
           effects. The overall estimation is an uncertainty of
           +-0.2 MeV for the first foils increasing to +-2.5 MeV
           in the last foil in which still significant
           cross-section values could be calculated.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the cross-sections were
           estimated taking the independent relative
           errors of the linearly contributing components,
           number of the bombarding particles, number of the
           target nuclei, decay data, detector efficiency and
           peak area were summed quadratically, and the square
           root of the sum was taken. The uncertainties of the
           cross-sections were estimated to be 10-13%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EPIRE-D
           and ALICE-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared
           to those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields. Depth
           distribution of the produced 22Na was calculated at
           11.2MeV bombarding deuteron energy for TLA studies.
