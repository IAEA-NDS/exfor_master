TITLE      Experimental study of the 165Ho(d,2n) and 165Ho(d,p)

SAMPLE     Ho foils (26 micron) and Ti foils (12 micron) from
           Goodfellow
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Incident deuteron energy: 21 MeV,
           beam current: 200 nA,
           irradiation time:  1.0 h.
           A Faraday-cup was used to control the beam intensity
           parameter.
           No chemical separation.
           The samples were measured at several times from shortly
           after the end of bombardment till 2 weeks later.

           The energy degradation as a function of depth in the
           stack was determined by calculation.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Not detailed.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties were estimated in the
           standard way: the independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing processes were summed
           quadratically and the square root of the sum was taken.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE-D, EMPIRE-II-D and GNASH.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.

REACTION   (67-HO-165(D,2N)68-ER-165,,SIG)
METHOD     165Er does not emit gammas after its EC decay but can
           be quantified by the characteristic X-lines of its
           daughter 165Ho.
           X-rays with the same energies come after decays of
           other simultaneously produced Er radioisotopes and
           from internal transitions of isomeric states of
           directly produced Ho isotopes as well. As, however,
           all these disturbing activities decay with shorter
           half lives than 165Er, using a proper cooling time it
           is possible to determine the contribution of 165Er
           separately.
