DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) Deuteron beams of 40 and 20
           MeV were used. Target and monitor foils were
           irradiated in Faraday-cup type holder. Measurements
           started after 1.5h cooling time for 20 MeV irradiation
           and 1 day cooling time of 40 MeV irradiation.
           The beam intensities obtained via  charge
           collection were corrected with the data from the
           monitor reaction. The energy degradation was
           initially determined by calculation using  the
           formulas and tables of Andersen and Ziegler and
           corrected on the basis of the measured monitor
           reaction excitation function. The nuclear data
           were taken from the NUDAT2 database.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the primary
           incident energy is estimated to be 0.3 MeV while due
           to cumulative effects the uncertainty increases to
           1.2 MeV on the last foils of the stack.
           (DATA-ERR)The estimated total uncertainty on the
           cross-sections was about 9.3 - 16.4 % by taking the
           square root of the sum in quadrature of individual
           contributions, supposing equal sensitivities.
           No individual error components are given.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code ALICE,
           EMPIRE and TALYS model codes.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
