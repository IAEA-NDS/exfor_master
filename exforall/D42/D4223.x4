FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     SrCl2 thick target 800mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,CHSEP,GSPEC) A thick-target production
           rate curve was measured for 88Y produced in the
           proton bombardment of SrCl2 target, from which the
           88Sr(p,n)88Y excitation function was derived using
           a differentiation method. Activations were performed
           using degraders of various thicknesses to cover the
           energy region from threshold up to 17.5MeV energy
           at the ATOMKI cyclotron in Debrecen, Hungary.
           Targets were irradiated inside the cyclotron
           vacuum at an average beam current of 50nA, each
           bombardment lasting about 30min.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-65,,SIG)
           The monitor foils were high purity Cu (99.99%,
           Goodfellow Metals,UK) with a thickness of 25 mm, for
           the accurate determination of the incident proton
           flux.
MONIT-REF  (,K.GUL+,R,IAEA-TECDOC-1211,49,2001) Chapter 4
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to and
           analyzed with the results of the theoretical model
           code ALICE-IPPE.
