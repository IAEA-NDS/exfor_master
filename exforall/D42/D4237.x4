SAMPLE     Targets of nominally 1.0 g in weight with an area
            thickness of 2.36 g/cm2 were prepared by compacting
            anhydrous CsF powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in a
            punch-and-die set using a hydraulic press.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB) 20 MeV
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,SITA)
           The target discs were thick enough to completely stop
            the beam at the primary proton energy 17.5 MeV.
           During bombardment, each target had a Cu monitor foil
            in front with a nominal thickness of 0.025 mm.
           The incident energy on target was adjusted by means of
            Al degrader foils of various thicknesses located
            upstream from the monitor foils and targets.
           Each bombardment lasted about 85 min at a beam current
            of nominally 50 nA.
           The targets were bombarded in a small target holder
            mounted on the end of an external beamline,
            electrically insulated.
           As CsF is very hygroscopic, the targets were kept in a
            vacuum oven at a temperature of 150 C until shortly
            before irradiation.
           The targets were in a vacuum environment during
            bombardment.
           Following irradiation, each activated CsF disc was
            dissolved in 3 mL of water in a standard glass serum
            vial, that constituted the counting sources.
           Two identical fractions of the 133Ba solution were
            prepared into sources, a source having a point
            geometry and the other made up into a 3 mL solution.
           The two specially prepared 133Ba sources were identical
            in strength.
           The ratio of their respective detector responses
            provided a correction factor for the different
            counting geometry and the self-absorption in the
            liquid volume and glass walls.
           Decay data were taken from Firestone and Eckstrom,
            Table of radioactive isotopes, version 2.1
            http://ie.lbl.gov/toi.
           The energy loss in each foil and target were calculated
            based on the stopping power formulae of
            Anderson and Ziegler.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in energy of each measured
            data point was estimated from the uncertainty in
            incident beam energy, foil thickness and path length
            straggling, the latter obtained from a compilation by
            Janni.
           (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainties in the measured
            cross sections and yields were obtained by summing
            all the contributing uncertainties in quadrature and
            are expressed as standard uncertainties.
           The uncertainties due to counting statistics and photo-
            peak integration were generally negligible <1%.
           In the case of the liquid sources, an additional
             uncertainty of 2% was adopted for the detector
             efficiency, resulting from the experimental
             correction factor for the source geometry.
           The systematic uncertainty was estimated to be about
            7%, including the
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-2) beam current integration           (3%)
           (ERR-3) counting geometry                  (2%)
           (ERR-4) decay corrections                  (2%)
           (ERR-5) Foil thicknesses and uniformity    (2%)
