SAMPLE     natural Yb target foils, thickness: 23 micron
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Three irradiations were performed.
           The activity of the irradiated samples was measured
           nondestructively, without chemical separation.
           VUB: the samples were investigated three times:
           two measurements were performed shortly after end of
           bombardment and the third one was done a month later.
           CYRIC: each foil was placed onto the detector three
           times but the first measurements started one day after
           end of bombardment.
           The primary energy and the calculated energy
           degradation were corrected on the basis of the
           simultaneously re-measured excitation functions of the
           monitor reactions.
           The effect of the secondary neutrons was checked
           placing extra target foils at the end of the stack,
           exposed only to possible secondary neutrons.
           Recoil losses were estimated from recoil contamination
           of the adjacent Al monitor foils.
           Both effects were negligible in these measurements.

           The median proton energy in the successive target
           foils was determined by calculation from the
           bombarding energy, stack composition and foil
           thickness.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NuDat database.

           analyzed with the results of the theoretical model

           determination of integral physical yields.
