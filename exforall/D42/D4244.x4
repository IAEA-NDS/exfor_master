FACILITY   (CYCLO,3HUNDEB) 11.5-17.5 MeV, 2microA,
SAMPLE     High purity natural Tm
           (69-TM-169,NAT=1.0)
            Physical type:        Metal
            Chemical composition: Element (Thulium)
            Samples were prepared by evaporation onto 0.002 mm Al
            backing.Thickness of the Tm layer varied between
            106 and 356 micro-g/cm2. Thickness was determined
            by proton micro beam using PIXE method.
DETECTOR   (LEGE,HPGE)
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           The energy of the alpha beam was between E = 11.5 MeV
           and 17.5 MeV, covered with 0.5 MeV-1 MeV steps with
           beam currents of typically 2 microA. After the
           beam-defining aperture, the chamber was insulated
           and secondary electron suppression voltage of ?300 V
           was applied at the entrance of the chamber. The
           collected charge in each irradiation was between 50 mC
           and 250 mC.
           S factors were derived from the averaged results of
           the irradiations weighted by the statistical
           uncertainty of the measured values. The effective
           center of mass energies (Ec.m.) take into account the
           energy loss of the ? beam in the target.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The quoted uncertainty in the Ec.m. values
           corresponds to the energy stability of the beam and
           to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainty of the S factors is the
           quadratic sum of the following partial errors:
           (ERR-1)number of target nuclei (4%);
           (ERR-2)HPGE detector efficiency (6%);
           (ERR-3)LEPS detector efficiency (4%);
           (ERR-4) beam current(3%);
           (ERR-5) decay data (5%);
           (ERR-S,0.5,7.) counting statistics (0.5-7%).
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes.
