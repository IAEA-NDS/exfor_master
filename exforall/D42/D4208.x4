SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene target (98% of 2H), 200 mu-
           g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PS)position sensitive detector
METHOD     The 2H(p,pp)n experiment was performed at the
           ATOMKI, cyclotron, using 5-MeV proton beam and
           Trojan horse method (THM).
           Proton-proton coincidences were measured by four
           500-microns-thick position sensitive detectors,
           each of them with an effective area of 5x1
           cm2. The setup allowed us to investigate the Epp
           range from 550 keV down to 80 keV, right within the
           characteristic interference minimum in the direct
           p-p cross section, and a p-p center-of-mass angle
           Theta-c.m. = 30. to 150.(DEG).
           A 4.7-MeV proton beam was delivered by the 3-MV
           Tandem accelerator with a spot size of about
           1mm onto a deuterated polyethylene
           target, 200 mu-g/cm2 thick, placed at 90 degree
           with respect to the beam direction.
ANALYSIS   Energy and angle calibrations of the detectors were
           performed using data acquired in preliminary runs of
           p+197Au, p+12C, p+d, and p+p elastic scattering.
           Energy resolution was found to be better than 2%.The
           angular resolution was found to be about 0.2 degree.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to and
           analyzed with the results of the theoretical model
           code HOES.
