SAMPLE     High purity Nb foils (20 micron) as target material,
           Al (0.5 and 1 mm) and Cu (54 micron) monitor foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)High purity Ge gamma spectrometer
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Stack containing Nb target and Al, Cu monitor foils
           with other metal foils used as energy degrader and
           target material in a parallel experiments was
           irradiated in a Faraday cup like target holder for
           half an hour at 200 nA with 70 MeV proton beam.
           HPGe spectrometers at large source-detector distances
           were used to assess the activity of the foils.
           No chemical separation was used.
           Measurement started 20 h after EOB and decay was
           followed for about one month.
           Excitation functions were determined
           relative to the simultaneously re-measured
           natAl(p,x)22,24Na and natCu(p,x)62,65Zn and 56Co
           monitor reactions.
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           formulas and tables of Andersen and Ziegler.

           Correction of 25% in beam intensity and 0.5 MeV in
           incident particle energy were necessary to introduce
           based on monitor reactions.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainties of the mean proton energies
           in the individual foils were estimated from the energy
           uncertainties of the primary beam, thickness and
           uniformity of the foils, energy straggling and energy
           spread. The uncertainties on the energy of the
           front foil of a stack are around 0.3 MeV and increase
           up to 2.7 MeV for the last foils of the stack.
           (ERR-T)The estimated total uncertainty on the
           cross-sections contains uncertainties of the following
           linearly contributing sources:
              * peak areas,
              * efficiency,
              * gamma abundances,
              * number of target nuclei,
              * beam intensity
              total amount is about 12%.
           Nonlinear contributions like time parameters are not
           considered.
DECAY-DATA Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of  model calculation ALICE.
           (TTY-C) Thick target production yields were calculated
                  from the fitted experimental croos sections.
           Activity depth distribution was calculated for TLA use.
