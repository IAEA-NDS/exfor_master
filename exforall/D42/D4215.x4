FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAUSA) Crocker Laboratory, 60-inch cyclotron
SAMPLE     Holmium oxide, containing
           about 15% dysprosium oxide and
           about 5% yttrium oxide.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)
           Bombardments with 38, 30 and 20 MeV alpha-particles.
           Beam intensities were taken from the cyclotron
           instruments.
           Initially the impure oxides were bombarded and the rare
           earths separated by the column method; in subsequent
           bombardments the recovered pure rare earths were used.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) End-on type Geiger-Muller counters
           with 3 mg/cm2 mica windows,
           filled with 10 cm argon and 0.5 cm alcohol.
           A magnetic counter was also used which enabled
           recognition of positive and negative electrons and
           provided a check on data obtained from absorption
           measurements.
           In gamma-ray absorptions, lead screens up to 45 g/cm2
           were used with a beryllium absorber, sufficient to
           remove all secondary electrons, placed directly below
           the counter window. Measurements were taken on a
           counter tube without the usual lead housing, as
           scattering in the latter has been found to give high
           values for the absorption half-thickness of hard
           gamma-radiation.
           The counter geometries were calibrated by use of a
           weighed uranium (UX2) standard.
