SAMPLE     (25-MN-55,NAT=1.0)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA) Cu(86%)-Mn(12%)-
           Ni(2%) alloy (25 micro-m) and pure Mn foils (10 micro-
           m) were used as target material. Irradiations of Mn
           targets was performed through stacked foil
           irradiation followed by high resolution gamma
           spectrometry. Stacks were irradiated at cyclotron of
           the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, VUB with proton beam
           of incident energy of 37 MeV, 61 nA, 71 min and the
           accelerator of Tohuku University, Sendai, nominal
           incident energy 70 MeV, 26 nA, 20 min and 100 nA, 60
           min. The stacks were interleaved with Al and Ti
           monitor/degrader foils. The beam current was kept
           constant. Activated foils were measured 3 times to
           follow the decay of the reaction products. Decay data
           were taken from NUDAT.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way following the
           recommendations of the ISO-guide as the square root of
           the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included.
           (ERR-1)surface density of target nuclei(5%),
           (ERR-2)incident charged particle flux (8%),
           (ERR-3)nuclear decay and branching data(3%)
           (ERR-4)detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-S,1.0,7.0)statistical and peak fitting (1-7%)
           This approach results in an overall uncertainty
           of 12-15% for the radionuclides studied.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TENDL-2012
           and EMPIRE-3.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
