DETECTOR   (HPGE,XHPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)
           Two stacks containing, respectively, 8 enriched 116Cd
           and 10 enriched 114Cd foils were irradiated in the
           external 38.5 MeV alpha beam at the VUB cyclotron.
           Irradiations were made for about 1 h at a constant,
           low beam current (about 90 nA). The copper backings
           served as a monitor foils as well as recoil nuclei
           catchers. The samples were measured about 2 h after
           EOB and assessment of the activity continued for a
           couple of times over a 9 months decay period, at
           different sample detector distances. Independent and
           comulative cross sections were determined.
           The SRIM 2006 code was used for estimation of the
           energy degradation in each foil of the stacks.

           Correction of 25% in beam intensity and 0.5 MeV in
           incident particle energy were necessary to introduce
           based on monitor reactions.

ANALYSIS   A reliable detection efficiency curve is difficult to
           be determined for a relatively narrow energy domain
           13-60 keV, therefore, efficiencies measured for higher
           energies photons of 152Eu were considered. A fit with
           a rational function was than performed over a wide
           energy range 13-1400 keV giving rise to a mean
           deviation of 12% in respect with the measured values
           for the 17-60 keV X-ray energy.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The incident energy was estimated at 38.9 MeV
           with an uncertainty of 0.1 MeV. Due to the variations
           in foils thickness and energy spread, the uncertainty
           in the median energy estimation is increasing along the
           stack, reaching at a maximum of 4.4 MeV in the last
           foil.
           (ERR-T)The following individual uncertainties are taken
           into account:
           (ERR-1) the number of target nuclei including
                    non-uniformity (5%),
           (ERR-2) detector efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-3) incident particle intensity (5%) and
             * absolute abundance of the used gamma rays (1-5%),
             * determination of the peak areas including
               statistical errors (1-5%),
           The total uncertainty is evaluated at 8-13%.
DECAY-DATA Decay data from Browne and Firestone were used for
           detector efficiency calculation.
           Decay and spectrometric characteristics of the
           investigated radionuclides were taken from Nudat2.
