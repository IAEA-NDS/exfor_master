SAMPLE     Metallic terbium foils 95.47 microns.
           (65-TB-159,NAT=1.0)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)Two stacks were
           irradiated with deuteron beams of 50 MeV.
           Stack1 irradiated at LLN, Louvain la Neuve:
           Incident energy: 50 MeV
           Energy interval: 49.6-7.9 MeV
           Beam intensity: 104.94 nA
           Irradiation time: 60 min
           Stack composition: Tb(95.47 micron), target
                              Al(27 micron), monitor and energy
                                             degrader
           Cooling times: 4.5-7.3 h, 49.8-69.5 h, 581.8-652.5
                          and 2277.0-2422.8 h.
           Stack2 irradiated at LLN, Louvain la Neuve:
           Incident energy: 50 MeV
           Energy interval: 48.5-36.1 MeV
           Beam intensity: 103.46 nA
           Beam intensity: 103.46 nA
           Stack composition: Tb(95.47 micron), target
                              Al(49.06 micron), monitor and
                              energy degrader
           Cooling times: 7.0-8.03 h, 45.1-47.2 h, 256.6-364.4 h
                          and 2373.3-2432.4 h.
           Nuclear data were taken from NUDAT.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty on the median energy in the
           foils includes the cumulative effects of uncertainty of
           incident beam energy, uncertainty of stopping power of
           each foil due to thickness variation and  straggling
           effects.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainty on the cross section values
           are estimated in the  standard way following the
           recommendations of the ISO-guide as the square root of
           the quadratic summation of the independently
           contributing parameters. Uncertainty of time parameters
           is not included.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code TALYS, ALICE-D
           and EMPIRE-D.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           determination of integral physical yields.
