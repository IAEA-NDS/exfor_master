           induced reactions on rhodium up to 40 MeV

SAMPLE     (45-RH-103,NAT=100) High purity 0.0123 mm Rh  foils
           (Goodfellow) were used interleaved with Al 0.1  mm
           monitor foils.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOH)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG,GSPEC,MOSEP,STTA)The irradiation of
           the targets was performed in He gas atmosphere in a
           water-cooled, Faraday-cup like target holder. For
           determination of the beam intensity and the energy.
           The target stack was irradiated with 40 MeV incident
           energy, with collimated proton beam for 30 min, at
           about 24 nA. The radioactivity of each sample and
           monitor foil was measured nondestructively by HPGe
           c-spectrometry twice. A first counting was started
           about 20 h after the end of the bombardment (EOB),
           the second series about 7-10 days after EOB. The
           decay data were taken from NUDAT.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the energy of the
           bombarding beam in the middle of each irradiated foil
           was estimated combining the uncertainties of the
           energy degradation depending on the thickness of the
           target foils in the stack and the energy straggling.
           (DATA-ERR)The uncertainties of the cross-section
           values were estimated in the standard way: the
           independent relative errors of the linearly
           contributing processes were summed quadratically and
           the square root of the sum was taken. The average
           uncertainty was found  to be 12-14%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model codes TALYS, EMPIRE
           and ALICE-IPPE.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared
           to those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           calculation of thick target yields.
