FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOH)
SAMPLE     Pd(12.1 mu-m), Cd(15.6 mu-m), Rh(12.3mu-m) metallic
           foils from GoodFellow
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,STTA)The cross-sections were measured by
           using the activation method and the standard stacked
           foil irradiation technique combined with
           high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy. The Pd and
           Cd target foils with Al and Cu monitor foils were
           stacked and irradiated with protons at Ep=70MeV,
           Ip=140nA for 6 min. The Rh target foils and Al
           monitor foils were stacked and irradiated with
           deuterons Ed=40, Id=24nA for 30 min.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)For estimation of the uncertainty of the
           particle mean energy in the foils the cumulative
           errors influencing the calculated energy (incident
           particle energy, foil inhomogeneity and thickness
           uncertainty, beam straggling) were taken into account.
           (DATA-ERR)The independent relative errors of the
           linearly contributing processes were summed
           quadratically and the square root was taken.
