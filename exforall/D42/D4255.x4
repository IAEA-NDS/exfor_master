            Deuteron induced reaction data given
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOH) 70 MeV proton
SAMPLE     (27-CO-59,NAT=100)
           High purity 0.01 mm Co foils (Goodfellow) were used
           interleaved with Al 0.012,and 0.1 mm monitor foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)The stack was irradiated in a
           short Faraday-cup target holder at about 100 nA beam
           for 1.5 hours. The gamma spectrometric measurements of
           the individual foils were started several hours after
           the end of the irradiations.The beam intensity obtained
           via charge collection was corrected with the data from
           the monitor reactions. The analysis of the gamma
           spectra was done in two steps: an initial automatic
           mode provided by the analysis software followed by an
           interactive peak fitting and separation manual mode.
           The nuclear data were taken from NUDAT database.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainties of the mean proton energies
           in the individual foils were estimated from the energy
           uncertainty of the primary beam, from the uncertainty
           of the thickness and uniformity of the foils in the
           irradiated stack, from energy straggling and from
           increasing energy spread. The uncertainties on the
           energy of the front foil of a stack is around 0.1 MeV
           and increase up to 1.2 MeV for the last foil.
           (DATA-ERR)The estimated total uncertainty on the
           cross-sections contains uncertainties of the following
           linearly contributing sources: peak areas, detector
           efficiency, gamma abundances, number of target nuclei,
           beam intensity and amounts to about 10%. Nonlinear
           contributions like waiting or measuring time,
           half-life, are not considered here.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code TALYS.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (TTY-C) Fitted excitation functions were used for
           calculation of thick target yields.
