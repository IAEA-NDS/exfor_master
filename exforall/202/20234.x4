TITLE      - An associated particle method for the D(d,n)3He
             reaction -
FACILITY   (CCW)    Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-D)    Deuteron-deuterium
METHOD     (ASSOP)    Associated particles of neutrons and He-3,
            and of He-3 and gammas from inelastic
            scattering measured.
SAMPLE      2cm diameter 3 cm length, placed at 50 cm distance
           from neutron beam source.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    Sodium-iodide crystal NaI(Tl) of 1.5 inch
           diameter, 3 inch long. Distance sample - front side is
           20 cm . Mounted on a RCA 7265 photomultiplier.
            256 channel pulseheight analyzer.
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(N,INL)26-FE-56,PAR,SIG) Value not given.
           .The experimental values were normalized
            in that way that the integrated angular
            distribution equals the theoretical cross-
            section for excitation of the 2+, 0.85 MeV state.
           .The shape of the 0.85 MeV gamma-ray angular
            distribution is in agreement with the
            theoretical shape for a 2+ state.
           .The theoretical cross-sections were
            calculated using the transmission
            coefficients given by Auerbach, BNL-765 for
            a Perey-Buck optical potential.
PART-DET   (G)    Gammas
CORRECTION .Gamma-ray yields corrected for attenuation of the
            neutron beam and absorption of gamma-rays in the
            scatterer, detection efficiency, multiple scattering,
            cascade transitions and isotopic abundances.
            For random coincidence.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1,,6.) An error in the multiplication factor
            ( for random coincidence) was introduced  by summation
           of pulses and by pulses from coincident gamma-rays due
           to neutrons scattered by the scatterer into the
           NaI-crystal. This error was found to have a maximum
           value of 6 % .
