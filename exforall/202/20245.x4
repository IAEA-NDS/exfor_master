TITLE       Gamma rays produced by the interaction of 15 MeV
            neutrons in N, O, Mg and Al
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDLND)    An-400 HVE Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)    Deuteron-tritium.
INC-SPECT  .Neutron energy of 15 MeV. The neutrons incident on
            the large sample had the n-energy between 14.7 and
            15.5 MeV.
            (E-RSL) -
DETECTOR   (GELI ) Ge(Li) detector, area of 70 mm2 and
            thickness of 7 mm.
           .Resolution of detector system was about 7 keV at 1 MeV
            and about 20 keV at 6 MeV.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(N,INL)6-C-12,,SIG,G)
            Morgan et al.,Annual Prog.Rep. for period ending
            Aug.1,1964,Texas Nuclear Corp.,and priv.comm.
PART-DET   (G)    Gammas.
CORRECTION .Corrected for the variation of neutron flux in the
            sample, neutron attenuation, multiple scattering
            and gamma-ray attenuation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information except remark: The counting
           statistics were generally sufficient in order to
           observe a gamma-ray line with a production cross
           section exceeding about 1 mb/sr for gamma-ray energies
           less than 3 MeV and about 0.5 mb/sr for gamma-rays
           above 3 MeV
