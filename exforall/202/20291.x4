TITLE       Excitation functions of Ni-58(n,p)Co-58 and
            Zn-64(n,p)Cu-64 reactions in the energy region from
            1.8 to 4.8 MeV
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNJAE)    2 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)    3 cm long D(2)-gas target, 400 mm-Hg.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) defined as the standard deviation of the
                    spectrum
ANALYSIS   The neutron flux was determined by
            (1) Detection of neutron beam at 0 deg by a stilbene
                scintillation counter following method described
                by Swartz and Owen(see REL-REF).
            (2) Known D(d,n)3He cross section and target gas
                pressure (see Fowler and Brolley in REL-REF).

SAMPLE     Samples of Ni or Zn metals (2 cm in diam. and 0.5 cm in
           thickness) were held at various well defined angles on
           the circle of 10 cm diam. around the center of D2-gas
           target.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    3" in diam. x 3" NaI(Tl) - for activity
            measurement of Co-58 or Cu-64.
           (BF3) Counting rates of a BF3-counter were recorded
           over the irradiation time to correct the effect of
           neutron yield change (correction negleted comparing
           with other sources of exp.errors).
           (SCIN) Thin stilbene scintillation counter (1" x 5.mm)
            placed at the beam direction behind the Ni or Zn
           sample for proton recoil (see INC-SPECT).
COMMENT    .(n,p)-cross-sections are given in dependence of
            the effective neutron energy which is defined as
            the mean value of the effective neutron energy
            spectrum which again is defined as the product of the
            neutron energy spectrum and the excitation function
            for each reaction.
CORRECTION .Gamma-ray attenuation.
           .Neutron attenuations through the sample were corrected
            using the total neutron cross-sections, BNL-325.
