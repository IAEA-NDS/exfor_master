TITLE      - SPINS OF SLOW NEUTRON RESONANCES IN HF, TM AND DY -
FACILITY   (SPECC)    BR1-REACTOR, CRYSTAL SPECTROMETER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    BR1-REACTOR, NEUTRON BEAM FROM THE CORE.
INC-SPECT  .MONOCHROMATIC BEAM OBTAINED FROM BRAGG-REFLECTION ON
            CU(111) PLANES.
SAMPLE     .SCATTERING SAMPLE AT RIGHT ANGLE TO NEUTRON BEAM,
            SURROUNDED BY PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS IN CYLINDRICAL
            GEOMETRY.
METHOD     .MEASURING THE RATIO OF SCATTERING CROSS-SECTION
            TO THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION AT RESONANCE ENERGY.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)    EIGHT PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS FILLED WITH
            BORON TRIFLUORIDE ENRICHED IN BORON-10.
            DETECTORS ARE 40 CM LONG, 5 CM IN DIAMETER,
            WITH 700 TORR PRESSURE.
ANALYSIS   .THE QUANTITY OBTAINED FROM THIS EXPERIMENT IS THE
            RATIO OF NEUTRON WIDTH TO TOTAL WIDTH. THE STATISTICAL
            WEIGHT FACTOR AND THEREFORE THE SPIN OF THE COMPOUND
            LEVEL IS FOUND BY COMBINING THIS RATIO WITH RESONANCE
            PARAMETERS IN BNL-325 FOR DY AND TM AND WITH RESONANCE
            PARAMETERS IN PHYS. REV. 101, 726(1956) FOR HAFNIUM.
           .FOR DYSPROSIUM THE RESONANT SCATTERING INTENSITY
            OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COUNTING RATE AT
            RESONANCE ENERGY AND IN THE WINGS OF THE RESONANCE.
           .FOR THULIUM AND HAFNIUM NET COUNTING RATE OBTAINED
            FROM DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAMPLE IN AND SAMPLE OUT
            COUNTING RATE.
