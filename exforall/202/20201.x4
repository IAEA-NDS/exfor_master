TITLE      - APPARATUS AND METHODS USED IN A SLOW NEUTRON
             RESONANCE SCATTERING EXPERIMENT -
FACILITY   .BR1-REACTOR, CRYSTAL SPECTROMETER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    BR1-REACTOR, NEUTRON BEAM FROM THE CORE.
INC-SPECT  .MONOCHROMATIC BEAM OBTAINED FROM BRAGG-REFLECTION ON
            CU(111) PLANES.
SAMPLE     .EVAPORATED INDIUM METAL ON ALUMINIUM
            BACKING OF 10 MICROMETERS. THREE DIFFERENT
            SAMPLES USED WITH DIAMETER OF 30 MILLIM.
            AND THICKNESSES OF 2.08E18 ATOMS/CM*CM,
            1.06E19 ATOMS/CM*CM, 1.31E19 ATOMS/CM*CM.
           .SCATTERING SAMPLE AT RIGHT ANGLE TO NEUTRON BEAM,
            SURROUNDED BY PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS IN CYLINDRICAL
            GEOMETRY.
METHOD     .MEASURING THE RATIO OF SCATTERING CROSS-
            SECTION TO THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION AT
            RESONANCE ENERGY.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)    EIGHT PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS FILLED WITH
            BORON-TRIFLUORIDE ENRICHED IN BORON-10,
            DETECTORS ARE 40 CM LONG, 5 CM IN DIAMETER,
            WITH 700 TORR PRESSURE.
ANALYSIS   .THE QUANTITY MEASURED IN THIS EXPERIMENT IS THE RATIO
            BETWEEN NEUTRON-WIDTH TO TOTAL WIDTH. THE STATISTICAL
            WEIGHT FACTOR AND THEREFORE THE SPIN OF THE COMPOUND
            NUCLEUS ARE OBTAINED USING RESONANCE PARAMETERS
            FROM BNL-325.
MONITOR    (82-PB-0(N,EL),,SIG)
             SCATTERING CROSS-SECTION OF LEAD,
            VALUE NOT GIVEN.
PART-DET   (N    )    NEUTRONS
COMMENT    .RESONANT SCATTERING INTENSITY OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENCE
            BETWEEN SAMPLE-IN AND SAMPLE-OUT COUNTING RATES AND
            NORMALIZED TO THE COUNTING RATE FROM A PB-SAMPLE.
STATUS     .TAKEN FROM NUCL,INSTR.METH.,17(1962)342.
            BIB-SECTION FORTIFIED BY PRIVATE COMMUNICATION.
HISTORY    (721005C)

CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS APPLIED FOR SAMPLE THICKNESS(ABSORPTION
            AFTER SCATTERING).
ERR-ANALYS .STATISTICAL ERROR DERIVED FROM OBSERVED VARIANCE ON A
            SERIES OF MEASUREMENTS.
