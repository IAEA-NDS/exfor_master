TITLE       Thermal neutron capture in Ti-50 and Ni-64
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDCTH) One MV heavy water reactor, R1.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)    Thermal neutron flux 3.x 10**12 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     .Gamma ray detected with Ge(Li)-spectrometer
            in pair spectrometer mode and anticoincidence mode.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR,GELI,NAICR) Staff-shaped Ge(Li) detector,
            vol. 3.1 cm3 and NaI annular crystal as pair
            spectrometer arrangement, above the pair production
            threshold. (An annulus of NaI, 15 cm in diam. and
            10 cm long with a hole 4 cm in diam. surrounded the
            Ge(Li)-detector.).
           .Relative efficiency of Ge(Li) pair spectrometer was
            calculated using composite spectrum.
           .For the measurement of low energy gamma-rays, the same
            NaI crystals were used in anticoincidence mantle.
            Furthermore a NaI-crystal, 12.5 cm in diam. and 10 cm
            long with a hole 1.8 cm in diam. was placed in front
            of the NaI-annulus to detect backscattered radiation.
CORRECTION .Corrected for recoil.
PART-DET   (G)    Gammas.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,100.) Errors in relative intensities are
            estimated to about 10% for strong lines and increase
            successively to about 100% for weak lines.

SAMPLE     Enriched titanium in the form of oxide was 400 mg.
           Due to the small contribution of 51Ti to the spectrum
           from the enriched sample a natural titanium sample
           was also used.

ANALYSIS   .The absolute intensity values in photons/100 neutron
            captures were obtained by normalizing the sum of the
            primary gamma rays to 100.
           .in the low energy anticoincidence spectrum, the
            intensity of 1167 keV line was normalized to 320 keV
            line from decay of Ti-51 (see FLAG).
FLAG       (1.) normalized to the 320 keV line from the 5.8 min
            decay of 51Ti to 51V, the intensity of which
            was set equal to 95.09%.
