TITLE      -THE NEUTRON ACTIVATION CROSS-SECTION OF AG-109(N,G)
            AG-110M.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    REACTOR DR 3, FUEL SCAN TUBE,
           .REACTOR DR1 FOR MEASUREMENT OF SELF SHIELDING.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL FLUX 1.55E+13 N/CM2/SEC,
           .FAST FLUX 4.45E+12 N/CM2/SEC.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL SAMPLE.
           .2 AMPOULES CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF CS-CL AND AG-CL,
            ONE WITH CADMIUM FOIL AND OTHER WITHOUT IT.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION, THERMAL ACTIVITY WAS TAKEN AS
            DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTIVITY OF FOIL WITHOUT AND WITH
            CADMIUM COVER. IRRADIATION TIME 15 MIN.
DETECTOR   (GELI )    10 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR, EFFICIENCY OF THE
            COUNTER FOR DIFFERENT GAMMA ENERGIES WAS MEASURED BY
            CALIBRATED STANDARD SOURCES FROM IAEA.
           (NAICR)    NAI(TL) CRYSTAL FOR MEASUREMENT OF SELF-
            SHIELDING.
