INC-SOURCE (D-T) 1-H-3(d,N)2-He-4. Deuterons incident on a metal
            titanium-tritide target (approx. 2 mg/cm**2 thick)
            on a silver backing (0.4 mm thick). This reaction
            generated the primary neutrons with energies in the
            range 14.8 to 20.5 MeV. Samples were placed at angles
             from 0 to 75 degrees relative to deuteron beam.
             The energy scale uncertainty is 5 keV.
             Deuteron energies of 1, 2, 3, and 4 MeV
            were used.
           (P-T)  1-H-3(P,N)2-He-3 reaction was used to produce
                  neutrons with energies between 1 and 3.4 MeV
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) standard spread.
            The neutron spectra from this source reaction were
            quasi-monoenergetic. The effective spread in the neut.
            Energy of the primary group was deduced from the
            target thickness, kinematics, and sample geometry.
           .Particular neutron flux in each case was determined
            using neutron-spectrum information obtained by the
            Time-Of-Flight  method and the spectral index method
            that involves 115-In(N,N')115m-In,58-Ni(N,P)58m+g-Co,
            27-Al(N,P)27-Mg , 56-Fe(N,P)56-Mn,27-Al(N,a)24-Na and
            93-Nb(N,2N)92m-Nb monitor reactions with distinct
            energy thresholds.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured using the neutron
            activation method.
           (STTA)  Packets containing the samples of the element
            and monitor foils which were irradiated in well-
            defined geometries near the target of the accelerator.
           (GSPEC) Radioactivity of samples was measure by
            gamma-ray spectrometry.
SAMPLE      Monitor foils of high-purity Al, Nb,Fe,Ni, In of
            natural isotopic composition, were stacked. Sample was
            sandwiched between two such stacks.
CORRECTION .Corrections for position and sample distance from the
            detector were determined using calibration sources.
            . Other corrections were determined for gamma-ray
            abundance, gamma-ray absorption in the samples,
            for internal conversion effects, and sample geometry.
           .The raw experimental data were corrected for the
            following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.
                . Geometric effects.
                . Gamma-ray absorption.
                . Absorption and scattering of neutrons.
                . Decay of product nuclei.
                . Fluctuations in neutron flux during the
                  irradiation period.
                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Sample chemical composition and impurities.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detectors were used.
           (BF3) Boron-trifluoride detector in a long-counter
                 configuration.

COMMENT    Monitor cross-section values at arbitrary neutron
           energies were derived from tabulated values by means
           of linear interpolation. The quoted neutron energy
           resolution is the root-mean-square (rms) of the
           distribution of primary neutrons.
