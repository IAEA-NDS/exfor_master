REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,718,518,2003)
SAMPLE     The natural lead samples, foils with 10-mm diameter,
           were irradiated back to back with a gold foil in the
           neutron beam.
DETECTOR   (SILI) A 4-pi-beta Si(Li)-spectrometer.
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)
           (VDG,2GERTUE)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The neutron spectrum at 30-keV was generated by
            the Li-7(p,n) reaction at reaction threshold.
           (P-T)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainty
ADD-RES     A new analysis of the solar abundances was carried
           out.

COMMENT    *By authors*. The Maxwellian average neutron capture
           cross section of Pb-208 has been reinvestigated.
           *By authors*. Cross section at thermonuclear energy
           equal 25-keV is in good agreement with a previous
           activation measurement of U.Ratzel (diplomaarbeit 1998,
           unpublished) and the respective recommended MAC cross
           section, but at kT=52-keV mac-cross section value is
           lower than the recommended cross section curve. The
           recommended mac-cross section at kT=30keV was
           confirmed.
