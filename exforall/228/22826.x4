INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  .Angles of irradiation of the target by deuterium ion
            beam are 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 130 degrees. Effective
            mean neutron energy at each sample position had been
            previously determined by the ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr
            and 93Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb cross sections
           .Neutron fluxes ranged from 1.E+7 to 6.E+7 n/cm2/sec
ANALYSIS   .Cross sections were derived from the cyclic activation
            formulas given by B.Anders, see REL-REF no.4

CORRECTION .Corrections were made for self-absorption of gammas
            in samples, random coincidence, dead time, contribu-
            tion of (n,np+nd) reaction due to 98Mo admixture,
            low energy neutron contribution (aprx 21%) and
            fluctuation of neutron flux
