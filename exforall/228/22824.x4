INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  .Angles of irradiation of the target by deuterium ion
            beam are 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 130 degrees. Effective
            mean neutron energy at each sample position had been
            previously determined by the ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr
            and 93Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb cross sections
           .Neutron fluxes ranged from 1.E+7 to 6.E+7 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     .Model sample as a disk pellets 13 mm diameter, 8.5 mm
            thickness made of pure teflon C2-F5, weight 2.9586 gr
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for gamma-ray attenuation in
            samples, random coincidence, dead time and
            fluctuation of neutron flux
