ANALYSIS   -Cross-section ratios were derived from the gamma
            ray analysis obtained during simultaneous irradiation
            at different energies of different samples and
            monitor foils using energy  dependence of the monitor
            reactions.
CORRECTION - Experimental data following application of various
            corrections. Most of these correction procedures
            were standard. The neutron scattering corrections
            were derived by the Monte-Carlo method using the
            computer code (MCNP-4C). The raw experimental data
            were corrected for the following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.
                . Geometric effects.
                . Gamma-ray absorption.
                . Absorption and scattering of neutrons.
                . Low-energy neutrons from the target.
                . Decay of product nuclei.
                . Fluctuations in neutron flux during the
                  irradiation period.
                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Multiple scattering of the neutrons in samples .
ADD-RES    (THEO)  For all measurements nuclear model calculations
                   were produced using models of the Hauser-
                   Feshbach type (HELGA, GNASH, EMPIRE, STAPRE,
                   STAPRE-H) .
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total Errors for the cross sections were
                   deduced by combining partial errors from
                   various sources in quadrature. Error sources
                   considered were:

                                                  gamma rays - 3%
