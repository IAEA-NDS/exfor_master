ANALYSIS   .Cross-Section Ratios were Derived from the Gamma
            Ray Analysis Obtained During Simultaneous Irradiation

CORRECTION . Experimental Data Following Application of Various
            Corrections. Most of these Correction Procedures
            Were Standard. The Neutron Scattering Corrections
            Were Derived by the Monte-Carlo Method Using the
            Computer Code (MCNP-4C). The Raw Experimental Data
            Were Corrected For the Following Effects:
                . Gamma-Ray Detection Efficiency.
                . Gamma-Ray Branching Factors.
                . Gamma-Ray Coincidence Summing Effects.
                . Geometric Effects.
                . Gamma-Ray Absorption.
                . Absorption and Scattering of Neutrons.
                . Low-Energy Neutrons from the Target.
                . Decay of Product Nuclei.
                . Fluctuations in Neutron Flux During the
                  Irradiation Period.
                . Isotopic Abundances.
