           (GLASD)  The irradiation the neutron flux was recorded
            in intervals of 1-min using a Li-6 glass detector for
            later correction of the number of nuclei, which
            decayed during the activation.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced via the Li-7(P,N)Be-7
                   source by bombarding a 30-mum thick layers of
            metallic Li on a water-cooled Cu-backing with protons
            of 1912 keV, 30-keV above the reaction threshold.
INC-SPECT  .The resulting quasi-stellar neutron spectrum
            approximates a maxwellian distribution for
            KT=25.0+-0.5-KeV.
