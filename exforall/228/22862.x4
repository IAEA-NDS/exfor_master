COMMENT    *By authors*.For the thermal neutron cross-section
           measurement, the samples of Dy, Hf and Au were put on
           an aluminium sample holder. The irradiation time was
            3-Hr during the 5-mw operation of the Kyoto University
           reactor .
           For the resonance integrals measurements, the samples
           Dy and Hf were put into a Cd-cover 0.5-mm in thickness
           and attached on an aluminium sample holder. A set of
           Dy and Au or Hf and Au was irradiated during 2-3hr
           with a nominal power of 1 Wt.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO) A highly enriched uranium-fueled light
           water-moderated research reactor, whose nomonal power
           is 5-mw-for the thermal neutron cross section.
           (REAC,2JPNKNK) The Kinki University reactor is high
            enriched uranium-fueled light water moderated and
            graphite-reflected research reactor-for the resonance
            integrals.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The heavy water tank can be used as a thermal
           neutron source of plane-type in a large space.
