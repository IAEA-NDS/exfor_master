DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO) A highly enriched uranium-fueled light
           water-moderated research reactor, whose nominal power
           is 5-MW-for the thermal neutron cross section.
           (REAC,2JPNKNK) The Kinki University reactor is high
            enriched uranium-fueled light water moderated and
            graphite-reflected research reactor-for the resonance
            integrals.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The heavy water tank can be used as a thermal
           neutron source of plane-type in a large space.
           The thermal neutron flux at the sample irradiation
           position was about 10**9 n/cm2/s.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
SAMPLE     *By authors*.For the thermal neutron cross-section
           measurement, the samples of Dy, Hf and Au were put on
           an aluminium sample holder. The irradiation time was
            3-hr during the 5-MW operation of the Kyoto University
           reactor .
           For the resonance integrals measurements, the samples
           Dy and Hf were put into a Cd-cover 0.5-mm in thickness
           and attached on an aluminium sample holder. A set of
           Dy and Au or Hf and Au was irradiated during 2-3hr
           with a nominal power of 1 Wt.
           The neutron fluxes during the irradiation were measured
           on Au foil (12.7mm in diameter, 50 mm in thickness).
            The neutron intensities among the irradiation runs
            were monitored by a pair of Au foils (10mm in diameter
            and 20 mm in thickness) which were set at the upper
            and lower positions 7.5 cm from the center.
