             linac, Electron burst width 1ns, Repetition rate
             800 Hz,Average electron current 70 microA, Average
             electron energy 100 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)Neutrons produced by (GAMMA,N) and
            (GAMMA,FISS) Reactions induced via bremsstrahlung
            from the electron beam hitting a rotating uranium
            target
           (THCOL) Fast neutron from the target moderated
                  to a white spectrum by water contained in
            berillium canning of 4.0cm thick walls situated
            below and above uranium target
INC-SPECT  .White Neutron Source
            10B overlap filter, 9mm thick Pb filter and Na black
            resonance filter kept permanently in the neutron beam;
            The total energy detection principle in combination
            with the pulse height weighting technique was applied.
SAMPLE     .Metallic natural thorium disc,
              diameter = 80 mm, thickness = 1.588E-3 at/b
METHOD     (TOF)  GELINA Flight path number 5; angle of the flight
            path with respect to the electron beam is 252deg;
            The weighting function was obtained by Monte Carlo
            simulations validated by experiment.
             The data have been normalized to the well-isolated an
             saturated 232Th resonance at 23.5 eV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Gamma-rays detected with two C6D6 detectors
            placed perpendicular to the neutron beam at 14.367 m
            from the neutron source
           (IOCH) 10B-loaded ionization chamber placed at 13.56 m
            from the neutron source for flux shape measurements
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG) ENDF/B-VI
            The interpolation of the 10B cross-section
            data was done log-log.
           ((MONIT)90-TH-232(N,0),,EN)  Normalisation based on
             the 232Th saturated resonance at 23 eV
ANALYSIS   .Data analysis performed with the AGS package
            (C. Bastian). The capture yield is obtained from dead
            time and background corrected response of SCIN and
            IOCH. A sample dependend weigthing function is applied
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for:
            * Dead time
            * Background
             flux: based on S, Na, W, Ag black resonances
             capture: 208Pb scattering sample + Na black resonance
            * Final capture yield corrected for multiple
             scattering and self-shielding effect (see
             Volev et al.)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)Total uncertainties were deduced by propagating
            correlated and uncorrelated partial uncertainties
            using AGS. Details in main reference
            Partial uncertainties considered were due to:
            * counting statistics, between 0.18% and 0.25 %
            * dead time and background correction
            * flux shape and normalisation, 1.5%
            * multiple scattering and self-shielding correction
