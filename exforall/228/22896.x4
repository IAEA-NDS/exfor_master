COMMENT    .By compiler: In references 2-6 initial (not re-evalu-
            ated) TER/BIN ratio yield data are given
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) The measurement were performed using
            a vacuum chamber with a sample in its centre and
            a silicon surface barrier telescope detector mounted
            outside the neutron beam.
           .Telescope consisted of a 15.4-mum thick Delta-E,
            detector-area 150 mm**2, alpha energy resolution
            50 keV and a 500-micron thick E-detector, area 450
            mm**2, alpha energy resolution 19 keV. The energy
            calibration of the detector was done using the well-
            known energies of the B-10(n,alpha)Li-7,
            Li-6(n,alpha)T, Nd-143(n,alpha)Ce-140 reactions and of
            the U-234, U-235 and Cf-252 radioactive decay alphas
