COMMENT    -Of authors, JAERI-C-2003-006,144,2003.This measurement
           was done to check the experimental method to measure
           energy spectrum of two neutrons emitted through n,2n
           reaction. Method is basically successful, but there is
           a problem of statistical accuracy.
           -Of compiler M.M. Really, two experiments were made,
           described respectively in S,JAERI-C-2003-006,144,2003
           and in J,NIM/A,595,439,2008 .
           Both were compiled in this one Entry according to
           recommendation of NDS IAEA (N.Otsuka).

COMMENT    Of authors. Errors bars are not specified, because are
           such large that the spectrum become not legible if
           specified.
STATUS     (UNOBT)   Data are not given, only graph is present

            Request for data was sent to I.Murata, his answer:
            " JAERI-Conf 2003-006 includes early-phase (fairly
             preliminary) data. So I recommend that these data
             should not be used."

SAMPLE      1.5 cm diameter, 3 cm long; currently larger samples

            collimator (485 cm from neutron source).

INC-SPECT    14.2-MeV monochromatic neutron beam, flux
             about 1.E+6 neutrons/sec/cm**2 at sample position.
ANALYSIS    Measurements were carried for 5 azimuthal angles 75,
           110, 180, 270, 300 degrees to investigate azimuthal-
           angle dependence.TDX was obtained by unfolding of the
           measured pulse height spectrum with code FORIST.
           Data were compared with JENDL-3.3 evaluation of DDX at
           60 degrees divided by 4*pi . Reasonably good agreement.
           Difference in lower energy range was explained by
           measurable limit energy of 0.6 MeV.
           Dependence on the azimuthal angle was found to be
           negligible small.
EN-SEC     (E,N) Outgoing neutron energy.
           ANG-AZ -azimuthal angle,

           ANG2 - second detector angle.
CORRECTION For neutron inter-detector scattering (tested by carbon
           sample).
ERR-ANALYS Error values are typically around 20% in lower energy
           region, more than several tens of percents in higher
           energy region.

SAMPLE      1.5 cm diameter, 3 cm long; currently larger samples
            of about 2.4 cm diameter. Placed at 135 cm from
            collimator (485 cm from neutron source).
            Distance sample - detector 18.8 cm.
INC-SPECT    14.2-MeV monochromatic neutron beam, flux
             about 1.E+6 neutrons/sec/cm**2 at sample position.
ANALYSIS    Measurements were carried for 5 azimuthal angles 75,
           110, 180, 270, 300 degrees to investigate azimuthal-
           angle dependence.TDX was obtained by unfolding of the
           measured pulse height spectrum with code FORIST.
           Data were compared with JENDL-3.3 evaluation of DDX at
           60 degrees divided by 4*pi . Reasonably good agreement.
           Difference in lower energy range was explained by
           measurable limit energy of 0.6 MeV.
           Dependence on the azimuthal angle was found to be
           negligible small.
EN-SEC     (E,N) Outgoing neutron energy.
           ANG-AZ -azimuthal angle,
           ANG1 - first detector angle,
           ANG2 - second detector angle.
CORRECTION For neutron inter-detector scattering (tested by carbon
           sample).
ERR-ANALYS Error values are typically around 20% in lower energy
           region, more than several tens of percents in higher
           energy region.
