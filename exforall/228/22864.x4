ADD-RES    .Al-26/Al-27 isotope ratios as low as 10E-15 could be
            measured with the Vienna environmental research
            acclerator corresponding to cross-section values as
            low as 0.04-mb.
           .For monitoring the ion temperature of a thermal plasma
            a sensitivity of a few percent can be achieved by this
            method. In case of non-thermal plasmas depending on th

COMMENT    *By authors*.The amount of Al-26 nuclei formed in all
           irradiations was determined via accelerator mass
           spectrometry with the vienna environmental research
           accelerator.
ERR-ANALYS The total error consists of random and systematic
           contributions-
           the uncertainty of the neutron fluence amounts to less
           or equal 2.7%.
           The uncertainty of the Al-26/Al-27 ratios comes mainly
           from the uncertainty of the nominal values of the Al-26
           standard materials 3.5% and from averaging of the
           individual results over the whole sample area as well
           as statistical errors. The latter dominate the low
           isotope ratios, whwreas systematic errors affect the
           higher cross-sections.
           The neutron energy in the near-threshold region was
           assumed to be known to better than 40-KeV. This leads
           to an additional uncertainty of 0.8-mb for a neutron
           energy of 13.8-MeV. It corresponds to an error of about
            50% at 13.8-MeV and about 25% at 13.9-MeV and reflects
           the steeply raising shape of the excitation function
           near threshold. For the higher-energy region, a 20-KeV
           uncertainty was assumed, which corresponds to absolute
           uncertainties of 0.6-mb, I.E. 10% at 14-MeV neutron
           energy and 2.4% for 14.8-MeV. For both neutron energies
            17- and 19-MeV two Al-foils were available. About 10-
           samples per foil were prepared for AMS measurements.
           The main contributions to the uncertainty of the cross-
           section values are 4.7% from the fluence determination
           and 5% from the AMS measurements-isotope ratios in the
           order of 10*e-13. The total error of the cross-section
           data amounts to 7%. The uncertainty of the neutron
           energy is negligible due to the nearly energy-
           independent shape of the excitation function in this
           region.
