           Final results as determined from Al-26/Al-27 ratios
           and neutron fluences.
SAMPLE     Pure Al-metal samples, 99.999% enrichment, 1-mm
           thickness and Nb-foil of 0.125-mm for the neutron
           fluence determination, were used.

           generator of the Radium Institute in Vienna.
           Deuterons with an energy 230-KeV were produced.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error consists of systematic and
           random contributions:
           (ERR-1,,2.7) the uncertainty of the neutron fluence
           amounts to less or equal 2.7%.
           (ERR-2) the uncertainty of the Al-26/Al-27 standard
           (DATA-ERR1,1.5,10.5) the uncertainty from averaging of
            the individual results over the whole sample area as
           well as statistical errors. The latter dominate the low
           isotope ratios, whereas systematic errors affect the
           higher cross-sections.
           (DATA-ERR2,2.5,50.) The neutron energy in the near-
           threshold region was assumed to be known to better than
            40-KeV. This leads to an additional uncertainty of
           0.8-mb for a neutron energy of 13.8-MeV. It corresponds
           to an error of about 50% at 13.8-MeV and about 25% at
           13.9-MeV and reflects the steeply raising shape of the
            excitation function near threshold. For the higher-
           energy region, a 20-KeV uncertainty was assumed, which
           corresponds to absolute uncertainties of 0.6-mb, i.e.
           10% at 14-MeV neutron energy and 2.4% for 14.8-MeV.

            No other information about sources of uncertainty,

            Since the results from the three neutron irradiations
            (Vienna, St. Petersburg and Tokai-mura) for 14 MeV
           neutrons agree very well with each other, one can
           safely assume that systematic errors in the neutron
           irradiation have been largely eliminated.
           The absolute values of the cross-sections are believed
           to be known to about 5-8% in the energy region above
           14 MeV. The uncertainty items mainly from systematic
           errors. Overall, a very consistent set of cross-section
