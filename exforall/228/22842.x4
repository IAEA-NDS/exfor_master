INC-SOURCE (AM-BE) Three 592 GBq 241Am-Be isotopic neutron source
INC-SPECT  .Alpha-berillium source was immersed in paraffin.
            Thermal neutron flux was (1.5+-0.2)E+4 and
            epithermal neutron flux was (1.4+-0.1)E+3 n/cm2/sec.
            Each irradiations were performed with and without
