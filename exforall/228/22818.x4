            Corrections. Most of these Correction Procedures
            Were Standard. The Neutron Scattering Corrections

            Computer Code (MCNP-4C). The Raw Experimental Data
            Were Corrected For the Following Effects:
                . Gamma-Ray Detection Efficiency.
                . Gamma-Ray Branching Factors.

            Samples were Used at Various Times During the
            Measurements, Either to Serve As Secondary Standards
            For Neutron Fluence Determination or For the Purpose
            Of Establishing Corrections For Low-Energy Neutrons

SAMPLE     .These Cross Sections were Measured Using Natural
            Molybdenum Sample Material. The Samples were Very
            Large, Consisting of Plates Stacked Around the Target
            At Various Angles. The Chosen Sample Geometry was a
            Compromise Between the Need to Provide Large Samples
            Owing to the Very Long Half Life of Nb-94G and the
            Requirement of Minimizing Radiation Absorption in
            These Samples. Long Irradiation Times were Required
            In Order to Generate Sufficient No-94G Activity For
            Counting.
            The Irradiated Molybdenum Samples were Cooled For a
            Sufficient Time to Allow All Nb-94M Activity to Decay
            By Isomeric Transitions to the Ground State of Nb-94.
            Summed Contributions from Three Distinct Reactions on
            Natural Molybdenum were Measured in this Experiment.
            Thus, the Indicated Cross Sections Correspond to
            Nb-94M+G Production from Neutrons on Natural
            Molybdenum.   -  Comment by Authors
