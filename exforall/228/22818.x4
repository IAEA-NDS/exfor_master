            All measurements involving secondary standards were
            eventually referenced to the primary standards.
            All relative measurements were eventually normalized
            to the primary standards.
           Monitor cross-section values at arbitrary neutron
           energies were derived from tabulated values by means
           of linear interpolation. The quoted neutron energy

           distribution of primary neutrons. (Author's)

ANALYSIS   -Cross-section ratios were derived from the gamma
            ray analysis obtained during simultaneous irradiation
            at different energies of different samples and
            monitor foils using energy  dependency of the monitor
            reactions .
CORRECTION - Experimental data following application of various
            corrections. Most of these correction procedures
            were standard. The neutron scattering corrections
            were derived by the Monte-Carlo method using the
            computer code (MCNP-4C). The raw experimental data
            were corrected for the following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.
                . Geometric effects.
                . Gamma-ray absorption.
                . Absorption and scattering of neutrons.
                . Low-energy neutrons from the target.
                . Decay of product nuclei.
                . Fluctuations in neutron flux during the
                  irradiation period.
                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Multiple scattering of the neutrons in samples.
           -Auxiliary aluminum, iron, nickel, indium, and niobium
            samples were used at various times during the
            measurements, either to serve as secondary standards
            for neutron fluence determination or for the purpose
            of establishing corrections for low-energy neutrons
            via the method of spectral indexing.
ADD-RES    (THEO)  For all measurements nuclear model calculations
                   were produced using models of the Hauser-
                   Feshbach Type (HELGA, GNASH, EMPIRE, STAPRE,
                   STAPRE-H)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total Errors for the cross sections were
                   deduced by combining partial errors from
                   various sources in quadrature. Error sources
                   considered were:

           (ERR-5,,3.) Max Uncertainty in the absorption of
                                                  gamma rays - 3%
           (ERR-6,,1.) Max Uncertainty due to sample mass    - 1%
           (ERR-7,,1.) Max Uncertainty due to counting times - 1%

SAMPLE     -These cross sections were measured using natural
            molybdenum sample material. The samples were very
            large, consisting of plates stacked around the target
            at various angles. The chosen sample geometry was a
            compromise between the need to provide large samples
            owing to the very long half life of Nb-94G and the
            requirement of minimizing radiation absorption in
            these samples. Long irradiation times were required
            in order to generate sufficient Nb-94G activity for
            counting.
            The irradiated molybdenum samples were cooled for a
            sufficient time to allow all Nb-94M activity to decay
            by isomeric transitions to the ground state of Nb-94.
            Summed contributions from three distinct reactions on
            natural molybdenum were measured in this experiment.
            Thus, the indicated cross sections correspond to
            Nb-94M+G production from neutrons on natural
            molybdenum.   -  Comment by Authors.

           samples enriched in Mo-97 and Mo-98, respectively, in

           The irradiated molybdenum samples were cooled for a
           sufficient time to allow all Nb-97M activity to decay
           by isomeric transitions to the ground state of Nb-97.

           contributions from the Mo-97(N,P) and Mo-98(N,NP+D)
           reactions to the production of measured Nb-97M+G.
           The irradiated molybdenum samples were cooled for a
           sufficient time to allow all Nb-97M activity to decay
           by isomeric transitions to the ground state of Nb-97.
