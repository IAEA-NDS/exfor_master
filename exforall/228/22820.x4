INC-SOURCE (D-T) 1-H-3(d,N)2-He-4. Deuterons incident on a metal
            Titanium-tritide target (approx. 2 mg/cm**2 thick)
            on a silver backing (0.5 mm thick). This reaction
            generated the primary neutrons with energies in the
            range 14 to 20.5 MeV. Samples were placed at angles
            from 0 to 75 degrees. The energy scale uncertainty
            is 5 keV. Deuteron energies of 1, 2, 3, and 4 MeV
            were used.
           (P-T)  1-H-3(P,N)2-He-3 reaction was used to produce
                  neutrons with energies between 1 and 3.4 MeV
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectra from this source reaction were
            quasi-monoenergetic. The effective spread in the neut.
            Energy of the primary group was deduced from the
            target thickness, kinematics, and sample geometry.
           .Particular neutron flux in each case was determined
            using neutron-spectrum information obtained by the
           .Time-of-Flight method and the spectral index method
            that involves 115-In(N,N')115m-In,58-Ni(N,P)58m+g-Co,
            27-Al(N,P)27-Mg , 56-Fe(N,P)56-Mn,27-Al(N,A)24-Na and
            93-Nb(N,2N)92m-Nb monitor reactions with distinct
            energy thresholds.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured using the neutron
            activation method.
           (STTA)  Packets containing the samples of the element
            and monitor foils which were irradiated in well-
            defined geometries near the target of the accelerator.
CORRECTION .Corrections for position and sample distance from the
            detector were determined using calibration sources.,
            For coincidence summing in certain cases.
            . Other corrections were determined for gamma-ray
            abundance, gamma-ray absorption in the samples,
            for internal conversion effects, and sample geometry.
           .The raw experimental data were corrected for the
            following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.
                . Geometric effects.
                . Gamma-ray absorption.
                . Absorption and scattering of neutrons.
                . Low-energy neutrons from the target.
                . Decay of product nuclei.
                . Fluctuations in neutron flux during the
                  irradiation period.
                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Sample chemical composition and impurities.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detectors were used.
            This included one planar detector with a carbon fiber
            window to enable photons with energies below 100 keV
            to be measured.
           (BF3) Boron-trifluoride detector in a long-counter
                 configuration.

             deduced by combining partial errors from various
             sources in quadrature. Error sources considered were-
           (ERR-S,1.,15.) statistical counting errors.
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) uncertainty in detector efficiencies.
           (ERR-2,0.01,3.) uncertainty in decay branching factors.

COMMENT    Monitor cross-section values at arbitrary neutron
           energies were derived from tabulated values by means
           of linear interpolation. The quoted neutron energy
           resolution is the root-mean-square (rms) of the
           distribution of primary neutrons.
