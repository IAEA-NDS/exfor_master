INSTITUTE  (2JPNTIT)  Experimental site
           (3KORKNU)  G.Kim
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2 MV PELLETRON Accelerator of the
            Research Laboratory For Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  .Proton energy was set equal to 1.903 MeV
                which is  22 keV above threshold energy of the
                7Li(p,n)7Be reaction.  Pulse repetition rate is
                4 MHz, average proton beam current 9 Micro-A
INC-SPECT   .Neutrons with energies from 2 to 90 keV are emitted
            within 50 degrees with respect to proton beam.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-Of-Flight
           (SITA) Sample run and empty run were made cyclically
                  with the standard gold run
DETECTOR   (GLASD)   5.0 mm diam, 5.0 mm thick Li-6 glass detector
                     for neutron spectrum determination.
           (NAICR)  Large Anti-Compton Na-I(TL) Spectrometer
SAMPLE      .Two monitor gold samples were used in the experiment.
            1st one has weight 6.014 gram, diam 20.10 mm,
                thickness 0.98 mm, chemical purity 99.99%
            2nd one has weight 3.437 gram, diam 14.95 mm,
                thickness 1.01 mm, chemical purity 99.99%
            .Sample structure is taken from the previous
             references
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)       Total error consists from:
           (ERR-S,1.,11.) Statistical error
            The systematic errors, that are the PH weighing
           function, extrapolation and neutron correction, were
           taken into account for those of capture cross sections.
           (ERR-1) Error of the weighting function of the
                         gamma-ray spectrometer
           (ERR-2,,0.1) Error of the sample atoms number
           (ERR-3) The error of response functions
           (ERR-4) Error in extrapolation
           (ERR-5) Error from neutron correction
           (MONIT-ERR)   Error of the monitor
