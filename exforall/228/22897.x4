FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3  MV PELLETRON accelerator of the
            research laboratory for Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Lithium target bombarded by 1.5 ns bunch
            pulsed proton beam, repetition rate 4 MHz, proton
            beam current is 7.8 - 8.9 micro-A
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  Anti-Compton Na-I(Tl) spectrometer. Main
            detector 15.2 cm diameter by 20.3 cm length was
            centered in a hollow Compton-suppression Na-I(TL)
            detector 33.0 cm outer diameter and  35.6 cm length
             - for gamma detection.
           (GLASD)  Li-6 glass detector for neutron flux monito-
              ring. 5 mm diameter * 5 mm length 6-Li detetor was
              used for 15-100 KeV region, and 102 mm diameter *
              6.4 mm length detector was used for 550 KeV.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (SITA)  Zirconium samples, monitor gold sample and
                   without any sample were performed cyclically
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
ADD-RES    (G-SPC)
SAMPLE     .About 1.3 gram of isotopically enriched oxide powder
            Zr-O2 was contained in a graphite case with an outer
            diameter of 24.0 mm.
           .A gold sample was used as a standard, metallic,
            chemical purity 99.99%, weights 6.023 and 12.04 gram,
            thickness  1.0 mm/5.85E-3 atoms/b and 2.0 mm/
            11.7E-3 atoms/B*1oe-03, diameter 20.0 mm.
CORRECTION *By authors*.The corrrection for the neutron self-
            shielding and multiple-scattering in the sample was
            made. Other corrections were made for the gamma-ray
            scattering and absorption in the sample is 1-5%, for
            the dependence of detection efficiency on the gamma-
            ray source position is less than 1%, for the effect
            of the ph-discrimation is less than 0.6-MeV on the
            capture yields-4%, for the effect of chemical and
            isotopic impurities in the sample on the capture
            yields 3-13% and for the attenuation of neutron
            monitor counts of the small Li-6-glass detector due
            to the Zr-91, Zr-92 or Au-197 sample in the 15-100
            KeV measurement 5-14%. The dead time of data
            acquisition system was negligibly small less than
            0.2%, because the counting rates were small 20-400-cps
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  Max statistical error. Min error is 2%.
           (MONIT-ERR)  Error of the standard cross-section of
            Au-197 is 3%.
           (ERR-1) The error in the weighting function of the
            gamma-ray spectrometer is 1%.
           (ERR-2) The error due to the extrapolation of Pulse-
                   Height spectrum below the discrimination
                   level is 2%.

                   multiple-scattering correction factors.

CORRECTION .The correction for the chemical impurities is less
            than 1.7% for Zr-91. The correction for the isotopic
            impurities ranged from 2 to 8% for Zr-91. In the
            isotopic correction for Zr-91, contribution of
            Zr-90,92 are dominant.
