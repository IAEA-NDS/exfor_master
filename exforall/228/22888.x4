FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDUPP) The Swedberg Laboratory facility
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  A 4-mm thick lithium target, about 200-mg/cm2,
            enriched to 99.98%
METHOD     (TOF)
           (EDE) For identifying light charged particles
           (BCINT)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,CSICR)  MEDLEY set-up
            the light charged particles, produced in the reaction
            target, were detected by means of eight three-detector
            telescopes, each composed of two silicon detectors and
            a CsI(Tl)-crystal. The silicon detectors are thin for
            the delTa-E1 detectors 50-60 mu-meters and thicker
            for the delta-E2 400-500-mu-meters. The active areas
            are about 450 mm2, both types being fully depleted
            standard silicon surface-barrier detectors. The
            material of E-detectors is CsI(Tl) scintillator
            crystal, total thickness 50 mm consisting of a
            cylindrical and a conical part. The cylindrical part
            thickness is 30 mm and diameter 40 mm which is thick
            enough to stop 100-MeV protons. Events associated
            with 96 MeV neutrons from the beam are selected using
            a time-of-flight technique.
            A Am-241 alpha-source, introduced in the center of the
            MEDLEY chamber, was used to obtain data for the energy
            calibration of the delta-E detectors.
INC-SPECT   The flux of about 3. x 10**4 neutrons/s/cm2.
SAMPLE      Two different carbon targets and one polyethylene
            C-H2-target were used. The targets, which are disc-
            shaped, have the dimensions 0.15-mm thick, 25-mm in
            diameter, 0.50-mm thick, 22-mm in diameter and 1-mm
            thick, 25-mm in diameter, for the two carbon and one
            the polyethylene targets, respectively. The thick
            target allows good statistics and the thin one enables
            cross checks of the corrections of the energy and
            particle losses due to the target thickness.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
            * neutron flux was monitored by Faraday cap and
              in addition by TFBC using U-238 neutron-induced
              fission counting - agreement within < 2.%
MONIT-REF  (22668002,J.Rahm+,J,PR/C,63,044001,2001)  - Absolute
            cross- sections are obtained by normalization to the
            H(n,p) elastic scattering differential cross-section
            at 96 MeV
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for -
            - target effect, i.e.energy and particle losses in the
              targets
            - collimator effect
            - wrap-around effects caused by the interference of
              low-energy neutrons, below 22-MeV, with the mono-
              energetic neutrons defined by the 96-MeV peak.
            - Minor correction of 1%, due to differences in solid
              angles between the various telescopes
            - TOF-distortion
            - Cs-I(Tl) intrinsic efficiency
            - dead time.
ADD-RES    (COMP)  Calculations with Gnash -the two versions of
           the Gnash code use the exciton model for
           pre-equilibrium particle emission and the
           Hauser-Feshbach statistical model for equilibrium decay
           of the compound nucleus.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty of CsI(Tl) detector intrinsic
            efficiency;
           (ERR-2,,1.) Uncertainty of the computer dead time;
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty of the wrap-around effect
           (ERR-4,2.,3.)  Uncertainty of the solid angle
           (ERR-5) The uncertainty in the absolute cross section
             normalization has been estimated to be 4.5% with
            contributions of (2% each):
              * uncertainty in the (n,p)-reference elastic
                scattering cross section (see MONIT-REF),
              * uncertainty in the target thickness,
              * uncertainty in the neutron-beam fluence,
              * uncertainty in the statistics in the (n,p) elastic
                scattering peak, and
              * uncertainty in neutrons of low-energy
                contributing to the (n,p) elastic-scattering peak.
COMMENT    From Stefan Pomp:'The work and data presented by
           Tippawan et al.(see REL-REF) supersede (in my mind) the
           Bergenwall data (which is an earlier, in the end
           independent analysis made by a subgroup of people
           involved in the original data taking and using the same
           experimental raw data)'.

ANALYSIS   .Total production cross section are obtained by
             taking the average values of the extrapolations
             cross-sections and adding them to the experimental
             cross section
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)    The errors shown include both the
            statistical and systematic errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic  uncertainties in the measured
            data are estimated to 16% including all partial errors
            (see Subent 001).
