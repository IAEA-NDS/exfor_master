METHOD     (TOF)
           (EDE) For identifiing light charged particles
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,CSICR)  MEDLEY set-up
            the light charged particles, produced in the reaction
            target, were detected by means of eight three-detector
            telescopes, each composed of two silicon detectors and
            a CsI(Tl)-crystal. The silicon detectors are thin for
            the delTa-E1 detectors 50-60 mu-meters and thicker
            for the delta-E2 400-500-mu-meters. The material of
            E-detectors is CsI(Tl) scintillator crystal, total
            thickness 50 mm consisting of a cylindrical and a
            conical part. The cylindrical part thickness is 30 mm
            and diameter 40 mm which is thick enough to stop
            100-MeV protons. Events associated with 96 MeV
            neutrons from the beam are selected using a
            time-of-flight technique.
            A Am-241 alpha-source, introduced in the center of the
            MEDLEY chamber, was used to obtain data for the energy
            calibration of the delta-E detectors.
INC-SPECT  .The energy resolution of the complete information
            from a telescope is estimated from the overall energy
            as derived from the points associated with the
            reactions C-12(N,P)B-12-gs  and C-12(N,d)B-11-gs .
            A fit of the proton and deuteron peaks from the carbon
            target from these reactions, indicate overall
            resolutions in the order of 2.2-MeV and 1.8-MeV for
           the protons and the deuterons, respectively.
SAMPLE     .Two different carbon targets and one polyethylene
            C-H2-target were used. The targets, which are disc-
            shaped, have the dimensions 0.15-mm thick, 25-mm in
            diameter, 0.50-mm thick, 22-mm in diameter and 1-mm
            thick, 25-mm in diameter, for the two carbon and one
            the polyethylene targets, respectively. The thick
            target allows good statistics and the thin one enables
            cross checks of the corrections of the energy and
            particle losses due to the target thickness.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
MONIT-REF  (22668002,J.RAHM+,J,PR/C,63,044001,2001)  - Absolute
            cross- sections are obtained by normalisation to the
            H(N,P) elastic scattering differential cross-section
            at 96 MeV
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for -
            - target effect, I.E.Energy and particle losses in the
              targets
            - collimator effect
            - wrap-around effects caused by the interference of
              low-energy neutrons, below 22-MeV, with the mono-
              energetic neutrons defined by the 96-MeV peak.
            - Minor correction of 1%, due to differences in solid
              angles between the various telescopes
            - TOF-distortion
            - Cs-I(Tl) intrinsic efficiency
            - dead time.
ADD-RES    (COMP)  Calculations with gnash -the two versions of
           the gnash code use the exciton model for
           pre-equilibrium particle emission and the
           Hauser-Feshbach statistical model for equilibrium decay
           of the compound nucleus.
ERR-ANALYS          The uncertainty in the absolute cross section
             normalisation has been estimated to be 4.5%.
            Contributions of 2% each from the (N,P)-reference
            elastic scattering cross section (see MONIT-REF),
            from the target thickness, from the neutron-beam
            fluence, from the statistics in the (N,P) elastic
            scattering peak, and from neutrons of low-energy
            contributing to the (N,P) elastic-scattering peak.
            The statistical uncertainties and the systematic ones
            including those due to the various corrections are
            given in Table 1 and in DATA subents.
