HISTORY    (20041127C)
           (20041222U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The irradiations of the samples were carried out within
           and without a cylindrical cadmium shield case. The
           irradiations for eight samples for each element, which
           are individually prepared from the fresh stocks, were
           repeated four time, that is, a set of four, with and
           without Cd-irradiation data for mno(2), Ga(2)O(3),
           as(2)O(3) are obtained. The samples were diluted to
           minimize self-shielding during irradiation. For this,
           the samples were mechanically mixed with finely grained
           Al(2)O(3) powder by 98.6-96%, since Al-27 isotope has
           low neutron absorption cross section.
           The irradiation times for the (N,g) reactions of Mn-55,
           Ga-71, as-75 were chosen for a period of 3-6 half-
           lives, yielding enough activity to be measured in gamma
           ray counting system.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The results are discussed and compared with
           previous measurements and the evaluated data in
           endf/B-vi and jendl-3.2.
           Using the nuclear data and the measured cadmium ratios
           for W- and Au-, alpha-epithermal neutron spectrum shape
           factor has been found to be O.116+-0.006 for the sample
           irradiation position.

           active volume of 100-cm*3.
