TITLE       Measurement of thermal neutron cross-sections and
            resonance integrals for Ga-71(n,gamma)Ga-72 and
            As-75(n,gamma)As-76 by using Am-241-Be isotopic
            neutron source

SAMPLE     The irradiations of the samples were carried out within
           and without a cylindrical cadmium shield case. The
           irradiations for eight samples for each element, which
           are individually prepared from the fresh stocks, were
           repeated four time, that is, a set of four, with and
           without Cd-irradiation data for MnO(2), Ga(2)O(3),
           As(2)O(3) are obtained. The samples were diluted to
           minimize self-shielding during irradiation. For this,
           the samples were mechanically mixed with finely grained
           Al(2)O(3) powder by 98.6-96%, since Al-27 isotope has
           low neutron absorption cross section.
           The irradiation times for the (n,gamma) reactions of
           Mn-55, Ga-71, As-75 were chosen for a period of
           3-6 half-lives, yielding enough activity to be measured
            in gamma-ray counting system.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The results are discussed and compared with
           previous measurements and the evaluated data in
           ENDF/B-VI and JENDL-3.2.
           Using the nuclear data and the measured cadmium ratios
           for W- and Au-, alpha-epithermal neutron spectrum shape
           factor has been found to be 0.116+-0.006 for the sample
           irradiation position.
DETECTOR    A reverse-electrode germanium detector with a total
           active volume of 100-cm*3.
INC-SPECT  *EN-RSL* the energy resolution N-type Ge-detector with
           be-window was 1.80-keV for 1332.5-keV of Co-60 and
            0.97-keV for 122-keV of Co-57 and its relative
           efficiency was 22.6%.
