SAMPLE     Al-foil of 10-mm*10-mm*0.2-mm thick was used.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The d-t-neutrons were generated by bombarding a
           water-cooled 3.7*10e+11-bq-tritiated titanium target
           with a 300-KeV deuteron beam.

FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNOSA) The intense 14-MeV neutron source
           facility of OSAKA University-OKTAVIAN.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
CORRECTION *By authors*.Neutron irradiation fields was noted and
            induced activities was measured including the
            contributions of scattered low-enegy neutrons, the
            fluctuation of the neutron fluence rate during
            irradiation, the true coincidence sum effect, the
            random coincidence sum effect, the deviation in the
            measuring position due to finite sample thickness,
            the self-absorption of the gamma-ray in the sample
            materials and the interference reactions producing the
            same radionuclides or the ones emitting the gamma-ray
            with the sameenergy interest.
ERR-ANALYS         The total errors were derived by combining the
           experimental error-
           the error in low-energy neutrons is less 2% (30% of
           correction magnitude).
           The error in neutron fluence rate fluctuations is less
            0.4% (20% of correction magnitude).
           The error in detector efficiency curve is 5% at E(G)
           less 80-KeV, 3% at e(g)=300-80-KeV, 1.5% at e(g) more
           than 300-KeV.
           The error in efficiency conversion ratio betwee close
           and conventional position is 1-2%.
           The error in true coincidence sum less 0.6%.
           The error in random coincidence sum less 0.1%.
           The error in sample thickness is 0.1% (20% of
           correction magnitude).
           The error in self-absorption of gamma-ray is 0.2-4%
            (20% of correction magnitude).
           The error in counting statistics of gamma-ray is 1-30%.
           The error in sample weight is 0.1%.
           The error in gamma-ray peak area evaluation is 0.5%.
           The error of nuclear data-
           the error in monitor cross section is 3%.
           The error in absolute gamma-ray intensity is 0.1-20%.
           The error in half-life is 0-10%.
