SAMPLE     Al-foil of 10-mm*10-mm*0.2-mm thick was used.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The d-t-neutrons were generated by bombarding a
           water-cooled 3.7 x 10**11-Bq-tritiated titanium target
           with a 300-keV deuteron beam.

MONIT-REF  (,P.F.Rose+,R,BNL-NCS-17541,1991)
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNOSA) The intense 14-MeV neutron source
           facility of OSAKA University-OKTAVIAN.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
CORRECTION *By authors*.Neutron irradiation fields was noted and
            induced activities was measured including the
            contributions of scattered low-energy neutrons, the
            fluctuation of the neutron fluence rate during
            irradiation, the true coincidence sum effect, the
            random coincidence sum effect, the deviation in the
            measuring position due to finite sample thickness,
            the self-absorption of the gamma-ray in the sample
            materials and the interference reactions producing the
            same radionuclides or the ones emitting the gamma-ray
            with the same energy interest.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total errors
             The main source of the total error is the standard
             cross-section of 27Al (n,alpha) 24Na (ENDF/B-VI).
