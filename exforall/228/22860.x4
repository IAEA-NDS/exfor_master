SAMPLE     Al-foil of 10-mm*10-mm*0.2-mm thick was used.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The d-t-neutrons were generated by bombarding a
           water-cooled 3.7 x 10**11-Bq-tritiated titanium target
           with a 300-keV deuteron beam.

METHOD     (ACTIV)
CORRECTION *By authors*.Neutron irradiation fields was noted and
            induced activities was measured including the
            contributions of scattered low-energy neutrons, the
            fluctuation of the neutron fluence rate during
            irradiation, the true coincidence sum effect, the
            random coincidence sum effect, the deviation in the
            measuring position due to finite sample thickness,
            the self-absorption of the gamma-ray in the sample
            materials and the interference reactions producing the
            same radionuclides or the ones emitting the gamma-ray
            with the same energy interest.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total errors were derived by combining the
           experimental error-
           (ERR-1,,2.) The error in low-energy neutrons is less
                        2% (30% of correction magnitude).
           (ERR-2,,0.4) The error in neutron fluence rate
           fluctuations is less 0.4% (20% of correction magnitude)
           (ERR-3,1.5,5.) The error in detector efficiency curve
           is 5% at E(gamma) less 80keV, 3% at E(gamma)=80-300keV,
           1.5% at E(gamma) more than 300-keV.
           (ERR-4,1.,2.) The error in efficiency conversion ratio
           between close and conventional position is 1-2%.
           (ERR-5,,0.6) The error in true coincidence sum < 0.6%.
           (ERR-6,,0.1) The error in random coincidence sum < 0.1%
           (ERR-7) The error in sample thickness is 0.1% (20% of
           correction magnitude).
           (ERR-8,0.2,42.) The error in self-absorption of
            gamma-ray is 0.2-4% (20% of correction magnitude).
           (ERR-S,1.,30.) The error in counting statistics of
                                           gamma-ray is 1-30%.
           (ERR-9) The error in sample weight is 0.1%.
           (ERR-10) The error in gamma-ray peak area
                                        evaluation is 0.5%.
           The error of nuclear data-
           (ERR-11) the error in monitor cross section is 3%.
           (ERR-12,0.1,20.) The error in absolute gamma-ray
                                         intensity is 0.1-20%.
           (ERR-13,0.,10.) The error in half-life is 0-10%.
