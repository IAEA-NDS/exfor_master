FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2 MV PELLETRON Accelerator of the
            Research Laboratory For Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Lithium target bombarded by 1.5 ns bunch
            proton beam. for neutron energies 10-80 keV proton
            energy is 1.903 MeV (22 keV above threshold energy of
            P-Li7 reaction), pulse repetition rate 2 MHz, average
            proton current 6 micro-a. for 520 keV neutron energy
            proton energy is 2.3 MeV, pulse repetition rate 4 MHz,
            average proton current 13 micro-A
PART-DET   (G,N)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  Anti-compton Na-I(TL) spectrometer. Main
            detector 15.2 cm diameter by 20.3 cm was centered
            in a 33.0 cm outer diameter by 35.6 cm Na-I(TL) hollow
            compton-suppression detector - for gamma detection.
            energy resolution is 7% at 0.662 MeV and time resolu-
            tion is 4.0 ns for 0.511 MeV gamma
           (GLASD)  Li-6 Glass detectors were used for neutron
              flux monitoring. Small 5 mm diameter * 5 mm Length
              6-Li detetor was used for 10-80 keV region, and
              long 102 mm Diameter 6.4 mm length detector was
              used for 520 KeV
METHOD     (TOF)    Flight Base is 12 and 20 Cm
