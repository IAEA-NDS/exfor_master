INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) .The neutron spectrum was produced via the
            Li-7(P,N)be-7 reaction by bombarding a 30-mum thick
            Li-target of 6-mm diameter with protons of 1911-KeV,
            30-KeV above the reaction threshold.
DETECTOR   (HPGE).A 39-cm3 high-purity Ge-detector.
           (GLASD).A Li-6 glass detector for monitoring of the
                   neutron flux variations.
PART-DET   (G,N)
INC-SPECT  .The resulting neutron spectrum is a continuous
            distribution in neutron energy and has a high energy
             cutoff at e(N)=106-KeV. The reaction kinematics
            restrict the emitted neutrons to a forward cone with
            an opening angle of 120-degree.
SAMPLE     .The samples were 7-mm diameter disks that were cut
            from a metallic lanthanum foil of natural composition.
            The use of an additional lanthanum oxide sample was
            turned down, since the La(2)O(3) and La((oh)3) from
            white powders, which makes it difficult to define the
            stoichiometry and thus the mass of lanthanum in sample
            Therefore, the sample was polished and stored in an
            argon atmosphere in order to remove and prevent
            surface impurities.
            .The sample was sandwiched between two gold foils.

CORRECTION .Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption.
            The summing correction factor for each gamma
            transition was obtained by comparing the intensity of
            the line in the monoenergetic simulated spectrum to
            that in the complex decay spectrum.

ADD-RES    (THEO).Results the S- and r-process components could
            be more accurately determined, making lanthanum a
            reliable S- and r-process indicator in stellar

STATUS     .From the text of main reference. Data from LA3
            measurement, E=487.02 gamma line, with minimal
            systematic error
COMMENT    *By authors*.The final La-139(N,g)La-140 cross section
           was adopted from the result of the third activation
           with the smallest systemetic uncertainty-33.2+-0.7-mb.
           Throughout the analysis, the four strongest lines of
           the decay of La-140 were studied. Through their
           intensities were found to be perfectly consistent with
           each other, only the line at 487-KeV was considered for
           the final analysis.

COMMENT    *By authors*.To obtained the maxwellian averged cross
           section, the normalized cross section vs neutron energy
           was folded with a maxwellian distribution. Assuming
           a 10% uncertainty for corresponding correction, one
           obtained 35.7+-0.8 for the maxwellian average at kt=25
           KeV. Starting from this result, the normalized cross
           section can now be used for determining the maxwellian
           averages for the entire range of S-process scenaris,
           covering the temperature range from a few KeV to 100-
           KeV.
ERR-ANALYS In order to calculate the respective uncertainties,
           one would need the error in the differential cross
           section, which is not provide in the evaluation.See
           rel-ref. There any additional errors are omitted except
           for the 25-KeV value and for the value at 30-KeV,
           which is commonly used for comparison of astrophysical
            (N,g) rates. For thr extrapolation from 25 to 30-KeV
           an additional systematic uncertainty of 1.2% was
           considered.
