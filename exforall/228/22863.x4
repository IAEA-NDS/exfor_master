TITLE      Production of neutron-rich nuclei in fission induced
           by neutrons generated by the P+C-13 reaction at
            55-MeV.

HISTORY    (20041129C)
           (20041222U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A 25*25-mm uranium target of 15-mg/cm**2 thickness
           was used.
DETECTOR   (COIN,GELI,SCIN).The gamma-rays were observed with
            a planar Ge and two coaxial Ge-detectors placed at
            about 8-cm from the collection spot. The energy range
            covered was from 15-KeV to 2-MeV and the total peak
            efficiency was 8.E-03 at 13-MeV.
           .In order to suppress the room background, the Ge-
            detectors were operated in coincidence with a 40%
            efficiency thin plastic scintillator triggered by
            beta-particles, built as a cylinder surrounding the
            collection spot.

METHOD     (ASEP)
ADD-RES    (COMP).The results, position of the maximum in the
            (z,a)-plane, width and magnitude, are very comparable
           with those where the neutron are generated by
           bombardment of natural C-12 graphite with 50-MeV
           deuterons.
COMMENT    *By authors*.Depending on the geometry of the
           converter/target assembly the isotopic yields, however,
           are a factor of 2-3 lower due to less efficient
           production of neutrons per primary projectile,
           especially at small forward angles.
           *By authors*.The efficiency of mass separation cannot
           be controlled well enough to make its variation
           negligible with respect to other sources of errors in
           measurements. The procedure adopted to extract isotopic
           cross sections is therefore based on the following two
           steps. First, the mass cross sections are calculated
           for the neutron spectrum experienced by the target.
           This supposes the knowledge of mass cross section curve
           versus neutron energy and of the spectral distribution
           of the neutrons impinging on the fissile target.
           Subsequently, for the certain number of masses selected
           with the mass separated the relative cross section of
           isobars are measured. Absolute value are obtained by
           normalization using the fact that the mass cross
           section is sum of the cross sections of individual
           isobars. This method is possible owing to the fast
           separator time, much shorter than beta-decay lifetimes
           of thedetectable isotopes and the negligible element
           selectivity of the igisil method. The problem of
           measuring relative cross section is thus reduced to
           that of measuring the intensities of the beams of the
           various isobars delivered by separator.
           *By compiler*.En is the average neutron energy.

            density of 736-mg/cm**3 and a length of 50-mm, placed
            inside a cylindrical Al-container of 1-mm thickness.
