FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDUPP)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  A 427 mg/cm2 disk of Li-7 isotopically
                enriched to 99.98%.
            System of three collimators defined a 9cm diameter
            neutron beam at scattering target, neutron yield was
             6.E+5 1/sec over whole beam area.
INC-SPECT   Neutron energy was determined by measuring the energy
            of proton recoil with the help of plastic scintillator
            Low-energy tail of source neutron spectrum
            was suppressed by time-of-flight techniques.
            Charge particles in neutron beam < 1%.
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Scattered neutrons were detected by SCANDAL
                   set-up:
            - proton detection with 35 MeV energy threshold in
              the angular range 10-140 degrees,
            - proton energy measured using 24 CsI(Na) detectors,
           (DRFTC)-proton trajectory was defined by drift chambers
            - energy resolution ~3.7 MeV
            - angular resolution ~1 deg
           (FISCH) Fission chamber as neutron scatterer
           (SCIN) Pulse heights were registered by plastic
            scintillator and CsI detectors.

            fission detector based on thin-film breakdown counters
            Veto detectors to remove scattered charge particles.
METHOD     (EDE)  Particle identification using E-DE technique.

MONIT-REF  (22668002,J.RAHM+,J,PR/C,63,044001,2001)  - Absolute
            cross- sections are obtained by normalization to the
            H(N,P) elastic scattering differential cross-section
            at 96 MeV -second independent normalization of
            angular distributions for Pb-208 and C-12.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Spectra of : 1)elastic scattering from Pb-208
            including background, 2)elastic scattering from C-12
            including background, 3) pure background,
             were analyzed.
             Two methods of normalization were used
             - by np scattering cross section,
             - by SIGtot-SIGreac method.
CORRECTION  Correction for dead time before background
            subtraction.
