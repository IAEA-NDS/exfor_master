TITLE      Thermal neutron cross-sections and resonance integral
           for Dy-164(n,gamma)Dy-165 reaction

INC-SOURCE (AM-BE) The three 592-GBq Am-241-Be.Isotopic neutron
            sources immersed in paraffin moderator shielded
            with lead.

DECAY-DATA (66-DY-165-G,2.334HR,DG,361.68,0.0084,
                                DG,94.7,0.036)
SAMPLE     .The samples used were diluted with analytical grade
           purity and finely grained Al2-O3    powder by 98.8-
            96.6%, because Al-27 isotope has the lower neutron
           absorption cross-section. Each of the samples of Mn-O2
           and Dy2-O3 was mixed independently with a sufficient
           amount of Al(2)O(3) powder.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The irradiation times for the (n,gamma)
           reactions of Mn-55 and Dy-164 were chosen for a period
           of three to six half-lives, yielding enough activity
           to be measured in a gamma-ray counting system.
