FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)) 7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator at IRMM,
                                Geel.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 1-H-3(d,n)2-He-4. Deuterons energy 1,2,3,4 MeV.
            Distance between the sample stack and the center of
            target varied from 3cm for samples of 10mm diameter to
            7cm for samples of 30mm diameter.
            Ti/T target of 2mg/cm**2 thickness on silver backing
            of 0.4mm thickness.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energy from 13.8 to
            20.5 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method in combination with gamma-
           (GSPEC) spectrometry.
            Radioactivity of samples was measured by standard
            gamma-ray spectrometry.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) Standard cross section of
            ENDF/B-VI - for neutron fluence rate determination.
            Used as secondary standards in spectral index method:

           (49-IN-115(N,INL)49-IN-115-M,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Each sample were sandwiched between monitor foils and
           placed at angles between 0 deg and 75 deg relative to
           incident deuteron beam.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial HPGe detector.In addition to standard
           detector efficiency calibration a Monte Carlo
           simulation was performed with MCNP5 code to achieve
           higher geometry flexibility and better accuracy.
           Full-energy peak and total efficiencies for detector
           measuring geometry were calculated by MCNP5 code for
           large Cr,Ni,Cu,Ta samples and for W samples due to
           high gamma-ray attenuation.To increase counting
           statistics, stack of several W samples were irradiated,
           and spread on detector cap to avoid counting loss due
           to gamma-ray absorption.
           Standard point sources were used for :
           -detector efficiency calibration (fitting of experimen.
           values with empirical functions provides accuracy of
           2.5 to 5 % for conventionally used sample geometry),
           -absolute detector
           efficiency measurement by variation of source-to-
           detector positions.
           (LONGC) Long-counter operated in multichannel-scaling
           acquisition mode to record the time profile of neutron
           flux during irradiation.
CORRECTION  Coincidence summing correction in the case of V-48,

            Measured gamma-ray count rates were corrected for:
             gamma-ray abundance,
             gamma-ray self-absorption,
             efficiency of detector,
             irradiation and measurement geometry,
             neutron flux fluctuation during irradiation.
             secondary neutrons.
            Also corrections in data analysis:
            - dead time effects,
            - low energy neutron background,
            - neutron flux and energy distribution inside the
              stack of sample and monitor foils.

SAMPLE      Disc-shaped high-purity natural chromium of 30 mm
            diameter, 5mm thickness. Nominal weight 25500mg.

ANALYSIS    Decay parameters applied in data analysis were taken
            from ENSDF data base.
            Threshold of reactions, which contribute to V-48
            production from Cr-50 are 12.9 MeV for (n,t), 19.3 MeV
            for (n,nd), 21.6 MeV for (n,2np). So, Cr-50(n,x)V-48
            reaction cross-section can be considered as pure (n,t)
            reaction in investigated energy range.

            Zr-89g from Zr-90(n,2n)Zr89 reaction decays by EC to
            Y-89m can not be neglected.Contribution of Zr-89g to
            total 909 keV gamma-activity was estimated to be from
            10 to 15% for about 15 cycles of irradiations and
            spectrum measurements.
