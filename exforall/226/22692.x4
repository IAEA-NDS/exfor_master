           GELINA beam energy is 100 MeV averaged current 60
           60 microAmp. Compressed 1 ns electron bursts repetition
           rate 800 Hz
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-Of-Flight, flight base 58.404 m
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)   Neutron produced by (gamma,n) and (gamma,f)
             reactions induced by electron beam of 100 MeV energy.
             Neutrons were moderated in two 40-mm water slabs

            The weighted average of the three resonances of 131Xe,
            at En=46.0, 75.6 and 114.9 eV respectively were used
            to minimize the effect of multiple scattering
            of neutrons into the sample.
SAMPLE       Natural xenon for the standard placed in a hollow
             sphere 80 mm inner diam., pressure 20 Bar, mass
             43.48 gram
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The uncertainties represent the sum of the
           contributions from:
            * the statistical errors on both the resonance
              parameters and the average cross section
           (ERR-1) 2% relative error due to uncertainties in the
                   normalization,
           (ERR-2,0.,3.) Error in the energy dependence of the
           neutron flux ranging from 0 at 1 keV to 3% at 200 keV
           with logE interpolation,
           (ERR-3) an estimated 10% error on the average capture
            cross section due to uncertainty in the background
            subtraction and
           (ERR-4)Conservative 5% error on the weighting procedure
