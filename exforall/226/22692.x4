ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The uncertainties represent the sum of the
           contributions from:
            * the statistical errors on both the resonance
              parameters and the average cross section
           (ERR-1) 2% relative error due to uncertainties in the
                   normalization,
           (ERR-2,0.,3.) Error in the energy dependence of the
           neutron flux ranging from 0 at 1 keV to 3% at 200 keV
           with logE interpolation,
           (ERR-3) an estimated 10% error on the average capture
            cross section due to uncertainty in the background
            subtraction and
           (ERR-4)Conservative 5% error on the weighting procedure
