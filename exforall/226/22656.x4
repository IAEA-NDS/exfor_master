INC-SOURCE (D-D) 1-H-2(D,N)2-He-3. 9-MeV deuterons incident on a
            deuterium gas target. Primary neutrons with 11.7-MeV
            energy-scale uncertainty is 5 keV.
           (D-T) 1-H-3(D,N)2-He-4. Deuterons Incident on a Metal
            Titanium-Tritide Target (1.923 MG/CM**2 THICK)
            On a Silver Backing (0.5 MM THICK).Primary Neutrons
            13.4 to 20.5 MeV. Energy Scale Uncertainty is 5 KeV.
            Deuteron Energies of 1 - 4 MeV were Used
INC-SPECT  .The Neutron Spectra from Each of the Sources Used
            Were Quasi-Monoenergetic.
SAMPLE     .All the Vanadium Samples were Metallic with Natural
            Isotopic Abundance. Disks of 10- And 13-Mm Diameter
            Thickness 350-450 Micrometer
            Foils of Aluminum, Iron, Nickel, Indium, and Niobium
            With Similar Diameters were Included Along with
            Vanadium in Multi-Layer Packets. Typical Thicknesses
            Of Auxiliary Samples are Less Than 0.1 mm. The Overall
            Thickness of Each Packet was Less Than 2 mm.
            Auxilliary Samples Served As Primary or Secondary
            Standards For Neutron Fluence Determination and For
            The Purpose of Determining Corrections For Low-Energy
            Neutrons Via the Method of Spectral Indexing.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross Sections were Measured Using the Neutron
            Activation Method. Packets Containing the Vanadium
            Samples and Various Additional Monitor Foils were
            Irradiated in Well-Defined Geometries Near the Targets
            Of the Accelerators.

ANALYSIS   .Cross-Section Ratios were Derived from the
            Experimental Data Following Application of Various
            Corrections. Final Cross Sections were Deduced from
            The Cross Section Ratios and the Primary Standard
            Cross Sections. When the Measurements were Made
            Relative to Secondary Standards or to Relative Neutron
            Fluence Monitors, the Data were Normalized to the
            Primary Standard by Specific Ratio Measurements of the
            Secondary Standards to the Primary Standard or by
            Calibration of the Relative Monitors to these
            Standards
CORRECTION . Most of Correction Procedures were Standard.
            The Neutron Scattering Corrections were Derived by
            The Monte-Carlo Method, Computer Code Mcnp.
            Corrections were Largest For the D-T Neutron Source
            Measurements at 4-MeV Deuteron Energy. Orrection was
            11% For 49-In-115(N,INL)49-In-115-M Reaction, 7% For
            28-Ni-58(N,P)27-Co-58 Reaction, and Less Than 2%
            For the Remaining Reactions.
            -The Low-Energy Neutron Corrections were Deduced Using
             A Representation of the Neutron Spectrum, Evaluated
            Cross Sections For the Various Spectral-Index Monitor
            Reactions, and Estimates of the Vanadium Reaction
            Cross-Section Shape. The Neutron Spectrum Determined
            By Time-Of-Flight Measurement was Transformed Into
            A Few Group Representation Which was Then Adjusted by
            An Application of the Generalized Least-Squares
            Method That Employed Measured Reaction Rates For
            Several Monitor Reactions. .

            Following Effects:
                . Gamma-Ray Detection Efficiency.
                . Gamma-Ray Branching Factors.

                . Sample Chemical Composition and Impurities.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) .Total Errors For the Cross Sections were
                   Deduced by Combining Partial Errors from
                   Various Sources in Quadrature. Error Sources
                   Considered were:

COMMENT    .The Listed Cross Section Data Correspond to the
            Production of 21-Sc-47 by Neutron Bombardment of
            Elemental Vanadium. According to the Authors, Below
            15-MeV Neutron Energy the 23-V-50(N,A)21-Sc-47
            Reaction Dominates the Yield of 21-Sc-47. However,
            Above 15-MeV, the 23-V-51(N,N+A)47-Sc-47 is the
            Overwhelming Contributor to 21-Sc-47 Production, in
            Part Because 23-V-51 is the Dominant Isotopic
            Component of Elemental Vanadium.
