INC-SPECT   .Neutron energies in the range 7.2 - 9.2 MeV were
            produced by varying the incident deuteron energy
            between 4.6 and 6.5 MeV

DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,PROPC) For beta-minus counting two stable
            detectors via low-level anti-coincidence counting were
            used - (BERTHOLD LB 2711, MULTI-LOGGER LB 5310)
           (GELI)   For gamma counting
           .For beta counting low-level anticoincidence beta-minus
            counting was used. for this purpose two very stable
            detector systems were used (BERTHOLD, LB 2711 AND
            MULTI-LOGGER LB 5310)
SAMPLE    A.High purity copper 99.9999%, 1.8 cm diameter, 2.8 cm
            height, weight between 64 and 74 gram. two aluminium
            foils attached in front and at the back of the copper
            block
          B.Eight copper foils each 2 cm diameter, 0.2 cm thick
            together with the few aluminium and niobium foils
            placed in front, in between and at the back of the
            sample stack
