FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  High Flux Reactor at the ILL, Grenoble,
                           France
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)  Curved neutron guide H22D of the high-flux
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux is 3.5E+8 n/cm2/sec. Energy
            distribution is near Maxwellian with the maximum at
            39 meV
ANALYSIS   Westcot factors used in analysis.
METHOD     (ASSOP,EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)  Silicon surface barrier detector
              calibrated by 6Li(n,alpha)3H, 10B(n,alpha)7Li,
              143Nd(n,alpha)140Ce reactions

SAMPLE      Sample was produced at the Los Alamos Laboratory by
            spallation of potassium-clorine target with a proton
            beam and extracted by ion exchange. The final result
            of the sample mass calibration gives (2.58+-0.12)E+17
            Uranium sample contains (4.43+-0.03)E+16 atoms
