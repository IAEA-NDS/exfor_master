FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  High Flux Reactor at the ILL, Grenoble,
                           France
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)  Curved neutron guide H22D of the high-flux
INC-SPECT  .Thermal neutron flux is 3.5E+8 n/cm2/sec. Energy
            distribution is near Maxwellian with the maximum at
            39 milli-eV
METHOD     (ASSOP)   Associated particle method
           (EDE)    (E-DELTA E) Method
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR))  Silicon surface barrier detector
              calibrated by 6Li(n,alpha)3H, 10B(n,alpha)7Li,
              143Nd(n,alpha)140Ce reactions

SAMPLE     .Sample was produced at the Los Alamos Laboratory by
            spallation of potassium-clorine target with a proton
            beam and extracted by ion exchange. The final result
            of the sample mass calibration gives (2.58+-0.12)E+17
           .Uranium sample contains (4.43+-0.03)E+16 atoms
