ADD-RES    (DECAY)   Half-life 0F Ho-167 was measured
INC-SPECT  .Samples were irradiated with and without cadmium
            shield. Because 59Co and 197Al have different sensi-
            tivities to thermal and epithermal neutrons, monitor
            wires allow to determine the thermal and epithermal
            fractions of neutron flux
SAMPLE     .Monitor samples are cobalt/aluminium and gold/
            aluminium wires which were used to monitor neutron
            flux at the target positions
           -Co/Al alloy(Co 0.46wt%, 0,381 mm in diameter),
            Au/Al alloy (Au-0.112wt%,0,510 mm diam)
           .Ho-166-m is generated from the stable monoisotope
            Ho-165 by irradiation in reactor. Four samples were
            prepared. Thickness of each is 0.0125 mm, purity
            is 99.9%, weighs 0.0944, 0.1203, 0.1165, 0.1030 mg.
            1st irradiation of the foils was performed at the long
            irradiation plug of (kurri) for 2 and 3 weeks.
            The second irradiation irradiation of the target was
            performed in a hydraulic transfer tube of kyoto
            university reactor for 10 hours with and without
            cadmium capsule
