FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)  GELINA - 2ZZZGEL Linear Accelerator
            .For 3-600 eV neutron energy range Linac provides
             100 MeV electron bursts 15 nsec width at repetition
             frequency 200 Hz and average beam current 20 Micro-A.
            .For 20 eV - 150 keV neutron energies Linac operates
             at frequency 800 Hz with average beam current
             60 micro-A and pulse width 2 nsec

            details concerning GELINA Facility
METHOD     (TOF,TRN) Time-of-flight, flight bases are 50, 30 and
                 26.5 M, the latter for temperature dependence
                 measurements
DETECTOR   (GLASD)   NE912 Lithium glass detector of 0.25 inch
             thickness and diameter 6 inches
           (SCIN)    Two NE230 total energy detectors placed at
                     90 degree on both sides of samples
ANALYSIS   (RFN)     R-Matrix neutron resonance shape analysis
                     using fitting program 'REFIT'
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)        Neutrons were produced by (gamma,n) and
             (gamma,fission) reactions induced via bremsstrahlung
                from the electron beam hitting a rotating uranium
                target
           (THCOL)    Fast neutron from the target were moderated
              to a white spectrum by water contained in berillium
              canning of 4 cm thick walls situated beneath and
              above the target
SAMPLE     .Five Samples of oxide and water solutions, enrichment
            in Np-237 100%, thickness from 0.022 to 1.0 gram/cm2
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)  Systematic Error Comprising Uncertainty of
             flight Path, variation of the background, error of
             radiation width (7%)
STATUS     (COREL,22486005) Data for Tc (D0,S0,S1 in region
