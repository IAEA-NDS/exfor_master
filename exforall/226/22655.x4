            range 0.5 to 6 MeV. Energy scale uncertainty is 5 keV.

            deuterium gas target. Neutrons in energies range

           (D-T) H-3(D,N)He-4. Deuterons incident on a metal
            titanium-tritium target (1.923 mg/cm**2 thick)
            on a silver backing (0.5 mm thick). Neutrons with
            energies in the range 13.4 to 20.6 MeV.
            Energy scale uncertainty is 5 keV.
INC-SPECT  -The primary neutron spectra from each of the sources
            used were quasi-monoenergetic. A continuum spectrum
            of low-energy neutrons was present for each source
            reaction.
           -Secondary neutron spectra were derived from comparison
            of secondary monitor foil activity with known
            excitation function .
SAMPLE     -All the sample materials were metallic. These were
            then sealed in aluminum containers with a wall
            thickness of 0.2 mm in order to guarantee mechanical
            stability of the samples and prevent contamination
            of the environment with radioactive material. The
            aluminum capsules were further sealed in polyethylene
            bags (0.2 mm thick). Foils of indium, nickel,
            aluminum, iron, cobalt, and niobium with thicknesses
            in the range 50 to 250 micro-meters and 13-mm diameter
            were used along with the technetium sample capsules
            to form sample packets.
            -Some of these foils served as primary or secondary
            standards for neutron fluence determination.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured using the neutron
            activation method.
            The reaction products are relatively short-lived.
            In the case of the D-D measurements using a deuterium
            gas target, irradiations were also carried out using
            an empty cell before and after each main irradiation
            so that corrections for background neutrons from the
            target could be determined.
             These intrinsically radioactive samples. This
            background was reduced to manageable levels by
            either counting at a distance and/or inserting lead
            sheet (1 or 2 mm thick) between sample and detector.

ANALYSIS   -The neutron scattering corrections were derived by
            the Monte-Carlo method using the computer code MCNP.
            The low-energy neutron corrections were deduced
            using a representation of the neutron spectrum,
            evaluated cross sections for the monitor reactions,
            and estimates of the unknown technetium cross section
            shape. The neutron spectrum determined by time-of-
            flight measurement was transformed into a few group
            representation which was then adjusted by an
            application of the generalized least-squares method
            that employed measured reaction rates for several
            monitor reactions. Final cross sections were deduced
            from the cross ratios and values for the primary
            standards. In those cases where measurements were
            made relative to secondary standards or to relative
            neutron fluence monitors, the data were normalized to
            the primary standards by specific ratio measurements
            of the secondary standards to the primary standards
            or by calibration of the relative monitors to these
            standards.
ADD-RES    (THEO)  For all measurements nuclear model calculations
                   were produced using models of the Hauser-
                   Feshbach type (HELGA, GNASH, EMPIRE, STAPRE,
                   STAPRE-H)

             following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.

                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Sample chemical composition and impurities.

                   deduced by combining partial errors from
                   various sources in quadrature. Error sources
