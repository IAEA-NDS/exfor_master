FACILITY   (VDG,2TUKCNA) 'SAMES T-400' Neutron generator,
           average deutron beam current 500 microAmp,
           accelerating voltage 300 KV. SAMES T-400 used in
           combination with the fast sample transfer system (FSTS)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) For short-lived isotopes FSTS was used with
           cyclic activation which delivers sample from
           irradiation to counting position within 0.5 sec
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial, 83 cm3 volume, within 10 cm-thick
           lead shield, 1.79 keV full width at half-maximum at
           1333 keV gamma energy
           (SCIN) NE102A used for neutron flux monitoring
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation
           (TOF)    Time-Of-Flight supplied as 'Input Spectrum'
INC-SPECT  .Irradiation positions are 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 130
            degrees relative to deutron beam which correspond
            to neutron energies 14.9, 14.7, 14.5, 14.1, 13.7,
            13.6 MeV
           .Mean effective neutron energy at the sample position
            has been determined by the ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr
            and 93Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb reactions cross sections
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,P)12-MG-27,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (12-MG-27,9.42MIN,DG,844.)
SAMPLE     .No Information
           .Aluminium oxide Al2-O3 pellets of the same size were
            used as standard cross section sample
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for the effect of gamma ray
            attenuation, coincidence summing, pulse pile-up,
            dead time of the detector, neutron flux fluctuation
            and scattered neutrons
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total Errors include:
           (ERR-1)  Error due to the sample weight
           (ERR-2)  Error due to the concentration of the element
           (ERR-3)  Error due to the counting solid angle and
                 intrinsic efficiency of the gamma detector
           (ERR-5)  Error due to the self-absorption of gammas
           (ERR-6,,4.)  Max Error due to the gamma-gamma
                 coincidence summing
           (ERR-7)  Error of the effective neutron flux
           (ERR-8)  Error due to the neutron flux fluctuations
