SAMPLE      90Sr-Cl2 standardized solution, equivalent to
            3.7 x 10**2 kBq was pipetted into the bottom of high-
            purity quartz tube 8 mm inner diam, 100 mm length. A
            40 kBq 85Sr-Cl2 standardized solution was added in the
            same manner. After drying of the solution, the quartz
            tube was welded under evacuation. The welded tube was
            circa 20 mm in length. This tube was put into alumin.
            capsule and then housed in the irradiation capsule.
            The loss of 85Sr was checked by the radioactivity of
            514-keV gamma line emitted from 85Sr
            Monitor samples were Co/Al alloy wire 0.381 mm diam,
