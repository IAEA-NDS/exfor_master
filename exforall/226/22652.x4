            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Lithium target bombarded by 1.5 ns bunched
            proton beam. For neutron energies 10-90 keV proton
            energy is 1.903 MeV (22 keV above threshold energy of
            P-Li7 reaction), pulse repetition rate 4 MHz, beam
            current near 9 micro-A.
INC-SPECT  .Broad neutron spectrum measured by TOF Method
PART-DET   (G,N)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  Anti-Compton Na-I(Tl) spectrometer. Main
            detector 15.2 cm diameter by 20.3 cm long was centered
            in a 33.0 cm outer diameter by 35.6 cm NaI(Tl) hollow
            Compton-suppression detector - for gamma detection.
            Energy resolution of the main detector is 7% at 0.662
            MeV and time resolution is 4.0 ns for 0.511 MeV gamma.
           (GLASD)  Li-6 glass scintillation detector for neutron
              energy and flux monitoring. 5 mm diameter * 5 mm
              thick Li-6 detector located 30cm from neutron source
              at 2.4 degree angle with respect to proton beam
              direction was used for 10-90 keV region .
METHOD     (TOF)   Time-of-flight.
            TOF spectra were observed for Dy, Au and blank by
            gamma-ray spectrometer.
           (PHD)   Pulse-height discrimination

CORRECTION .Corrections were made for neutron self-shielding and
            multiple scattering in the sample, for gamma-ray
            absorption and scattering in sample,for neutron cross-
            sections employed in calculations.,
            for dependence of gamma-ray detection efficiency on
            gamma-ray source position, for impurities in sample,
            for dead time.
            Overall correction factors for Dy <1.02, for Au <1.12.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total Error (about 10 %) composed of partial
                    ones given below :

                        gamma-rays below discrimination level,
