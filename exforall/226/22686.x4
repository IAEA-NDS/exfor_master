SAMPLE     .Pb-I2 Obtained by Extraction of Iodine from the Waste
            Solution of the Fuel Processing Facility, Mass Frac-
            Tion of 129I is (20.4+-1.0)%. Five Samples of Pb-I2
            Have Been Prepared with Diam 5.5Cm Sealed Within Alu-
            Minium Containers (TWO CONTAINING THE IODINE PRECI-
            PITATE, 0.18 AND 1.8 GRAM/CM2THICK, ABUNDANCE OF 127I
            IS 3.6+-0.2%), and Three Enriched to 99.9% in 127I
            (O.16, 1.9 AND 5.1 GRAM/CM2 THICK). To Investigate
            The Low Energy Resonances of 127I a Water Solution of
            High-Purity Li-I (7.92E-4 ATOMS/BARN THICK) Canned in
            Aluminium Container was Used. Totalmass Fraction of
            Pb-I2 in the Sample is Estimated to be 43/2%, Remai-
            Ning 56.8% Being Lead Oxide.
CORRECTION .Corrections For Background are 2.4% and 3.5% at 100 Hz
            And 800 Hz.
