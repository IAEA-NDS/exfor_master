INC-SOURCE (D-T) (1-H-3(d,N)2-He-4). Deuterons incident on a
            solid titanium-tritium target (approximately 2 mg/cm2
            thick) on a silver backing (0.5 mm thick), Q-value =
            17.59 MeV. This reaction generated the primary
            neutrons with energies in the range 14 to 20.5 MeV.
            Samples were placed at angles from 0 to 75 degrees.
            The energy scale uncertainty is 5 keV. Deuteron
            energies of 1, 2, 3, and 4 MeV were used.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectra from this source reaction were
            quasimonoenergetic. The effective spread in the
            neutron energy of the primary group was deduced from
            the target thickness, kinematics, and sample geometry.
            The quoted neutron energy resolution is the root-mean-
            square (EN-RSL) of the distribution of primary
            neutrons.
SAMPLE     .Both isotopically enriched and natural abundance
            materials were employed in the present measurements.
            Aluminum metal samples with diameter equal to the
            various lead samples and thickness of 50 - 300 micro-
            meters were used for fluence monitoring purposes.
             The lead samples were sandwiched in layers between
            aluminum monitor foils for the cross section determi-
            nations. Also, auxiliary aluminum, iron, nickel,
            indium, and niobium samples were used at various times
            during these experiments, either to serve as secondary
            standards for neutron fluence determination or for
            the purpose of establishing corrections for low-energy
            neutrons via the method of spectral indexing.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured using the neutron
            activation method. Packets containing various lead
            samples and monitor foils were irradiated in well-
            defined geometries near the target of the accelerator.
           (GSPEC)   All sample activities were measured by obser-
            ving radioactive decay gamma rays from each of the
            irradiated samples. They were measured using shielded,
            high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors and gamma-ray
            spectroscopy techniques.
           (STTA)   Stack target irradiation. Stacks from two to
             twelve intermittent lead-main and secondary monitor
             samples were employed
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detectors were used.
            The photon detectors were calibrated using standard
            gamma-ray calibration sources acquired from radiation
            metrology laboratories at PTB (Braunschweig, Germany)
            and Damri (Gif-sur-Yvette, France).
           (LONGC,BF3) Boron trifluoride detector in a long-
            counter configuration. Long counter for relative
            measurements. Current integrator for relative
            measurements.
ANALYSIS   .The various lead reaction cross sections were usually
            determined from measured cross-section ratios relative
            to the Al-27(N,a)Na-24 standard. Cross-section ratios
            were derived in each case from the experimental data
            following the application of various corrections.
MONITOR      All measurements involving secondary standards were
            ultimately referenced to the primary standard.
             All relative measurements were ultimately normalized
            to the primary standard.
             Monitor cross-section values at arbitrary neutron
            energies were derived from tabulated values by means
            of linear interpolation.

ADD-RES    (THEO)  TALYS, TALYS-mu and STAPRE codes were used
                   for auxiliary cross section calculations
CORRECTION .Most of these correction procedures were standard.
            The neutron scattering corrections were derived by
            the Monte-Carlo method using the computer code
            MCNP4C. These corrections were largest for the D-T
            neutron source measurements at 4-MeV deuteron energy.
            There, the correction was
             11% for the In-115(N,INL)In-115-M reaction,
              7% for the Ni-58(N,P)Co-58 reaction, and
            less than 2% for all the remaining monitor reactions.
            The raw experimental data were corrected for the
             following effects:
                . Gamma-ray detection efficiency.
                . Gamma-ray branching factors.
                . Gamma-ray coincidence summing effects.
                . Geometric effects.
                . Gamma-ray absorption.
                . Absorption and scattering of neutrons.
                . Low-energy neutrons from the target.
                . Decay of product nuclei.
                . Radioactivity build-up (for cyclic activation)
                . Fluctuations in neutron flux during the
                  irradiation period.
                . Isotopic abundances.
                . Sample chemical composition and impurities.
           *The low-energy neutron corrections were deduced using
            a representation of the neutron spectrum, evaluated
            cross sections for the various spectral-index monitor
            reactions, estimates of the various lead reaction
            cross-section shapes.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard errors for the cross sections were
             deduced by combining partial errors from various
             sources in quadrature. Error sources considered were:
                . Statistical counting errors.
                . Uncertainty in detector efficiencies.
                . Uncertainty in decay branching factors.
                . Uncertainty in coincidence summing corrections.
                . Geometric uncertainty.
                . Uncertainty in the absorption of gamma rays.
                . Uncertainty in the absorption and scattering
                  of neutrons.
                . Uncertainty in low-energy neutron corrections.
                . Uncertainty in primary and secondary neutron
                  fluence standards.
                . Uncertainty in decay half lives.

SAMPLE     .For the Pb-204(n,inl)Pb-204m cross-section measurement
            a 0.2193 g sample of metallic lead enriched to 48.9%
            in Pb-204 was used. The sample was pressed into a
            pellet 6 mm in dia. By 0.8 mm thick.

COMMENT    .These cross sections were measured using both natural
           lead samples and samples enriched in Pb-204 and Pb-206,
           respectively. Use of these isotopically enriched
           samples enabled contributions from the reactions
           Pb-204(n,inl) and Pb-206(n,3n) to be distinguished
           in the experiment.

COMMENT    .These cross sections were measured using the cyclic
            activation method and a fast rabbit sample transport
            system. Elemental lead samples were used. This isomer
            decays entirely by an isomeric transition to the
            ground state of Pb-203. The corresponding emitted
            gamma ray was observed. The activity was observed
            after the decay of the second isomer with half life
            of 0.48 s.

COMMENT    .These cross sections were obtained by first allowing
            for all nuclei residing in the 6.3-sec isomeric state
            at 825.20-keV excitation in Pb-203 to decay to the
            ground state. The cross section values refer to the
            total (N,2N) cross section for formation of the
            isomer plus the ground state of Pb-203.

ANALYSIS   .This reaction cross section was determined by
            measuring gamma rays associated with the decay of the
            isomeric level at 2169.84 keV by isomeric transitions
            to the ground state. Some of the decays of this state
            occurred by electron capture but the gamma rays
            associated with this process were not measured.
