INC-SOURCE (D-T) (1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4). Deuterons Incident on a
            Solid Titanium-Tritide Target (APPROXIMATELY 2 MG/
            CM**2 THICK) On a Silver Backing (0.5 MM THICK). This
            Reaction Generated the Primary Neutrons with Energies
            In the Range 14 to 20.5 MeV. Samples were Placed at
            Angles from 0 to 75 Degrees. The Energy Scale Uncer-
            Tainty is 5 KeV. Deuteron Energies of 1, 2, 3, and 4
            MeV were Used.
INC-SPECT  .The Neutron Spectra from this Source Reaction were
            Quasimonoenergetic. The Effective Spread in the
            Neutron Energy of the Primary Group was Deduced from
            The Target Thickness, Kinematics, and Sample Geometry.
SAMPLE     .Both Isotopically Enriched and Natural Abundance
            Materials were Employed in the Present Measurements.
                Aluminum Metal Samples with Dia. Equal to the
            Various Lead Samples and Thickness of 50 - 300 Micro-
            Meters were Used For Fluence Monitoring Purposes.
            The Various Lead Reaction Cross Sections were Usually
            Determined from Measured Cross-Section Ratios Relative
            To the Al-27(N,A)Na-24 Standard. The Lead Samples
            Were Sandwiched in Layers Between Aluminum Monitor
            Foils For the Cross Section Determinations. Also,
            Auxiliary Aluminum, Iron, Nickel, Indium, and Niobium
            Samples were Used at Various Times During these Expe-
            Riments, Either to Serve As Secondary Standards For
            Neutron Fluence Determination or For the Purpose of
            Establishing Corrections For Low-Energy Neutrons Via
            The Method of Spectral Indexing.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross Sections were Measured Using the Neutron
            Activation Method. Packets Containing Various Lead
            Samples and Monitor Foils were Irradiated in Well-
            Defined Geometries Near the Target of the Accelerator.
           (GSPEC)   All Sample Activities were Measured by Obser-
            Ving Radioactive Decay Gamma Rays from Each of the
            Irradiated Samples. They were Measured Using Shielded,
            High-Purity Germanium (HPGE) Detectors and Gamma-Ray
            Spectroscopy Techniques.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-Purity Germanium Detectors were Used.
            The Photon Detectors were Calibrated Using Standard
            Gamma-Ray Calibration Sources Acquired from Radiation
            Metrology Laboratories at PTB (BRAUNSCHWEIG, GERMANY)
            And Damri (GIF-SUR-YVETTE, FRANCE).

ANALYSIS   .Cross-Section Ratios were Derived in Each Case from
            The Experimental Data Following the Application of
            Various Corrections.  The Low-Energy
            Neutron Corrections were Deduced Using a Representa-
            Tion of the Neutron Spectrum, Evaluated Cross Sections
            For the Various Spectral-Index Monitor Reactions, and
            Estimates of the Various Lead Reaction Cross-Section
            Shapes.
CORRECTION .Most of these Correction Procedures were Standard.
            The Neutron Scattering Corrections were Derived by
            the Monte-Carlo Method Using    The Computer Code
            MCNP4C. These Corrections were Largest For the D-T
            Neutron Source Measurements at 4-MeV Deuteron Energy.
            There, the Correction was
             11% For the In-115(N,INL)In-115M Reaction,
              7% For the Ni-58(N,P)Co-58 Reaction, and
            Less Than 2% For All The Remaining Monitor Reactions.
            The Raw Experimental Data were Corrected For the
             Following Effects:
                . Gamma-Ray Detection Efficiency.
                . Gamma-Ray Branching Factors.
                . Gamma-Ray Coincidence Summing Effects.
                . Geometric Effects.
                . Gamma-Ray Absorption.
                . Absorption and Scattering of Neutrons.
                . Low-Energy Neutrons from the Target.
                . Decay of Product Nuclei.
                . Radioactivity Build-Up (FOR CYCLIC ACTIVATION)
                . Fluctuations in Neutron Flux During the
                  Irradiation Period.
                . Isotopic Abundances.
                . Sample Chemical Composition and Impurities.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total Errors For the Cross Sections were Deduce
            Bycombining Partial Errors from Various Sources in
            Quadrature. Error Sources Considered were:
                . Statistical Counting Errors.
                . Uncertainty in Detector Efficiencies.
                . Uncertainty in Decay Branching Factors.
                . Uncertainty in Coincidence Summing Corrections.
                . Geometric Uncertainty.
                . Uncertainty in the Absorption of Gamma Rays.
                . Uncertainty in the Absorption and Scattering
                  Of Neutrons.
                . Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutron Corrections.
                . Uncertainty in Primary and Secondary Neutron
                  Fluence Standards.
                . Uncertainty in Decay Half Lives.
COMMENT    .Monitor Cross-Section Values at Arbitrary Neutron
            Energies were Derived from Tabulated Values by Means
            Of Linear Interpolation. The Quoted Neutron Energy
            Resolution is the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Of the
            Distribution of Primary Neutrons.

            Taken to Correct the Measured Activity For Contribu-
            Tions from Preceding Cycles Since Both the Irradiation
            And Cooling Times For Each Cycle were Significantly
            Smaller Than the Half-Life For the Tl-208 Activity.

COMMENT    .This Reaction Cross Section was Determined by
            Measuring Gamma Rays Associated with the Decay of the
            Isomeric Level at 2169.84 KeV by Isomeric Transitions
            To the Ground State. Some of the Decays of this State
            Occur by Electron Capture But the Gamma Rays Associa-
            Ted with this Process were not Measured.

COMMENT    .This Reaction Cross Section was Determined by Measu-
            Ring Beta Minus Decay with Low Level Liquid Scintil-
            Lation Counting Following Radiochemical Separation of
            Thallium from Lead Matrix. The Separation of the Tl
            Activity was done at Inc, Fz Juelich. Liquid Scintil-
            Lation was Performed at the IRMM Radionuclide Group
            Using a Wallac Quantulus 1220 Ultra Low Level Liquid
            Scintillation Counter Operated at 12-13 Degree
            Centigrade. Detector Calibration is Relative to a
            204Tl Standard Solution
