INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuterons Incident on Metal Titanium-Tritide
            Target (APPROX. 2 MG/CM**2 THICK) On Silver Backing
            (0.5 MM THICK).
            Deuteron Energies of 1, 2, 3, and 4 MeV were Used.
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-Monoenergetic Neutron Spectra with Primary
            Energies in the Range 14 to 20.5 MeV.
           .Effective Neutron Energy Spread of the Primary Group
            Deduced from Target Thickness, Kinematics, and Sample
            Geometry.
           .A Low-Energy Neutron Continuum Spectrum was Present
            Above an Effective Threshold Deuteron Energy (NOT
            SPECIFIED) Due to Neutrons Produced by Deuteron
            Reactions with Target Backing or Beam-Stop Materials
            Other Than Tritium, As Well As from T(D,N+P)T
            Deuteron-Breakup Process.
           .Quoted Neutron Energy Resolution is the Root-Mean-
            Square (RMS) Of the Distribution of Primary Neutrons.
SAMPLE     .Samples were Placed at Angles from 0 to 75 Degrees.
METHOD     (STTA) Samples Sandwiched Between Aluminum Monitor
            Foils.
           (ACTIV) Neutron Activation Method. Packets Containing
            Samples and Monitor Foils were Irradiated in Well-
            Defined Geometries Near the Target of the Accelerator.
           To Obtain the Maximum Counting Statistics, the Foils
            Were Generally Placed Directly on the Detector Cap,
            However, Some Gamma-Ray Measurements were Performed
            At Distant As Well As Close Positions in Order to
            Enable Coincidence-Summing Effects to be Determined.
           (BCINT) Beam Current Recorded During Each Irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-Purity Germanium Detectors Used, Including
            One Planar Detector with a Carbon Fiber Window to
            Enable Photons with Energies Below 100 KeV to be
            Measured. Gamma-Ray Spectra were Recorded with Three
            Separate Pc Data Acquisition Systems.
           (BF3,LONGC) Boron-Trifluoride Detector in Long-Counter
            Configuration Used to Measure Neutron Flux Time
            Profile. Long-Counter Counts were Recorded in Multi-
            Channel Scaling Mode to Determine Time-Dependent Flux
            Corrections, Significant When Reaction Products are
            Relatively Short Lived.
