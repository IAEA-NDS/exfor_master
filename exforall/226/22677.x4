SAMPLE     .A minute amount of 147Pm was added to enriched to
            98.27% samarium-147 isotope serving as carrier. This
            mixture was then oxidized, mixed with 10 milligram of
            fine graphite powder and pressed into a pellet 6 mm
            diameter, 0.4 mm thickness. Sample mass is 28.7+-1.2
            nanogram, or (1.17+-0.05) x 10**14 atoms
