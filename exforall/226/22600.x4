            The ISOLDE isotope separator facility, attached
           on-line with the reconstructed CERN synchro-cyclotron
            was used in target preparation (see SAMPLE).
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum. Thermal
           neutron flux of 10**9 n/cm2/s
SAMPLE     During a 20 hr run of the ISOLDE facility (see REL-REF)
           by (700nA proton current on target of molten Y-La
           alloy, 63 gr Y/cm2), nearly 10**14 atoms of 84Rb were
           deposited within an area of 0.5 cm2 in a 10 mu-m foil
           of ultra-pure Al.
