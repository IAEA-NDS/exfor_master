FACILITY   (VDG,VDGT) The 2.0 MeV Van de Graaff injector and
           12 MeV Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator facilities
           were used.
INC-SOURCE The maximum available intensity was 0.5 mu-A. The
           target was bombarded with 0.1 mu-A to 0.5 mu-A beams of
           alpha particles over the energy range 6.9 MeV to 8.2
           MeV.

COMMENT    Data are given in a form of relative counting rate.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7.6 cm * 7.6 cm sodium iodide detector,
           housed in a steel block, was mounted upon a rotating
           table enabling gamma ray detection over the angular
           range 0 to 135 degr. An unshielded 12.7 cm * 10.2 cm
           detector was located at 90 degr. (opposite the smaller
           spectrometer) and was supported independently of the
           table to serve as a monitor for angular distribution
           measurements and to provide independent excitation
           functions.
SAMPLE     Separated 12C targets of a nominal 144 mu-g/cm2
           thickness, deposited onto 0.12 mm gold backing, were
           used (evidence for residual 13C contamination was
           observed by means of the 13C(a,n'g) reaction).
           Background contributions from beam tracking slits,
           approximately 4 cm from the target, were negligible but
           gamma ray production was observed from the 3.2 mm
           diameter beam apertures in two coaxial tantalum
           collimators located approximately 46 cm and 51 cm from
           the target.

COMMENT    No explanation of relative units is given.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7.6 cm * 7.6 cm sodium iodide detector,
           housed in a steel block, was mounted upon a rotating
           table enabling gamma ray detection over the angular
           range 0 to 135 degr. An unshielded 12.7 cm * 10.2 cm
           detector was located at 90 degr. (opposite the smaller
           spectrometer) and was supported independently of the
           table to serve as a monitor for angular distribution
           measurements and to provide independent excitation
           functions.
SAMPLE     Separated 12C targets of a nominal 144 mu-g/cm2
           thickness, deposited onto 0.12 mm gold backing, were
           used (evidence for residual 13C contamination was
           observed by means of the 13C(a,n'g) reaction).
           Background contributions from beam tracking slits,
           approximately 4 cm from the target, were negligible but
           gamma ray production was observed from the 3.2 mm
           diameter beam apertures in two coaxial tantalum
           collimators located approximately 46 cm and 51 cm from
           the target.
