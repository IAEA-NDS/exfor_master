DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma-radiation from the target was detected at
           90 degr. to the proton beam in a sodium iodide crystal,
           15cm long and 12.5 cm diameter, viewed initially by an
           EMI photomultiplier type 6099 and later by an RCA
           photomultiplier type 7046 with a faster rise-time, the
           front face of the crystal being 15 cm from the target
           centre. The counter was housed in a lead cylinder of
           wall thickness 10 cm. As the beam in the experimental
           area was contained inside the vacuum pipe by quadrupole
           magnets, the Faraday cup and the carbon collimator were
           the only important sources of background. Further lead
           shielding was therefore placed between the counter and
           these two sources. With these shielding arrangements
           the target-out background was less than 10% of the
           target-in counting rate.
SAMPLE     The target was of polythene 5 cm2 mounted on a brass
           frame which could be retracted from the beam without
           breaking the vacuum. Targets of two different
           thicknesses were used. Target A was used at proton
           energies below 30 MeV and target B above that energy.
