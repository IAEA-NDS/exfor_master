SAMPLE     Most of the experiments were carried out with thick
           PbF2 targets evaporated on 0.5 mm thick copper
           backings. With beam currents of 3 mu-A over an area of
           0.1 cm2 the PbF2 showed slight losses in yield over
           periods of about 1 h. Each target backing could be
           moved so as to expose four fresh target areas to the
           beam without breaking vacuum, so that uninterrupted
           runs of several hours were possible.

DETECTOR   (SIBAR) An Ortec surface barrier detector 300 mm2 in
           area was used as the proton detector; this was covered
           with a nickel foil 3 mg/cm2 thick which completely
           absorbed the scattered deuterons while permitting the
           observation of proton peaks as low as 1 MeV in energy.
