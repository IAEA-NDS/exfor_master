TITLE       The ratio of thermal neutron capture to fission for
            U-233
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) PLUTO reactor.
DETECTOR    Mass spectrometer.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiation in the flux scanning tube of the
            B2 fuel element of the PLUTO reactor for 47 days.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum in PLUTO has a temperature of
            106 degrees and a large epithermal component ranging
            from 0.046 to 0.066 for the epithermal index.
SAMPLE     .Sample were prepared by mixing highly enriched
            U-233 with 99.995% enriched U-238. Aliquots
            of approx 100 micro-gr U-233 were dispersed in about
            10 mg magnesium oxide for irradiation.
METHOD     (ASEP) Isotopic mass separation using an A.E.I.
            Type M.S.5 mass spectrometer. 10 Micro-g uranium
            on tungsten filament surface ionization source.
ANALYSIS   .Alpha derived from changes in isotopic composition
            of uranium mixtures from neutron capture
            and fission.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60-G+M,,SIG)
            2200 m/sec value.
            Separate Co-59, Sm-149 and U-238 sample
            monitors were used to determine neutron flux, the
            spectrum temperature and the epithermal component.
STATUS      Final data from page 12, 66PARIS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty in the derived 2200 m/sec value are
            from:
           (ERR-1) mass spectrometer statistical errors (0.1%),
           (ERR-2) determination of spectrum average alpha (1.0%),
            this is then combined with uncertainties in Westcotts
            G and S factors to give a total absolute uncertainty
