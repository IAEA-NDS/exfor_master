TITLE      -THE RADIATIVE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF TH-232 FOR
            NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 300 TO 1200 KEV.-
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK ALD) 6 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) TRITIUM GAS, PRESSURE ABOUT 1 ATM., 1 IN. LONG
            CELL.
SAMPLE     .TH-O(2) MADE OF TH, SEPARATED CHEMICALLY FROM ITS
            DAUGHTER PRODUCTS. THIS OXYDE WAS PACKED INTO A
            POLYSTYRENE CONTAINER, INNER DIAM. 2 CM, DEPTH 0.075
            CM.
           .U(3)-O(8) FOR THE MEASUREMENTS OF THE MONITOR. MADE
            STARTING FROM METAL DEPLETED IN U-235, VIZ.
            CONTAINING 0.02 WEIGHT PERC U-235, AND PURIFIED TO
            99.9 PERC FROM ITS DAUGTHERS BY CHEMICAL SEPARATION.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION ANALYSIS.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) END WINDOW GEIGER-MUELLER COUNTER, AND
           (LONGC) LONGCOUNTER FOR N FLUX MONITORING.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,G)92-U-239,,SIG) NO MONITOR VALUES GIVEN.
STATUS     (NDD  ) DATA TAKEN FROM NEUDADA.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND DUE TO GROW-IN OF NATURAL DAUGHTERS IS
            CORRECTED FOR, CORRECTION FOR N-FLUX VARIATION,
            VARIATION OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LONGCOUNTER WITH
            NEUTRON ENERGY, ANISOTROPIC OUTPUT OF THE TARGET,
            OCCURENCE OF LOW ENERGY INCOMING NEUTRONS, AND PROTON
            ENERGY LOSSES AT LOW ENERGIES.
