TITLE      -MASS SPECTROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF THE RATIO OF
            THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE TO FISSION FOR PU-241 -.
FACILITY   (SPECM) MASS SPECTROMETER.
           (REAC ) PLUTO REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATIONS WERE IN THE FLUX SCANNING TUBE
            OF THE B2 FUEL ELEMENT FOR 48.35 DAYS.
INC-SPECT  .THE PLUTO SPECTRUM IS MAXWELLIAN WITH A TEMPERATURE
            OF 106 DEGREES AND WITH A HIGH EPI-THERMAL INDEX,
            RANGING FROM 0.041 TO 0.087
SAMPLE     .NITRIC ACID SOLUTIONS OF MIXTURES OF FOUR HIGHLY
            ENRICHED ISOTOPES OF PLUTONIUM, PRECIPITATED ONTO
            SILICA AND SEALED IN SILICA PHIALS UNDER PRESSURE.
            AFTER IRRADIATION SAMPLES WERE ALLOWED TO COOL FOR
            SIX MONTHS, THEN PLUTONIUM WAS CHEMICALLY SEPERATED
            AND USED FOR THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION CHANGES.
METHOD     (ASEP ) MASS SPECTROSCOPY USING AN A.E.I. TYPE M.S.5
            SPECTROMETER, WITH ABOUT 0.1 MICRO-G PLUTONIUM ON
            A TUNGSTEN FILAMENT SURFACE IONISATION SOURCE.
ANALYSIS   .VALUE DERIVED FROM CHANGES IN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION
            ARISING FROM NEUTRON CAPTURE AND FISSION.
            ALL MEASURED RATIOS INVOLVING PU-241 WERE CORRECTED
            FOR RADIO-ACTIVE DECAY USING A HALF LIFE
            OF 13.29 +- 0.06 YEARS.
                 - NOTE THAT THIS DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY FROM
            LATER ACCEPED VALUES BUT WAS NOT CONSIDERED IN THE
            RE-ANALYSIS OF 66 PARIS. -
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60-G+M,,SIG/SUM) 2200 M/SEC
            VALUE, TAKEN FROM JIN,24,1483.
STATUS     .REVISED VALUE FROM PAGE 14 OF 66PARIS.
HISTORY    (800303C)
           (800318E)
CORRECTION .CORRECTION FOR PRODUCTION OF PU-242 VIA PU-241 DECAY
            TO AM-241 FOLLOWED BY CAPTURE TO AM-242-G THEN DECAY
            TO PU-242 WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL ANALYSIS,
            BUT IS INCLUDED IN THE REVISED ANALYSIS IN 66PARIS.
ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTIES ARE INCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING
            SOURCES.... DETERMINATION OF REACTOR SPECTRUM VALUE
            OF ALPHA (5.5 PC), STATISTICS (1.9 PC), MASS
            DISCRIMINATION IN SPECTROMETER (0.1 PC), NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM TEMPERATURE AND EPI-THERMAL INDEX (0.1 PC).
            A FURTHER 1 PERCENT UNCERTAINTY IS INCLUDED FROM
            ERRORS IN CONVERSION FACTORS, WESTCOTT FACTORS.
