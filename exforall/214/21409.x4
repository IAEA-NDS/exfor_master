TITLE       Mass spectrometric measurements of the ratio of
            thermal neutron capture to fission for Pu-241

INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR) Chemistry division.
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,27,2481,1965) Data superseded.
           (C,66PARIS,2,3,1966) Revised final data.

FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) PLUTO reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were in the flux scanning tube
            of the B2 fuel element for 48.35 days.
INC-SPECT   The PLUTO spectrum is Maxwellian with a temperature
            of 106 degrees and with a high epi-thermal index,
            ranging from 0.041 to 0.087
SAMPLE      Nitric acid solutions of mixtures of four highly
            enriched isotopes of plutonium, precipitated onto
            silica and sealed in silica phials under pressure.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASEP) Mass spectroscopy using an A.E.I. Type
            M.S.5 Spectrometer, with about 0.1 micro-g plutonium
            on a tungsten filament surface ionisation source.
            After irradiation samples were allowed to cool for
            six months, then plutonium was chemically seperated
            and used for the isotopic composition changes.
ANALYSIS    Value derived from changes in isotopic composition
            arising from neutron capture and fission.
            All measured ratios involving Pu-241 were corrected
            for radio-active decay using a half life
            of 13.29 +- 0.06 years.
                 - Note that this differs considerably from
            later acceped values but was not considered in the
            Re-analysis of 66PARIS. -
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG) 2200 m/sec
CORRECTION  Correction for production of Pu-242 via Pu-241 decay
            to Am-241 followed by capture to Am-242-g then decay
            to Pu-242 was not included in the original analysis,
            but is included in the revised analysis in 66PARIS.

           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in determination of reactor
                   spectrum value of alpha (5.5%),
           (ERR-S) Statistical error (1.9%),
