TITLE      -THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF THERMAL NEUTRONS IN
            WATER.-
FACILITY   .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) 450 KEV DEUTERONS IMPINGING ONTO A HEAVY
            ICE TARGET, COOLED WITH LIQUID NITROGEN, 1.E5 N/SEC
            PRODUCED. THE SOURCE WAS PULSED (1 PULSE EVERY 1600
            MICRO-SECONDS).
SAMPLE     .600 GALLON WATER TANK, 120 CM*120 CM* 180 CM.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF THE DECAY OF THE NEUTRON DISTRIBUTION
            IN A WATER TANK.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR (TERPHENYL IN CYCLOHEXANE
            WITH DIPHENYL AS FREQUENCY SHIFTER).
           (BF3  ) AS NEUTRON FLUX MONITOR.
STATUS     (NDD  ) DATA TAKEN FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (800229T) G.C.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND (THE METAL CELL CONTAINING THE LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR BECAME RADIOACTIVE WITH NEUTRON
            IRRADIATION), PRESENCE OF THE TUBE THROUGH WHICH THE
            DEUTERONS REACH THE TARGET GIVES LEAKAGE (THIS WAS
            CORRECTED FOR BY USING THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT
            WITH A DUMMY TUBE.)
ERR-ANALYS .PROBABLE ERRORS GIVEN FOR THE AVERAGE LIVES, FROM
            WHICH THE DATA IS CALCULATED. THIS ERROR IS BASED ON
            THE STATISTICAL ERROR, THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE TARGET
            CORRECTION, AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TARGET -
            SCINTILLATOR DISTANCE.
