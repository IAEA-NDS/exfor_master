TITLE       The C-12(n,np)B-11, C-12(p,pn)C-11 and C-12(p,2p)B-11
            reactions induced by nucleons of 120-150 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK HAR)
INC-SOURCE .No details given.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Na-I-(Tl)-crystal in coincidence with two
            proton detectors (no further specification of these)
            in bad geometry.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(N,N+P)5-B-11,PAR,SIG) To 2.14 MeV level.
            The efficiency of the counting system could not be
            determined directly with any great accuracy, so the
            yield of the 2.14 MeV gamma-ray was used as a measure
            of the efficiency. The cross-section for producing
            the mirror state in 11C in the mirror reaction
            12C(p,pn) has been found to be 2.8+-0.4 mb; the
            cross-section for producing the 11B state in the
            12C(n,np) reaction should be the same.
PART-DET   (P) Protons and
           (G) coincident gamma rays.
COMMENT    .The cross section to the 2.14 MeV level was taken
            the same as to the mirror state in the mirror
            reaction (6-C-12(p,p+n)6-C-11,par,sig).
