TITLE      -THE PROTON-THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION.-
FACILITY   (CCW,2UK OXF) 600 KEV COCKCROFT WALTON MACHINE.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION, 300 KEV DEUTERONS.
            PULSED NEUTRON BEAM.
SAMPLE     .WATER TANK.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRONS
            IN A LARGE WATER TANK AS A FUNCTION OF TIME BY
            DETECTING THE CAPTURE GAMMA RAYS. THE TANK WAS AN
            OPEN CUBOID OF 1.8 M DEEP AND 2.5 M SQUARE.
            THE INITIAL NEUTRON DISTRIBUTION IS CREATED BY A
            PULSED NEUTRON BEAM COMING INTO THE WATER TANK.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR, TYPE NE102 (NUCLEAR
            ENTERPRISES LTD. EDINBURGH) WITH THERMAL NEUTRON
            DIFFUSION PROPERTIES SIMULAR TO THOSE OF WATER.

CORRECTION .BACKGROUND FROM THE O-16(N,P)N-16 REACTION CAPTURE
            GAMMA RAYS (2.2 MEV) AND FROM IMPURITIES IN THE TANK,
            AMOUNTING TO 1-5 PERC., DRIFTS IN STABILITY OF THE
            ELECTRONICS (ABOUT 1 PERC), DEAD TIME EFFECTS,
            DECAY DURING AN OPEN TIME CHANNEL WIDTH. THE LAST
            THREE CORRECTIONS YIELDED TOGETHER ONLY A 0.5
            CORRECTION. THE NEUTRON ABSORPTION BY THE NEUTRON
            BEAM TUBE WAS NEGLIGIBLE.
ERR-ANALYS .COMPOUNDED FROM THE ERROR OF THE LEAST SQUARES FIT
            TO THE NEUTRON DECAY CURVE, AND INDIVIDUAL ERRORS
            IN THE QUANTITIES WHICH LEAD TO THE INTEGRATED
            NEUTRON FLUX IN THE TANK.
