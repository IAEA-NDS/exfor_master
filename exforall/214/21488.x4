REFERENCE  (J,PPS/A,70,195,1957)   Short report of supplementary
                         activation measurement of Fe-54(N,2N).
AUTHOR     (D.L.Allan)
TITLE       Protons from the interaction of 14 MeV neutrons with
            medium weight nuclei
FACILITY   (CCW,2UK HAR) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 250-300 KeV deuteron beam on zirconium-
            tritium target.
SAMPLE     The targets were in the form of strips 1 cm wide and
           varied in thickness from 5 to 12 mg/cm2
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proportional counter, no details.
MONITOR    (29-CU-63(N,2N)29-CU-62,,SIG) Value taken
            as  482 mb.
CORRECTION .Not corrected for beta self absorption and back
            scattering as the beta energies and half-life are
            almost identical to those in the monitor reaction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) One standard deviation, statistical error.
HISTORY    (19800422C)
           (20051003A) Date is corrected
           (20051121U) Last checking has been done.
