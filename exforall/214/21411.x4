TITLE       A re-assessment of the isomeric cross section ratio
            in Ge-75
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK BIA) SAMES accelerator, 150 kV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 150 keV deuterium beam on tritium target
            giving neutrons of 14.5 MeV with an energy spread
            of +- 0.2 MeV.
SAMPLE     A few grams of spectrographically-pure arsenic trioxide
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
           (ASSOP) Associated particle technique for neutron
            flux monitor.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3 by 3 inch NaI(Tl) crystal.
MONITOR    (1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,SIG) Associated alpha counting.
COMMENT    From compiler: This measurement is in disagreement with
           previous data in NP/A,93,74,1967 (see Entry 20303).
STATUS     (TABLE) From the text on p.2958 of JIN,31,2957,1969
CORRECTION  Corrected for self absorption of decay gammas.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Principal uncertainties are from decay
           scheme data, gamma ray absorption in sample, NaI(Tl)
           detector efficiency and neutron flux monitor. All
           uncertainties are combined in quadrature to give the
           quoted error.
HISTORY    (19800304T)
           (20151212A) SD:Updated to new date formats,lower case.
            Correction following last EXFOR rules and Dict.
