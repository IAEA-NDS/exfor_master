INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) BEPO-reactor.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal column.
INC-SPECT  Maxwellian neutron spectrum (thermal column).
DETECTOR   (COIN,FISCH,BF3) Coincidences between the fission
            fragments and the prompt neutrons. Fission chamber
            contained 15 cm Ar + 1 cm C-O(2). Ring of 16 BF3
            counters embedded in a block of paraffin wax
            surrounded the fission chamber. They had a pressure
            of 40 cm. Enriched boron-10 (96 perc), 13 cm long *
            2.3 cm diam. Sensitive volume.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments in coincidence with
           (PN)    prompt fission neutrons.
CORRECTION  Correction for the difference in the
            fission neutron spectra of the different isotopes,
            which causes a difference in detection efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error due to gate length within
           statistical error. Quoted error is standard deviation
           from the mean of a number of measurements (+ 1% from
           the correction on the efficiency for different
           fission neutron spectra in the case of the values
           derived from relative measurements.)

            Isotopic enrichment of 81.2 perc for the U-235 foil.
            The Pu-foil was prepared using highly irradiated Pu
            from the nrx pile at chalk river.
            It contained 26.8% Pu-239, and 13.9% Pu-241.
CORRECTION  A 0.5% correction was made for the spontaneous
            fission of Pu-240 and Pu-242. (these have no thermal
            fission).

            source with a spontaneous fission rate of 1.59+-0.09
