TITLE      -The fast neutron emission spectrum of Cf-252.-
FACILITY   .No information given.
SAMPLE      The IAEA Cf-252 neutron source consists of
            a cylindrical capsule with an outer length of 22.0
            mm and an external diameter of 2.80 mm, strength
            calibrated against a standard Cf-252 source.
METHOD     (REC)   Measuring proton-recoils in the gas filled
            proportional counter spectrometers.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A gas filled proportional counter filled
            with 200 kpa C-H4 gas, 200 kpa Kripton gas and 0.1%
            He-3, energy calibrated with a Na-Be neutron source
            and the He-3(N,P)-reaction using thermal neutrons.
ANALYSIS   .The response functions for the detector were calcu-
            lated using the MONTE-CARLO code MATRI, which is a
            modified version of the code SPEC-4.
STATUS     .Results taken from INDC(AUS)-4,,197912
CORRECTION .Correction for the high energy part of the Cf-252
            neutrons above 10 MeV applied.
           .No gamma discrimination applied, since the lower
            detection threshold is 0.9 MeV.

COMMENT    .Raw data were fitted to a polynomial of fourth
            order using the expression:
            N(e) = K*(sqrt(E)*exp(-E/T)*(sum(a(I)*E**(I)))
             I - 0,1,2,3,4.
            Which gave the results,
            T = 1.409 +- 0.015 MeV
            a(0) =  0.89250
            a(1) = -0.36978E-02
            a(2) =  0.30352E-01
            a(3) = -0.59229E-02
            a(4) =  0.29983E-03
