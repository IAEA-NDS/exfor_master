TITLE      -THE FAST NEUTRON EMISSION SPECTRUM OF CF-252.-
FACILITY   .NO INFORMATION GIVEN.
INC-SOURCE (CF252) THE IAEA CF-252 NEUTRON SOURCE CONSISTS OF
            A CYLINDRICAL CAPSULE WITH AN OUTER LENGTH OF 22.0
            MM AND AN EXTERNAL DIAMETER OF 2.80 MM, STRENGTH
            CALIBRATED AGAINST A STANDARD CF-252 SOURCE.
METHOD     (REC  ) MEASURING PROTON-RECOILS IN THE GAS FILLED
            PROPORTIONAL COUNTER SPECTROMETERS.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A GAS FILLED PROPORTIONAL COUNTER,FILLED
            WITH 200 KPA CH4-GAS, 200 KPA KR-GAS AND 0.1 PERCENT
            HE-3, ENERGY CALIBRATED WITH A NA-BE NEUTRON SOURCE
            AND THE HE-3(N,P)-REACTION USING THERMAL NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS   .THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS FOR THE DETECTOR WERE CALCU-
            LATED USING THE MONTE-CARLO CODE MATRI, WHICH IS A
            MODIFIED VERSION OF THE CODE SPEC-4.
STATUS     .RESULTS TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.
HISTORY    (800317C) CN.
           (800331E)
CORRECTION .CORRECTION FOR THE HIGH ENERGY PART OF THE CF-252
            NEUTRONS ABOVE 10 MEV APPLIED.
           .NO GAMMA DISCRIMINATION APPLIED, SINCE THE LOWER
            DETECTION THRESHOLD IS 0.9 MEV.
ERR-ANALYS .ERRORS IN THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM INCLUDES STATISTICAL
            ERRORS AND SYSTEMATC ERRORS DUE TO THE MONTE-CARLO
            METHOD USED TO OBTAIN THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS OF THE
            DETECTOR.

REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,DE,N)
COMMENT    .RAW DATA WERE FITTED TO A POLYNOMIAL OF FOURTH
            DEGREE USING THE FORMULA,
            N(E) = K*(SQRT(E)*EXP(-E/T)*(SUM(A(I)*E(I)))
             I = 0,1,2,3,4.
            WHICH GAVE THE RESULTS,
            T = 1.409 +- 0.015 MEV
            A(0) =  0.89250
            A(1) = -0.36978E-02
            A(2) =  0.30352E-01
            A(3) = -0.59229E-02
            A(4) =  0.29983E-03
STATUS     .RESULTS FROM MAIN REFERENCE AND FROM A CORRIGENDUM
            RECIEVED IN MARCH 1980 (SEE COMMENT).
