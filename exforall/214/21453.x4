TITLE       Mean number of prompt neutrons emitted in the fission
            of U-238, Pu-239, Th-232
METHOD     (COINC) Fission fragments detected in coincidence
            with prompt fission neutrons.
            The quantity detector-efficiency*nu-bar was measured
            in all the experiments. by comparison of this quantity
            with its value obtained with the same apparatus for a
            reference nucleus, the nu-bar can be determined,
            from the nu-bar value of the reference nucleus, if
            one assumes that the efficiency remains the same.
DETECTOR   (COIN,FISCH,BF3) A number of BF3 counters surrounding
            the fission chamber in coincidence.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments, and
           (N) prompt fission neutrons.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the text of J.de Phys.,21,617.
CORRECTION .For background from diffused neutrons, random coinci-
            dences, non detected fission events. Correction
            for neutron number loss due to simultaneous detection
            of 2 or more neutrons negligible. Other corrections
            applied described in subworks.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),PR,NU)
FACILITY   (CCW,2FR SAC) Cockcroft Walton accelerator, operated
            at 220 keV to produce 14.2 MeV neutrons.
           (REAC,2FR SAC) Reactor Pile EL.2. This beam also gave
            the neutrons for the creation of the fission neutron
            spectrum, and also the Maxwellian neutron spectrum.
SAMPLE     .500 mg natural uranium in 40 deposits of 1.8 mg/cm2,
            produced by painting of uranyl nitrate onto
            the two sides of an Al foil of 0.03 mm thickness.
            There is  also a measurement done with a sample
            made poorer in U-235 (2.E-4 U235) in order to show
            that at 14.2 MeV the fissions come only from U-238
            in both of the samples.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),PR,NU)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium reaction in tritium-titanium
            target for the production of 14.2 MeV neutrons.
CORRECTION .Difference in efficiency between the monitor
            measurement and the main measurement (smaller than 1%)
            fission fragment anisotropy effects resulting
            in a 2.5 +- 2% lowering of the efficiency, and
            incoming neutron spectrum degradation due to
            inelastic scattering of the neutrons with the
            collimator walls (+0.15+-0.01 correction)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) .Uncertainty includes statistics and
            uncertainties of the random coincidences determination
            caused by neutron flux fluctuations and coincidence
            time fluctuations. The value given is a weighted mean
            of the results of the two independent measurements
            described above.

METHOD     .In order to discriminate against the spontaneous

            the paraffin surrounding the chamber), the
            experiments were done in coincidence with the
            associated alpha particles from the neutron
            production d-t-reaction. These alphas were detected
