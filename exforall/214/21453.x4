TITLE      -MEAN NUMBER OF PROMPT NEUTRONS EMITTED IN THE FISSION

FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT WALTON ACCELERATOR, OPERATED AT 220
            KEV TO PRODUCE 14.2 MEV NEUTRONS.
           (SPECC) CRYSTAL SPECTROMETER FOR THE SELECTION OF
            0.0253 MILLI-EV NEUTRONS FROM A NEUTRON BEAM OF THE
           (REAC,2FR SAC) REACTOR PILE EL.2. THIS BEAM ALSO GAVE
            THE NEUTRONS FOR THE CREATION OF THE FISSION NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM, AND ALSO THE MAXWELLIAN NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION IN TRITIUM-TITANIUM
            TARGET FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 14.2 MEV NEUTRONS.

           .U-235(N,F)-REACTION FOR THE CREATION OF THE FISSION
            NEUTRON SPECTRUM. A 3 MM THICK LAYER OF 20 PERCENT
            ENRICHMENT WAS USED.
METHOD     (COINC) FISSION FRAGMENTS DETECTED IN COINCIDENCE
            WITH PROMPT FISSION NEUTRONS.
            THE QUANTITY DETECTOR-EFFICIENCY*NU-BAR WAS MEASURED
            IN ALL THE EXPERIMENTS. BY COMPARISON OF THIS QUANTITY
            WITH ITS VALUE OBTAINED WITH THE SAME APPARATUS FOR A
            REFERENCE NUCLEUS, THE NU-BAR CAN BE DETERMINED,
            FROM THE NU-BAR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE NUCLEUS, IF
            ONE ASSUMES THAT THE EFFICIENCY REMAINS THE SAME.
DETECTOR   (COIN,FISCH,BF3) A NUMBER OF BF3 COUNTERS SURROUNDING
            THE FISSION CHAMBER IN COINCIDENCE.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS, AND
