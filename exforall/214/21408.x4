TITLE       The ratio of thermal neutron capture to fission for
            Pu-239

           (R,AERE-R-4173,1963) Addendum to JIN,25,607.
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) PLUTO reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiation in the flux scanning tube of the
            B2 fuel element of the pluto reactor for 47 days.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum in pluto has a temperature of
            106 degrees and a large epithermal component ranging
            from 0.049 to 0.070 for the epithermal index.
SAMPLE      Sample of three highly enriched plutonium isotopes,
            Pu-239 (99.9%), Pu-240 (99.4%) and Pu-242 (98.1%)
            were blended to give mixtures of known
            isotopic composition. For irradiation the plutonium
            mixtures were mixed with silica and evaporated to
            dryness as nitrate. Afer irradiation plutonium was
            chemically seperated then mass seperated.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASEP) Isotopic mass seperation using an A.E.I.
            Type M.S.5 mass spectrometer. 0.1 ug plutonium
            on tungsten filament surface ionisation source.
ANALYSIS    Alpha derived from changes in isotopic composition
            of plutonium mixtures from neutron capture
            and fission.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG) 2200 m/sec value.
            Monitors were used to determine neutron flux, the
            spectrum temperature and the epithermal component.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty from mass discrimination in
                   spectrometer (0.1%),
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in determination of spectrum
                   average alpha (1.4%),
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in neutron temperature (0.9 pc),
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in epi-thermal index (0.7%)
            This is then combined with uncertainties in Westcotts
            G and S factors to give a total absolute unceratainty
            of 0.0070.
