TITLE      -THE RATIO OF THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE TO FISSION FOR
            PU-239 -.
FACILITY   (SPECM) MASS SPECTROMETER.
           (REAC ) PLUTO REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATION IN THE FLUX SCANNING TUBE OF THE
            B2 FUEL ELEMENT OF THE PLUTO REACTOR FOR 47 DAYS.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM IN PLUTO HAS A TEMPERATURE OF
            106 DEGREES AND A LARGE EPITHERMAL COMPONENT RANGING
            FROM 0.049 TO 0.070 FOR THE EPITHERMAL INDEX.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLE OF THREE HIGHLY ENRICHED PLUTONIUM ISOTOPES,
            PU-239 (99.9 PC), PU-240 (99.4 PC) AND PU-242
            (98.1 PC) WERE BLENDED TO GIVE MIXTURES OF KNOWN
            ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION. FOR IRRADIATION THE PLUTONIUM
            MIXTURES WERE MIXED WITH SILICA AND EVAPORATED TO
            DRYNESS AS NITRATE. AFER IRRADIATION PLUTONIUM WAS
            CHEMICALLY SEPERATED THEN MASS SEPERATED.
METHOD     (ASEP ) ISOTOPIC MASS SEPERATION USING AN A.E.I.
            TYPE M.S.5 MASS SPECTROMETER. 0.1 MICRO-G PLUTONIUM
            ON TUNGSTEN FILAMENT SURFACE IONISATION SOURCE.
ANALYSIS   .ALPHA DERIVED FROM CHANGES IN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION
            OF PLUTONIUM MIXTURES FROM NEUTRON CAPTURE
            AND FISSION.

            M/SEC VALUE.
            MONITORS WERE USED TO DETERMINE NEUTRON FLUX, THE
            SPECTRUM TEMPERATURE AND THE EPITHERMAL COMPONENT.

ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTY IN THE DERIVED 2200 M/SEC VALUE ARE
            FROM MASS SPECTROMETER STATISTICAL ERRORS (0.1 PC),
            DETERMINATION OF SPECTRUM AVERAGE ALPHA (1.4 PC),
            NEUTRON TEMPERATURE (0.9 PC), AND EPI-THERMAL
            INDEX (0.7 PC) GIVING TOTAL OF 1.8 PERCENT.
            THIS IS THEN COMBINED WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN WESTCOTTS
            G AND S FACTORS TO GIVE A TOTAL ABSOLUTE UNCERATAINTY
            OF 0.0070
