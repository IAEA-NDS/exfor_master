TITLE      -HARMONIC FREE DETERMINATION OF THE THERMAL NEUTRON
            ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION OF HYDROGEN BY A PULSED
            SOURCE TECHNIQUE.-
FACILITY   .SAMES,TYPE J, 150 KV DEUTERON ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION.
SAMPLE     .CYLINDRICAL WATER TANK, RADIUS 10.03+-0.3 CM, HEIGHT
            20 CM, COVERED WITH 0.04 IN. CD TO PREVENT RE-ENTRY
            OF ROOM-REFLECTED THERMAL NEUTRONS. WATER WITH
            CONDUCTIVITY OF 7 MICRO-OHM/CM, TOTAL DISSOLVED
            SOLIDS LESS THAN 1 PPM.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF THE DECAY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MODE
            (FOURIER ANALYSIS) OF THE THERMAL NEUTRON DENSITY
            DISTRIBUTION IN A CYLINDER OF WATER AFTER THERMA-
            LIZATION OF AN INJECTED BURST OF FAST NEUTRONS.
            MEASUREMENT OF THIS DECAY FOR A RANGE OF WATER
            DEPTHS ENABLES DETERMINATION, BY EXTRAPOLATION, OF
            THE DECAY CONSTANT V*SIGMA(ABSORPTION) OF AN
            INFINITELY LARGE SYSTEM.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) 0.25 IN. FISSION COUNTER IN A 1CM DIAM AL
            TUBE + A LARGE BORON LOADED N DETECTOR AS FLUX
