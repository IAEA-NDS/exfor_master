TITLE       Harmonic free determination of the thermal neutron
            absorption cross section of hydrogen by a pulsed
            source technique
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK MAN) SAMES,type J, 150 KV deuteron accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium reaction.
SAMPLE     .Cylindrical water tank, radius 10.03+-0.3 cm, height
            20 cm, covered with 0.04 in. Cd to prevent re-entry
            of room-reflected thermal neutrons. Water with
            conductivity of 7 micro-ohm/cm, total dissolved
            solids less than 1 ppm.
METHOD     .Measurement of the decay of the fundamental mode
            (Fourier analysis) of the thermal neutron density
            distribution in a cylinder of water after therma-
            lization of an injected burst of fast neutrons.
            Measurement of this decay for a range of water
            depths enables determination, by extrapolation, of
            the decay constant V*sigma(absorption) of an
            infinitely large system.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) 0.25 in. fission counter in a 1cm diam Al
            tube + a large boron loaded n detector as flux
            monitor.
