TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE FISSION CROSS SECTIONS AND NUMBER
            OF PROMPT NEUTRONS EMITTED DURING FISSION.-
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR SAC) 2 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF MACHINE HVEC.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION. TRITIUM-TREATED

            DEUTERONS.
SAMPLE     .PREPARED BY ELECTROLYSIS ON AL OF U-OXIDE. SAMPLE WAS
            ALPHA COUNTED FOR MASS DETERMINATION. THIS YIELDED
            621 MG +- 2 PERC METALLIC URANIUM (SELFABSORPTION
            AND BACKSCATTERING OF THE ALPHA PARTICLES WERE TAKEN
            INTO ACCOUNT)
DETECTOR   (COIN,FISCH,SCIN) COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE ASSOCIATED
            ALPHA PARTICLE FROM THE NEUTRON PRODUCTION AND THE
            NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION FRAGMENT. THE ALPHAS ARE
            DETECTED IN A 1 MM THICK PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR,
            WITH A 8 MICRONS THICK AL ENTRANCE SHIELD TO STOP
            DIFFUSED NEUTRONS. THE  DETECTION EFFICIENCY IS 100.
            PERCENT. THE FISSION FRAFMENTS ARE DETECTED IN A
            FISSION CHAMBER (DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN
            SEE TEXT) FILLED WITH 3 KG/CM*CM MIXTURE OF 95 PERC
            AR AND 5 PERC C-O(2), WITH A GAS FLOW OF 2 LITER/MIN.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSION FRAGMENTS, AND
