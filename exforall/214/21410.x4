REFERENCE  (R,AERE-R-5874,1,1968) Re-assessment of JIN,28,2467
           (J,JIN,28,2467,1966) data superseded.

TITLE       A Re-assessment of Harwell mass spectrometric
            measurements of the cross sections of Pu-239,
            Pu-240 and Pu-241 for Maxwellian neutrons
FACILITY   (SPECM,2UK HAR) Mass spectrometer.
           (REAC,2UK HAR) DIDO reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiation carried out in the no4 hobson-
            honeycomb unit, at the end nearest the core.
            The irradiation can was separated from the nearest
            fuel rod by 15 cm aluminium alloy and 62 cm heavy
            water. Irradiation for 295.6 +- 0.1 days.
INC-SPECT  The neutron spectrum was Maxwellian with a
            temperature of 116 degrees and an epithermal component
            of 7.5 / 10**4.
SAMPLE     .Target materials were aliquots of mixtures of
            highly enriched plutonium isotopes, in nitric acid
            solution, supplied by the electromagnetic separation
            group at Harwell. Mixtures were deposited on precipte
            silica.Samples contained about 10 mg silica and about
            10 micro-gram plutonium in small silica phials under
            reduced pressure.Irradiated samples were separated
            chemically by anion exchange column, then
            analyzed for relative isotopic abundances by mass
            spectrometry.
METHOD     (ASEP)  Mass separation in A.E.I. Type MS5 mass
            spectrometer, for details see JIN,27,2481.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
            value taken as 37.5 +- 0.13 b, revised value
            supersedes that used in JIN,28,2467.
COMMENT    .The original analysis in JIN,28,2467 used an
            interactive fitting procedure to obtain a self-
            consistent set of cross sections from all fourteen
            samples.
           .The revised procedure considers the experiment in
            tree separate parts, with each isotopic mixture
            analyzed independently.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).Errors are given at one standard deviation
             and include contributions from
              * the mass analysis,
           (ERR-1) the neutron flux normalization (2.26%),
              * uncertainties in other assumed quantities such
                as the Pu-241 half life etc.
