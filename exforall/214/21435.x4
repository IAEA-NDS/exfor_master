TITLE      -THE RATIO OF THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE TO FISSION FOR
            U-235 -.
FACILITY   (SPECM) MASS SPECTROMETER.
           (REAC ) PLUTO REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATION IN THE FLUX SCANNING TUBE OF THE
            B2 FUEL ELEMENT OF THE PLUTO REACTOR FOR 47 DAYS.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM IN PLUTO HAS A TEMPERATURE OF
            106 DEGREES AND A LARGE EPITHERMAL COMPONENT RANGING
            FROM 0.046 TO 0.066 FOR THE EPITHERMAL INDEX.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLE WERE PREPARED BY MIXING 93 PERCENT ENRICHED
            U-235 WITH 99.995 PERCENT ENRICHED U-238. ALIQUOTS
            OF APPROX 100 MICRO-GM U-235 WERE DISPERSED IN ABOUT
            10 MG MAGNESIUM OXIDE FOR IRRADIATION.
METHOD     (ASEP ) ISOTOPIC MASS SEPERATION USING AN A.E.I.
            TYPE M.S.5 MASS SPECTROMETER. 10 MICRO-G URANIUM
            ON TUNGSTEN FILAMENT SURFACE IONISATION SOURCE.

            OF URANIUM MIXTURES FROM NEUTRON CAPTURE
            AND FISSION.

            SEPERATE CO-59, SM-149 AND U-238 SAMPLE
            MONITORS WERE USED TO DETERMINE NEUTRON FLUX, THE
            SPECTRUM TEMPERATURE AND THE EPITHERMAL COMPONENT.
ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTY IN THE DERIVED 2200 M/SEC VALUE ARE

            DETERMINATION OF SPECTRUM AVERAGE ALPHA (1.0 PC),
            THIS IS THEN COMBINED WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN WESTCOTTS
