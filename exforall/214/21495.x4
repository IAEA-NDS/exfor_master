TITLE      -PROMPT FISSION NEUTRONS. MEASUREMENT OF NU-BAR AND
            OF THE PROBABILITIES P(NU) FOR THE EMISSION OF NU
            NEUTRONS.- (IN FRENCH).-
FACILITY   .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
INC-SOURCE .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
DETECTOR   (COIN,STANK,FISCH) LARGE GD-LOADED LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR MADE BY NUCLEAR ENTERPRISES, SPHERICAL,
            TYPE NE5562, CONTAINING 230 LITERS OF SCINTILLATING
            NE323, OPERATED IN COINCIDENCE AND DELAYED COINCI-
            DENCE (FOR BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS) WITH A FISSION
            CHAMBER. NO DETAILS ARE GIVEN ABOUT THE FISSION
            CHAMBER.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU) TAKEN FROM MOAT ET AL.,
            JNE,15(1961)102.
PART-DET   (FF   ) FISSIONS DETECTED AS COINCIDENCES BETWEEN
            THE FISSION FRAGMENTS IN THE FISSION CHAMBER AND
            THE RECOIL PROTONS FROM THE PROMPT NEUTRON SLOWING
            DOWN + FISSION GAMMAS IN THE SCINTILLATOR, AND
           (N    ) PROMPT NEUTRONS BY THEIR CAPTURE GAMMAS
            AFTER SLOWING DOWN.
STATUS     (NDD  ) DATA TAKEN FROM NEUDADA.

ERR-ANALYS .ERROR INCLUDES ERRORS FROM NORMALIZATION, DEAD TIME
            CORRECTION, STATISTICS AND THE INTERGRATION OF THE
            CURVE GIVING THE NEUTRON EMISSION PROBABILTY AS A
            FUNCTION OF TIME.
           .ERRORS FROM ELECTRONICS, FISSION FRAGMENT LOSS WITHIN
            THE SOURCE, GEOMETRY OF THE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR ARE
            MINIMIZED.
