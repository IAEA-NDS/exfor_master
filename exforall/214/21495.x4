TITLE       Prompt fission neutrons. Measurement of nu-bar and
            of the probabilities p(nu) for the emission of nu
            neutrons

FACILITY    No details given.
DETECTOR   (COIN,STANK,FISCH) Large Gd-loaded liquid
            scintillator made by nuclear enterprises, spherical,
            type NE-5562, containing 230 liters of scintillating
            NE-323, operated in coincidence and delayed
            coincidence (for background measurements) with a
            fission chamber. No details are given about the
            fission chamber.

REL-REF    (C,20488001,J.Frehaut+,R,CEA-R-4626,1974) Efficiency
            was not measured under good conditions in
            this 1966 work
PART-DET   (FF) Fissions detected as coincidences between
            the fission fragments in the fission chamber and
            the recoil protons from the prompt neutron slowing
            down + fission gammas in the scintillator, and
           (N) prompt neutrons by their capture gammas
            after slowing down.
CORRECTION  Background, dead time, efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Error includes errors from normalization,
            dead time correction, statistics and the integration
            of the curve giving the neutron emission probability
            as a function of time.
            Errors from electronics, fission fragment loss within
            the source, geometry of the liquid scintillator are
            minimized.
