TITLE       Boron pile nu-bar measurements
SAMPLE     .No details given. Effects from foil thickness were
            less than 0.3%, according to the authors.
METHOD     .Boron pile. Fission neutrons slowed down in a
            220 cm side cubic core of a graphite stack,
            surrounded by a 35 cm thick graphite reflector to
            keep them inside. The whole is surrounded by a
            neutron shield consisting of 0.4 mm cadmium inside
            61 cm of concrete.
DETECTOR   (BF3) 2 BF3-counters in each hole of the lattice
            of 11*11 holes in the graphite stack of the boron
            pile. 5 cm diam detectors, enriched boron,
           (FISCH) fission chamber in the centre of the boron
            pile.
           (IOCH) For measuring the monitor reaction. It
            contains C-D(4).
PART-DET   (N) Fission neutrons, and
           (FF) fission fragments.
REL-REF    (I,22509001,D.W.Colvin+,C,58GENEVA,16,121,1958) - A
            full description of the boron pile.
COMMENT    .Efficiency determined by measuring the number of
            neutrons emitted per reaction (1-H-2(gamma,n)1-H-1),
            which is 1. this efficiency was of the order of 64%
            Absolute measurement.
           .A number of pitfalls is discussed in the article,
            e.g. A 50 Hz modulation of the Van de Graaff beam
            by the magnetic field of the belt motors, anisotropy
            of the efficiency, (n,f)-reactions induced by the
            prompt neutrons, foil thickness effects.
CORRECTION .Background correction determined with a delayed
            coincidence technique. Seven other corrections
            discussed in reference, viz. count-rate effect,
            overlap correction, effect of fission chamber,
            ionization chamber and beam tube on the boron pile
            efficiency, neutrons captured after the gate for
            counting the fission neutrons is closed, the
            variation of efficiency with the position in the
            central channel, effects of impurities in the
            fission foils, correction for delayed neutrons.

METHOD     .Data obtained with a measurement where the pile
            efficiency was determined with standard sources.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) .Two errors were always calculated, viz an
            internal one and an external one. The biggest of them
            was always taken. Total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in efficiency,
           (ERR-S) Uncertainty in value of neutrons detected per
           counted fission event,
           (ERR-4)  effect of electrical pickup,
           (ERR-5) anisotropy in efficiency,
           (ERR-6) correction for neutrons captured after the gate
