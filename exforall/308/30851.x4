INC-SOURCE (P-BE) The neutron beam was produced from the 9Be(p,n)
            reaction by impinging 35 and 45 MeV proton beams on a
            2 mm thick Be target.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) The neutron spectrum was characterized by
            MCNPX 2.6.0.
SAMPLE     100Mo metallic powder
            - purity: >99.99%
            - weight: 33.8 mg, 38.6 mg
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation for 60 min
           (GSPEC) Started after the cooling time (7-9 hour)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Energy resolution and relative efficiency of
            the detector at the 1332.5 keV gamma-ray of 60Co are
            1.8 keV and 20% relative to a 7.6 cm diameter x 7.6 cm
            length NaI(Tl).
MONITOR    Al foil (thickness: 0.025 mm)
            - purity: >99.99%
            - weight: 67.4 mg, 62.5 mg
           The neutron fluxes from the reaction threshold to the
            maximum neutron energies was calculated with the MCNPX
            code.
           The experimental data used to obtain the flux-weighted
            average cross-section for Al(n,a)24Na reaction for
            the neutron energies of 35 and 45 MeV are 0.027 and
            0.0324 b.
