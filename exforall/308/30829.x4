COMMENT    By J.Y.Lee (2012-10-15):
            Fast and epithermal neutrons were eliminated through
            a silicon single crystal cooled by liquid nitrogen.
            A bismuth crystal was used after the silicon crystal
            as a gamma-ray filter. Deviation from the thermal
            cross section due to this process could be ~1%, which
            is negligible compared with the uncertainty 9.4%.
