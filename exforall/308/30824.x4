SAMPLE     C6-D6(NE230 ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR). THIS SAMPLE SERVED
           SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A DETECTOR FOR THE BREAK-UP PROTONS.

METHOD     (TOF)
           (ASSOP)-ASSOCIATED ALPHA PARTICLE
           TWO TOF SPECTRA WITH NE230(DEUTERATED SAMPLE) AND
           NE231(NONDEUTERATED SAMPLE) WERE MEASURED. THE SPECTRUM
           OF NEUTRONS FROM REAL BREAK-UP EVENTS WAS DETERMINED
           AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SPECTRA.
