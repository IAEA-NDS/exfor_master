SAMPLE     C6-D6(NE230 organic scintillator). This sample served
           simultaneously as a detector for the break-up protons.
MONITOR    Absolute measurements
FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNELU)  Neutron generator NG-200

METHOD     (TOF)
           (ASSOP)-Associated alpha particle
           Two TOF spectra with NE230(deuterated sample) and
           NE231(nondeuterated sample) were measured. The spectrum
           of neutrons from real break-up events was determined
           as the difference between these two spectra.
