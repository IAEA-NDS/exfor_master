TITLE      The angular distribution of 1.79 MeV neutrons scattered
           from helium.
FACILITY   (VDG,1USATEX) 3 MeV electrostatic accelerator was
            pulsed after acceleration at a frequency of 3.6 Mc/s.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Cylinder containing tritium gas at one atmosphere
           The cell was 1.5 cm long and was separated from the
           accelerator by a 0.0001 in. nickel foil.
SAMPLE     The helium scatterer was contained in a steel
                                              high-pressure cell
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4 by 3 by 2 in. plastic scintillator viewed
            by two RCA 6810 photomultiplier tubes through Lucite
            light pipes.
            The neutrons were monitored by a 1 by 2 by 0.040 in.
           plastic scintillator placed a few inches above the
           tritium cell.
CORRECTION Corrected for multiple scattering.
