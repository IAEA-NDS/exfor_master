TITLE      A search for H4 and Li4.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The neutrons produced in a thick water-cooled
           lithium target
FACILITY   (VDG,1USALMS) 3 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator
SAMPLE     The tritium sample, in the form of the compound
           titanium tritide,  was encased in three quartz
           ampoules which were held by Styrofoam  inside a
           thin-walled (0.4 g/cm2) stainless steel cylinder
           having a diameter of 3.7 cm and a length of 5 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
           Fast neutron fluxes were measured by removing the large
           plastic scintillator and observing the induced Au-198
           activity in gold foils placed around the tritium sample
           From the known Au-197(n,gamma)Au-198 cross sections
           and from the calculated neutron energy spectrum from a
           lithium target thick enough to stop the proton beam,
           the total flux of neutrons in the energy range
           30-1200 keV was calculated.
MONIT-REF  (,K.K.Harris+,J,BAP,7,553,1962)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The beta particles from H4 or Li4 decay would be
           detected, if any such decay occurred, in a large
           cylindrical plastic scintillator, 25 cm in diam. by
           25 cm in length, having an axial well 5 cm in diam.
           by 15 cm in length

INC-SPECT  Fluxes of thermal neutrons produced by moderation in
           the plastic scintillator were measured using bare and
           cadmium-covered gold foils.
COMMENT    Value given is for the half-life range .003-100 sec.
           For a half-life range of 100-100,000 sec, upper limit
            is 1 microbarn.
