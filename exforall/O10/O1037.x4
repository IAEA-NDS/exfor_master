SAMPLE     The 91.5% enriched Cd-110 target, thickness 200-mg,
           was used.
COMMENT    *By authors. Positron-emitting In-110-m  was produced
           in a two-step process. Irradiation of highly enriched
           Cd-110 with He-3 particles over an energy range of
           36-25-MeV led to the formation of Sn-110, which after
           its fast radiochemical separation from the target
           material was used to prepared a Sn-110-->In-110-m
           generator.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (NAICR) Volatilization kinetics were measured on-line
           at the original place of the target materials using
           a NaI detector.
           (GELI) The distribution of the volatilized products
           along the inner surface of the quartz tube was measured
           gamma-spectrometrically using Ge(Li) detectors.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich compact cyclotron CV-28.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Beam currents of 1-5 mua.
           (CHSEP) Chemical separation mainly consists of an
           initial thermochromatographic step, providing almost
            100% separation of Sn-110 within 20-min.
