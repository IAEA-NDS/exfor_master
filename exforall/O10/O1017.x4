TITLE      Production of the positron emitter Mn-51 via the
           Cr-50(d,N) reaction-targetry and separation of no-
           carrier-added radiomanganese.

COMMENT    -By authors. Several separation techniques such as ion
           exchange chromatography, solid phase extraction, liquid
           liquid extraction and co-precipitation have been
           investigated to separate no-carrier-added
           radiomanganese from the bulk target chromium. For
           production purposes, a sandwiched pellet of the
           chemical composition Al(4)Cr-50-Cl(3) was developed as
           a new target.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The compact cyclotron CV-28.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (CHSEP)
           (ACTIV) A beam current of 3-mua was applied for 1-hr.
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched Cr-50 in metallic form was
           used, the isotopic composition of was-
           Cr-50 -94.7+-0.4%,
           Cr-52 -4.84%,
           Cr-53 -0.37%,
           Cr-54 -0.09%.
           The chemical impurities (in ppm)
           supplier, were- Ti  less 30, Mn  less 10, Fe less 250,
           Ni less 40, Cu - 80, Al -780, Si -200 and Ca -150.
           The Al(4)Cr-50Cl(3) pellet was made by pressing a
           mixture of 70-mg Cr-50Cl(3) and 50-mg Al powder between
           two polyethylene foils in a pellet press. The pellet
           thus contained 20-mg of Cr-50.
