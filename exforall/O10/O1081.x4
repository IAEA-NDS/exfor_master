ADD-RES    (COMP)
           The distorted wave Born approximation calculations.
           He-3 energy spectra were analyzed.
SAMPLE     A 100-mm diameter gas cell, filled with helium, more
            99.995% purity, to a nominal absolute pressure of 1.5
           bar at room temperature, was bombarded with alpha-
           particles.
           The effective target length and solid angle were
           defined by means of a double-aperture collimator system
           with 3-mm thick tantalum front and rear slits. The
           slits were placed 186 and 526-mm, respectively, from
           the center of the target. The rather large distance
           from the gas cell and large separation between slits
           ensured that measurements could be performed down to
           very forward angles with small effective target and
           good angular resolution. At forward angles smaller than
            26-degree, 2.8 mm wide slits were used, while 4.5-mm
            wide slits were employed at larger angles in order to
           increase the count rate. The effective target length
           varied between 8 and 28-mm, i.e., Weel distant from the
            6-mum thick HAVAR entrance and exit windows of the gas
           cell.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Different detector telescopes were used in the
            158- and 200-MeV measurements. For the 158-MeV runs
           the telescope consisted of a 150-mum thick Si surface
           barrier delta-E detector, followed by two Si-Li
           detectors of 5-mm nominal thickness each, followed by a
            1-mm thick Si surface-barrier veto detector.
           For the 200-MeV runs the front delta-E element was
           replaced with a 2-mm thick Si surface-barrier detector.
           The standard delta-E-E technique was used for particle
           identification.
