SAMPLE     The uranium targets consist of U-F4 deposited on a thin
           carbon foil of 30 microgramm/cm**2 by thermal
           evaporation out of a tantalum crucible.  The target
           thickness was 800 microgramm/cm**2 which is equivalent
           to a 600 microgramm/cm**2 of pure U target.  The
           uncertainty of the thickness is estimated to be 10% and
           the inhomogeneity of the target is 3%.

           The monitor reactions were used for high intensities.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,SIBAR) The setup provides an energy
           measurement of particles with a large angular coverage.
           It is composed of two open cubes placed on each side of
           the target.  The faces perpendicular to the beam have
           been removed to let the beam pass through.  Each face
           is composed of a set of four silicon detectors with a
           surface of 50 X 50 mm**2 and a thickness of 500
           micrometer.  The mechanics and the electronics have
           been constructed with special care in order to reduce
           the dead zones.  The angular coverage is of the order
           of 70% of 4pi.  The measurement of two particles
           emitted back to back has been optimized by a symmetric
           design with respect to the target point.  The high
           granularity of 32 detectors allows the measurement of
           three particles in coincidence with a low pileup
           probability.  Coincidence of two detectors provides the
           major trigger for the acquisition.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) The experiment was performed at
            Cyclone, the Radioactive Nuclear Beam  facility
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (SITA) See SAMPLE
           (BCINT) The beam intensity was measured during the
           experiment by a NE102 plastic scintillator placed at 0
           degree for beam intensities less than 7.E+05 pps.
           (EDEG) Intermediate energies have been obtained using
           mylar absorbers of thicknesses 25 and 50 micrometers.

           (20030710U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  The statistical uncertainties are not directly
           correlated to the total number of fissions since the
           cross sections have been determined on the basis of the
           number of fissions in each back-to-back pair of
           detectors and taking into account their measured
           efficiency.
           (ERR-1) The systematic uncertainty due to the target
           thickness.
           (ERR-2) The systematic uncertainty due to the
           efficiency of detection.
           The systematic uncertainties could affect only the
           global normalization but not the relative cross
           sections since all the measurements have been performed
           under similar conditions
COMMENT    - By authors.  The data lead us to conclude that at the
           barrier no hindrance due to the breakup of the nucleus
           is observed, and below the barrier there is a large
           enhancement of the fusion probability for the 6-He
           nucleus with respect to the stable 4-He nucleus.
