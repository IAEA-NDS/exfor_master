DETECTOR   (SCIN) A 0.9mm thick plastic scintillator (Ne110) for
           detecting beta-particles.
           A Ge detector with an active area of 10 cm**2 and by a
           thickness of 10-mm and the coaxial Ge detector with
            20% relative efficiency.
COMMENT    -By authors. Independent yields for Sn-127-134 and
           Sb-130-134 isotopes in units atoms/s was measured
           at the focal point of the IGISOL separator.
           In both cases the beam intensity was kept as close to
            3 mua as possible. Small intensity fluctuations and
           correspondingly the yields were corrected by
           normalizing the production rate at every mass by the
           production rate of Rh-112.

DETECTOR   (LONGC) The neutron long-counter consisted of 42 3-He
           ionization chamber tubes, which were arranged tn two
           concentring rings in a polyethylene block.

COMMENT    -By authors. Available experimental values are
           normalized to these predictions by setting the sum of
           the corresponding theoretical cross sections.The
           separation efficiencies for different isotopes of a
           given element are assumed to be equal. One can see that
           the neutron-rich slopes of experimental isotopes
           distributions are described quite well. Although, no
           experimentally observed odd-even fluctuations are
           reproduced.
