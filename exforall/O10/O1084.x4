           (J,JPJ,66,73,1997) Preliminary results for yield of
           the D(d,p)T reaction occurring in a thick Ti target and
           details of experiment.
COMMENT    -By authors. In this experiment, the difficulty is to
           determine the number of target deuterons in the D+D
           reaction. Since, the deuterons are accumulated in metal
           plate during the deuteron bombardment, the number of
           target deuterons changes.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) A del'ta E-E counter telescope
           consisting of 50-mum and 200-mum thick Si-surface
           barrier detector was employed.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2JPNTOH) High-current ion beam generator
METHOD     (SITA,EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Errors associated with the data in the figure
           include only statistical ones, i.e. Statistics  of  the
           yield at each bombarding energy and those at 6.45-KeV
           for the normalization runs.
CORRECTION The data are corrected for the ratio of the detector
           solid angle in C.M. and laboratory frames.

REACTION   (1-H-2(D,P)1-H-3,,MLT,,TT/REL)  Figure 2.
           The measured thick target yields per the dose of the
           beam were normalized to the yield at E(d) =6.45 KeV.
SAMPLE     Target was thick plate of Yb-10mm*10mm*1mm. In Yb
           plate a deuteron beam was implanted at E(d) =6.45 keV
           for a long time until proton yield became almost
           constant. A liquid nitrogen trap was set at the
           scattering chamber and no carbon build-up on the target
           was observed.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The thick target yield of the reaction in Ti
           metal with the calculated value for bare cross  section
           is presented.
           The electron screening potential for the target is
           obtained as 81 +/- 10 eV.  Systematical errors of the
           deduced screening potential in Yb are considered to be
           +25/-35 eV, due to the uncertainty of the stopping
           power and +13-eV due to uncertainty of the number of
           the deuterons in metal during the bombardment.
