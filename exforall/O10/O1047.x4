           The beam intensity was monitored continuously.
DETECTOR   (TELES,MCPLT,MCPLT,SIBAR) The residues and remaining
           beam-like particles passed through a multi channel
           plate detector before their energy was measured with  a
           silicon surface - barrier detector.
           (SIBAR) Four detectors detected  Rutherford scattering
           from the target to monitor beam intensity.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Coupled-channels calculations.
           Deduced representations of barrier distribution.
           Subbarrier fusion.

SAMPLE     (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.9936) Zr-90, thickness of 50 mug/cm**2,
           evaporated on 15 mug/cm**2 carbon backing.
           Isotopic composition of the Zr-90 target was
           99.36% Zr-90, 0.30% Zr-91, 0.17% Zr-92, 0.12% Zr-94 and
           0.04% Zr-96.
COMMENT    *By authors. For each energy the number of evaporation
           residue events was normalized to the Rutherford
           scattering detected by the monitor detectors. Using the
           solid angles, the 0-degree to total ratios and the
           transmission factor measured, these evaporation residue
           yields were transformed into total cross-sections.
           Since fission of the compound nucleus can be neglected
           for both systems, the measured cross-sections were
           taken as fusion cross sections.
STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl. 1 of NP/A,633,421,1998
CORRECTION The energies have been corrected for the energy loss
           in the target foil.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical uncertainties of the
           cross-sections are of the order of 1%.
           (ERR-SYS) The  systematic uncertainty of the excitation
           functions is approximately +-7% with the transmission
           of the electrostatic deflector being the major
           contribution.
