TITLE      Optimization of irradiation parameters for Ga-67
           production from Zn-nat(p,xn) nuclear reactions.

SAMPLE     Two series of zinc targets, thicknesses 179 and 4.13
           mg/cm**2, isotopic composition:
           Zn-64 48.9%, Zn-66 27.8%, Zn-67 41%, Zn-68 18.6%,
           Zn-70 0.6%, were used.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Evaluations were made both of target thickness
           and proton energy in order to optimize the Ga-67
           production rate at the same time minimizing
           contamination by the Ga-66.  Optimal irradiation
           conditions, depending both on the beam current
           available and on the power dissipated into the target
           were determined.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A coaxial Ge(Li) detector.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ITYMIL) The AVF cyclotron of Milan University.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,1.5) Uncertainty in detector efficiency.
