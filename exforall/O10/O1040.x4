           Co-58-m,g in neutron, proton, deuteron and alpha-

           Investigations on the Co-59(n,2n)Co-58-M reactin were
           performed in the energy range 11-13 MeV. The data are
           presented in ENTRY 22484.
           For calculating the ratios, the Sigma-m+Sigma-g values
           reported earlier were used. See REL-REF

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich compact cyclotron CV-28 .
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) In present work the activity of Co-58-m was
           determined via X-Ray spectrometry and via the activity
           of the ground state Co-58-g which was measured as a
           function of time via standard gamma-ray spectrometry.
           From an analysis of the growth and decay curve of
           Co-58-g it is possible to obtain the initial activities
           of both Co-58-m and Co-58-g.  This method was found to
           be suitable when the activity of Co-58-m was relativity
           high.
CORRECTION The count rates were corrected for random pileup losses
           as well as for gamma-ray or X-ray abundance and the
           efficiency of the detector.  Correction for coincidence
           loss was also taken into account.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The X-Ray spectrometric studies were performed
            using either Si(Li) or an intrinsic HPGe detector with
            Be window.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The major sources of errors involved were those
           associated with the measurement of the beam current and
           determination of the absolute activities of the product
           the error in the neutron flux density or beam current
           was adopted as 4-7%, the efficiencies of the gamma-
           and X-ray detectors were known within an uncertainty
           of 3-5%, the errors in the calculation of the absolute
           activity were-the error of the initial count rate at
           the end of the irradiation was determined by the least-
           squares-fitting procedure and it was about 0.5-25%,
           the error in the decay data used was less 1% and that
           in the coincidence losses less 0.5%, the error in the
           target atoms/cm**2 was 0.5-1.5%, the total error in
           each cross section was obtained by combining the
           individual errors in quadrature.
