HISTORY    (20021007C)
           (20040304U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Two U-238 targets of 15 mg/cm**2 were installed in a
           gas cell.
ADD-RES    (COMP). Shell-model calculation.
           (DECAY,STRUC) Two B-decaying states are observed in
           Co-70 with half-lives of 0.12(3) and 0.50(18) sec.
           From the B-decay of these states in Co-66, 68, 70 many
           new excited levels are established in Ni-66, Ni-68  and
           Ni-70.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two high-purity germanium detectors, 70% and 75%
           relative efficiency and three Delta-E detectors
           arranged in a compact configuration.
FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGBLG) An ion-guide laser ion source has been
           developed at the Leuven isotope separator on-line.

REL-REF    (R,O0923001,S.FRANCHOO+,J,PRL,81,3100,1998) Data from
           this paper for Ni-68-Ni-74 was reported in table I and
           on fig.1.
FLAG       (1.).The yields for Ni-68 - Ni-71 from O0923.
           (2.).The early yields for Co-isotopes.
           (3.).Improved yields for Ni and Co isotopes.
COMMENT    -By authors:
           1.  The half-life of Co-66 is measured to be 0.18(1)
           sec.  The half-life of the Co-68 isomers are 1.6 and
           0.23 sec which means that only the short-living isotope
           could substantially decay during transport.  Two
           B-decaying states are observed in Co-70 with half-
           lives of 0.12(3) and 0.50(18) sec.
           2. Early experiments to measure Ni-68-Ni-74 were also
           performed with the liglis-lisol setup with similar
           detector configurations.  See O0923.
           3.  Production rates (atoms/muc) of neutron- rich
           isotopes produced in the 30-MeV proton induced  fission
           of U-238 were calculated by authors in units- mb, using
           scaling factor of 0.01 mb*muc/atom for the Co, Ni.  See
           O1005002.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty is shown in table.
