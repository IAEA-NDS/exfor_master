TITLE      Thin-target excitation functions, cross-sections and
           optimised thick-target yields for Mo-nat(P,xn)Tc-94-g,
           Tc-95-m, Tc-95-g, Tc-96-m+g nuclear reactions induced
           by proton from threshold up to 44-MeV. No carrier
           added radiochemical separation and quality control.

ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Thick-target yield values were calculated and
           optimised, by numerical fitting and integration of the
           measured excitation functions.

STATUS     (TABLE)
COMMENT    -By authors. Average proton energy-mean value between
           the incident beam energy and the outgoing beam energy,
           calculated range and stopping-power tables by
           williamson that differ because of the small beam
           energy loss in target.
