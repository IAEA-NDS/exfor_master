TITLE      Measurements and nuclear model calculations on proton-
           induced reactions on Rh-103 up to 40-MeV-evaluation of
           the excitation function of the Rh-103(P,N)Pd-103
           reaction relevant to the production of the therapeutic
           radionuclide Pd-103.

SAMPLE     High-purity thin rhodium foils,
           isotopic  composition- 99.9% Rh-103, thickness 25 mum,
           were used as samples.
           In a given stack about six such foils were placed.
           Copper monitor foils were inserted in each stack to
           degrade the proton energy as well as to determine the
           incident particle energy and the beam intensity.
           All the foils used were cut from materials of
           different thickness, thereby allowing changes in the
           mean energies of the irradiated rhodium samples.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) At the compact cyclotron CV-28 and
           injector of COSY, Julich.
           The primary proton energies used were 15.8 and 19.6-MeV
           at the CV-28 and 45.1-MeV at the injector of COSY.
CORRECTION *By authors*.The count rates were corrected for random
           pile-up losses as well as for gamma-ray abundance and
           the efficiency of the detector and self-absorption in
           the foils. Correction for coincidence loss was also
           taken into account.
METHOD     (STTA) See sample
           (BCINT) Besides monitor foils, the charge collected in
           a Faraday cup was also registered and there from the
           average beam current was deduced. The two results
           generally agreed within +/- 10%.
           (ACTIV) Each stack was irradiated for 30 - 60 minutes
           (EXTB) The primary proton energies used were 15.8 and
           19.6 MeV at the CV-28 and 45.1 MeV at the injector
           of COSY.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The model calculated excitation function
           plays a ransformation role for the data. We fitted the
           measured/model calculation ratio with a rational
           function, which described the deviation of the
           measured and calculated excitation function around
           20 MeV. For the fitting the TableCurve 2D program
           of SPSS was used, taking into account in the weighting
           factor the uncertainties of the  measurement. First we
           used all available data. Then we removed those series
           of measurements which had many data out of  the 3 sigma
           limit. In the next step all other data were fitted
           and again some points outside the 3s limit were
           removed. In the third step we got the final fit
           function (see fig.4). Table 3 gives the evaluated
           cross sections with the 95% confidence limits as well
           as the calculated integral yields of 103Pd.
