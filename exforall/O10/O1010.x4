TITLE      Measurements and nuclear model calculations on proton-
           induced reactions on Rh-103 up to 40-MeV-evaluation of
           the excitation function of the Rh-103(P,N)Pd-103
           reaction relevant to the production of the therapeutic
           radionuclide Pd-103.

SAMPLE     High-purity thin rhodium foils,
           isotopic composition:
           99.9% Rh-103, thickness 25 mummeters, were used as
           samples.
           In a given stack about six such foils were placed.
           Copper monitor foils were inserted in each stack to
           degrade the proton energy as well as to determine the
           incident particle energy and the beam intensity.
           All the foils used were cut from materials of
           different thickness, thereby allowing changes in the
           mean energies of the irradiated rhodium samples.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) At the compact cyclotron CV-28 and
           injector of COSY, julich.
           The primary proton energies used were 15.8 and 19.6-MeV
           at the CV-28 and 45.1-MeV at the injector of COSY.
CORRECTION -By authors. The count rates were corrected for randow
           pile-up losses as well as for gamma-ray abundance and
           the effciency of the detector and self-absorption in
           the foils. Correction for coincidence loss was also
           taken into account.
METHOD     (STTA) See sample
           (BCINT) Besides monitor foils, the charge collected in
           a Faraday cup was also registred and there from the
           average beam current was deduced. The two results
           generally agreed within +/- 10%.
           (ACTIV) Each stack was irradiated for 30 - 60 minutes
           (EXTB) The primary proton energies used were 15.8 and
           19.6 MeV at the CV-28 and 45.1 MeV at the injector
           of COSY.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The major sources of errors involved were those
           associated with the measurement of the beam current and
           determination of the absolute activities of the
           product.  The error in the excitation function of an
           individual monitor reaction was taken as 6-10%.
           The beam current was determined by a fitting  procedure
           using two monitor reactions.  Therefore,the error in
           the beam current was adopted as 4-7%, assuming that no
           correlation existed in the data of the different
           authors.
           The efficiencies of the x-ray and gamma-ray detectors
           were known within an uncertainty of 3-5%.  The
           uncertainties in the calculation of the absolute
           activity were:
           1.  The uncertainty in the count rate at the end of the
           irradiation was determined by the last squares fitting
           procedure and it was about 0.5-25%.
           2.  The uncertainty in the decay data used was less 1%.
           3.  The uncertainty in the coincidence losses less
           0.5%.
           4.  The uncertainty in the target atoms/cm**2 was
           0.5-1.5%.
           The total uncertainty in the each cross section was
           obtained by combining the individual uncertainties in
           quadrature.
           (ERR-1).The energy of the particle beam was measured
           before or after the irradiation and had an uncertainty
           of 0.15-MeV.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of beam particle energy on
           target foil.
