SAMPLE     Two U-238 targets, a 10 mg/cm**2 thickness are situated
           in a gas cell. The targets are tilted under an angle of
           20 degree with respect to the proton beam (3 mua).

           Comment by authors: A strong discrepancy between the
            PROFI  code and RUBCHENYA's model. Our data favor the
            PROFI model.

FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGLVN) An ion-guide laser ion source has been

COMMENT    -By authors. The production rates of Co-67-70 and
            Ni-68-74 isotopes are known from earlier studies at
            LISOL .  Recently, yields were deduced for the
            Co-65-66, Cu-70-76 isotopes, produced with resonant
           laser ionization and Ga-74-81 without laser ionization,
           since a significant fraction of the gallium isotopes
           survives the neutralization process.  This could be
           explained by the fact that gallium atoms have a lower
           ionization  potential than nickel (6.0 eV (Ga) vs. 7.6
           eV (Ni)), thus having a higher probability to be
           ionized by plasma or by the collisions with impurity
           molecules or metastable argon atoms.
           In order to verify the consistency of our results the
           yields of some selected isotopes of Co and Ni were
           compared with the previously measured data. The results
           were consistent within a factor of two, showing the
           stability and reproducibility of our laser ion source.

           The total production rates - thus, the sum of the rates
           of the two isomers, where applicable, are given.

COMMENT    -By authors. Production rates (atoms/micro-coulomb) of
           neutron - rich isotopes produced in the 30-MeV proton
           induced fission of U-238 were calculated by authors in
           units - mb, using scaling factor of 0.01
           mb*micro-coulomb/atom for the Co, Ni and Cu. The
           gallium yields were obtained without laser ionization
           and were multiplied by 0.0182 mb*micro-coulomb/atom.
           Due to the low-production rates of the Co-65-66
           isotopes, these rates were deduced from the number of
           detected beta-particles.  Thus, one can deduce the
           production rate by subtracting the background
           beta-counting rate (lasers off) from the on-resonance
           beta-counting rate and by corrected for the cumulative
           daughter activity.
           The production rates of the gallium-isotopes were
           deduced from the number of detected gamma-rays as well
           as beta-particles.  After correction for the daughter
           activity, isobaric and doubly charged isotope
           contamination, both methods gave the same results
           within the experimental accuracy.
           The production rates of the Cu-isotopes were
           determined by gamma-counting only.
