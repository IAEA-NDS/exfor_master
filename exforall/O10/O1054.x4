SAMPLE     The target material was 99.84% enriched in Sr-88,
           this was produced by evaporating Sr-88(NO3)2 powder on
           a 0.4-mm thick tantalum backing. The amount of Sr-88 in
           the target was determined by means of an XRF analysis
           before all measurements. It was also checked at the end
           of the Stuttgart measurements as well as at the end of
           the Athens runs. The thickness of Sr-88 in the target
           before any measurement was 168+-7-mug/cm**2 and the
           material loss was found to be less than 3%. This
           thickness corresponds approximately 12 and 8-KeV at
           beam energies of 2 and 4-MeV,  respectively. These
           values were derived using the SRIM code and assuming
           that the target consists of Sr-88 only. However,
           the thickness of the target is defined by its
           stoichiometry that was determined at the end of the
           measurements by performing a nuclear reaction analysis.
           The measurements were necessary to determine correctly
           the proton stopping powers.  The measurements were
           performed using a single-charged H2 beam of 1.1-MeV
           energy that was delivered by the tandem accelerator
           of Athens.
           The final amount of Sr-88 in the target, according to
           the XRF analyses, did not differ practically from that
           in the beginning of the measurements allows to
           calculate the maximum total target thickness by varying
           the ratio of the amount of the Sr-88(NO3)2 to the
            Sr-88(OH)2 phase. The maximum thickness obtained this
           way is 405 mug/cm**2, that corresponds to 44 and 28-KeV
           at 2 and 4-MeV, respectively. This thickness is derived
           if the target is comprised of the Sr-88(NO3)2 phase
           only. Even in such an extreme case the uncertainty
           entering the determination of the corresponding
           effective energies is less than 0.5%.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) For cross section measurements at E(P) < 3.5
           MeV (Stuttgart) four large volume HPGE  detectors, all
           shielded with BGO crystal for Compton background
           suppression.
           In the cross section measurements carried out in
            Athens one HPGE detector without any BGO shields was
           used.
METHOD     (BCINT) The current of the proton beam was about 10-muA
           at measurements carried out in Stuttgart and approx.
            1.3-muA at measurements carried out in Athens.
COMMENT    *By authors. In experimental setup used in Stuttgart
           the target was placed at 90-degree to the beam axis.
           Its backing was cooled directly with water during the
           whole experiments. The detector were placed on a
           rotating table at distances between 10 and 20-cm front
           the target.
           In  experimental setup used in Athens the target was
           placed at 20-degree with respect to the beam axis.
           The distance between the target-center and the
           detector-front was 12-cm. The detector was placed
           on a goniometrical table that could rotate around the
           target with an accuracy better than 1-degree. In order
           to measure gamma angular distributions at each beam
           energy, gamma-singles spectra were taken at six angles
           with the respect to the beam. The target backing was
           cooled with air during all measurements.
           As in case of the measurements in Stuttgart, background
           spectra were also measured, in order to investigate
           possible yield contributions from the backing material.
           In both the Stuttgart and Athens experiments, the
           absolute efficiency data were checked for uncertainties
           due to coincident summing.
