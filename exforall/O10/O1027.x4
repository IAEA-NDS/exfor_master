HISTORY    (20030210C)
           (20030221A) Isomeric cross section ratios are added.
           (20030221U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The thin samples of SrCO/3 were used.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) From the measured cross sections integral
           yields of Y-88, Y-87-m and Y-87-g were calculated.
           The isomeric cross section ratio for the pair Y-87-m/g
           was determined as a function of incident proton energy
           and the results are discussed in terms of the spins of
           the two isomeric states involved.
           Medium scale production of both Y-86 and Y-88 has been
           carried out more than 15 times each using the (P,N)
           reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainties in the cross section
           values were obtained by taking the square root of the
           sum of the squares of individual uncertainties.  The
           individual uncertainties in % considered were as
           follows-
           -target thickness - i.e Number of nuclei in the target
           approx. 2%.
           -Inhomogenety in target thickness approx. 5%.
           -Bombarding beam intensity approx. 10%.
           -Detector efficiency and sample-detector geometry
           approx. 5%.
           -Peak area analysis approx. 5%.
           For the  SR-nat(P,XN) reactions investigated the
           typical overall uncertainty was 13%.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty has been calculated by authors
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich compact cyclotron CV-28 .
           (CYCLO,2SWTPSI) The PSI injector.

           The effective energy of proton beam was determined via
           a ratio of monitor reactions.
MONIT-REF  (,F.TARKANYI+,R,IAEA-1211,2001)
METHOD     (ACTIV) At Julich the irradiation time in each case was
           60-min. At the PSI the irradiation time was 7.7 hour.
           (STTA) Several stacks, each consisting of about
           5 samples and a few monitor foils, were irradiated at
           the Julich. One stack was irradiated at the PSI.
           (EXTB) At the Julich compact cyclotron at a beam
           current of about 100-nanoampere.  At the PSI at a beam
           current of 40-nanoampere.
           (EDEG)  PSI Injector beam was degraded in the stack so
           that the calculated energy on the first sample amounted
           to 25.6 MeV.

COMMENT    -By authors. Our measurements agree with the results of
            P0033 and B0069 up to 15-MeV and provide a more
           detailed data set around the maximum of the excitation
           function.
           Our values also agree with A0510 data, except around
           the maximum and above 22-MeV where the latter are too
           high.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The Y-87 production cross section
           includes both Y-87m and Y-87g since the measurement was
           done after almost complete decay of Y-87m.
