TITLE      Cross section data for the production of the positron
           emitting niobium isotope Nb-90 via the Zr-90(P,N)
           reaction.

REL-REF    (R,B0124001,S.M.QAIM,J,ARI,28,947,1977) Details of
           experiments.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich compact cyclotron CV-28.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV) Each stack was irradiated for 30 minutes at a
           beam current of 100 nano-ampere.
           (BCINT) The proton beam current was measured directly
           using a  Faraday  cup as well as indirectly via the
           Cu-63(P,N)Zn-63 reaction.  At low intensity the proton
           flux measured via the two techniques differed
           considerably.  The authors therefore put more reliance
           on the monitor reaction.
           (GSPEC) With respect to cross section measurements,
           counting was performed only over two days after each
           irradiation, and attention was paid exclusively to the
           short-lived niobium isotopes 90-Nb, 89-Nb and 89-m-Nb.
           Apart from the activity of the mentioned isotopes the
           activity of the monitor reaction products 62-Zn and
           63-Zn was also determined.
SAMPLE     In the case of natural Zr samples for cross section
           measurements were prepared by cutting pieces of 13-mm
           diameter out of a 10-mum thick metal foil.
           For thick target yield measurements discs of 250-mm
           thickness were cut out of a large sized metal foil.
           A homogeneous and mechanically stable Zr-90-O(2)
           samples of thickness in the order of 5-6 mg/cm**2 was
           thus obtained on the surface of the copper backing
           foil. To avoid contamination, the surface of each
           samples was covered with a 10-mum thick Al foil,
           having the same diameter of 13-mm as the Cu backing
           foil.

           The ratio of cross section (P,2N)/(P,N) was used to
           control the proton energy.

ERR-ANALYS The uncertainties due to random coincidences were kept
           small by choosing a sample to detector distance such
           that the dead time was less 7%. Since the distance
           between the sample and the detector was always more 10-
           cm, the correction for real coincidence losses was
           negligible. The overall uncertainty in each cross
           section was obtained by taking the square root of the
           sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties,
           which were considered to be as follows-
           -target mass-approx. 2%.
           -Inhomogeneity in target thickness-5%-10%.
           -Statistical errors-2-10%, for energy point near the
           threshold up to 20%.
           -Detector efficiency and sample-detector geometry
           approx. 6%.
           -Decay data errors less 3%.
           -Bombarding proton beam intensity 8-10%.
           For the ZR-90(P,N) reaction the overall error in cross
           section amounts to 15 to 20%. The primary proton energy
           had an error of +-0.2-MeV. The proton energy
           degradation in each stack foil or Zr-90-O(2) sample
           was calculated and its half-value was combined with the
           uncertainty of the primary energy. The uncertainty in
           the effective energy of the front foil was estimated to
           be 0.3-MeV. Due to propagation of error it increased
           to 0.7-MeV in the sixth foil of a stack.
