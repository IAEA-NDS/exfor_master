COMMENT    - By authors. The excitation function for the reaction
            U-238(d,2n)Np-238 determined by measuring the Pu-238
           decay product, but the activities were very low.
SAMPLE     Uranium foils, thickness 50-mg/cm**2, were intercalated
           with aluminium degraders and copper foils used as beam
           monitors. Enrichments-93% U-235 and 99.9% U-238.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For monitor activity
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2UK HAR) The Harwell's Variable Cyclotron .    O
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV) The time of irradiation was 8-hours with a beam
           current of 2-muA for U-235 and 6.6-hours with 7-muA for
           U-238.
           (CHSEP)
           (GSPEC) After the irradiation, the samples were left
           for cooling for three months to allow the decay of most
           of the fission products and of the Np-234, which emits
           the same X-rays as Np-235.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).Counting errors were always better than 10%,
           except for Pu-238.
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is reported by authors
           without any analysis.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table
           without any analysis.
