           particle impact of natural titanium.

SAMPLE     A natural titanium plate of 99.9% purity was rolled
           down to foil with thickness from 1 to 2 mg/cm**2. Each
           titanium foil was covered by both of aluminium foils
           with 1.2 and 1.5 mg/cm**2 thickness to prevent the loss
           of activity owing to atom recoil. The aluminium foils
           were a purity of 99.9%. Target thickness was determined
           in all case by weight. The inhomogeneity of the
           titanium foil thickness was less than 3%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The exciton model.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRSIU) The 1.2-m cyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (BCINT)
           (EXTB) The beam intensity was kept at about 300
           nano-ampere.
           (ACTIV) Total charge amounted to 2700 micro-curie
           (GSPEC) About 15 hours after the stop of irradiation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error in the cross section data was
           determined by summing up in quadrature all the
           individual errors.  The main sources of uncertainties:
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of target inhomogeneity
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of detector efficiency.
           (ERR-3) The uncertainty of beam current integrator.
           (ERR-S,0.8,3.8) The statistical errors of photopeak
                  counting, which are from 0.8 to 3.8%.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in the projectile energy
           contains two factors:
            1.  The energy spread of the inherent beam,
            2.  The energy loss inside those foils themselves.
