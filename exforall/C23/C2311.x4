TITLE      Fission of Ra226 by 11-MeV Protons
AUTHOR     (R.C.Jensen,A.W.Fairhall)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,109,942,1958)
           #doi:10.1103/PhysRev.109.942
INSTITUTE  (1USAWAU)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The University of Washington 60-inch
           cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE The proton flux is high (10**14 protons/cm2 sec).
SAMPLE     Because of the thickness of the radium deposit
            (about 0.5 mg/cm2) and the overlapping gold, the
           fission fragments emitted at oblique angles to the
           foil normal could not escape from the target.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After bombardment the catcher foil was
           dissolved in an acid or basic solution containing
           carrier amounts, usually 10 mg, of the fission
           product elements to be separated. The type of solvent
           used depended on the elements to be separated. Each
           sample was counted in one of a set of four end-window
           G-M counters with nearly identical shelf assemblies.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were plotted and analyzed in
           the usual way, and saturation counting rates were
           determined for each radioactive species.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The tabulated errors are the standard
           deviations of separate measurements.
