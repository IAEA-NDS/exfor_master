           (N,,C.M.Lederer+,B,LEDERER-7,,,1978) Decay properties
           of the Sc nuclides.
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL,1USACAR)
FACILITY   (MESON,1USALAS) The Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) After irradiations, radiochemical
           separations, developed from standard precipitation,
           solvent extraction, and ion-exchange techniques, were
           performed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty associated with each cross
           section value represents the total experimental
           uncertainty calculated from the associated systematic
           and random uncertainties. The systematic
           uncertainties considered were the counter
           efficiencies, decay schemes, monitor cross section
           value, minor target isotopic impurity corrections,
           and summing corrections. The sources of random
           uncertainty were counting statistics, decay curve
           analyses, chemical yield determinations, timing, and
           target misalignment.

SAMPLE     Natural Y targets were 25 microm metal foil, 99.999%
           pure. The absolute yield targets consisted of a stack
           of two 25 microm Al foils serving as the monitor and
           catcher, the target pellet or foil, and a final 25
           microm Al catcher foil. The target stacks were
           carefully aligned and sealed in a 100 microm Al
           guarding envelope.
