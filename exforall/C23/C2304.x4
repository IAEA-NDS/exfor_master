FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 60-inch cyclotron of the
           University of California.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The gamma-ray spectrum was investigated
           by use of a 100-channel pulse-height analyzer
           together with a thallium-activated sodium iodide
           crystal. The thin-target cross sections were deduced.

SAMPLE     The target material was reagent-grade (99.9+%) NaCl
           crystals which had been ground into a powder. The
           powder was placed in an aluminum holder and covered
           with a piece of 0.001-inch aluminum foil.
