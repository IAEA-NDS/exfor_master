DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The Geiger tube was 1.5 inches i.d. and had a
           3 mil tungsten wire exposed for 3 inches.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) The bombardment of a stack of
           foils was made in the beam defining slit system of
           the Washington University cyclotron. The deuteron
           beam at the normal target position passed through a
           narrow vertical slit and down an evacuated tube. The
           target foils were one foot beyond this slit. The
           foils were mounted at the rear of a Faraday cage
           which could be moved in and out of the deuteron beam
           by means of a support rod through a Wilson seal. The
           activities, other than the 34-hour Br82, produced by
           bombardment of selenium with low energy deuterons are
           short-lived compared to the 34-hour activity. The
           irradiated sodium or potassium bromide deposits were
           dissolved in water and the solution acidified with
           nitric acid and boiled to remove krypton activities.
           Silver bromide was then precipitated, digested,
           filtered onto tared filter paper, dried, and weighed
           for the chemical yield determination. The sample was
           then mounted on cardboard under half-mil aluminum and
           3 mg/cm2 Cellophane, and counted in the same geometry
           as the selenium foils.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,20.,30.) The relative values of the cross
           sections are believed to be reliable to 5 or 10
           percent. The uncertainty in the absolute values may
           be as large as 20 or 30 percent because of
           uncertainties in the absolute beta-counting
           calibration.

REACTION   (35-BR-81(D,P)35-BR-82,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Sodium bromide and potassium bromide deposits for the
           d,p reaction on bromine were prepared individually by
           evaporation of the salts onto half-mil aluminum in a
           bell-jar vacuum system. The area of a deposit was
           defined by a masking foil of aluminum. The aluminum
           collection foils were weighed before and after
           evaporation and the weight of salt (~1 mg/cm2)
           determined by difference.
METHOD     Cross section was obtained from two independent runs
           in which the beam current was measured.

SAMPLE     Selenium deposits of approximately ~1 mg/cm2
           thickness were prepared by vacuum distillation of
           elemental selenium onto aluminum foils. The aluminum
           foils were about 3.6 mg/cm2 thick, the thickness of
           each foil being determined by weighing prior to the
           deposition of the selenium.
METHOD     Absolute cross section measurement.
