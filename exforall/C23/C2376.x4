TITLE      Comparison of Reactions of Copper-63 Compound Nuclei
           Performed by Alpha-Particle, Proton, and Carbon-Ion
           Bombardments

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,STTA) Radiochemical techniques were
           employed to separate, identify, and measure the Cu61,
           Co57, Co58, and Co61 activities produced in the three
           series of reaction studied. The radioactive species
           were identified by comparing their observed half
           lives with the literature values and their gamma-ray
           spectra with standards.

           inch cyclotron.
           (CYCLO,1USABRK) One irradiation was performed in the
           internal beam of the Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron to
           extend the alpha-particle excitation functions to an
           energy of 48 MeV.
SAMPLE     The targets were prepared by electrodeposition of
           spectroscopically pure cobalt onto one-half mil gold
           foils from a cobalt-ethylene-diamine solution. The
           targets varied from 0.5 to 2 mg/cm2 in thickness, and
           each target was uniform to +-2%.

           (28-NI-64,ENR=0.002) The 97.8%, enriched Ni62 was
           supplied by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The
           thickness of the nickel deposit was determined as for
           the cobalt targets and varied from 1 to 5 mg/cm2 with
           a uniformity of approximately +-5% for individual
           targets.
