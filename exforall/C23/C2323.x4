TITLE      Recoil Ranges of Products from Reactions of Cu65 with
           11-33-MeV He3 Ions

INSTITUTE  (1USAPUR)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) The 60-in. cyclotron at Argonne
           national laboratory.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted in most cases of
           self-supporting foils of highly enriched copper-65,
           4-6 mg/cm2 in thickness. In some instances foils of
           natural isotopic composition (1.8 mg/cm2 thick) were
           also employed.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The activity measurements were performed
           with scintillation and gamma-gamma coincidence
           spectrometers.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After bombardment, copper and gallium
           were radiochemically separated from the various
           samples.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated experimental error of 15-20%
           includes the uncertainties in the disintegration rate
           and chemical-yield determinations as well as the
           effect of nonuniformity in the target thickness.
