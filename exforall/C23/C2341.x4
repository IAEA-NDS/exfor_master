FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USANAL) The Fermi National Accelerator
           Laboratory (Fermilab).
SAMPLE     The targets were circular disks of the pilot B
           plastic scintillator of thickness 0.310 g cm-2 and
           containing 91.55% carbon by weight.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) 7.6x7.6-cm NaI scintillator, plastic
           scintillator target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) After the beam was turned off the target was
           transported to the Nuclear Counting Laboratory, about
           5 km from the irradiation station. Two methods of
           counting were used: internal scintillation counting
           and annihilation radiation counting in an NaI well
           counter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error listed is made up of the
           standard deviation of the end of bombardment count
           rate (given by the least-squares analysis program),
           the uncertainty in absolute counting efficiency, and
           the estimated error in the correction for varying
           beam intensity in the case of those runs in which the
           variation was large.
