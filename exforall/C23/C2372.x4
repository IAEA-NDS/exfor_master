FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU) Experiment was performed at the
           Indiana University Cyclotron Facility.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were momentum analyzed
           by the K600 high- resolution magnetic spectrometer.
           (SCIN) Two plastic scintillators provided start
           signal for time measurements in the wire chambers.
           (MWDC) Position along the spectrometer focal plane
           was measured by a pair of vertical drift wire
           chambers. Distances perpendicular to the spectrometer
           bend plane were measured by a set of horizontal drift
           chambers arranged in pairs.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for dead time and for the
           inefficiencies in track reconstruction in the wire
           chambers
