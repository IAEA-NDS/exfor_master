TITLE      Spallation-Fission Competition in Heavy-Element

DETECTOR   (PROPC)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) For the thorium foil bombardments the
           large amounts of activity produced allowed separate
           aliquots of the dissolved target to be used for the
           various fractions analyzed. For the thorium
           bombardments the protactinium fraction was purified
           by extraction with diisopropyl ketone (DIPK) and
           elution on an anion-exchange column. The uranium
           fraction was purified by an anion-exchange-column
           elution. For the U233 bombardments the chemical
           separation of the neptunium fraction was described by
           Vandenbosch. The protactinium fraction was separated
           from the neptunium by carrying neptunium (IV)
           fluoride on LaF3. The counting rates of
           alpha-particle-emitting spallation products were
           measured by use of a multichannel alpha-pulse-height
           analyzer. The counting rates of spallation products
           which decay by orbital electron capture were
           determined with a methane-flow windowless
           proportional counter.

SAMPLE     A few of the thorium targets were thin uniform deposits
            (~500 microg/cm2) of the hydrated thorium or uranium
           oxide electrodeposited on aluminum. The amount of
           Th232 was determined by alpha counting of the
           resulting thin deposits.

           spallation cross sections do not include
           uncertainties in the counting efficiencies used.

           or long-lived).
SAMPLE     A few of the thorium targets were thin uniform deposits
            (~500 microg/cm2) of the hydrated thorium or uranium
           oxide electrodeposited on aluminum. The amount of

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of fission errors are estimated.

           daughters of the Th232.

SAMPLE     A few of the thorium targets were thin uniform deposits
            (~500 microg/cm2) of the hydrated thorium or uranium
           oxide electrodeposited on aluminum. The amount of
           Th232 was determined by alpha counting of the
           resulting thin deposits.
ANALYSIS   Most of the values for the chain yields are identical
           to those for the cumulative yields of the nuclide
           given in the other subentry, except that (some) cross
           sections were increased by "a small amount" to account
           for fission products of the same mass chain not
           included experimentally.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits fission errors are estimated.
FLAG       (1.) Contribution from Cd115m estimated.
           (3.) The cross section for formation of the daughter
           was measured and found negligible.
           (4.) Isotopic-exchange difficulties which make
           ruthenium cross sections unreliable.
CORRECTION For thorium, corrections were applied to account for
           the contribution from alpha particle-emitting
           daughters of the Th232.
