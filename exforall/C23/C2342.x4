TITLE      Cross Sections and Isomer Ratios for the Sc45(He3,

INSTITUTE  (1USAUAL,1USAFSU)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) The florida state university tandem
           van de graaff accelerator.
SAMPLE     The Sc45 targets were prepared by evaporating
           scandium metal (stated purity 99.9%) upon aluminum
           backings. The scandium thickness was determined by
           microbalance weighing and varied from 0.482 to 0.925
           mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) A 3x3-in. Nai(Tl) crystal scintillator,
           coupled with a 256-channel analyzer, was used for gamma
            counting. The absolute disintegration rates were
           determined using the photopeak efficiencies of heath.
           A low-efficiency high-resolution spectrum was taken
           on one sample using a Ge(Li) detector coupled with a
           1000-channel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Upon completion of the bombardment,
           each target underwent preparation for counting. The
           reaction was very clean, requiring minimum chemical
           removal of undesirable activities. The scandium
           targets and aluminum backings were dissolved in 6-m
           hydrochloric acid.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in the absolute cross sections
           for the separate states is estimated to Be about 20%.

CORRECTION Small corrections (usually negligible) for the
           unresolved 1.121-MeV photon of Ti46, decay product of
           Sc46, were made by monitoring the 0.889-MeV photon of
           Ti46.
