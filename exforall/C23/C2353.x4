FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment was carried out at the
           Argonne National Laboratory ATLAS In-Flight Facility
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene (CD2) targets of thickness
           200 mu-g/cm2 were used. Targets were placed near the
           center of the magnet (Z=0 cm).
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The measurement was carried out using the
           superconducting HELIcal Orbit Spectrometer HELIOS
           with a homogeneous magnetic field strength of 2.5 T.
           (SI) The position-sensitive Si detector (PSD)
           array placed on solenoid axis covered a range of
           -56 < Z < -21 cm upstream from the target. Outgoing
           deuterons at the forward-most center-of-mass angles
           travel in backward trajectories in the laboratory frame
           for these reactions, therefore PSD array was placed
           upstream of the target
           (SI)A Si detector to monitor deuterons scattered from
            the target was placed downstream at a distance of
           12 cm from target.
           (TELES,SI,SI) A Si telescope to identify recoiling
           nuclei (DE detector nominally 80 mu-m thick and
           E detector with thickness of 500 mu-m ) was placed
           downstream at a distance of 108 cm from target.
           (TELES,SI,SI) A zero-degree Si detector telescope to
           monitor the rate of the beam (nominally 80 mu-m
           and 500 mu-m thick), was located at Z = 113 cm,
METHOD     (EDE) was used to identify reaction products
           (COINC) A (d,p) reaction channel was identified by
            coincidence between proton and 22F
INC-SOURCE Radioactive 21F beam was produced via proton
           removal from a 22Ne primary beam at 11 MeV/u
           on a 5 mg/cm2 Be target. The 21F beam intensity was
           approximately 2-4E+4 particles per second and had a
           purity ranging from 10%-80%, the primary contaminant
           being primary beam 22Ne.
