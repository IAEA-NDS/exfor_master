           Van de Graaff accelerator.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GEMUC) 3- x 3-in. NaI crystal.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After irradiation, the targets were
           dissolved in HCl; yttrium, strontium, and barium
           carriers were added and the solution was made
           strongly basic with NaOH to remove aluminum. After
           washing, the precipitate was dissolved in a small
           amount of concentrated HNO3, strontium and barium
           carriers were again added and then precipitated as
           nitrates with fuming nitric acid. The prepared
           samples were gamma counted as soon as possible flat
           against the aluminum shield of a NaI scintillation
           crystal. After a period of ten half-lives ( 32 h),
           the samples were beta counted with a lead shielded
           calibrated Geiger-Muller counter.

SAMPLE     The rubidium targets were prepared by evaporating
           high-purity RbCl upon aluminum backings with a
           thickness of 1 mg/cm2 or less. The targets were then
           individually bombarded with 11-18-MeV alpha particles.
