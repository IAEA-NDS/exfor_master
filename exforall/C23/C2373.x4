FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at NSCL at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     Large volume gas target. Target He gas filled
           scattering chamber with diameter of 235 cm
DETECTOR   (PS) Scattering angle of reaction products was
           determined by two position sensitive (probably Si)
           detectors placed one behind the other
