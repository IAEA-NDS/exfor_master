TITLE      Test of the independence hypothesis in the decay of
           the 210Po compound nucleus

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) The irradiations were performed with
           the deflected  beams of the Argonne National
           Laboratory 152 cm cyclotron.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method was used.
           Recoiled product nuclei were collected on a catcher
           foil.The recoil catchers were prepared of very pure
           99.999% aluminium foil having a surface density of
           5 mg/cm2. Following irradiation, polonium was
           chemically separated from the target and catcher foils
           by spontaneous deposition on silver
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) detector was used for X-rays
           (GELI) Ge(Li) detector was used for gamma rays
PART-DET   (XR,G)

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,15.)  Being comprised primarily of the
                               uncertainty in target thickness.

           electrodeposition of lead to a thickness of 1 mg/cm2
           onto thin nickel foil. Stacks consisting of six
           target-catcher pairs were mounted in a target holder
           which also served as a Faraday cup for determination
           of the beam intensity.
