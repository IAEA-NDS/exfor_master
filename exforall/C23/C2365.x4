FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) The Brookhaven alternating gradient
           synchrotron (AGS).
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Chemical separations were carried out
           on all of the targets. The gamma radiations of the
           four isotopes of interest were determined with a
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector at a low geometry so that
           the loss of counting rate in the photopeak due to
           summing with coincident radiation was negligible. The
           decay of each nuclide was followed for a minimum of
           two half-lives.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were analyzed by a
           least squares computer program in order to obtain the
           activities and their standard deviations at end-of-
           bombardment time.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error estimates given for the mean
           values were obtained by root-mean-square addition of
           these individual errors and of the standard deviation
           of the mean.
           (ERR-1) Counting efficiencies.
           (ERR-2,0.7,1.5) Recoil losses.
           (ERR-3) Secondary production of 24Na.
CORRECTION Since relatively thin target foils were used in these
           experiments (65 to 97 mg/cm2), it was necessary to
           correct all measured cross sections for recoil losses.
