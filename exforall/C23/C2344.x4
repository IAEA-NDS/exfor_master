INSTITUTE  (1USANYB)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABRK) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 184-
           in. synchrocyclotron.
DETECTOR   (GELI,PROPC) 7-cm3 Ge(Li) detector in connection with
           a multichannel analyzer, end-window proportional
           counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) After bombardment the targets were
           taken to the chemistry laboratory. The chemical yield
           for each sample was determined after counting using
           atomic absorption spectroscopy. The decay rates for
           the 57Ni, 196mAu, and 196gAu were determined using a
           Ge(Li) detector. The decay rates of the 64Cu
           were determined by counting the beta radiations with
           a proportional counter.

SAMPLE     (28-NI-58,ENR=0.999) The nickel targets were
           fabricated by electroplating isotopically enriched
            (99.9%) 58Ni to a surface density of about 5 mg cm-2
           onto 0.08-mm thick gold foil. During the irradiation
           all targets were flanked by a set of 99.9% pure
           aluminum foils: two 0.04-mm-thick inner guard foils,
           two 0.08- mm-thick beam-monitor foils, and two
           0.04-mm-thick outer guard foils.

           to be less than 20%.

           about 5%.
