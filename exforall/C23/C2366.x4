TITLE      Interaction of 3- and 29-GeV Protons with Vanadium
AUTHOR     (L.Husain,S.Katcoff)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,7,2452,1973)
           #doi:10.1103/PhysRevC.7.2452
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL,1USASTB)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Target foils were irradiated in the
           circulating beam of the Brookhaven National
           Laboratory (BNL) alternating gradient synchrotron.
DETECTOR   (GELI,MAGSP) 35-cm3 Ge(Li) detector having a
           resolution of 2.6 keV full width at half maximum at
           1332 keV. A 6-in.-radius, 60 degree sector magnetic
           deflection mass spectrometer equipped with an
           extraction line made of Dom Corning 1720 glass.
SAMPLE     A typical aligned stack consisted of one or two
           25-microm-thick high-purity vanadium target foils
           sandwiched symmetrically between two 25-microm
           vanadium guard foils, two 12-microm aluminum guard
           foils, two 25-microm aluminum monitor foils, and
           finally two more 25-microm aluminum guard foils.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves mere constructed from the most
           prominent gamma-ray peaks of each nuclide and the
           analyses were done with the least-squares CLSQ code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors in the radiochemical measurements
           were calculated by root-mean square combinations of
           the errors.
           (ERR-S) Radioactive counting.
           (ERR-1) Counting efficiency.
           (ERR-2,0.,8.) Branching ratios.
           (ERR-3) Cross section for production of 24Na from Al.
CORRECTION Activities at the end of bombardment mere corrected
           for detector efficiency, gamma branching ratio,
           summing of gamma rays (if any), and parent daughter
           relationships.
