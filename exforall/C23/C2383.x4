FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Present experiment was performed at
           the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF)
           at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene (C2D4) sample was used. Two
           targets were used: the initial 214 mu-g/cm2-thick
           film was replaced after 40 hours of beamtime with a
           thicker 350 mu-g/cm2 target.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) The SuperORRUBA array of segmented
           Si telescopes was used to detect tritons from the
            (d,t) reaction. The array comprised of seven E-dE
           telescopes from the ORRUBA array to identify the
           light ejectiles and four additional E detectors to
           monitor elastically-scattered deuterons for beam
           normalization. The respective thickness was 65 mu-m
           for dE and 1000 mu-m for E detectors. The telescopes
           were placed at a radial distance of 123 mm from the
           target. The large segmentation of the E detectors (64
           strips perpendicular to the beam direction) combined
           with the 8-fold segmentation (parallel to the beam
           direction) of the E detectors, resulted in an average
           resolution of 0.28 degrees in polar angle. The
           angular range covered by the telescopes and two of
           the E detectors was 35 - 50 degrees in the laboratory
           frame, while the two remaining E detectors were
           placed close to 90 degrees.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE The radioactive 132Sn beam was produced via the
           proton-induced fission of 238U in a UCx target,
           extracted using the isotope separation online (ISOL)
           technique, and accelerated by the 25-MV ORNL Tandem
           electrostatic accelerator to 580 MeV.
ANALYSIS   The triton angular distributions were converted to
           absolute cross sections using the normalization
           determined from the elastic scattering of deuterons
           from the same target
