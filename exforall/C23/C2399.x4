FACILITY   (VDG,1USATNL) Experiment performed using 1 MV model
           JN Van de Graaff accelerator at the Laboratory for
           Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics at TUNL
SAMPLE     (10-NE-22,ENR=0.9999) Implanted porous titanium
           target fabricated by evaporating a thick (> 3 mu-m)
           layer of titanium onto a 0.5- mu-m thick titanium
           backing. Subsequently 22Ne ions were implanted into
           the porous surface with an incident dose of approx.
           1 C. The incident 22Ne ion energy was 75 keV,
           corresponding to a target thickness of  cca 95 keV
           for an alpha-particle beam of 828-keV energy
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector
           with 135% relative efficiency located at a distance
           of 1.1 cm to the target and an angle of 0deg relative
           to beam direction was used for measurement of gamma
           rays. HPGe detector was surrounded by a NaI(Tl)
           annulus and a plastic veto scintillator shield.
