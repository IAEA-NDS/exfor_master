STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab. 1 of the reference
FACILITY   (VDGT,1CANMCM) Experiments were performed using the
           McMaster University model FN tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were momentum analyzed
           with an Enge-type magnetic spectrograph
           (TRD) charged particles d,t were detected with Kodak
           NTB nuclear emulsions 50 mu-m thick

           from oxides of separated isotopes.The Nd oxides were
           reduced using Thorium metal and evaporated on 50
           mu-g/cm2 carbon backing. The thickness of 150Nd
           target was 40 mu-g/cm2.
