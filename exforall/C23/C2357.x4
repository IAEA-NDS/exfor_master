REL-REF    (O,C0261010,J.B.Cumming+,J,PR,127,950,1962) Preliminary
            results for 28 GeV.
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USABNL)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven Cosmotron and AGS.
SAMPLE     A target stack consisted of a 0.001-in. Al target foil
            (99.99% pure) and three 0.00025-in.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3x3-in. NaI crystals.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The irradiations were performed at the
           Brookhaven Cosmotron and AGS, and at the latter
           machine it was necessary to reduce the beam intensity
           to prevent the burning of the plastic foils. The
           irradiations sometimes lasted as long as 20 min, but
           corrections were made for the variation of the beam
           intensity during the bombardments. The Mg27 was
           separated chemically from the target and catcher
           foils, and the main problem was eliminating the
           tremendous quantities of C11 activity induced in the
           plastic foils. This was accomplished by fuming off
           the carbon with perchloric acid. The other
           interfering activities, F18 and Na24, were eliminated
           with holdback carriers. The samples were mounted on
           Al cards of sufficient thickness to stop the beta
           particles and assayed on NaI crystals.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for the secondary reaction and
           scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The following errors were not folded into
           errors for sigma: 7% uncertainty of the monitor cross
           sections, the error in the blank subtraction and that
           due to the counting statistics.
           (ERR-1) Mg chemical yields.
           (ERR-2) Intercalibration of the counters with the
           Mn54 source.
           (ERR-3) Na chemical yields.
           (ERR-4) Determination of the Na24 activity.
           (ERR-5) Uncertainty in the efficiency of the well
           counter for Na24.
           (ERR-6) Mg27 saturation factor for the irradiation.
