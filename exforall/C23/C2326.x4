SAMPLE     Target foils were placed between ultrapure (99.9999%)
           silver catcher foils which served to collect
           recoiling fission fragments in the forward and
           backward (to the beam) directions. The uranium foils
           had been analyzed both spectroscopically and
           radiochemically for some 54 elements which might
           produce spallation products that could possibly
           interfere with the fission fragments.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Standard chemical procedures using
           carrier techniques were used to separate the various
           fission products. After irradiation, the target and
           the catcher foils were removed and dissolved
           separately in the presence of added carriers. One of
           the problems encountered in this investigation was to
           find satisfactory radiochemical procedures capable of
           separating the trace amounts of radioactivity due to
           ternary-fission nuclides from gross amounts of binary
           and spallation products. The activities were counted
           in suitable chemically stable precipitates in Geiger
           counters provided with anticoincidence guard counters.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The resolution of the decay curves was aided
           by a modified Los Alamos PAKAG IBM 7094 computer
           program. In computing the absolute cross sections for
           the recoil products Si31, Mn56, and Ni66, the
           assumption was made that the same fraction of the
           total activity recoiled out of the thick uranium
           target as was experimentally found for Mg28 and Sr89
            (7% in both the forward and backward direction in
           each case).
CORRECTION Corrections are only necessary to the lower-energy
           data (<25 MeV) and were made using the known cross
           sections and an activation analysis of the uranium
           for aluminum and magnesium content.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted for the individual cross-
           section values are estimated from various
           uncertainties in the measurements. These errors are
           largely due to corrections for contributions from
           spallation impurities, estimation of the counter
           efficiencies, resolution of decay curves,
           determination of chemical yields, and counting
           statistics.
