SAMPLE     A stack of fifty foils, each ~4.55 mg/cm2 thick, was
           prepared from sections of aluminum sheet of known
           area and weight. Variations in thickness of the foils
           were found by this means to be less than 1 percent.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Activities in the fifty foils were measured
           on a bell-type mica-window beta-ray counter and a
           scale-of-128 circuit.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) A number of aluminum foils were
           first stacked up and bombarded with the full deuteron
           beam of the M.I.T. cyclotron. Half-life measurements
           and a chemical analysis of the activity induced in
           the first few foils were carried out, the results of
           which confirmed the assumption that the isotope being
           produced from the aluminum was 14.8-hour Na24. The
           absolute cross section can be changed by about a
           factor of two by adjusting the variables, showing
           that the observed agreement is well within the
           probable error.
