SAMPLE     Forty 0.00025-in. thick (~10 mg/cm2) Ta foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) The excitation function of
           Ta181(d,p)Ta182 was measured by the well-known stack
           foil technique. Ta foils were bombarded with the
           deuteron beam from the University of Pittsburgh
           cyclotron. The energy of the deuteron beam was
           measured by its range in air to be 15.0 MeV. To
           evaluate the absolute cross section, two 0.0003-in.
           aluminum foils were added to the stack. Since the
           excitation function of Al27(d,p alpha)Na24 is known,
           the relative yield of Na24 in Al foil to Ta182 in Ta
           foil provides a measure of the absolute cross section
           for the Ta reaction. When Ta181 foils were bombarded
           with deuterons, three activities, with half-lives
           16.3 min, 115 days, and 8.2 hours, were observed.
           About 5 days after bombardment, however, only the
           115-day activity remained. An hour after the deuteron
           bombardment, and up to a few days later, only one
           activity with a 15-hour half-period was observed in
           the Al foils. The relative excitation function of the
           115-day Tai182 and also the relative thick target
           yield were thus obtained. By using 0.028 barn as the
           extrapolated cross section value for 15.0-MeV
           deuterons for the reaction Al27(d,p alpha)Na24 after
           Clarke, it was found that the cross section for 15.0-
           MeV deuterons from the reaction on Ta181(d,p)Ta182
           was 0.5 barn. The cross sections at other deuteron
           energies can be obtained from these values shown in
           Fig. 1.
