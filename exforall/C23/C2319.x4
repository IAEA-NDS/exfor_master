INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Crocker Laboratory 60-inch
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     The amount of Bk249 available was only 1.2x10**-8 g,
           or about 3x10**13 atoms. The target material was
           deposited as a very thin layer over a rectangular
           area 0.6x6 mm on a 0.005-cm-thick gold foil. (This
           small target area was chosen to match the area of the
           most intense helium-ion beam.)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A windowless proportional counter was assumed
           to give a counting efficiency of 90% for the
           beta-particles from Bk249 mounted on thick platinum
           plates.
METHOD     (REC,CHSEP,ACTIV) The beam passed first through the
           gold foil and then through the Bk249 target, so that
           nuclear reaction products were ejected from the
           target in the forward direction. They were caught on
           a 0.00025-cm thick gold "catcher" foil placed about
           5.5 mm from the target foil. By this method it was
           possible to bombard the Bk249 target a large number
           of times without the necessity of dissolving it. Some
           45 bombardments, many of them for as long as 9 hours,
           were made with no loss of target material. The Bk249
           target also contained a known amount of Cm244 from
           which Cf246 was produced by the (alpha,2n) reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The accuracy of the cross-section
           measurements was limited to about 30% by (1)
           uncertainty in the amount of Bk249 in the target (the
           very soft beta- activity of Bk249 is not easy to
           count accurately, since the counting yield is very
           sensitive to the thickness of the sample), and (2)
           counting statistics in those experiments in which
           yields were measured by alpha-pulse analysis.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The half-life given for Es-252 is
           a factor 3 different from recent value. Authors
           mention that their value is only approximate and
           based only on alpha-pulse analysis, not taking into
           account the (at their time uncertain) decay by EC.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Authors suggest that Es250 also
           can be produced due to decay of Bk249 to Cf249,
           T1/2=280 days, modern values 330 days. Multiple
           reactions/decays on Cf249 could lead to Es250;
           however, half-life value of Bk249 makes these
           contributions small.
