SAMPLE     The 1.7 mg/cm2 bismuth foil was imagined to be
           divided, parallel to the foil faces, into a series of
           thin sections of equal thicknesses. The target was
           prepared by vacuum evaporation of bismuth on one side
           of a thin (0.09 mg/cm2) gold foil.

METHOD     (ACTIV) In order to obtain the relative cross section
           as a function of the energy of the incident helium
           ions for the Bi209(n,alpha)At212 reaction, bismuth
           target on a gold backing was bombarded with an
           energy-analyzed beam. The lab energy of the
           bombarding beam was varied from 18.25 to 19.25 MeV.
           The energy of the alpha particles emitted by At212
           was measured.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
