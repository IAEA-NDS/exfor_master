INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USAANL) The Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at
           the Argonne National Laboratory.
SAMPLE     One was a disc 3.17 cm in diameter and 0.125 cm thick
           which was cut from polyethylene of density 0.94
           g/cm3. In order to monitor the proton intensity on
           the target, an aluminum foil 50 micron thick
           protected by 25 micron of aluminum on each side was
           taped to the target. The other two sizes were
           machined from polyethylene of 0.91 g/cm3 density to
           thicknesses of 1.00 cm and 2.00 cm and square cross
           section 2.54 cm on an edge. These targets had a stack
           of three aluminum foils 25 micron thick and two gold
           foils 12 micron thick attached to, and trimmed to fit,
           the upstream and downstream faces of the polyethylene
           for beam monitoring.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detector was a NaI crystal 7.6 cm in
           diam. and 7.6 cm thick, and a single-channel analyzer
           was set to accept counts in the photopeak region.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Internal bombardments were carried out
           using polyethylene target foils of 600 microm or 127
           microm thickness. The 0.478 MeV gamma ray from the
           decay of 7Be was used to measure the number of 7Be
           nuclei produced by direct counting of intact
           polyethylene samples.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) We estimate an overall error of 5% is
           associated with the 7Be results, relative to the
           published values for Sigma Al(24Na) and Sigma C(llC).
           The absolute error is increased to 8% when the errors
           in the reference cross sections are included.
CORRECTION The variation of counting efficiency over the face of
           the NaI crystal was determined, and corrections of
           about 2% were applied to the counting data after
           taking into account the activity distribution in the
           polyethylene after bombardment. An additional 0.5%
           correction was applied to the gamma-ray counting
           rates of the 1 cm and 2 cm thick targets for recoils
           from the gold foil in contact with the upstream face.
           This correction was determined from measurements on
           aluminium foils which were downstream of a gold foil
           during a bombardment.
