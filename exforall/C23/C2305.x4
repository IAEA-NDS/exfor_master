TITLE      Considerations on the Probability of Nuclear Fission

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Crocker Laboratory 60-inch
           cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The amounts of the various alpha-emitting
           products were determined by use of 52%-geometry
           ionization counters and multichannel
           alpha-pulse-height analyzers.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are due principally to
           uncertainties in determining the amount of target
           material which was bombarded.

SAMPLE     The radium used was isotopically pure Ra226. The
           targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the
           various materials onto gold or aluminum foils.
METHOD     (REC,CHSEP,ACTIV) The radium targets were dissolved
           after each bombardment and plutonium and thorium
           fractions, respectively, were isolated
           radiochemically. A recoil technique was used for the
           thorium cross-section measurements.
