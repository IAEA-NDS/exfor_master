TITLE      Excitation Functions for Inelastic Scattering
           Reactions of Cadmium-111 and Indium-115
AUTHOR     (N.T.Porile)

INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABNL) Brookhaven 60-inch cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3x3 inch sodium iodide scintillation counter.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After bombardment the foils were
           dissolved and cadmium and indium were separated and
           decontaminated by conventional radiochemical
           procedures. The activity of the samples was
           determined with a sodium iodide scintillation counter
           and the decay of a particular photopeak was followed
           with the aid of a 100-channel pulse-height analyzer.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall uncertainties in the measured
           cross sections are 10-20% at the higher energies and
           increase to a factor of two or more at the very
           lowest bombarding energies.
           (ERR-1,5.,10.) The target uniformity.

SAMPLE     (48-CD-111,ENR=0.861) The experiments with Cd111 were
           performed in all cases with enriched Cd111 (86.1 atom
           percent Cd111) electroplated on gold, and with
           0.0003-inch thick cadmium foil having a normal
           isotopic composition. The electroplated targets had a
           thickness of approximately 1 mg/cm2.
CORRECTION The Cd111m results were corrected for photopeak
           losses arising from the coincidence between the
           150-keV and 246-keV transitions.
