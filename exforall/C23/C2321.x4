TITLE      Nuclear Reactions with Energetic Nitrogen Ions

INSTITUTE  (1USAORL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAORL) ORNL 63-inch cyclotron.
INC-SPECT  A rather wide incident energy spectrum (extending up
           to 30 MeV).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,BF3)
METHOD     (ACTIV) After bombardments lasting from one to thirty
           minutes the targets were withdrawn through the air
           lock and placed under a shielded thin-window Geiger
           counter. Usually about two minutes elapsed from the
           time the beam was turned off until counting began.
           Targets were counted continuously until the counting
           rate for induced activities approximated background.
           It was thus possible to detect half-lives ranging
           from one minute to several days. In general, there
           were several induced activities in each target.
           Standard graphical methods were used to determine
           half-lives and analyze decay curves. From the known
           bombardment time and rate of decay, the relative
           thick-target yields for the production of radioactive
           isotopes were calculated.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The below listed factors contributed a
           probable error in relative cross sections of less
           than 20% for any one target element, and less than
           50% from one element to another.
           1. Counting errors.
           2. Target impurities: commercially available target
           materials were usually pure to a few parts per thousand
           in cases where unexpected impurities appeared, in TaN,
           for example, they were readily detected by the
           anomalous decay curve.
           3. Changes in the target during bombardment: stable
           compounds with high dissociation temperatures were
           chosen as target materials in order to avoid changes in
            the chemical composition of the target during
           bombardment; targets bombarded with reduced beams gave
           the same results, within the limits of accuracy, as
           those bombarded with intense beams.
           4. Analysis of decay schemes: decay curves containing
           more than two or three half-lives are difficult to
           analyze accurately; with several independent analyzers
           and a variety of targets, we were able to reproduce
           relative yield values to within the estimated error.
           5. Variation of beam energy distribution: relative
           yields depend on the beam energy spectrum, vide supra;
           errors due to this cause were investigated by
           bombarding the same target element a number of times
           and by bombarding carbon targets periodically. No
           serious changes in relative yields were found.
