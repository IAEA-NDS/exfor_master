FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was conducted at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)
           at Michigan State University
SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with a thickness of 188-mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The rare-isotope projectile beam impinging
           onto the target was characterized using two plastic
           timing scintillators.One was placed at the exit of
           the A1900 fragment separator and the other at the
           object of the S800 spectrograph, approximately 30m
           apart. These detectors yield time-of-flight
           information as well as the incoming beam intensity
           and transmission efficiency.
           (MAGSP) The projectile-like neutron-removal residues
           were identified and characterized with the
           spectrograph S800.
           (DRFTC) The focal plane of the S800 was equipped with
           two cathode readout drift chambers (CRDCs) for x-y
           position determination of the beam.
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber located in the focal plne
           was used for energy-loss measurements,
           (SCIN) A plastic scintillator located at the focal
           plane served as trigger and time-of-flight reference
           relative to two plastic beam line scintillators.
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 24-O with energy of 92.3-MeV/u
           and 1% momentum spread was produced and selected with
           the A1900 fragment separator using a 48Ca primary
           beam of 140 MeV/u impinging on a 9Be production
           target with a thickness of 1034 mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty from possible
                   backgrounds and identification gate
           (ERR-4) systematic uncertainty from beam purity
                   and stability
           (ERR-5) systematic uncertainty from the reaction
                   target thickness
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
