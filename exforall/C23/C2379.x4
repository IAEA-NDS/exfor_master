INSTITUTE  (1USALAS,1CANSFU,1CANUBC)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANUBC) The TRIUMF Biomedical Facility.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) 75-mm-thick x 75-mm-diam NaI(Tl)
           scintillator.
SAMPLE     The targets were 3.2-mm-thick by 38-mm-diam disks of
           Pilots B and F plastic scintillator containing 91.6%
           carbon by weight. These disks were the same diameter
           as the first scintillator of the counter telescope
           and were mounted to its upstream face during the
           irradiations. No correction was made for the 1.11% 13C
           content of the carbon; that is, the results reported
           here technically apply to natural carbon.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The targets were irradiated for 20 to
           40 min (one to two half-lives of the 11C) and were
           then transported to a counting area where the target
           scintillator disk was optically coupled to the face
           of a photomultiplier tube. This assembly was then
           placed in contact with the face of a NaI(Tl)
           scintillator inside a lead shield. The 11C positrons
           were self-detected by the plastic scintillator, and
           the annihilation quanta were detected in the NaI(Tl)
           scintillator which had an electronic window set to
           include only the 511-keV photopeak pulses. Each
           sample was counted for at least three half-lives with
           standard beta-gamma coincidence circuity. The 11C
           disintegration rate was calculated from the net beta+,
           gamma, and beta+-gamma coincidence rates.
CORRECTION Reproducibility corrections ranged from 2% for 30-MeV
           pi+ to 13% for 30-MeV pi-.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
