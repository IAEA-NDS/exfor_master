INC-SOURCE (MPH=(11-NA-23(N,G)11-NA-24))
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) ABSORPTION METHOD. THE PHOTONS
           OBTAINED FROM THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE REACTION
           WERE PASSED THROUGH 2-M LONG ABSORBERS (NATURAL
           WATER (H-2)O AND HEAVY WATER (D-2)O).
SAMPLE     TWO WATER ABSORBERS WERE CONTAINED IN STAINLESS
           STEEL TUBES OF EQUAL INTERNAL DIMENSIONS (4.2 CM)
           AND DIFFERENT LENGTHS: 199.3 CM (FILLED WITH (H-2)O,
           DENSITY 0.99841 G/CM**2) AND 199.967 CM (FILLED
           WITH (D-2)O, DENSITY 1.10549 G/CM**2).

DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   AFTER MEASUREMENT OF THE TRANSMITTED G-SPECTRA THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED FROM
           THE COMPARISON OF THE INTENSITIES TRANSMITTED THROUGH
           THE TWO ABSORBERS.
REL-REF    (R,,Y.BIRENBAUM+,J,PR/C,32,1825,85) DATA ON ABSOLUTE
           VALUE OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION H-1(G,N).
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR THE DECAY OF THE NA-24
           SOURCE DUE TO THE TIME LAPSE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATE
           ABSORBERS AND ALSO FOR THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE IN THE
           ABSORBERS.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERROR ONLY.
COMMENT    THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION OF THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           OF DEUTERIUM WAS MEASURED AT 2754 KEV USING AN
           ABSORPTIVE METHOD BY PASSING THE PHOTONS THROUGH 2-M-
           LONG ABSORBERS OF (H-2)O AND (D-2)O.
