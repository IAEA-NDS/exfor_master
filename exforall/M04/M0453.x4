METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) Absorption method.  The photons  obtained
            from  thermal  neutron  capture reaction were passed
            through 2-m long absorbers (natural water (H-2)O and
            heavy water (D-2)O).
SAMPLE     Two water absorbers were contained in stainless steel
            tubes  of  equal  internal  dimensions  (4.2 cm) and
            different lengths:  199.3 cm  (filled  with  (H-2)O,
            density 0.99841 g/cm**2) and 199.967 cm (filled with
            (D-2)O, density 1.10549 g/cm**2).

ANALYSIS   After measurement  of  the  transmitted g-spectra the
            photodisintegration cross section was obtained  from
            the   comparison   of  the  intensities  transmitted
            through the two absorbers.

            absolute value of the cross section for the reaction
            H-1(g,n).
CORRECTION Corrections were  applied  for the decay of the Na-24
            source due to the time lapse between  two  alternate
            absorbers and also for the temperature change in the
            absorbers.

COMMENT    The absolute cross section of the photodisintegration
            of  deuterium  was  measured  at  2754  keV using an
            absorptive method by  passing  the  photons  through
            2-m long absorbers of (H-2)O and (D-2)O.
