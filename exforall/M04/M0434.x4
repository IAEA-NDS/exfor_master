INSTITUTE  (4RUSLIN)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSLIN)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) Kinematically    determined    (reaction
            particle tagged) energy of  incident  bremsstrahlung
            photon.
SAMPLE     Nuclear emulsions loaded with the isotope  Li-7  were
            used as a target and as a detector simultaneously.
METHOD     (COINC) Three-prong stars in emulsions.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) NIKFI-T3   type   plates   with  an  emulsion
            thickness of 200 microns were used.

ANALYSIS   Plates loaded   and   not   loaded   with  Li-7  were
            irradiated under identical conditions.  The unloaded
            plate was used for background measurements. The laws
            of energy and momentum  conservation  were  used  to
            identify the reactions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are statistical.
COMMENT    A search  was made for the reaction Li-7(gamma,pt)H-3
            (Q = 22.28 MeV) in the gamma-ray energy range  23  -
            27  MeV  using  thick  nuclear  emulsion loaded with
            isotope Li-7.  The momentum and energy  conservation
            laws   were  used  to  identify  the  reaction.  The
            integrated reaction cross section in  the  mentioned
            energy region was obtained.
