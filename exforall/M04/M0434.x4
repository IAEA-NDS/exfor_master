TITLE      THE REACTION LI-7(G,PT)H-3 AT EG < 27 MEV.
AUTHOR     (E.A.KOTIKOV,E.D.MAKHNOVSKII)
REFERENCE  (J,SNP,18,125,1973)
INSTITUTE  (4RUSLIN)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSLIN)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) KINEMATICALLY DETERMINED (REACTION
           PARTICLE TAGGED) ENERGY OF INCIDENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           PHOTON.
SAMPLE     NUCLEAR EMULSIONS LOADED WITH THE ISOTOPE LI-7
           WERE USED AS A TARGET AND AS A DETECTOR
           SIMULTANEOUSLY.
METHOD     (COINC) THREE-PRONG STARS IN EMULSIONS.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) NIKFI-T3 TYPE PLATES WITH AN EMULSION
           THICKNESS OF 200 MICRONS WERE USED.
PART-DET   (P)
           (T)
ANALYSIS   PLATES LOADED AND NOT LOADED WITH LI-7 WERE
           IRRADIATED UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS. THE
           UNLOADED PLATE WAS USED FOR BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS.
           THE LAWS OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM CONSERVATION WERE
           USED TO IDENTIFY THE REACTIONS.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
COMMENT    A SEARCH WAS MADE FOR THE REACTION LI-7(G,PT)H-3
            (Q = 22.28 MEV) IN THE G-RAY ENERGY RANGE 23 - 27
           MEV USING THICK NUCLEAR EMULSION LOADED WITH
           ISOTOPE LI-7. THE MOMENTUM AND ENERGY CONSERVATION
           LAWS WERE USED TO IDENTIFY THE REACTION. THE
           INTEGRATED REACTION CROSS SECTION IN THE MENTIONED
           ENERGY REGION WAS OBTAINED.
