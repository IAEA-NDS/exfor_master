SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS FORMED BY PRESSING ENRICHED B-10
           POWDER (91%) TO FORM A SELF-SUPPORTING DISC OF
           THICKNESS 292 MG/CM**2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SCIN,NAICR) EDE SYSTEM FOR PROTONS.
           (SCIN) LIQUID SCIHTILLATOR NE213 FOR NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS   (INTED) REACTIONS B-10(G,P) AND B-10(G,PN) WERE
           INVESTIGATED IN DIRECT COINCIDENCE EXPERIMENT.
           THE DATA WERE INTEGRATED OVER THE PHOTON ENERGIES
           OF 76 - 103 MEV.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    MEASUREMENTS OF THE CROSS SECTIONS OF B-10(G,P) AND
           B-10(G,PN) WITH TAGGED PHOTONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED
           AT EG = 66 - 103 MEV.
           THE COMPARISON OF EXPERIMENTAL CROSS SECTION
           OF B-10(G,P) REACTION AND THE CROSS SECTION
           DEDUCED BY SCALING OF EXPERIMENTAL CROSS
           SECTION OF B-10(G,PN) REACTION IS USED FOR STUDY
           HOW MUCH OF THE HIGH MISSING ENERGY B-10(G,P) CROSS
           SECTION ARISES FROM THE (G,PN) PROCESS WHERE THE
           PHOTONEUTRON IS NOT DETECTED.
