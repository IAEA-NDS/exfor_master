SAMPLE     The target  was  formed  by  pressing  enriched  B-10
            powder (91%)  to  form  a  self-supporting  disc  of
            thickness 292 mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SCIN,NAICR) EDE system for protons.
           (SCIN) Liquid scintillator NE213 for neutrons.
ANALYSIS   (INTED) REACTIONS  B-10(g,p)  and   B-10(g,pn)   were
            investigated  in direct coincidence experiment.  the
            data were integrated over the photon energies of  76
            - 103 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    Measurements of  the  cross sections of B-10(g,p) and
            B-10(g,pn) with tagged photons have  been  performed
            at Eg = 66 - 103 MeV. The comparison of experimental
            cross section of B-10(g,p) reaction  and  the  cross
            section  deduced  by  scaling  of experimental cross
            section of B-10(g,pn) reaction is used for study how
            much  of  the  high  missing  energy B-10(g,p) cross
            section arises from the  (g,pn)  process  where  the
            photoneutron is not detected.
