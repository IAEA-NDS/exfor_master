TITLE      Photodisintegration cross section of beryllium
            near threshold.

INC-SOURCE  Decay gammas from 124Sb (1.692 MeV),
                  206Bi(1.720 MeV) and 28Al(1.780 MeV).
METHOD     (MANGB) The neutron yield was determined by comparing
            the (radioactive source - Be) photoneutron source to
            a Ra-Be standard source by means of a manganous
            sulfate bath (measurements of saturated manganese
            activity).
SAMPLE     The beryllium sample was in form of spherical shell
            with  outside diameter of 8.2 cm and a thickness
            of 0.645 cm.
PART-DET   (B-)  Saturated manganese activity.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The saturated activity of manganese in
           manganous sulfate bath was measured by Geiger tube.
CORRECTION Some kinds of corrections to the data were used.
            These were corrections for:
            - peak-to-total ratio;
            - substraction of 2.09 MeV Compton tail;
            - half-life of Sb-124;
            - absolute strength of source;
            - neutron escape from manganous sulfate bath;
            - capture of fast neutrons in bath;
            - neutron counting statistics;
            - finite source-size;
            - gamma-ray attenuation in the Be shell;
            - neutrons produced by 2.09 MeV gamma rays.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given for cross section values
            are over-all uncertainties (square root of sum of
            squares).
