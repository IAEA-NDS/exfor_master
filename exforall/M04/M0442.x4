TITLE      PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION OF BERILLIUM
           NEAR THRESHOLD.
AUTHOR     (W.JOHN,J.M.PROSSER)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,127,231,62)
INSTITUTE  (1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(51-SB-124(0,G))). EG = 1.692 MEV.
           (MPH=(83-BI-206(0,G))). EG = 1.72  MEV.
           (MPH=(13-AL-28(0,G))).  EG = 1.78  MEV.
METHOD     (MANGB,ACTIV) THE NEUTRON YIELD WAS DETERMINED BY
           COMPARING THE (RADIOACTIVE SOURCE - BE) PHOTONEUTRON
           SOURCE TO A RA-BE STANDARD SOURCE BY MEANS OF A
           MANGANOUS SULFATE BATH (MEASUREMENTS OF SATURATED
           MANGANESE ACTIVITY).
SAMPLE     THE BERILLIUM SAMPLE WAS IN FORM OF SPHERICAL SHELL
           WITH  OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF 8.2 CM AND A THICKNESS
           OF 0.645 CM.
PART-DET   (B-)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) THE SATURATED ACTIVITY OF MANGANESE IN
           MANGANOUS SULFATE BATH WAS MEASURED BY GEIGER TUBE.
CORRECTION SOME KINDS OF CORRECTIONS TO THE DATA WERE USED.
           THESE WERE CORRECTIONS FOR:
           - PEAK-TO-TOTAL RATIO;
           - SUBSTRACTION OF 2.09 MEV COMPTON TAIL;
           - HALF-LIFE OF SB-124;
           - ABSOLUTE STRENGTH OF SOURCE;
           - NEUTRON ESCAPE FROM MANGANOUS SULFATE BATH;
           - CAPTURE OF FAST NEUTRONS IN BATH;
           - NEUTRON COUNTING STATISTICS;
           - FINITE SOURCE-SIZE;
           - G-RAY ATTENUATION IN THE BE SHELL;
           - NEUTRONS PRODUCED BY 2.09 MEV GAMMA RAYS.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS GIVEN FOR CROSS SECTION VALUES ARE
           OVER-ALL UNCERTAINTIES (SQUARE ROOT OF SUM OF
           SQUARES).
