METHOD     (EXTB,PHD) The  energy  separation of the protons and
            deuterons  from  He-3  was  achieved  by  pulseshape
            discrimination.   Number  of  silicon detectors with
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0  mm  were
            used  either  singly  or  in  combinations of two to
            separate protons and deuterons from  the  background
            due to electrons and neutrons.
SAMPLE     The target  consisted  of  two  similar gas cells 1.5
            inches in diameter by  2  inches  in  length,  which
            could  be  moved  in  and  out of the beam by remote
            control.  One cell was fitted with  a  0.00025  inch
            havar  window  at  90 degrees t0 the beam and filled
            with 3 atm of H-2.  The other cell had mylar windows
            of  either 0.00014 or 0.00050 inches filled with 0.5
            and 1.33 atm,  respectively,  of He-3. Both the He-2
            and He-3 gases were to be better than 99.5% pure.

DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SOLST) A  number  of  silicon  detectors  with
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0 mm placed
            in focal plane of a quadrupole-triplet magnet.
ANALYSIS   The deuteron  energy  spectra  were measured for some
            runs.  The total number  of  deuteron  counts  in  a
            spectrum   peak   at  each  run  was  determined  by
            substracting the background obtained in a  run  with
            an  evacuated  target cell and the quadrupole magnet
            at a similar field  setting.  The  total  number  of
            deuteron  counts  from  He-3  contained  in  a  peak
            together  with the total  number  of  proton  counts
            from  He-2  contained in a peak produced by the same
            gamma  energy  and  with  the  Deswart  and  Marshak
            theoretical  cross section d-sig/d-omega (H-2) at 90
            degrees in the laboratory system were used to obtain
            the   differential   cross   section  for  He-3(g,d)
            reaction.

            differential  cross   section   for   the   H-2(g,p)
            reaction.
COMMENT    The He-3(g,d)p  differential  cross  section  at   90
            degrees  in  the laboratory system has been measured
            in the gamma-ray energy range of 8.5 to  46  MeV.  A
            broad  peak  with a maximum of 93 microbarn/sr at 11
            mev  is  observed.  The  He-3(g,2p)n  proton  energy
            spectrum  produced by 40 MeV bremsstrahlung has also
            been measured.  A survey of sum-rule predictions  is
            also included.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The quoted errors include statistical as well
            as systematic errors but do not include any estimate
            of  the  error  in  the  Deswart  and  Marshak cross
            section.
           (ERR-1) The  estimate systematic  error is about 10%.
