METHOD     (EXTB,PHD) THE ENERGY SEPARATION OF THE PROTONS
           AND DEUTERONS FROM HE-3 WAS ACHIEVED BY PULSE-
           SHAPE DISCRIMINATION. A NUMBER OF SILICON DETECTORS
           WITH DEPLETION DEPTHS RANGING FROM 0.045 TO 3.0 MM
           WERE USED EITHER SINGLY OR IN COMBINATIONS OF TWO
           T0 SEPARATE PROTONS AND DEUTERONS FROM THE
           BACKGROUND DUE TO ELECTRONS AND NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET CONSISTED OF TWO SIMILAR GAS CELLS
           1.5 INCHES IN DIAMETER BY 2 INCHES IN LENGTH, WHICH
           COULD BE MOVED IN AND OUT OF THE BEAM BY REMOTE
           CONTROL. ONE CELL WAS FITTED WITH A 0.00025 INCH
           HAVAR WINDOW AT 90 DEGREES T0 THE BEAM AND FILLED
           WITH 3 ATM OF H-2. THE OTHER CELL HAD MYLAR WINDOWS
           OF EITHER 0.00014 OR 0.00050 INCHES FILLED WITH
           0.5 AND 1.33 ATM, RESPECTIVELY, OF HE-3. BOTH THE
           HE-2 AND HE-3 GASES WERE TO BE BETTER THAN 99.5% PURE.

DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SOLST) A NUMBER OF SILICON DETECTORS WITH
           DEPLETION DEPTHS RANGING FROM 0.045 TO 3.0 MM PLACED
           IN FOCAL PLANE OF A QUADRUPOLE-TRIPLET MAGNET.
ANALYSIS   THE DEUTERON ENERGY SPECTRA WERE MEASURED FOR SOME
           RUNS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEUTERON COUNTS IN A
           SPECTRUM PEAK AT EACH RUN WAS DETERMINED BY
           SUBSTRACTING THE BACKGROUND OBTAINED IN A RUN WITH
           AN EVACUATED TARGET CELL AND THE QUADRUPOLE MAGNET
           AT A SIMILAR FIELD SETTING. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
           DEUTERON COUNTS FROM HE-3 CONTAINED IN A PEAK
           TOGEATHER WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PROTON COUNTS
           FROM HE-2 CONTAINED IN A PEAK PRODUCED BY THE SAME
           GAMMA ENERGY AND WITH THE DESWART AND MARSHAK
           THEORETICAL CROSS SECTION D-SIG/D-OMEGA (H-2) AT
           90 DEGREES IN THE LABORATORY  SYSTEM WERE USED TO
           OBTAIN THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR HE-3(G,D)
           REACTION.
REL-REF    (R,,J.J.DESWART+,J,PHY,25,1001,59) THEORETICAL
           DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE H-2(G,P)
           REACTION.
COMMENT    THE HE-3(G,D)P DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION AT 90
           DEGREES IN THE LABORATORY SYSTEM HAS BEEN MEASURED IN
           THE GAMMA-RAY ENERGY RANGE OF 8.5 TO 46 MEV. A BROAD
           PEAK WITH A MAXIMUM OF 93 MICROBARN/SR AT 11 MEV IS
           OBSERVED. THE HE-3(G,2P)N PROTON ENERGY SPECTRUM
           PRODUCED BY 40 MEV BREMSSTRAHLUNG HAS ALSO BEEN
           MEASURED. A SURVEY OF SUM-RULE PREDICTIONS IS ALSO
           INCLUDED.
ERR-ANALYS THE QUOTED ERRORS INCLUDE STATISTICAL AS WELL AS
           SYSTEMATIC ERRORS BUT DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ESTIMATE
           OF THE ERROR IN THE DESWART AND MARSHAK CROSS
           SECTION. THE ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE SYSTEMATIC ERROR
           FROM THIS SOURCE IS ABOUT 10%.
