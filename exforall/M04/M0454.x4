            reaction below 10 MeV.

METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) Photoneutron   spectra  measurements  for
            angles between 30 and 150 degrees.
SAMPLE     The target  was  a thin-walled glass vial,  4.4 cm in
            diameter and 5  cm  high,  filled  with  high-purity
            heavy water D(2)O, 99.8% D).
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) H3-3 spectrometer.
ANALYSIS   The photoneutron  yields  at  various   angles   were
            normalized  for  the  runnung  time  and the average
            photon flux during  each  run.  The  total  absolute
            D(g,n)  reaction  cross  section measured previously
            was used  to  obtaine  absolute  differential  cross
            sections.  At  energies  not  studied  previously an
            interpolation using a  smooth  exponential  function
            which  reproduced the experimental cross sections to
            within 0.5% was used.
REL-REF    (R,,Y.Birenbaum+,J,PR/C,32,1825,1985) Data on
            absolute value of the cross section for the reaction
            D(g,n).
CORRECTION Correction was introduced to take  into  account  the
            change of the detector efficiency with energy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) statistical errors only.
COMMENT    The absolute cross section of the photodisintegration
            of deuterium was  measured  at  2754  keV  using  an
            absorptive  method  by  passing  the photons through
            2-m long absorbers of (H-2)O and (D-2)O.
