TITLE      DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE D(G,N) REACTION
           BELOW 10 MEV.
AUTHOR     (Y.BIRENBAUM,Z.BERANT,A.WOLF,S.KAHANE,R.MOREH)
REFERENCE  (J,PRL,61,810,88)
INSTITUTE  (3ISLNEG)
FACILITY   (REAC,3ISLNEG) IRR-2 REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(24-CR-0(N,G))) EG = 7939, 8498, AND 8884 KEV.
           (MPH=(26-FE-0(N,G))) EG = 5970, 7279, AND 7639 KEV.
           (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G))) EG = 6837, 8533, AND 8999 KEV.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) PHOTONEUTRON SPECTRA MEASUREMENTS FOR
           ANGLES BETWEEN 30 AND 150 DEGREES.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A THIN-WALLED GLASS VIAL, 4.4 CM IN
           DIAMETER AND 5 CM HIGH, FILLED WITH HIGH-PURITY
           HEAVY WATER D(2)O, 99.8% D).
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) HE-3 SPECTROMETER.
ANALYSIS   THE PHOTONEUTRON YIELDS AT VARIOUS ANGLES WERE
           NORMALIZED FOR THE RUNNUNG TIME AND THE AVERAGE
           PHOTON FLUX DURING EACH RUN. THE TOTAL ABSOLUTE
           D(G,N) REACTION CROSS SECTION MEASURED PREVIOUSLY
           WAS USED TO OBTAINE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
           SECTIONS. AT ENERGIES NOT STUDIED PREVIOUSLY AN
           INTERPOLATION USING A SMOOTH EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
           WHICH REPRODUCED THE EXPERIMENTAL CROSS SECTIONS
           TO WITHIN 0.5% WAS USED.
REL-REF    (R,,Y.BIRENBAUM+,J,PR/C,32,1825,85) DATA ON ABSOLUTE
           VALUE OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION D(G,N).
CORRECTION CORRECTION WAS INTRODUCED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
           CHANGE OF THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WITH ENERGY.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY.
COMMENT    THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION OF THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           OF DEUTERIUM WAS MEASURED AT 2754 KEV USING AN
           ABSORPTIVE METHOD BY PASSING THE PHOTONS THROUGH 2-M-
           LONG ABSORBERS OF (H-2)O AND (D-2)O.
