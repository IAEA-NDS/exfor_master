INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Electron storage ring 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (MPH,LCS) Monocromatic 'LADON' photon  beam  obtained
            by   compton   backscattering   of  laser  light  by
            electrons circulating in storage ring.
SAMPLE     The mica sheets covered, on one side, with a layer of
            uranium oxide.
METHOD     (STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD,PLATE) MICA foils and emulsion plates.
PART-DET   (FF)
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement of  the  reaction  cross  section.
            After  the  etching of the mica foils detector,  the
            identification and counting  of  fission  fragments,
            and track analysis were carried out by using optical
            microscopes.  The emulsions were processed using the
            special  technique  to  obtain  very legible fission
            tracks in spite of background from alphaparticles.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The photofission cross section of  U-238  induced  by
            monocromatic and polarized photons has been measured
            using the ladon facility.  The experiment  has  been
            performed  at six different energies in the range 46
            - 72 MeV by detecting the fission  fragments  either
            in  uranium-loaded  nuclear-track emulsion plates or
            in uranium-mica sandwiches.  During  the  experiment
            the  main features of ladon beam were a satisfactory
            energy resolution (up to about 10%  fwhm, at maximum
            energy), an  extremely low bremsstrahlung background
            (about 5% integrated over the whole spectrum above 2
            MeV),  an intensity of about 10**5 photons/s, and an
            almost complete linear polarization.
