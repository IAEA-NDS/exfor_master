TITLE      PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-238 IN THE

INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) ELECTRON STORAGE RING 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (MPH,COMPT) MONOCROMATIC 'LADON' PHOTON BEAM
           OBTAINED BY COMPTON BACKSCATTERING OF LASER LIGHT
           BY ELECTRONS CIRCULATING IN STORAGE RING.
SAMPLE     THE MICA SHEETS COVERED, ON ONE SIDE, WITH A LAYER
           OF URANIUM OXIDE.
METHOD     (STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD,PLATE) MICA FOILS AND EMULSION PLATES.

ANALYSIS   DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE REACTION CROSS SECTION.
           AFTER THE ETCHING OF THE MICA FOILS DETECTOR, THE
           IDENTIFICATION AND COUNTING OF FISSION FRAGMENTS,
           AND TRACK ANALYSIS WERE CARRIED OUT BY USING
           OPTICAL MICROSCOPES. THE EMULSIONS WERE PROCESSED
           USING THE SPECIAL TECHNIQUE TO OBTAIN VERY LEGIBLE
           FISSION TRACKS IN SPITE OF BACKGROUND FROM ALPHA-
           PARTICLES.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-238 INDUCED BY
           MONOCROMATIC AND POLARIZED PHOTONS HAS BEEN MEASURED
           USING THE LADON FACILITY. THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN
           PERFORMED AT SIX DIFFERENT ENERGIES IN THE RANGE
           46 - 72 MEV BY DETECTING THE FISSION FRAGMENTS
           EITHER IN URANIUM-LOADED NUCLEAR-TRACK EMULSION
           PLATES OR IN URANIUM-MICA SANDWICHES.
           DURING THE EXPERIMENT THE MAIN FEATURES OF LADON
           BEAM WERE A SATISFACTORY ENERGY RESOLUTION (UP TO
           ABOUT 10% FWHM, AT MAXIMUM ENERGY), AN EXTREMLY
           LOW BREMSSTRAHLUNG BACKGROUND (ABOUT 5% INTEGRATED
           OVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM ABOVE 2 MEV), AN INTENSITY
           OF ABOUT 10**5 PHOTONS/S, AND AN ALMOST COMPLETE
           LINEAR POLARIZATION.
