SAMPLE     A 120-g sample of  water,  isotopically  enriched  to
            48.6% in O-17, was contained in a thin-walled lucite
            cylinder 3.81 cm in diameter, and 10.2 cm long.

COMMENT    Bremsstrahlung-weighted integrated cross sections for
            photoproton and photoneutron emission from  O-17  to
            excited  residual  states in N-16 and O-16 have been
            measured  by  detecting  the   deexcitation   g-rays
            emitted  from  these  states in the residual nuclei.
            About  90%  of  photoproton   emission   from   O-17
            populates  the  ground  state (2-) and the 0.298 MeV
            level  (3-)  in  N-16.  The  remaining   photoproton
            emission  lead  to  the 0.120 MeV (0-) and 0.397 MeV
            (1-) levels.  For the  O-17(g,n)O-16  reaction,  the
            results  show  that emission to bound states in o-16
            is predominantly to the 0-16 ground state (0+), with
            4%  of  the  decay  from O-17 giant dipole resonance
            going to the 6.13 MeV (3-) excited state; population
            of other bound states is not observed.

ANALYSIS   The number  of  deexcitation  g-rays  detected  at  a
            particular bremsstrahlung end-point energy  reflects
            the  differential  cross  section  over  the  energy
            region up  to  this  end-point  energy  weighted  by
            number  of  photons at each energy in bremsstrahlung
            spectra.  So the differential cross section and  the
            integrated    cross   sections   obtained   are   of
            'bremsstrahlung-weighted' type.

ANALYSIS   The integrated  (non-bremsstrahlung-weighted)   cross
