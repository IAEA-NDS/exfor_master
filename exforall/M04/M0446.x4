METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     A 120-G SAMPLE OF WATER, ISOTOPICALLY ENRICHED TO
           48.6% IN O-17, WAS CONTAINED IN A THIN-WALLED LUCITE
           CYLINDER 3.81 CM IN DIAMETER, AND 10.2 CM LONG.
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (GELI) THIN GE(LI) LOW-ENERGY PHOTON DETECTOR, WITH
           THE DATA-ACQUISITION SYSTEM ENABLED TO COUNT FOR
           70 MICROSEC STARTING 8.5 MICROSEC AFTER THE BEAM
           BURST.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS.
COMMENT    BREMSSTRAHLUNG-WEIGHTED INTEGRATED CROSS SECTIONS
           FOR PHOTOPROTON AND PHOTONEUTRON EMISSION FROM O-17
           TO EXCITED RESIDUAL STATES IN N-16 AND O-16 HAVE
           BEEN MEASURED BY DETECTING THE DEEXCITATION G-RAYS
           EMITTED FROM THESE STATES IN THE RESIDUAL NUCLEI.
           ABOUT 90% OF PHOTOPROTON EMISSION FROM O-17 POPULATES
           THE GROUND STATE (2-) AND THE 0.298 MEV LEVEL (3-) IN
           N-16. THE REMAINING PHOTOPROTON EMISSION LEAD TO THE
           0.120 MEV (0-) AND 0.397 MEV (1-) LEVELS. FOR THE
           O-17(G,N)O-16 REACTION, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EMISSION
           TO BOUND STATES IN O-16 IS PREDOMINANTLY TO THE 0-16
           GROUND STATE (0+), WITH 4% OF THE DECAY FROM O-17 GIANT
           DIPOLE RESONANCE GOING TO THE 6.13 MEV (3-) EXCITED
           STATE; POPULATION OF OTHER BOUND STATES IS NOT
           OBSERVED.
