TITLE      ALPHA PARTICLES FROM PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF BE-9

SAMPLE     THE 0.0127 MM THICK BERILLIUM FOIL.
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED SI(LI) DETECTORS.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,UNFLD,DIFFR) MEASUREMENTS OF ALPHA PARTICLE
           ENERGY SPECTRA WERE FULFILLED AT THE ANGLES OF 45 -
           160 DEGREES TO THE DIRECTION OF BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           BEAM. THE ALPHA PARTICLE YIELDS AT EACH OF USED
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT ENERGY WERE NORMALIZED. BY
           SUBSTRACTING THE ALPHA PARTICLE YIELDS AT SUCCESSIVE
           END-POINT ENERGIES FROM EACH OTHER AND DIVIDING BY
           CORRESPONDING PHOTON SPECTRUM DIFFERENCE, AVERAGE
           CROSS SECTIONS OVER 2 MEV ENERGY INTERVALS WERE
           OBTAINED BY THE PHOTON DIFFERENCE TECHNIQUE.
           THE ENERGIES OF THE MEDIAN POINTS OF THE ALPHA
           PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF A PURE REACTION
           BE-9(G,N)BE-8(E-EXC = 16.6 MEV) AT EACH ANGLE OF
           DETECTION FOR EACH BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT
           ENERGY WERE DETERMINED BY KINEMATIC CALCULATIONS.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
CORRECTION THE DETECTED ALPHA PARTICLES WERE CORRECTED FOR
           ENERGY LOSSES IN THE BERYLLIUM TARGET AND IN THE
           INERT SILICON 'WINDOWS' OF THE SI(LI) DETECTORS.
           THE ALPHA PARTICLE ENERGY SPECTRA WERE THEN
           NORMALIZED FOR GEOMETRIC EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTION
           SYSTEM AND FOR PHOTON FLUX.
COMMENT    ALPHA PARTICLES FROM THE BE-9(G,N)BE-8 -> 2A AND
           BE-9(G,A-0)HE-5 WERE STUDIED IN THE PHOTON ENERGY
           REGION 18 - 26 MEV; THE RESULTS YIELDED A COMBINED
           INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION OF 13.1 (2.0) MEV*MB AND
           AN UPPER LIMIT ON THE INTEGRATED (G,A-0) CROSS
           SECTION OF 4.0 MEV*MB. THESE REACTIONS TOGETHER WITH
           THE BE-9(G,N-1)BE-8 REACTION (WHICH HAS AN INTEGRATED
           CROSS SECTION OF 2.4 (0.4) MEV*MB) ARE THE MAJOR
           REACTION CHANNELS CONTRIBUTING TO THE TOTAL
           PHOTONEUTRON CROSS SECTION IN THIS ENERGY REGION.
           THE (G,N-1) REACTION ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE
           POPULATION OF 3/2+ AND 5/2+ STATES OF BE-9.
