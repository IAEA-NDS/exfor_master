            the photon energy region 18 - 26 MeV.

SAMPLE     The 0.0127 mm thick beryllium foil.
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Liquid nitrogen cooled Si(Li) detectors.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,UNFLD,DIFFR) Measurements  of  alpha  particle
            energy spectra were fulfilled at the angles of 45  -
            160 degrees to the direction of bremsstrahlung beam.
            The  alpha  particle  yields   at   each   of   used
            bremsstrahlung end-point energy were normalized.  By
            substracting the alpha particle yields at successive
            end-point  energies  from each other and dividing by
            corresponding photon  spectrum  difference,  average
            cross  sections  over  2  MeV  energy intervals were
            obtained by the  photon  difference  technique.  The
            energies  of the median points of the alpha particle
            distributions of a pure reaction Be-9(g,n)Be-8(E-exc
            =  16.6  MeV)  at  each  angle of detection for each
            bremsstrahlung end-point energy were  determined  by
            kinematic calculations.
CORRECTION The detected  alpha  particles  were  corrected   for
            energy  losses  in  the  beryllium target and in the
            inert silicon 'windows' of the Si(Li) detectors. The
            alpha  particle  energy spectra were then normalized
            for geometric efficiency of the detection system and
            for photon flux.
COMMENT    Alpha particles from  the  Be-9(g,n)Be-8  ->  2a  and
            Be-9(g,a-0)He-5  were  studied  in the photon energy
            region 18 - 26 MeV;  the results yielded a  combined
            integrated cross section of 13.1 (2.0) MeV*mb and an
            upper limit on the integrated (g,a-0) cross  section
            of  4.0  MeV*mb.  these  reactions together with the
            Be-9(g,n-1)Be-8 reaction (which  has  an  integrated
            cross  section  of  2.4  (0.4) MeV*mb) are the major
            reaction  channels   contributing   to   the   total
            photoneutron  cross  section  in this energy region.
            the  (g,n-1)  reaction  are  consistent   with   the
            population of 3/2+ and 5/2+ states of Be-9.
