INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) ELECTRON STORAGE RING 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (MPH,COMPT) MONOCROMATIC 'LADON' PHOTON BEAM
           OBTAINED BY COMPTON BACKSCATTERING OF LASER LIGHT
           BY ELECTRONS CIRCULATING IN STORAGE RING.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     A VERY THIN (0.16 MM) ALUMINIUM TUBE (15 CM IN
           LENGTH AND 1.5 CM IN DIAMETER), WITH END CAPS OF
           LEXAN, WAS FILLED WITH DEUTERIUM OR HYDROGEN (IN
           TURN) AT HIGH PREASURE (ABOUT 30 ATM).
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR NE213.
ANALYSIS   DATA WERE TAKEN IN SEVERAL RUNS WITH DEUTERIUM AND
           HYDROGEN GAS (FOR BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS). DATA
           WERE ALSO TAKEN WITH USE OF ONLY THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           COMPONENT OF THE BEAM. DATA WERE REDUCED TO CROSS
           SECTIONS IN SEVERAL STEPS. BY USE OF BOTH PULSE-
           SHAPE-ANALYSER AND HEAD/TAIL INFORMATION, A HIGH-
           QUALITY P/G DISCRIMINATION WAS OBTAINED. NEXT, THE
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG DATA WERE NORMALIZED TO THE SAME
           TOTAL ELECTRON FLUX AND SUBSTRACTED. THEN, THE NET
           HYDROGEN YIELD WAS SUBSTRACTED FROM THE DEUTERIUM
           YIELD, TO GET RID OF THE RESIDUAL ELECTROMAGNETIC
           BACKGROUND AND THE SPURIOUS COUNTS FROM THE LEXAN
           WINDOWS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE PROTON DETECTOR
           EFFICIENCY, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PROTON
           ENERGY THRESHOLD (O.7 MEV AT EG = 14.7 MEV) AND
           ANGULAR ACCEPTANCE.

COMMENT    THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF
           DEUTERON HAS BEEN MEASURED IN THE G-RAY ENERGY
           RANGE BETWEEN 15 AND 75 MEV, BY USE OF THE
           MONOCROMATIC 'LADON' PHOTON BEAM OF THE FRASCATI
           NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND DETECTION OF THE PROTON.
