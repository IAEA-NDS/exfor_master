INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Electron storage ring 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (LCS)   Monocromatic  'LADON'  photon  beam  obtained
            by  compton  backscattering  of   laser   light   by
            electrons circulating in storage ring.
METHOD      (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     A very thin (0.16 mm) aluminium tube (15 cm in length
            and 1.5 cm in diameter), with end caps of lexan, was
            filled  with deuterium or hydrogen (in turn) at high
            preasure (about 30 atm).
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Liquid scintillator NE213.
ANALYSIS   Data were  taken  in  several runs with deuterium and
            hydrogen gas  (for  background  measurements).  Data
            were  also taken with use of only the bremsstrahlung
            component of the beam.  Data were reduced  to  cross
            sections   in   several   steps.   By  use  of  both
            pulseshape-analyser  and  head/tail  information,  a
            highquality  p/g discrimination was obtained.  Next,
            the bremsstrahlung data were normalized to the  same
            total electron flux and substracted.  Then,  the net
            hydrogen yield was substracted  from  the  deuterium
            yield,  to  get  rid of the residual electromagnetic
            background and the spurious counts  from  the  lexan
            windows.
CORRECTION Corrections were  made  for   the   proton   detector
            efficiency,  including  the  effect  of  the  proton
            energy threshold (0.7 MeV at  Eg  =  14.7  MeV)  and
            angular acceptance.

COMMENT    The total  cross  section  for photodisintegration of
            deuteron has been measured in the g-ray energy range
            between  15  and 75 MeV,  by use of the monocromatic
            'LADON'  photon  beam  of  the   Frascati   National
            Laboratory and detection of the proton.
