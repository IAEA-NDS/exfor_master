TITLE      STUDY OF THE REACTION HE-4(G,2P2N).
AUTHOR     (A.N.GORBUNOV)
REFERENCE  (J,YF,10,469,69)
INSTITUTE  (4CCPLEB)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4CCPLEB)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) KINEMATICALLY DETERMINED (REACTION
           PARTICLE TAGGED) ENERGY OF INCIDENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           PHOTON.
METHOD     (MAGFR)
DETECTOR   (TRD) CLOUD CHAMBER IN MAGNETIC FIELD.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A HELIUM GAS IN CLOUD CHAMBER.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   BECAUSE THE REACTIONS (G,P) AND (G,2P2N) WERE NOT
           DIFFERENTIATED IN VISUAL SCANNING OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS
           IDENTIFICATION OF THESE EVENTS WAS ACCOMPLISHED
           AFTER MEASUREMENT OF THE CURVATURE OF THE TRACKS.
           THE CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF PROTON AND
           DEUTERON TRACKS WERE: THE TRACK DENSITY, ITS CHANGE
           ALONG THE TRACK, SCATTERING OF THE PARTICLES AT THE
           END OF THE RANGE, THE NUMBER OF GAPS, AND THE NUMBER
           OF DELTA-ELECTRONS PER UNIT LENGTH OF TRACK.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED ONLY. ERRORS
           ASSOCIATED WITH MEASUREMENT OF THE ABSOLUTE
           INTENSITY OF THE RADIATION FROM THE SYNCHROTRON
           WERE ESTIMATED TO BE NOT LARGER THAN 6%.
CORRECTION SINCE TWO NEUTRONS ARE EMITTED IN THE REACTION
           STUDIED, APPLICATION OF THE CONSERVATION LAWS DOES
           NOT ENABLE DETERMINATION UNIQUELY THE ENERGY OF THE
           PHOTON WHICH PRODUCED THE REACTION. HOWEVER, IT CAN
           BE ESTIMATED QUALITATIVELY IF THE ENERGIES OF THE
           NEUTRONS AND PROTONS EMITTED IN THE REACTION WERE
           ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME ON THE AVERAGE. SINCE THE
           CURVATURE MEASUREMENTS WERE DONE FOR EVENTS IN WHICH
           THE ANGLE OF INCLINATION OF THE PROTON TRACKS TO A
           PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD DOES NOT
           EXCEED 30 DEGREES, AN APPROPRIATE GEOMETRICAL
           CORRECTION WAS MADE.
COMMENT    A CLOUD CHAMBER IN A MAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN USED TO
           MEASURE THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE HE-4(G,2P2N)
           REACTION IN THE GAMMA-QUANTA ENERGY RANGE FROM 20 TO
           150 MEV.
