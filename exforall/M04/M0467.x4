INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) Kinematically    determined    (reaction
            particle  tagged)  energy of incident bremsstrahlung
            photon.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     A deuterated  (C(D-2))  and  an   ordinary   (C(H-2))
            polyethelene  targets  were  used.  the targets were
            pressed from polyethelene powder.  the targets  used
            in  the  experiment  were  found  to be sufficiently
            homogeneous with the values N-CD = (4.415 (0.011)) *
            10**21  atoms/cm**2  and  N-CH = (4.3564 (0.0086)) *
            10**21 atoms/cm**2.

DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN) The magnetic spectrometer with plastic
            scintillator detectors in its focal plane.
ANALYSIS   Magnetic spectrometers  have   been   used   in   the
            measurement  and  make  it  possible  to  deduce the
            absolute cross section  values  independent  of  the
            shape   of   the   spectrum   of  primary  radiation
            (bremsstrahlung spectrum),  and also independent  of
            the  calibration detailes of the conventionally used
            radiation monitors.  Effectively,  the ratio of  the
            deuteron  photodisintegration cross section into the
            forward direction,  to the forward direction compton
            electron  production  cross  section  was  measured.
            since the  compton  effect  cross  section  is  well
            known,  the photodisintegration cross section can be
            deduced.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic error was estimated to be be
            about 3%.
           (ERR-T) The total error was estimated to be about 6%.
COMMENT    The absolute   differential  cross  section  for  the
            photodisintegration of the deuteron at 0 degrees for
            the outgoing protons has been measured at lab photon
            energies of 20, 30, 40, 75, 100, and 120 MeV using a
            magnetic spectrometer and a bremsstrahlung beam. The
            absolute cross section values have an error of about
            6% and were determined with an angular resolution of
            1.5 degrees.
