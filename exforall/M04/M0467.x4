TITLE      THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF DEUTERIUM AT 0-DEGREE
           FOR THE OUTGOING PROTONS.

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) KINEMATICALLY DETERMINED (REACTION
           PARTICLE TAGGED) ENERGY OF INCIDENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           PHOTON.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     A DEUTERATED (C(D-2)) AND AN ORDINARY (C(H-2))
           POLYETHELENE TARGETS WERE USED. THE TARGETS
           WERE PRESSED FROM POLYETHELENE POWDER. THE TARGETS
           USED IN THE EXPERIMENT WERE FOUND TO BE SUFFICIENTLY
           HOMOGENEOUS WITH THE VALUES N-CD = (4.415 (0.011)) *
           10**21 ATOMS/CM**2 AND N-CH = (4.3564 (0.0086)) *
           10**21 ATOMS/CM**2.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN) THE MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER WITH PLASTIC
           SCINTILLATOR DETECTORS IN ITS FOCAL PLANE.
ANALYSIS   MAGNETIC SPECTROMETERS HAVE BEEN USED IN THE
           MEASUREMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DEDUCE THE
           ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION VALUES INDEPENDENT OF THE
           SHAPE OF THE SPECTRUM OF PRIMARY RADIATION
            (BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM), AND ALSO INDEPENDENT OF
           THE CALIBRATION DETAILES OF THE CONVENTIONALLY USED
           RADIATION MONITORS. EFFECTIVELY, THE RATIO OF THE
           DEUTERON PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION INTO THE
           FORWARD DIRECTION, TO THE FORWARD DIRECTION COMPTON
           ELECTRON PRODUCTION CROSS SECTION WAS MEASURED. SINCE
           THE COMPTON EFFECT CROSS SECTION IS WELL KNOWN, THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION CAN BE DEDUCED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERROR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
           BE ABOUT 3%.
           (DATA-ERR3) THE TOTAL ERROR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
           ABOUT 6%.
COMMENT    THE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF THE DEUTERON AT 0 DEGREES FOR
           THE OUTGOING PROTONS HAS BEEN MEASURED AT LAB PHOTON
           ENERGIES OF 20, 30, 40, 75, 100, AND 120 MEV USING A
           MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER AND A BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM. THE
           ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION VALUES HAVE AN ERROR OF ABOUT
           6% AND WERE DETERMINED WITH AN ANGULAR RESOLUTION
           OF 1.5 DEGREES.
