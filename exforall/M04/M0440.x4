METHOD     (MAGFR) Nuclear  photoemulsions   in   a   transverse
            homogeneous magnetic field with H = 13500 oe.
SAMPLE     A 4.7 mg/cm*2 beryllium target.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) NIKFI-YA 2 emulsions.
ANALYSIS   Photoparticles were  registered  in  the  interval of
            angles from 20 to 120 degrees with  respect  to  the
            g-quanta  beam direction.  To identify the particles
            the orientation of their tracks in the emulsions was
            measured besides the ranges.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors given for cross section values are
            statistical.
COMMENT    The spectra and angular distribution of  photoprotons
            from  the  reaction  Be-9(g,p) are investigated with
            the aid of the nuclear  photoplates  in  a  magnetic
            field  and  the reaction cross section was obtained.
            Additionally    the    reaction    Be-9(g,d)     was
            investigated.  a  comparatively  high  ratio  of the
            yield of deuterons to that of protons  (Y(d)/Y(p)  =
            0.20(0.10)  at  Ep  >  3.7 MeV and Ed < 14,2 MeV) is
            measured.  The  cross  sections  for  the  reactions
            accompanied  by  deuteron emission were estimated to
            account for 6 to 7%  of the total cross section  for
            the  absorption  of g-quanta with energies from 16.7
            to 35.0 MeV.
