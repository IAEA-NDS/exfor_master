TITLE      ELASTIC PHOTON SCATTERING BETWEEN 9.5 AND 12 MEV
           IN PB-208 AND PB-206.
AUTHOR     (R.D.STARR,P.AXEL,L.S.CARDMAN)

INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
FACILITY   (MICRT,1USAUI) ILLINOIS MICROTRON USING A
           SUPERCONDUCTING LINAC (MUSL-2).
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD)
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE DETECTOR WAS CYLINDRICAL AND WAS ABOUT
           15 CM IN DIAMETER AND 23 CM DEEP.
SAMPLE     TWO PB TARGETS WITH DIFFERENT ISOTOPIC ENRICHMENT
           WERE USED TO SEPARATE THE SCATTERING DUE TO PB-208
           AND PB-206. A PBC(O-3) POWDER TARGET THAT WAS PACKED
           INTO A LUCITE BOX WAS ENRICHED IN PB-208; IT CONTAINED
           72.6% PB-208, 25.8% PB-206, AND 1.6% PB-207. THE
           TARGET ENRICHED IN PB-206 WAS A SOLID METAL WHICH
           CONTAINED 88.3% PB-206, 2.7% PB-208, AND 9.0% PB-207.

ANALYSIS   DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF CROSS SECTION VALUES FOR
           COINCIDENCE COUNTS BETWEEN THE TAGGED ELECTRONS FROM
           MICROTRON AND THE SCATTERING GAMMA-QUANTA DETECTOR.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED ONLY. THE
           SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES WERE ESTIMATED TO BE
           PROBABLY LESS THAN 10%.  FOR THE SMALLEST MEASURED
           CROSS SECTIONS (I.E., EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 0.03
           MB/SR) THERE ARE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY
           THE DIFFICULTY OF SEPARATING RELIABLY THE ELASTIC
           SCATTERING PEAK FROM THE BACKGROUND IN THE GAMMA-RAY
           SPECTRUM MEASURED WITH THE NAI PHOTON DETECTOR. THE
           DATA POINTS BELOW 9.7 MEV FOR PB-208 AND BELOW 10 MEV
           FOR ENRICHED PB-206 TARGET MIGHT, THEREFORE, HAVE
           LARGER SYSTEMATIC ERRORS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS FOR GEOMETRIC FACTORS AND FOR THE ATOMIC
           ABSORPTION OF PHOTONS IN THE TARGETS MAY HAVE
           CONTRIBUTED AN UNCERTAINTY OF 5% OR LESS.
COMMENT    THE ELASTIC PHOTON SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS OF
           PB-208 AND PB-206 WERE MEASURED AT 90 AND 135
           DEGREES IN THE ENERGY RANGE FROM 9.5 TO 12 MEV WITH A
           TAGGED PHOTON BEAM WHOSE ENERGY SPREAD WAS ABOUT 125
           KEV. THE PB-206 CROSS SECTION RISES MONOTONICALLY
           WITH ENERGY, AND IS CONSISTENT WITH A TOTAL PHOTON
           INTERACTION CROSS SECTION WHICH HAS A LORENTZIAN
           ENERGY DEPENDENCE WITH A PEAK CROSS SECTION OF 650 MB
           AT 13.6 MEV AND A WIDTH ABOUT 3.8 MEV. THE PB-208
           SCATTERING CROSS SECTION IS LARGER AND HAS SOME RAPID
           VARIATIONS WITH ENERGY; THERE IS A NARROW EXTRA PEAK
           NEAR 10.04 MEV AND THERE ARE ABRUPT INCREASES IN THE
           CROSS SECTION JUST BELOW 10.6 AND 11.3 MEV. THE
           RELATIVE SCATTERING OBSERVED AT THE TWO ANGLES
           INDICATES THAT ALL OF THE SCATTERING, INCLUDING THE
           RAPID VARIATIONS WITH ENERGY, IS DOMINATED DY DIPOLE
           INTERACTIONS.
