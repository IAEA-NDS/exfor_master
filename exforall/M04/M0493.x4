TITLE      Elastic photon scattering between 9.5 and 12  MeV  in
            Pb-208 and Pb-206.

REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,25,780,1982)
INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
FACILITY   (MICRT,1USAUI) Illinois     microtron     using     a
            superconducting linac (MUSL-2).
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD)
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detector was cylindrical and was about 15
            cm in diameter and 23 cm deep.
ANALYSIS   Direct measurements  of  cross  section  values   for
            coincidence counts between the tagged electrons from
            microtron and the scattering gamma-quanta detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are presented only.
           (ERR-SYS,,10.) The  systematic   uncertainties   were
            estimated  to  be  probably  less than 10%.  For the
            smallest measured cross sections (i.e.,  equal to or
            less   than   0.03   mb/sr)   there  are  additional
            uncertainties caused by the difficulty of separating
            reliably   the  elastic  scattering  peak  from  the
            background in the gamma-ray spectrum  measured  with
            the  NaI photon detector.  The data points below 9.7
            MeV for Pb-208 and below 10 MeV for enriched  Pb-206
            target  might,  therefore,  have  larger  systematic
            errors.
CORRECTION Corrections for  geometric factors and for the atomic
            absorption  of  photons  in  the  targets  may  have
            contributed an uncertainty of 5% or less.
COMMENT    The elastic  photon  scattering  cross  sections   of
            Pb-208  and Pb-206 were measured at 90 and 135 degr.
            in the energy range from 9.5 to 12 MeV with a tagged
            photon  beam  whose  energy spread was about 125 keV
            The Pb-206 cross section  rises  monotonically  with
            energy,  and  is  consistent  with  a  total  photon
            interaction cross section  which  has  a  Lorentzian
            energy  dependence  with a peak cross section of 650
            mb at 13.6 MeV and a width about 3.8 MeV. The Pb-208
            scattering  cross  section  is  larger  and has some
            rapid variations with  energy;  there  is  a  narrow
            extra  peak  near  10.04  MeV  and  there are abrupt
            increases in the cross section just below  10.6  and
            11.3  MeV.  The  relative scattering observed at the
            two angles indicates that  all  of  the  scattering,
            including  the  rapid  variations  with  energy,  is
            dominated by dipole interactions.
