ANALYSIS   The activity of the Th-231 was measured by 84 keV
            line after waiting 16.hr in order to allow the Th-233
            that can be formed, to decay.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include those arising from
           statistic and calibration.
CORRECTION Since the neutron capture targets employed emit
            also some secondary lines, although with low
            relative intensity with respect to the principal
            line, it is necessary to correct their contribution,
            solving a linear equation system of special type.
            Using the special equations presented by Caldwell
            the cross section measured have been recalculating
            for variation of the average number of neutrons as
            a function of the excitation energy.

COMMENT    The photoneutron cross section of Th-232 was
            measured by activation methods using monochromatic
            gamma-rays of energies from 5.43 to 10.83 MeV. The
            data for photofission of Th-232 together with the
            data of both types for U-238 are presented.
