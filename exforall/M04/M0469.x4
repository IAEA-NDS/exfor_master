TITLE      Photodisintegration of He3.
FACILITY   (BETAT,1USAUI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     The target chamber was constracted of brass, with
           thin alumiseal (a mylar-aluminium laminate) windows.
           The target chamber was filled with 3He gas at
           slightly less than atmospheric pressure, so that
           the chamber was a constant-volume device of 0.5
           liter capacity.
METHOD     (COINC,PHD,PSD) Proton-deuteron coincidencies.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two CsI(Tl) crystals.

ANALYSIS   Coincidencies were demanded between the proton and
           deuteron from the two-body 3He disintegration. The
           particle energies were determined by pulse-height
           measurement, and electrons were rejected by pulse-
           shape analysis. The yield was obtained from the
           corrected numbers of p-d coincidencies and then was
           used for obtaining the differential cross section
           for two-body 3He disintegration. The three-body
           3He disintegration cross section was obtained with
           the aid of p-p events.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical and total errors are presented.
            Systematic error was estimated to be about
            5%.
COMMENT    The 90-degrees photodisintegration cross sections for
           3He were measured for incident photon energies
           between 8.5 and 21.5 MeV by detecting proton-deuteron
           coincidencies in CsI(Tl) scintillators immersed in
           1 atm gas. The source of gamma-quanta was the
           Bremsstrahlung beam of the University of Illinois
           22 MeV betatron. The particle energies were
           determined by pulse-height measurement, and electrons
           were rejected by pulse-shape analysis.
