TITLE      PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF HE-3.

INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
FACILITY   (BETAT,1USAUI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (COINC,PHD,PSD) PROTON-DEUTERON COINCIDENCIES.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET CHAMBER WAS CONSTRACTED OF BRASS, WITH
           THIN ALUMISEAL (A MYLAR-ALUMINIUM LAMINATE) WINDOWS.
           THE TARGET CHAMBER WAS FILLED WITH HE-3 GAS AT
           SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, SO THAT
           THE CHAMBER WAS A CONSTANT-VOLUME DEVICE OF O.5
           LITER CAPACITY.
PART-DET   (P)
           (D)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) TWO CSI(TL) CRYSTALS.
ANALYSIS   COINCIDENCIES WERE DEMANDED BETWEEN THE PROTON AND
           DEUTERON FROM THE TWO-BODY HE-3 DISINTEGRATION. THE
           PARTICLE ENERGIES WERE DETERMINED BY PULSE-HEIGHT
           MEASUREMENT, AND ELECTRONS WERE REJECTED BY PULSE-
           SHAPE ANALYSIS. THE YIELD WAS OBTAINED FROM THE
           CORRECTED NUMBERS OF P-D COINCIDENCIES AND THEN WAS
           USED FOR OBTAINING THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION
           FOR TWO-BODY HE-3 DISINTEGRATION. THE THREE-BODY
           HE-3 DISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED WITH
           THE AID OF P-P EVENTS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) STATISTICAL AND TOTAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
           (DATA-ERR2) SYSTEMATIC ERROR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT
           OF  5%.
COMMENT    THE 90-DEGREES PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTIONS FOR
           HE-3 WERE MEASURED FOR INCIDENT PHOTON ENERGIES
           BETWEEN 8.5 AND 21.5 MEV BY DETECTING PROTON-DEUTERON
           COINCIDENCIES IN CSI(TL) SCINTILLATORS IMMERSED IN
           1 ATM GAS. THE SOURCE OF GAMMA-QUANTA WAS THE
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
           22 MEV BETATRON. THE PARTICLE ENERGIES WERE
           DETERMINED BY PULSE-HEIGHT MEASUREMENT, AND ELECTRONS
           WERE REJECTED BY PULSE-SHAPE ANALYSIS.
