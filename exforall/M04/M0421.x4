INC-SOURCE (MPH=(58-CE-140(N,G)58-CE-141)) Additionally   a  few
            radioactive nucleus  sources  were  used  (were  not
            identified).
SAMPLE     The Ta and Pb scattering targets were metallic sheets
            about  1 cm thick and 10 x 10 cm in area with masses
            of 1600 and 1400 g respectively. The uranium scatter
            consisted   of   600   g  U-3(O-8)  powder  and  had
            dimensions of 10 x 12 x 2 cm.

ANALYSIS   From the rate of elastically  scattered  photons  and
            from  the  strength  of  the direct beam the elastic
            differential cross  section  has  been  obtained  by
            means of a geometrical factor.
