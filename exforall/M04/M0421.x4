           ADDITIONALLY A FEW RADIOACTIVE NUCLEUS SOURCES
           WERE USED (WERE NOT IDENTIFIED).
SAMPLE     THE TA AND PB SCATTERING TARGETS WERE MATALLIC
           SHEETS ABOUT 1 CM THICK AND 10 X 10 CM IN AREA
           WITH MASSES OF 1600 AND 1400 G RESPECTIVELY.
           THE URANIUM SCATTER CONSISTED OF 600 G U-3(O-8)
           POWDER AND HAD DIMENSIONS OF 10 X 12 X 2 CM.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
PART-DET   (G)
ANALYSIS   FROM THE RATE OF ELASTICALLY SCATTERED PHOTONS
           AND FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE DIRECT BEAM THE
           ELASTIC DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN
           OBTAINED BY MEANS OF A GEOMETRICAL FACTOR.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
