TITLE      EVIDENCE FOR COULOMB CORRECTION EFFECT IN
           DELBRUCK SCATTERING OF 9.0 AND 7.9 MEV PHOTONS

ANALYSIS   TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS
           WERE USED. THE FIRST, AT ANGLES 1.2 AND 1.5
           DEGREES, UTILISED A SHADOW BEAM GEOMETRY IN WHICH
           THE ELASTIC CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED BY
           COMPARING THE AREA OF THE ELASTIC PEAK TO THE
           NEIBOURING COMPTON PEAK IN THE SAME SCATTERED
           SPECTRUM. THE SECOND MEASUREMENT, FOR THE RANGE
           OF ANGLES 25 - 140 DEGREES, USED THE CONVENTIONAL
           METHOD OF COMPARING THE INTENSITY OF ELASTICALLY
           SCATTERED G-LINE WITH THAT IN THE INCIDENT BEAM.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE DUE TO STATISTICS AND TO
           EXPERIMENTAL AND GEOMETRICAL UNCERTAINTIES.
