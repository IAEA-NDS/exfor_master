ANALYSIS   Two entirely different experimental arrangements were
            used.  The  first,  at  angles  1.2 and 1.5 degrees,
            utilised a shadow beam geometry in which the elastic
            cross  section was obtained by comparing the area of
            the elastic peak to the neighbouring Compton peak in
            the same scattered spectrum. The second measurement,
            for the range of angles 25 - 140 degrees,  used  the
            conventional  method  of  comparing the intensity of
            elastically  scattered  g-line  with  that  in   the
            incident beam.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors  are  due  to  statistics  and
            to experimental and geometrical uncertainties.
