SAMPLE     THE DEPLETED U-238 FOIL OF 3.2 MM THICKNESS
            (4.3 MG/CM**2).
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,DIFFR) THE CROSS SECTION WAS DERIVED FROM THE
            EXPERIMENTAL YIELD CURVE AS THE APPROXIMATED SOLUTION
            BY THE PHOTON DIFFERENCE METHOD.
CORRECTION CORRECTION FOR SPONTANEOUS FISSION RATE OF THE SAMPLE
            WAS DONE SIMPLY BY MEASURING THE TIME DURING WHICH
            THE MICA WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE SAMPLE, AND
            CALCULATING THE TRACK-DENSITY CORRECTION FROM THE
            KNOWN SPONTANIOUS FISSION HALF-LIFE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS ARE THE QUADRATIC SUMS OF THE
            STANDARD DEVIATIONS RESULTING FROM TRACK COUNTINGS
            AND AN ESTIMATED (NEAR 20%) UNCERTAINTY IN THE
            BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM.
COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-238 WAS MEASURED
           IN THE 2.75 TO 5.75 MEV RANGE. CROSS SECTION AS
           SMALL AS 2 * 10**(-11) BARNS WERE DETECTED. A SHELF
           WAS OBSERVED WHICH HAD BEEN PREDICTED TO OCCUR IN THE
           CROSS SECTION OWING TO THE DOMINANCE OF RADIATIVE
           DECAY OF LEVELS IN THE SECOND WELL OF THE POTENTIAL
           BARRIER OF U-238.
