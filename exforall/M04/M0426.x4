DETECTOR   (TRD) Mica-foil track detector.

SAMPLE     The depleted u-238 foil of 3.2 mm thickness
            (4.3 mg/cm**2).
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,DIFFR) The  cross section was derived from the
            experimental  yield  curve   as   the   approximated
            solution by the photon difference method.
CORRECTION Correction for spontaneous fission rate of the sample
            was  done  simply by measuring the time during which
            the  mica  was  in  contact  with  the  sample,  and
            calculating  the  track-density  correction from the
            known spontaneous fission half-life.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The  errors  are the quadratic sums of the
            standard deviations resulting from  track  countings
            and  an  estimated  (near  20%)  uncertainty  in the
            bremsstrahlung spectrum.
COMMENT    The photofission  cross section of U-238 was measured
            in the 2.75 to 5.75  MeV  range.  Cross  section  as
            small as 2 * 10**(-11) barns were detected.  A shelf
            was observed which had been predicted  to  occur  in
            the   cross   section  owing  to  the  dominance  of
            radiative decay of levels in the second well of  the
            potential barrier of U-238.
