INC-SOURCE (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G)))     Radiative capture photons are
           compton scattered from a curved aluminium plate. The
           energy of scattered photons was easily varied by
           rotating and bending the scattering plate.
SAMPLE     the targets of U-238 (enriched to 99.97%, 7.77
           mg/cm**2) and U-235 (enriched to 97.68%, 7.25
           mg/cm**2) were the cylindrical metal foil targets
           5.08 cm high and 2.22 cm diameter.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Heavy-ion surface barrier detectors.
           The experimental yield curves were measured using four
            detectors were mounted at 45 and 135 degrees with
            respect to the incident photon beam.
PART-DET   (FF)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,UNFLD,LEAST) The net yield curve was obtained
            by normalization of the raw yield data followed by
            background substraction from the total photofission
            yield.
           The average photofission cross section was determined
            by unfolding the beam spectra from the net
            photofission yield curve using the least-structure
            method. Applying the appropriate target, counting
            efficiency, and normalization factors to the average
            cross section, the absolute cross cross section value
            were obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The errors are the uncertainties due to
           propagation of the yield point statistical errors
           through the unfolding equations. The systematic errors
           were estimated to be about 30%.
COMMENT    Cross sections extracted from measured yield curves
           are reported for photofission of U-238 and U-235.
           The monoenergetic photons were obtained by compton
           scattering g-rays produced by neutron capture in a
           nickel plate near the core of the 5 mw ames
           laboratory research reactor. An unfolding procedure
           was used to extract the smoothed cross sections from
           the measured yield curves. In the U-238(g,f) cross
           section, prominent structure is observed at 6.2 MeV
           and 7.6 MeV with hints of structure at 5.5 MeV and
           7.0 MeV. The U-235(g,f) cross section shows
           pronounced structure at 5.9 MeV, 6.6 MeV, and 7.5
           MeV with a hint of structure at 5.4 MeV.
