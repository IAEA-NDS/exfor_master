SAMPLE     The target was a  vertical  mylar  cylinder  (4.0  cm
            diameter,  10  cm  high,  wall  thickness  0.08 mm),
            filled with liquid deuterium.

ANALYSIS   Proton spectra were simultaneously recorded at 5  lab
            angles  from 32.5 to 130 degrees with respect to the
            photon beam and at 7  annihilation  photon  energies
            from 100 to 260 MeV.  The proton energies also being
            measured,    The    reaction    is     kinematically
            overdetermined.  The photon energy spectra were also
            measured by pair spectrometer. Only the peaks in the
            proton and phoron spectra were used to determine the
            cross section. Moreover, by use this program, it was
            also possible to determine the cross section also in
            the bremsstrahlung tail region.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic  errors are only estimated to be
            about 5%.
COMMENT    Differential cross   sections   for   the    reaction
            H-2(g,p)n  were  measured  at five laboratory angles
            from 32 to 130 degrees, for photon energies from 100
            to  220  MeV.  A  quasimonochromatic photon beam was
            used and the photon spectrum was measured on line by
            a  pair  spectrometer.  The energy resolution may be
            estimated as be about 10%  using the published  data
            on  on-line  measurement  of  photon  spectrum.  The
            absolute normalization uncertainty is within 5%.
