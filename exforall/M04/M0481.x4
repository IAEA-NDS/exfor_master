DETECTOR   (SCIN,NAICR)
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A VERTICAL MYLAR CYLINDER (4.0 CM
           DIAMETER, 10 CM HIGH, WALL THICKNESS 0.08 MM),
           FILLED WITH LIQUID DEUTERIUM.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   PROTON SPECTRA WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED AT  5
           LAB ANGLES FROM 32.5 TO 130 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO
           THE PHOTON BEAM AND AT 7 ANNIHILATION PHOTON ENERGIES
           FROM 100 TO 260 MEV. THE PROTON ENERGIES ALSO BEING
           MEASURED, THE REACTION IS KINEMATICALLY OVER-
           DETERMINED. THE PHOTON ENERGY SPECTRA WERE ALSO
           MEASURED BY PAIR SPECTROMETER. ONLY THE PEAKS IN THE
           PROTON AND PHORON SPECTRA WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE
           CROSS SECTION. MOREOVER, BY USE THIS PROGRAM, IT
           WAS ALSO POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE CROSS SECTION ALSO
           IN THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG TAIL REGION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT 5%.
COMMENT    DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE REACTION
           H-2(G,P)N WERE MEASURED AT FIVE LABORATORY ANGLES
           FROM 32 TO 130 DEGREES, FOR PHOTON ENERGIES FROM
           100 TO 220 MEV. A QUASIMONOCHROMATIC PHOTON BEAM
           WAS USED AND THE PHOTON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED ON
           LINE BY A PAIR SPECTROMETER. THE ENERGY RESOLUTION
           MAY BE ESTIMATED AS BE ABOUT 10% USING THE
           PUBLISHED DATA ON ON-LINE MEASUREMENT OF PHOTON
           SPECTRUM. THE ABSOLUTE NORMALIZATION UNCERTAINTY
           IS WITHIN 5%.
