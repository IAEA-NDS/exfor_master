SAMPLE     THE U-233 AND PU-239 SAMPLES CONTAINED 52.4 AND
           51.4 MG RESPECTIVELY, DEPOSITED IN THE FORM OF
           U-3(O-8) AND PU(O-2) ON FOUR TITANIUM DISKS,
           EACH WITH AN ACTIVE DIAMETER OF 40 MM.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (TRD) MAKROFOL FOILS (8 MU).
PART-DET   (FF)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE REACTION CROSS SECTION.
           THE MAKROFOL FOILS AND THE U-233 AND PU-239 SAMPLES
           WERE IRRADIATED IN THE FORM OF 'SANDWICHES'
           SEPARATELY. AFTER THESE IRRADIATIONS THE TRACKS
           CREATED BY THE FISSION FRAGMENTS IN THE MAKROFOL
           FOILS WERE ETCHED. FINALLY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
           TRACKS WAS COUNTED BY AN AUTOMATIC SPARK COUNTING
           CHAMBER.
ERR-ANALYS TOTAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED. THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
           WERE ESTIMATED FOR THE PHOTON FLUX CALIBRATIONS AS
           11-13%, FISSION DETECTOR EFFICIENCY AS 3.1%, MASS
           DETERMINATION AS 2%, AND SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLES
           AS 4-5%.
           STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE ABOUT 2-5%.
COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF U-233 AND PU-239
           HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY USING MONOCROMATIC AND DISCRETE
           PHOTONS, IN THE ENERGY INTERVAL FROM 5.43 TO 9.72
           MEV, PRODUCED BY THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE.
