TITLE      Nuclear fission of Au-197, Pb-nat, and Bi-209 induced
            by polarized and monocromatic photons of
            60 and 64 MeV.

INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Electron storage ring 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Monocromatic  'LADON'  photon  beam obtained by
            Compton backscattering of laser light  by  electrons
            circulating in storage ring.
SAMPLE     stacks of 24 thin foils of  gold,  natural  lead  and
            bismuth on thin mylar sheets.
METHOD     (STTA)
DETECTOR   (TRD) MAKROFOL fission-track detectors.
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement  of  the  reaction  cross section.
            After the etching  of  the  MAKROFOL  detector,  the
            identification and counting of fission fragments was
            realized by three observers for each detector, using
            optical microscopes. Finally-taking into account the
            factors of identification efficiency,  geometry  and
            track    counting,    as    well   as   effects   of
            self-absorption   by    target-photofossion    cross
            sections were obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    Experimental results on fission cross section and the
            fissionability of the Au-197,  Pb-nat, and Bi-209 at
            photon  energies  60  and 64 MeV are presented.  The
            experimental photofission cross sections  were  used
            to  evaluate the total nuclear photoabsorption cross
            sections: sig(g,abs)=0.089*a**0.97 mb at en = 60 MeV
            and  sig(g,abs)  = 0.060*a**1.042 mb at en = 64 MeV.
            The photon beam was  obtained  by  backward  Compton
            scattering   of   laser   light   on  the  electrons
            circulating in ADONE storage ring. The main features
            of  this  beam  are a satisfactory energy resolution
            (up to 10%  fwhm,  at maximum energy),  an extremely
            low  background  (about  5%  integrated  over  whole
            spectrum above 2 MeV),  an intensity of about  10**5
            g/s and almost complete linear polarization.
