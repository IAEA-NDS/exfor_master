SAMPLE     The target was a conventional 7 liter, liquid helium
            dewar. While runnung, the dewar was pressured to
            0.034 atm to minimize the loss rate and reduce
            thermal density variations.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) With reasonably high statistical accuracy
            the reaction cross section simultaneously have been
            measured at five laboratory angles between 30 and
            142 degrees. Differential cross sections were
            obtained by comparing the He-4(g,n)He-3 and
            H-2(g,n)H-1 cross sections. The latter were obtained
            from alternating runs with D(2)O and H(2)O in an
            identical target configuration as that used for
            helium. for the deuterium cross section, the
            experimental results were normalized to the
            calculation of Partovi. Differential cross sections
            were used to obtain the total cross section.

CORRECTION The photoneutron energy spectra were first
            corrected for counting losses (< 2%), and
            background was substracted. corrections for neutron
            scattering and absorption within the target were
            made with a monte-carlo method. the contribution
            of neutrons from other competing channels was
            assessed by comparing data taken at lower incident
            electron energies. the other neutron producing
            channels, contributing < 10% to the spectra, were
            substracted where necessary from the data.
COMMENT    The He-4(g,n)He-3 differential cross section has
            been simultaneously measured at five laboratory
            angles between 30 and 142 degrees, from threshold
            to 110 MeV. The asymmetry in the angular distribution
            from 24 to 70 MeV has been extracted and found to
            have sign changes at energies which are in accord
            with the previous experiments. The total photo-
            neutron cross section has been observed to be close
            to the known (g,p) cross section. From the energy
            dependence of the asymmetry coefficient a 2+ state
            in He-4 at energy of about 35 MeV has been confirmed.
CRITIQUE   EN-CM in the capture to Fig.1 is the mistake.
