SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A CONVENTIONAL 7 LITER, LIQUID HELIUM
           DEWAR. WHILE RUNNUNG, THE DEWAR WAS PRESSURED TO
           0.034 ATM TO MINIMIZE THE LOSS RATE AND REDUCE
           THERMAL DENSITY VARIATIONS.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) WITH REASONABLY HIGH STATISTICAL ACCURACY
           THE REACTION CROSS SECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVE BEEN
           MEASURED AT FIVE LABORATORY ANGLES BETWEEN 30 AND
           142 DEGREES. DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS WERE
           OBTAINED BY COMPARING THE HE-4(G,N)HE-3 AND
           H-2(G,N)H-1 CROSS SECTIONS. THE LATTER WERE OBTAINED
           FROM ALTERNATING RUNS WITH D(2)O AND H(2)O IN AN
           IDENTICAL TARGET CONFIGURATION AS THAT USED FOR
           HELIUM. FOR THE DEUTERIUM CROSS SECTION, THE
           EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WERE NORMALIZED TO THE
           CALCULATION OF PARTOVI. DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS
           WERE USED TO OBTAIN THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION.

CORRECTION THE PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRA WERE FIRST
           CORRECTED FOR COUNTING LOSSES (< 2%), AND
           BACKGROUND WAS SUBSTRACTED. CORRECTIONS FOR NEUTRON
           SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION WITHIN THE TARGET WERE
           MADE WITH A MONTE-CARLO METHOD. THE CONTRIBUTION
           OF NEUTRONS FROM OTHER COMPETING CHANNELS WAS
           ASSESSED BY COMPARING DATA TAKEN AT LOWER INCIDENT
           ELECTRON ENERGIES. THE OTHER NEUTRON PRODUCING
           CHANNELS, CONTRIBUTING < 10% TO THE SPECTRA, WERE
           SUBSTRACTED WHERE NECESSARY FROM THE DATA.
COMMENT    THE HE-4(G,N)HE-3 DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION HAS
           BEEN SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURED AT FIVE LABORATORY
           ANGLES BETWEEN 30 AND 142 DEFREES, FROM THRESHOLD
           TO 110 MEV. THE ASYMMETRY IN THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
           FROM 24 TO 70 MEV HAS BEEN EXTRACTED AND FOUND TO
           HAVE SIGN CHANGES AT ENERGIES WHICH ARE IN ACCORD
           WITH THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS. THE TOTAL PHOTO-
           NEUTRON CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO BE CLOSE
           TO THE KNOWN (G,P) CROSS SECTION. FROM THE ENERGY
           DEPENDENCE OF THE ASYMMETRY COEFFICIENT A 2+ STATE
           IN HE-4 AT ENERGY OF ABOUT 35 MEV HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.
