INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) Electron storage ring 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (MPH,LCS)  Monochromatic 'LADON' photon beam obtained
            by   compton   backscattering   of  laser  light  by
            electrons circulating in storage ring.
SAMPLE     The target  was  a very thin (0.16 mm) aluminium tube
            (15 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter),  with  two
            lexan and caps filled with deuterium or hydrogen (in
            turn) at high pressure (30 atm).
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Liquid scintillator NE213.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   Direct measurement of  the  reaction  cross  section.
            Data were taken in several runs for effective photon
            mean energies eg = 14.7,  19.3,  28.9,  38.2,  47.5,
            57.5,  and 74.0 MeV, with deuterium and hydrogen gas
            (for background measurements)  in  turn  as  target.
            data   were   also   taken   with   use   only   the
            bremsstrahlung component of the beam.
CORRECTION Corrections were   made   for   the  proton  detector
            efficiency,  including  the  effect  of  the  proton
            energy  threshold  (0.7  MeV  at  Eg = 14.7 MeV) and
            angular acceptance.

COMMENT    The total cross section  for  photodisintegration  of
            deuteron has been measured in the g-ray energy range
            between 15 and 75 MeV,  by use of  the  monocromatic
            LADON photon beam and detection of the protons.
