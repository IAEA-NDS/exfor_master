INSTITUTE  (2ITYFRA)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,2ITYFRA) ELECTRON STORAGE RING 'ADONE'.
INC-SOURCE (MPH,COMPT) MONOCROMATIC 'LADON' PHOTON BEAM
           OBTAINED BY COMPTON BACKSCATTERING OF LASER LIGHT
           BY ELECTRONS CIRCULATING IN STORAGE RING.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET WAS A VERY THIN (0.16 MM) ALUMINIUM TUBE
            (15 CM IN LENGTH AND 1.5 CM IN DIAMETER), WITH
           TWO LEXAN END CAPS FILLED WITH DEUTERIUM OR
           HIDROGEN (IN TURN) AT HIGH PRESSURE (30 ATM).
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR NE213.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE REACTION CROSS SECTION.
           DATA WERE TAKEN IN SEVERAL RUNS FOR EFFECTIVE PHOTON
           MEAN ENERGIES EG = 14.7, 19.3, 28.9, 38.2, 47.5,
           57.5, AND 74.0 MEV, WITH DEUTERIUM AND HYDROGEN GAS
            (FOR BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS) IN TURN AS TARGET.
           DATA WERE ALSO TAKEN WITH USE ONLY THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           COMPONENT OF THE BEAM.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE PROTON DETECTOR
           EFFICIENCY, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PROTON ENERGY
           THRESHOLD (0.7 MEV AT EG = 14.7 MEV) AND ANGULAR
           ACCEPTANCE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) STATISTICAL ERRORS.
COMMENT    THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF
           DEUTERON HAS BEEN MEASURED IN THE G-RAY ENERGY RANGE
           BETWEEN 15 AND 75 MEV, BY USE OF THE MONOCROMATIC
           LADON PHOTON BEAM AND DETECTION OF THE PROTONS.
