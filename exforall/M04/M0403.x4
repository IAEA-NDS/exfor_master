SAMPLE     The natural-carbon graphite sample was in form  of  a
            cylinder, 70 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)

ANALYSIS   The absolute  differential cross section was obtained
            with the aid of such quantities as effective  number
            of  C-12  nuclei  per cm**2,  the solid angle of the
            neutron detector (14.6 msr),  the number  of  tagged
            photons,  the  neutron-detection efficiency for each
            neutron energy,  and the neutron-attenuation factor.
            In  order to derive the cross sections to ground and
            low-lying excited states  of  C-11,  gaussians  were
            fitted   to  neutron  spectra.  The  gaussians  were
            centered at energies of E-exc = 0, 2.0, 4.6 (average
            of 4.3 and 4.8),  6.5, and 8.1 MeV, corresponding to
            low-lying states in C-11.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-1) Systematic errors were estimated as 7% due to
            neutron-detection  efficiency,  6%  due  to  neutron
            scattering   correction,   and  3%  due  to  tagging
            efficiency
CORRECTION The corrections were made for scattering of neutrons.
COMMENT    A measurements of the differential photoneutron cross
            section of C-12 at 65-degrees,  between Eg = 30  and
            100 MeV are reported.  Tagged photons,  monocromatic
            to within 2.6 mev,  were  used,  thus  allowing  the
            cross sections to a wide range of final states to be
            observed.
