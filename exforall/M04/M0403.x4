TITLE      C-12 CROSS SECTION FROM 30 TO 100 MEV.

SAMPLE     THE NATURAL-CARBON GRAPHITE SAMPLE WAS IN FORM OF A
           CYLINDER, 70 MM IN DIAMETER AND 100 MM IN LENGTH.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
PART-DET   (N)
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED
           WITH THE AID OF SUCH QUANTITIES AS EFFECTIVE NUMBER
           OF C-12 NUCLEI PER CM**2, THE SOLID ANGLE OF THE
           NEUTRON DETECTOR (14.6 MSR), THE NUMBER OF TAGGED
           PHOTONS, THE NEUTRON-DETECTION EFFICIENCY FOR EACH
           NEUTRON ENERGY, AND THE NEUTRON-ATTENUATION FACTOR.
           IN ORDER TO DERIVE THE CROSS SECTIONS TO GROUND AND
           LOW-LYING EXCITED STATES OF C-11, GAUSSIANS WERE
           FITTED TO NEUTRON SPECTRA. THE GAUSSIANS WERE CENTERED
           AT ENERGIES OF E-EXC = 0, 2.0, 4.6 (AVERAGE OF 4.3 AND
           4.8), 6.5, AND 8.1 MEV, CORRESPONDING TO LOW-LYING
           STATES IN C-11.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WERE ESTIMATED AS 7% DUE
           TO NEUTRON-DETECTION EFFICIENCY, 6% DUE TO NEUTRON
           SCATTERING CORRECTION, AND 3% DUE TO TAGGING EFFICIENCY
CORRECTION THE CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS.
COMMENT    A MEASUREMENTS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL PHOTONEUTRON CROSS
           SECTION OF C-12 AT 65-DEGREES, BETWEEN EG = 30 AND
           100 MEV ARE REPORTED. TAGGED PHOTONS, MONOCROMATIC TO
           WITHIN 2.6 MEV, WERE USED, THUS ALLOWING THE CROSS
           SECTIONS TO A WIDE RANGE OF FINAL STATES TO BE
           OBSERVED.
