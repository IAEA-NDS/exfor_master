TITLE      Photodisintegration of He-4.

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) The Bremsstrahlung source of incident
            gamma-quanta. But for He-4(gamma,p)H-3 reaction one
            has a breakup into two particles which do not have
            excited states. The measured angle and energy of
            only one of the emitted particles therefore
            determine the energy of the gamma-quantum that
            produced the reaction.
METHOD     (MAGFR) Quadrupole triplet.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Semiconductor detector.
SAMPLE     The He-4 gas target.
ANALYSIS   For experimental reasons, tritons could be detected
            only in the higher gamma ray energy region. The low
            energy region had to be studied by measuring protons,
            although protons from the three-body (d,p,n) and
            four-body (p,p,n,n) breakup reactions interfere. The
            contribution of these reactions which have higher
            thresholds (26 and 28 MeV, respectively) was however,
            minimized by working at a low maximum Bremsstrahlung
            energy of 40 MeV. By alternating the He-4 target with
            a H-2 target, the He-4 cross section was obtained
            relative to that of the deuteron photodisintegration.
            To convert to an absolute cross section, a
            theoretical cross section for the photodisintegration
            of deuteron as calculated by Donnachie and O'Donnell
            was used (solution with 6% d-state and retardation
            included). In analyzing of multipolarity of cross
            section it was assumed that coefficient 'beta' which
            determine the E2 term varies from 0.2 at Eg = 27 MeV
            to 0.7 at Eg = 52 MeV. Therefore the error in the
            cross section arising from the inaccurately known
            value of 'beta' does not exceed about 10%, even for
            the highest energies in this experiment.
REL-REF    (R,,A.Donnachie+,J,NP,53,128,1964) Theoretical data on
           deuteron photodisintegration cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are presented only.
            An error in the cross section arising from the
            inaccurately known value of coefficient 'beta' which
            determine the electrical quadrupole component in the
            measured dipole component was estimated to be not
            larger than 10%.
