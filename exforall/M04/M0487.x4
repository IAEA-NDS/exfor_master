TITLE      PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF HE-4.
AUTHOR     (H.G.CLERC,R.J.STEWART,R.C.MORRISON)

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAYAL)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG SOURCE OF INCIDENT
           GAMMA-QUANTA. BUT FOR HE-4(G,P)H-3 REACTION ONE
           HAS A BREAKUP INTO TWO PARTICLES WHICH DO NOT HAVE
           EXCITED STATES. THE MEASURED ANGLE AND ENERGY OF
           ONLY ONE OF THE EMITTED PARTICLES THEREFORE
           DETERMINE THE ENERGY OF THE GAMMA-QUANTUM THAT
           PRODUCED THE REACTION.
METHOD     (MAGFR) QUADRUPOLE TRIPLET.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     THE HE-4 GAS TARGET.
ANALYSIS   FOR EXPERIMENTAL REASONS, TRITONS COULD BE DETECTED
           ONLY IN THE HIGHER GAMMA RAY ENERGY REGION. THE LOW
           ENERGY REGION HAD TO BE STUDIED BY MEASURING PROTONS,
           ALTHOUGH PROTONS FROM THE THREE-BODY (D,P,N) AND
           FOUR-BODY (P,P,N,N) BREAKUP REACTIONS INTERFERE. THE
           CONTRIBUTION OF THESE REACTIONS WHICH HAVE HIGHER
           THRESHOLDS (26 AND 28 MEV, RESPECTIVELY) WAS HOWEVER,
           MINIMIZED BY WORKING AT A LOW MAXIMUM BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           ENERGY OF 40 MEV. BY ALTERNATING THE HE-4 TARGET WITH
           A H-2 TARGET, THE HE-4 CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED
           RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE DEUTERON PHOTODISINTEGRATION.
           TO CONVERT TO AN ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION, A
           THEORETICAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           OF DEUTERON AS CALCULATED BY DONNACHIE AND O'DONNELL
           WAS USED (SOLUTION WITH 6% D-STATE AND RETARDATION
           INCLUDED). IN ANALIZING OF MULTIPOLARITY OF CROSS
           SECTION IT WAS ASSUMED THAT COEFFICIENT 'BETA' WHICH
           DETERMINE THE E2 TERM VARIES FROM 0.2 AT EG = 27 MEV
           TO 0.7 AT EG = 52 MEV. THEREFORE THE ERROR IN THE
           CROSS SECTION ARISING FROM THE INACCURATELY KNOWN
           VALUE OF 'BETA' DOES NOT EXCEED ABOUT 10%, EVEN FOR
           THE HIGHEST ENERGIES IN THIS EXPERIMENT.
REL-REF    (R,,A.DONNACHIE+,J,NP,53,128,64) THEORETICAL DATA ON
           DEUTERON PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED ONLY. AN ERROR
           IN THE CROSS SECTION ARISING FROM THE INACCURATELY
           KNOWN VALUE OF COEFFICIENT 'BETA' WHICH DETERMINE
           THE ELECTRICAL QUADRUPOLE COMPONENT IN THE MEASURED
           DIPOLE COMPONENT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE NOT LARGER THAN
           10%.
