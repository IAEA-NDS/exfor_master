TITLE      The 90-degrees differential  cross  section  for  the
            reaction  He-4(g,n0)He-3  and  evidence  for isospin
            mixing in the dipole states of He-4.

METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight technique for neutron energy
            spectrum measurements.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The 7.5 cm plastic scintillator 'Pilot-b'.
SAMPLE     The liquid-helium sample was  contained  in  a  long,
            thin-walled  (20 micron) aluminium dewar,  7.5 cm in
            diameter.

ANALYSIS   The photoneutron energy  spectrum  was  measured  and
            used  for  obtaining  of  partial differential cross
            section  using  the  data  on  the  shape   of   the
            bremsstrahlung  spectrum  together  with information
            about the  energy  dependence  of  neutron  detector
            efficiency. The  absolute  cross  section  scale was
            determined with the aid of data on cross section  of
            H-2(g,n) reaction.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic errors are  only  estimated
            to be about of +15 or -20%.
COMMENT    The differential  cross sections for the ground state
            reaction He-4(g,n0)He-3 has been measured up  to  32
            MeV  by  the  neutron time-of-flight technique.  The
            peak absolute cross section is 110 mu-bn/sr.
