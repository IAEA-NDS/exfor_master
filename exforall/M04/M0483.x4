TITLE      THE 90-DEGREES DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR
           THE REACTION HE-4(G,N0)HE-3 AND EVIDENCE FOR
           ISOSPIN MIXING IN THE DIPOLE STATES OF HE-4.

DETECTOR   (SCIN) THE 7.5 CM PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR 'PILOT-B'.
SAMPLE     THE LIQUID-HELIUM SAMPLE WAS CONTAINED IN A LONG,
           THIN-WALLED (20 MICRON) ALUMINIUM DEWAR, 7.5 CM IN
           DIAMETER.

ANALYSIS   THE PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED AND
           USED FOR OBTAINING OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
           SECTION USING THE DATA ON THE SHAPE OF THE
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUN TOGETHER WITH INFORMATION
           ABOUT THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF NEUTRON DETECTOR
           EFFICIENCY. THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION SCALE WAS
           DETERMINED WITH THE AID OF DATA ON CROSS SECTION
           OF H-2(G,N) REACTION.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT OF +15 OR -20%.
COMMENT    THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE GROUND
           STATE REACTION HE-4(G,N0)HE-3 HAS BEEN MEASURED UP
           TO 32 MEV BY THE NEUTRON TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUE.
           THE PEAK ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION IS 110 MU-BN/SR.
