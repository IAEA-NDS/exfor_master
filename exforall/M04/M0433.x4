METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (TRD,BF3)  Fission  fragments  were   detected   with
            a  multiparallel fission chamber,  the photoneutrons
            from (gamma,n) and (gamma,f) reactions were detected
            by 4pi long counter of  a Halpern type with  six BF3
            detectors immersed  in paraffin  where neutrons  are
            slowed down.
           (NAICR) for gamma-flux measurement
ANALYSIS   The photofission cross sections are related to
            the experimental counting rates by a system of
            linear equations: sum(R*sig) = (n/F)*A, which
            is the connection between the cross section 'sig'
            and gamma-ray flux 'R' at some (not main) line in
            photon spectrum with number of fissions 'n', main
            flux of photons 'F', and number of target atoms 'A'.
            This set of linier equations can Be solved only with
            some approximations. Once the solution of the
            quadratic system obtained from the principal lines
            of the elements is calculated, a linear
            interpolation is made between the first set of
            solutions, and this procedure may be repeated until
            the variations introduced are very small.
           The total cross section for neutron emission is
            given by: sig(gamma,n-tot) = sig(gamma,n)+
            2*sig(gamma,2n) + 3*sig(gamma,3n)+...+nu*sig(gamma,F)
            + (1+nu)sig(gamma,nf) + (2+nu)sig(gamma,2nf)+...,
            where 'nu' is the number of neutrons emitted per
            per fission. Using long counter measured only
            sig(gamma,n-tot) = sig(gamma,n)+nu*sig(gamma,f)
            (work below the thresholds of other reactions).
           Substitute the latter equation to the former gives
            the system of linear equations, the solving of
            which gives the total cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are statistical. However since
           the photofission cross sections in U-235 and U-238
           which are presented in natural uranium are of the
           same order of magnitude the error committed on this
           assumption is of the order of the quantity of U-235
           in the natural uranium - about 0.7%.
COMMENT    The (gamma,f) and (gamma,n) cross sections in U-238
           Th-232 and the ratio width-n/width-F were measured
           and with monochromatic gamma-rays, of energies from
           5.43 to 9.00 MeV.
