TITLE      PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF HE-3.

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) THE SOURCE OF GAMMA-QUANTA IS
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG BUT IN CASE OF FULL GEOMETRY
           THE ENERGY OF PHOTON WHICH PRODUCED EACH EVENT
           IS EXACTLY THE SUM OF THE PROTON AND DEUTERON
           ENERGIES PLUS 5.49 MEV (THE THRESHOLD OF HE-3(G,P)
           REACTION).
METHOD     (COINC)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) CSI(TL) CRYSTALS.
SAMPLE     THE BRASS CHAMBER WITH THIN ALUMISEAL WINDOWS
           WAS FILLED WITH HE-3 GAS AT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN
           ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.

ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED FROM THE NUMBER
           0F PROTON-DEUTERON COINCIDENCE EVENTS BY DIVIDING
           OF THIS NUMBER BY CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF PHOTONS
           IN THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT 5%.
COMMENT    THE 90-DEGREES DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF HE-3 INTO A PROTON AND A
           DEUTERON HAS BEEN MEASURED FOR INCIDENT PHOTON
           ENERGIES BETWEEN 8.5 AND 22 MEV. THE FACT THAT THE
           INCIDENT PHOTON MOMENTUM IS SMALL AT THESE ENERGIES
           PROVIDES A UNIQUE SIGNATURE FOR THIS PROCESS. THE
           PROTON AND DEUTERON ARE EMITTED NEARLY BACK TO BACK
           WITH EQUAL MOMENTA; HENCE THE ENERGY OF THE PROTON
           IS ABOUT TWICE THAT OF THE DEUTERON.
