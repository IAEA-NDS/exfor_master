INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) The    source    of    gamma-quanta   is
            bremsstrahlung but in  case  of  full  geometry  the
            energy  of  photon  which  produced  each  event  is
            exactly the sum of the proton and deuteron  energies
            plus 5.49 MeV (the threshold of He-3(g,p) reaction).
METHOD     (COINC)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) CsI(Tl) crystals.
SAMPLE     The brass chamber with thin Alumiseal windows
            was filled with He-3 gas at slightly less than
            atmospheric pressure.

ANALYSIS   The cross section was determined from the number
            of proton-deuteron coincidence events by dividing
            of this number by corresponding number of photons
            in the bremsstrahlung spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors are only estimated
            to be about 5%.
COMMENT    The 90-degrees differential cross section for the
            photodisintegration of He-3 into a proton and a
            deuteron has been measured for incident photon
            energies between 8.5 and 22 MeV. The fact that the
            incident photon momentum is small at these energies
            provides a unique signature for this process. The
            proton and deuteron are emitted nearly back to back
            with equal momenta; hence the energy of the proton
            is about twice that of the deuteron.
