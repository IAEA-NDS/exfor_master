INC-SOURCE (MPH=(11-NA-23(D,P)11-NA-24)) Radioactive nucleus
            Na-24. Eg = 2.75 MeV.
METHOD     (COINC) The photoprotons were detected in crystal and
            the   associated   photoneutrons  were  detected  in
            delayed coincidence  in  a  stilbene  crystal  at  a
            distance of 170 mm.
SAMPLE     The deuterated anthracene scintillation  crystal  was
            used  simultaneously  as  target  and  as photoroton
            detector.

ANALYSIS   Photodisintegration runs were made at six  laboratory
            angles  Theta-n  = 30,  45,  60,  90,  120,  and 135
            degrees.  For each angle the photoneutron yield  was
            determined   by   integrating   the  counts  in  the
            photoneutron peak and by normalizing to  a  constant
            flux of incident 2.75 MeV gamma rays.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for background,  geometry, dead
            time  losses,  and  relative detection efficiency of
            neutron detector.

COMMENT    The angular distribution of  neutrons  from  deuteron
            photodisintegration  by  2.75  MeV  gamma  rays  was
            measured at six laboratory angles between 30 and 135
            degrees. The dipole cross section ratio sig-m/ sig-e
            = 0.290 (0.021) was derieved from the  measurements.
            The  least  squares  fit  to angular distribution of
            neutrons led to the value a/b = 0.193 (0.014).
