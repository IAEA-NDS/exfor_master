TITLE      ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRONS FROM H-2(G,N)H-1
           AT EG = 2.75 MEV.

FACILITY   (VDG,3SAFSCT)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(11-NA-23(D,P)11-NA-24)) RADIOACTIVE NUCLEUS
           NA-24. EG = 2.75 MEV.
METHOD     (COINC) THE PHOTOPROTONS WERE DETECTED IN CRYSTAL
           AND THE ASSOCIATED PHOTONEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN
           DELAYED COINCIDENCE IN A STILBENE CRYSTAL AT A
           DISTANCE OF 170 MM.
SAMPLE     THE DEUTERATED ANTHRACENE SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL WAS
           USED SIMULTANEOUSLY AS TARGET AND AS PHOTOROTON
           DETECTOR.
PART-DET   (N)
           (P)
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SCIN)
ANALYSIS   PHOTODISINTEGRATION RUNS WERE MADE AT SIX
           LABORATORY ANGLES THETA-N = 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,
           AND 135 DEGREES. FOR EACH ANGLE THE PHOTONEUTRON
           YIELD WAS DETERMINED BY INTEGRATING THE COUNTS IN
           THE PHOTONEUTRON PEAK AND BY NORMALIZING TO A
           CONSTANT FLUX OF INCIDENT 2.75 MEV GAMMA RAYS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR BACKGROUND, GEOMETRY,
           DEAD TIME LOSSES, AND RELATIVE DETECTION EFFICIENCY
           OF NEUTRON DETECTOR.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY.
COMMENT    THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRONS FROM DEUTERON
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION BY 2.75 MEV GAMMA RAYS WAS
           MEASURED AT SIX LABORATORY ANGLES BETWEEN 30 AND
           135 DEGREES. THE DIPOLE CROSS SECTION RATIO SIG-M/
           SIG-E = 0.290 (0.021) WAS DERIEVED FROM THE
           MEASUREMENTS. THE LEAST SQUARES FIT TO ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRONS LED TO THE VALUE A/B =
           0.193 (0.014).
