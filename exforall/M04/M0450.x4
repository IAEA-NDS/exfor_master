TITLE      ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION VERSUS ENERGY OF THE
           CU-63(G,N) AND CU-63(G,2N) REACTIONS.

INSTITUTE  (1USASTF)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USASTF)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV) THE STACKED-FOIL METHOD. THE REACTION
           YIELDS WERE MEASURED BY DETERMINING THE RADIOACTIVITY
           OF THE TEN-MINUTE COPPER-62 AND THREE-HOUR COPPER-61
           NICLEI WHICH RESULTS FROM THE (G,N) AND (G,2N)
           PROCESSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN COPPER-63. THE NUMBER OF
           PHOTONEUTRONS EJECTED FROM THE COPPER FOIL WAS
           DETERMINED BY COUNTING THE RESIDUAL RADIOACTIVITY OF
           THE CU-62 AND CU-61 ISOTOPES WITH 4PI SCINTILLATION
           COUNTER.
SAMPLE     HIGHLY-ENRICHED COPPER-63 FOILS: COPPER OXIDE
           CONTAINING 99.4% COPPER-63.
PART-DET   (B+) POSITRONS, WHOSE END-POINT ENERGIES ARE
           2.9 MEV IN CASE OF COPPER-62 AND 1.3 MEV IN CASE OF
           COPPER-61.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4PI SCINTILLATION COUNTER: THE FOIL WAS
           SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO FLAT ANTHRACENE CRYSTALS.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PHDIF) THE NUMBER OF PHOTONEUTRONS EJECTED
           FROM THE COPPER FOIL WAS DETERMINED BY COUNTING THE
           RESIDUAL RADIOACTIVITY OF THE CU-62 AND CU-61 ISOTOPES
           WITH 4PI SCINTILLATION COUNTER. ACTIVATION POINTS WERE
           TAKEN AT 2 MEV INTERVALS. THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE
           COMPUTED FROM EXPERIMENTAL YIELD CURVES BY APPLYING
           THE PHOTON-DIFFERENCE METHOD USING BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           DISTRIBUTIONS CALCULATED AT 2 MEV INTERVALS FOR
           A 0.025-RADIATION-LENGTH COPPER RADIATOR.
ERR-ANALYS NO DATA ABOUT UNCERTAINTIES OF CROSS SECTIONS
           OBTAINED, STATISTICAL ERRORS FOR INTEGRATED CROSS
           SECTIONS.
CORRECTION THE CROSS SECTIONS GIVEN WERE CORRECTED FOR
           CONTRIBUTIONS CAUSED BY THE COMPETING THREE-HOUR
           ACTIVITY OF CU-61 (FROM CU-63(G,2N) REACTION) FOR
           TWELVE-HOUR CU-64 ACTIVITY (FROM CU-65(G,N) REACTION)
           WICH WAS EVALUATED BY COUNTING IT AFTER DECAY OF THE
           THREE-HOUR CU-61 ACTIVITY AND THEN CORRECTING BY
           EXTRAPOLATING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CU-64 ACTIVITY
           AND FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING OF THE PRIMARY ELECTRONS
           FROM LINAC IN THE FOILS INCREASES THE EFFECTIVE PATH
           LENGTH OF THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG QUANTA AND ELECTRONS IN
           THE REAR FOIL RELATIVE TO THE FIRST (A CORRECTION
           FOR THIS WAS APPLIED WHICH VARIED FROM 4.0 TO 0.4%
           FROM 12 TO 36 MEV).
COMMENT    EXPERIMENTAL VALUES WERE FOUND FOR THE ABSOLUTE
           CROSS SECTION OF BOTH CU-63(G,N) AND (G,2N) REACTIONS
           VERSUS G-QUANTA ENERGY FROM THRESHOLD TO 36 MEV.
           STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WERE LIMITED BY THE
           USE OF (A) THE DIRECT ELECTRON BEAM OF THE STANFORD
           36 MEV LINEAR ACCELERATOR, WHICH PRODUCED
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG IMMEDIATELY BEFOR AND WITHIN THE
           COPPER FOILS UNDER BOMBARDMENT, (B) AN ELECTRON-BEAM
           COLLECTOR WHICH RECORDED THE TOTAL ACCUMULATED CHARGE
           IN THE INCIDENT FLUX, (C) A 4PI SCINTILLATION COUNTER
           WHICH MEASURED THE ACTIVITY OF THE RESULTANT CU-62
           AND CU-61, AND (D) ELECTROPLATED FOILS OF SEPARATED
           CU-63 ISOTOPES.
