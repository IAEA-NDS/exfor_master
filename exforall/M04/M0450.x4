TITLE      Absolute cross section versus energy of the
            Cu-63(gamma,n) and Cu-63(gamma,2n) reactions.

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) The   stacked-foil   method.   The
            reaction yields were  measured  by  determining  the
            radioactivity   of   the  ten-minute  copper-62  and
            three-hour copper-61 nuclei which results  from  the
            (gamma,n) and (gamma,2n) processes, respectively, in
            copper-63.  The number of photoneutrons ejected from
            the  copper  foil  was  determined  by  counting the
            residual  radioactivity  of  the  Cu-62  and   Cu-61
            isotopes with 4pi scintillation counter.
SAMPLE     The natural-copper foils used in the  (gamma,n)  runs
            were 1.25-inch diameter disks 40 mg/cm2 thick, while
            the enriched foils were 0.5 inch x 0.75-inch  strips
            totaling 65 mg/cm2. Highly-enriched copper-63 foils:
            copper  oxide  containing  99.4%  copper-63.   Foils
            ranging  in  thickness  from  3  to  16  mg/cm2  and
            totaling 130 mg/cm2 were made.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4Pi  scintillation  counter:  the   foil   was
            sandwiched  between  two  flat  anthracene crystals,
            1.-inch square and 0.125-inch thick,  backed by  two
            DuMont 6292 photomultipliers.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PHDIF) The  number  of  photoneutrons  ejected
            from  the copper foil was determined by counting the
            residual  radioactivity  of  the  Cu-62  and   Cu-61
            isotopes with 4pi scintillation counter.  Activation
            points were taken at  2  MeV  intervals.  The  cross
            sections   were  computed  from  experimental  yield
            curves  by  applying  the  photon-difference  method
            using  bremsstrahlung  distributions calculated at 2
            MeV intervals for  a  0.025-radiation-length  copper
            radiator.
CORRECTION The cross   sections   given   were   corrected   for
            contributions  caused  by  the  competing three-hour
            activity of Cu-61 (from  Cu-63(g,2n)  reaction)  for
            twelve-hour    Cu-64   activity   (from   Cu-65(g,n)
            reaction) which was evaluated by counting  it  after
            decay  of  the  three-hour  Cu-61  activity and then
            correcting by extrapolating  back  to  the  original
            Cu-64  activity  and  for multiple scattering of the
            primary electrons from Linac in the foils  increases
            the  effective  path  length  of  the bremsstrahlung
            quanta and electrons in the rear  foil  relative  to
            the  first  (a correction for this was applied which
            varied from 4.0 to 0.4% from 12 to 36 MeV).
COMMENT    Experimental values were found for the absolute cross
            section  of  both  Cu-63(gamma,n)   and   (gamma,2n)
            reactions  versus gamma-quanta energy from threshold
            to 36 MeV.  Statistical and systematic  errors  were
            limited by the use of:
             (a) the direct electron beam of the Stanford 36 MeV
                 linear     accelerator,     which      produced
                 bremsstrahlung  immediately  before  and within
                 the copper foils under bombardment,
             (b) an electron-beam collector which  recorded  the
                 total accumulated charge in the incident flux,
             (c) a  4pi scintillation counter which measured the
                 activity of the resultant Cu-62 and Cu-61,
             (d) electroplated   foils   of   separated    Cu-63
                 isotopes.
