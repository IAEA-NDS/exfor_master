PART-DET   (G)
SAMPLE     5 CM DIAMETER, 2.5 G/CM**2 ISOTOPIC TARGET OF
           PB-208 (91% ENRICHMENT).
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE SCATTERING CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED
           FROM THE INTENCITIES OF THE INCIDENT BEAM AND THE
           SCATTERED RADIATION.
ERR-ANALYS THE TOTAL ERRORS WHICH INCLUDE STATISTIC AND
           GEOMETRY ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    ELASTIC SCATTERING OF MONOCROMATIC PHOTONS (ENERGY
           RESOLUTION ABOUT 25 EV) AT 8999, 10055, AND 11388
           KEV WAS USED TO PROBE THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF KNOWN
           BUMPS IN THE LOW-ENERGY TAIL OF THE GIANT DIPOLE
           RESONANCE IN PB-208.
