METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     BERILLIUM TARGET, WHOSE SHAPE IS A HOLLOW CYLINDER
           6 CM IN OUTER DIAMETER BY 6 CM HIGH, WITH WALLS OF
           1 CM THICKNESS.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) FOUR BF3 COUNTERS EMBEDDED IN PARAFFIN.
ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION VALUES WERE OBTAINED USING THE
           EQUATION: SIG(EG)=K*C(S)/I(S)*DELTA(EG)*EPSILON(EN),
           WHERE 'K' IS A CONSTANT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY UPON THE
           SHAPE OF THE BE TARGET, 'C(S)' IS THE COUNTING RATE
           OF NEUTRONS DUE TO THE SOURCE 'S' WITH INTENSITY
           'I(S)', ENERGY 'EG', AND EMISSION RATE 'DELTA', AND
           'EPSILON(EN)' IS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEUTRON
           DETECTOR FOR NEUTRONS WITH ENERGY 'EN'.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
COMMENT    SIX KINDS OF RIDIOISOTOPES WERE USED TO MEASURE CROSS
           SECTION OF THE BE-9(G,N) REACTION NEAR ITS THRESHOLD.
           BECAUSE ALL OTHER POSSIBLE PHOTONUCLEAR REACTIONS
           HAVE A LARGER THRESHOLDS THIS IS A PURE REACTION
           BE-9(G,N).
