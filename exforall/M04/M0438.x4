METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     Beryllium target,  whose shape is a hollow cylinder 6
            cm  in outer diameter by 6 cm high,  with walls of 1
            cm thickness.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) Four BF3 counters embedded in paraffin.
ANALYSIS   The cross  section  values  were  obtained  using the
            equation: sig(Eg)=k*c(s)/i(s)*delta(Eg)*epsilon(En),
            where  'k' is a constant which depends only upon the
            shape of the be target,  'c(s)' is the counting rate
            of  neutrons  due  to  the source 's' with intensity
            'i(s)',  energy 'Eg', and emission rate 'delta', and
            'epsilon(En)'  is  the  efficiency  of  the  neutron
            detector for neutrons with energy 'En'.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are statistical.
COMMENT    Six kinds of radioisotopes were used to measure cross
            section   of   the   Be-9(g,n)   reaction  near  its
            threshold.  Because all other possible  photonuclear
            reactions  have  a  larger thresholds this is a pure
            reaction Be-9(g,n).
