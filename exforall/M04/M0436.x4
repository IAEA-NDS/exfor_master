TITLE      Angular distributions  and  cross  sections  of   the
            photoneutron  reaction  in Be-9 in the photon energy
            region 18 - 26 MeV.

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,THRDT) Threshold technique determined energy of
            incident bremsstrahlung photon.
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     The targets used were 0.3 cm thick  beryllium  metal,
            and  (D-2)O,  (H-2)O,  and dummy targets of the same
            thickness.

ANALYSIS   (INTED) Measurements of neutron spectra were made  at
            five  angles between 50 and 146 degrees.  Because of
            the 2.9 MeV separation between the ground state  and
            first  excited  state of Be-8,  kinematics enables a
            reasonably unambiguous identification to be made  of
            neutrons  in  the  highest  2  MeV  of  each neutron
            spectrum at each end-point energy.  Correspondingly,
            the  8.5  MeV  separation  between the first excited
            state  and  second  excited  state  of  Be-8   makes
            possible  the  fairly  unambiguous identification of
            first excited state in the highest  6  MeV  of  each
            neutron  spectrum  once  the  ground  state  neutron
            contribution has  been  substracted.  By  comparison
            with  the  photoneutron  spectra  from the deuterium
            photodisintegration  and  use  of   Partovi's  cross
            section for deuterium, differential  cross  sections
            for beryllium were obtained.

COMMENT    The Be-9(g,n-0)Be-8  and  Be-9(g,n-1)Be-8   reactions
            were  studied  in  the  photon energy region 18 - 26
            MeV.  The  integrated  cross  section   of   (g,n-0)
            reaction  was  found  to  be less than 0.1 MeV*mb in
            this energy region. The integrated cross section for
            the (g,n-1) reaction in the energy region studied is
            2.4(0.4) MeV*mb,  which is 10 to 15%  of  the  total
            photoneutron  cross  section.  The  measured angular
            distributions   for   the   (g,n-1)   reaction   are
            consistent  with  the  population  of  3/2+ and 5/2+
            states of Be-9.
