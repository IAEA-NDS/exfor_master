TITLE      ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS AND CROSS SECTIONS OF THE
           PHOTONEUTRON REACTION IN BE-9 IN THE PHOTON
           ENERGY REGION 18 - 26 MEV.

INC-SOURCE (QMPH,THRDT) THRESHOLD TECHNIQUE DETERMINED ENERGY
           OF INCIDENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG PHOTON.
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     THE TARGETS USED WERE 0.3 CM THICK BERILLIUM
           METAL, AND (D-2)O, (H-2)O, AND DUMMY TARGETS
           OF THE SAME THICKNESS.
PART-DET   (N)
ANALYSIS   (INTED) MEASUREMENTS OF NEUTRON SPECTRA WERE MADE
           AT FIVE ANGLES BETWEEN 50 AND 146 DEGREES. BECAUSE
           OF THE 2.9 MEV SEPARATION BETWEEN THE GROUND STATE
           AND FIRST EXCITED STATE OF BE-8, KINEMATICS ENABLES
           A REASONABLY UNAMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATION TO BE MADE
           OF NEUTRONS IN THE HIGHEST 2 MEV OF EACH NEUTRON
           SPECTRUM AT EACH END-POINT ENERGY. CORRESPONDINGLY,
           THE 8.5 MEV SEPARATION BETWEEN THE FIRST EXCITED
           STATE AND SECOND EXCITED STATE OF BE-8 MAKES
           POSSIBLE THE FAIRLY UNAMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATION OF
           FIRST EXCITED STATE IN THE HIGHEST 6 MEV OF EACH
           NEUTRON SPECTRUM ONCE THE GROUND STATE NEUTRON
           CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN SUBSTRACTED. BY COMPARISON
           WITH THE PHOTONEUTRON SPECTRA FROM THE DEUTERIUM
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION AND USE OF PARTOVI CROSS
           SECTION FOR DEUTERIUM, DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS
           FOR BERILLIUM WERE OBTAINED.

ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
COMMENT    THE BE-9(G,N-0)BE-8 AND BE-9(G,N-1)BE-8 REACTIONS
           WERE STUDIED IN THE PHOTON ENERGY REGION 18 - 26 MEV.
           THE INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION OF (G,N-0) REACTION WAS
           FOUND TO BE LESS THAN 0.1 MEV*MB IN THIS ENERGY
           REGION. THE INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION FOR THE (G,N-1)
           REACTION IN THE ENERGY REGION STUDIED IS 2.4(0.4)
           MEV*MB, WHICH IS 10 TO 15% OF THE TOTAL PHOTONEUTRON
           CROSS SECTION. THE MEASURED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR
           THE (G,N-1) REACTION ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE
           POPULATION OF 3/2+ AND 5/2+ STATES OF BE-9.
