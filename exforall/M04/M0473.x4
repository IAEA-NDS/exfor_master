METHOD     (ACTIV) MEASURING THE ACTIVITY INDUCED IN CU-63
           BY ELECTRODISINTEGRATION.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET CONSISTED OF 99% ENRICHED CU-63 FOILS
           APPROXIMATELY 5 MG/CM**2 IN NIS EXPERIMENTS AND OF
           99.9% ENRICHED CU-63 FOILS 10.0 (0.2) MG/CM**2 IN
           USP EXPERIMENTS.
PART-DET   (B+)
ANALYSIS   THE DATA FROM INDUCED ACTIVITY WERE ACQUIRED IN FIVE
           SEQUENTIAL FOUR MINUTE COUNTING PERIODS. AFTER EACH
           COUNTING PERIOD, THE 511 KEV ANNIHILATION PEAK
           COUNTING RATE WAS DETERMINED AND CORRECTED FOR DECAY
           TO THE END OF THE IRRADIATION AND FOR DECAY WITHIN
           THE COUNTING PERIOD. THEN NUMBERS OF COUNTING WERE
           USED TO OBTAIN THE ELECTRODISINTEGRATION CROSS
           SECTION. THE USP RELATIVE DATA WERE NORMALIZED TO THE
           NIST ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS. THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED FROM ELECTRODISINTEGRATION
           CROSS SECTION USING THE VIRTUAL PHOTON SPECTRA THEORY.
CORRECTION THE MEASURED COUNTING RATES WERE CORRECTED FOR DECAY
           TO THE END OF THE IRRADIATION AND FOR DECAY WITHIN
           THE EACH OF USED COUNTING FOUR MINUTES PERIOD.
           THE EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION
           WAS CORRECTED FOR THE CONTRIBUTION DUE TO THE
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG GENERATED IN THE TARGET. THE VIRTUAL
           PHOTON SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR NUCLEAR SIZE
           EFFECTS.

COMMENT    THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN STUDIED BY
           MEASURING THE (B+) ACTIVITY INDUCED IN CU-63 BY
           ELECTRODISINTEGRATION AND WHEN THIN RADIATORS OF CU,
           MO, TA, AND TH WERE PLACED IN THE ELECTRON BEAM JUST
           AHEAD OF THE TARGET. THE ELECTRON ENERGIES WERE
           WARIED FROM 13.5 TO 60 MEV FOR THE REACTION OF
           ELECTRODISINTEGRATION AND FROM 20 TO 60 MEV FOR THE
           RADIATOR-IN MEASUREMENTS; THE (G,N) CROSS SECTION
           FOR CU-63 WAS DETERMINED USING VIRTUAL PHOTON THEORY;
           THE RADIATOR DATA WERE FITTED USING VARIOUS DATA ON
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG CROSS SECTIONS.
