METHOD     (ACTIV) Measuring  the  activity induced in  Cu-63 by
            electrodisintegration.
SAMPLE     The  target  consisted  of  99%  enriched Cu-63 foils
            approximately 5 mg/cm**2 in NIS experiments  and  of
            99.9%  enriched  Cu-63  foils 10.0 (0.2) mg/cm**2 in
            USP experiments.
PART-DET   (B+)
ANALYSIS   The data from induced activity were acquired in  five
            sequential four minute counting periods.  After each
            counting  period,  the  511  keV  annihilation  peak
            counting rate was determined and corrected for decay
            to the end of the irradiation and for  decay  within
            the  counting period.  Then numbers of counting were
            used  to  obtain  the  electrodisintegration   cross
            section.  The  USP  relative data were normalized to
            the     NIST     absolute     measurements.      The
            photodisintegration  cross section was obtained from
            electrodisintegration  cross   section   using   the
            virtual photon spectra theory.
CORRECTION The measured  counting rates were corrected for decay
            to the end of the irradiation and for  decay  within
            the  each of used counting four minutes period.  The
            experimental electrodisintegration cross section was
            corrected   for   the   contribution   due   to  the
            bremsstrahlung generated in the target.  The virtual
            photon  spectra  were  corrected  for  nuclear  size
            effects.

COMMENT    The bremsstrahlung  cross section has been studied by
            measuring the (b+)  activity  induced  in  Cu-63  by
            electrodisintegration and when thin radiators of Cu,
            Mo, Ta, and Th were placed in the electron beam just
            ahead  of  the  target.  The  electron energies were
            varied from 13.5 to  60  MeV  for  the  reaction of
            electrodisintegration  and from 20 to 60 MeV for the
            radiator-in measurements;  the (g,n)  cross  section
            for   Cu-63  was  determined  using  virtual  photon
            theory;  the radiator data were fitted using various
            data on bremsstrahlung cross sections.
