TITLE      ISOSPIN EFFECTS ON THE N-15(G,2N) REACTION CROSS
           SECTION.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (ACTIV) MEASURING THE YIELD OF 0.511 MEV GAMMA-QUANTA
           EMITTED FOLLOWING ANNIHILATION OF POSITRONS FROM THE
           INDUCED 9.97 MIN POSITRON ACTIVITY OF N-13.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
SAMPLE     THREE SAMPLES, EACH WEIGHING 24.9 G, WERE IN THE FORM
           OF DISCS OF DIAMETER 31.85 MM AND THICKNESS 18.66 MM.
           THEY WERE FORMED UNDER PRESSURE FROM AMMONIUM-SULFATE
           POWDER ((N(H-4)-2)S(O-4)) WHICH WAS ENRICHED TO 98%
           IN N-15.
PART-DET   (AR) ANNIHILATION RADIATION OF POSITRONS FROM THE
           ACTIVITY OF N-13.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PLA) THE YIELD AT A GIVEN ENERGY IS DETERMINED
           BY THE NUMBER OF 0.511 MEV GAMMA RAYS DETECTED AT THAT
           ENERGY. YIELD POINTS WERE MEASURED AT 200 KEV
           INTERVALS FROM 21 TO 28 MEV. A TOTAL OF THREE
           SEPARATE MEASUREMENTS WAS MADE OVER THIS WHOLE
           RANGE. THESE THREE RUNS WERE AVERAGED. THIS AVERAGED
           CURVE WAS THEN ANALYZED USING THE VARIABLE BIN
           PENFOLD-LEISS METHOD.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT 10%.
COMMENT    THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE N-15(G,2N) REACTION HAS
           BEEN STUDIED FROM 20 TO 28 MEV. THE CROSS SECTION
           REMAINS NEAR ZERO FOR 3 MEV ABOVE THRESHOLD, THEN
           RISES SHARPLY AT ABOUT 24 MEV, TO A MAXIMUM VALUE OF
           1.7 MB. THE SHAPE IS EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE
           DENSITY OF STATES WITH ISOSPIN T> IN N-14 AT THE
           RELEVANT EXCITATION ENERGY. IT MUST BE NOTED THAT
           THE PRESENT MEASUREMENT DETERMINES ONLY THE CROSS
           SECTION FOR TRANSITIONS LEADING TO THE GROUND STATE
           OF FINAL NUCLEUS N-13, I.E. THE CROSS SECTION OF THE
           REACTION N-15(G,NN-0)N-13-G. ALL EXCITED STATES OF
           N-13 (THE FIRST IS AT 2.365 MEV) ARE PROTON UNSTABLE.
