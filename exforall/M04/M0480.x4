METHOD     (ACTIV) Measuring the yield of 0.511 mev gamma-quanta
            emitted following annihilation of positrons from the
            induced 9.97 min positron activity of N-13.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
SAMPLE     Three samples, each weighing 24.9 g, were in the form
            of  discs  of  diameter 31.85 mm and thickness 18.66
            mm.   They   were   formed   under   pressure   from
            ammonium-sulfate powder ((N(H-4)-2)S(o-4)) which was
            enriched to 98% in N-15.
PART-DET   (AR) Annihilation radiation of positrons from the
            activity of N-13.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PLA) The yield at a given energy is determined
            by the number of 0.511 MeV gamma  rays  detected  at
            that  energy.  Yield points were measured at 200 keV
            intervals from 21  to  28  MeV.  A  total  of  three
            separate  measurements  was  made  over  this  whole
            range. These three runs were averaged. this averaged
            curve  was  then  analyzed  using  the  variable bin
            Penfold-Leiss method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Root-mean-squared errors.
           (ERR-1) The systematic errors are only estimated to be
           about 10%.
COMMENT    The cross section for  the  N-15(g,2n)  reaction  has
            been  studied  from 20 to 28 MeV.  The cross section
            remains near zero for 3 MeV  above  threshold,  then
            rises sharply at about 24 MeV, to a maximum value of
            1.7 mb.  The shape is  explained  in  terms  of  the
            density  of  states  with  isospin T> in N-14 at the
            relevant excitation energy.  It must be  noted  that
            the  present  measurement  determines only the cross
            section for transitions leading to the ground  state
            of final nucleus N-13, i.e. the cross section of the
            reaction N-15(g,nn-0)N-13-g.  All excited states  of
            N-13   (the  first  is  at  2.365  MeV)  are  proton
            unstable.
