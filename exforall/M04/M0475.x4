TITLE      EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE HE-4(G,D)D
           REACTION.

INSTITUTE  (2GERBON)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERBON)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) KINEMATICALLY DETERMINED (REACTION
           PARTICLE TAGGED) ENERGY OF INCIDENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           PHOTON.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
SAMPLE     THE TARGET CONSISTED OF A CYLINDRICAL CELL FILLED
           WITH LIQUID HELIUM.
PART-DET   (D)
ANALYSIS   THE PHOTO-EJECTED DEUTERONS D1 AND D2 WERE DETECTED
           IN COINCIDENCE WITH THE USE OF TWO TIME-OF-FLIGHT
           SPECTROMETERS CONSISTING OF THIN SCINTILLATION
           COUNTERS. IN EACH ARM THE MASS, ENERGY AND ANGLE OF
           THE DETECTED PARTICLE WERE DETERMINED. THIS GIVES
           A KINEMATICAL OVERDETERMINATION OF THE REACTION
           WHICH WAS USED TO SUPPRESS THE HIGH BACKGROUND OF
           ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENCIES AND UNCORRELATED PARTICLES.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY.
COMMENT    HIGH-ENERGY DIFFERENTIAL CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENTS
           OF THE HE-4(G,D)D REACTION ARE PRESENTED. THE CROSS
           SECTIONS ARE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN PREVIOUSLY
           PUBLISHED RESULTS AND ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH A
           PREDICTED E2 TRANSITION.
