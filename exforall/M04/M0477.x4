           40 AND 150 MEV.

METHOD     (COINC,EDE)
DETECTOR   (SOLST,SCIN)
SAMPLE     LOW-TEMPERATURE (4.20 (0.04) DEGREES K) HE-3 GAS
           WITH A PRESSURE OF 650 MM HG.

ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED FROM THE REACTION
           YIELD BY ASSUMING THAT FOR VERY SMALL INTERVAL
           BETWEEN TWO POINTS EG1 AND EG2 CROSS SECTION MAY BE
           ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE LESS THAN 7%. THEY ARE:
           - A 2.3% UNCERTAINTY IN THE MONITOR CALIBRATION;
           - A 2.5% UNCERTAINTY IN THE NUMBER OF NUCLEI IN THE
             TARGET;
           - A 1.0% ERROR IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF EVENTS;
           - A 1.5% ERROR FOR NUCLEAR INTERACTIONS OF
             PARTICLES;
           - A 1.0% ERROR OWING TO FINITE ENERGY RESOLUTION;
           - A 3.0% ERROR FROM A SYSTEMATIC ERROR IN PARTICLE
             ENERGIES.
           THE SUM OF ALL THESE ERRORS IS 11.3%. THEIR ROOT
           MEAN SQUARE IS 5.0%. BUT THE FAIR VALUE TO ASSIGN
           SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IS 7%.
CORRECTION THE CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR:
           - EVENTS MISSING BECAUSE THEY HAD OCCURED TOO SOON
             AFTER ANOTHER EVENT (CORRECTION WAS AMOUNTED TO;
             1.9% AT THE LEAST AFFECTED ANGLE AND 7.6% AT THE    M
             MOST);
           - FALLING OF EFFECTIVE DEUTERON MASS OUTSIDE THE
             ACCEPTANCE INTERVAL (CORRECTION OF 1% WAS MADE).
COMMENT    THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION OF HE-3 AT
           PHOTON ENERGIES FROM 40 TO 150 MEV AND PROTON
           LABORATORY ANGLES FROM 30 TO 135 DEGREES HAVE BEEN
           MEASURED.
