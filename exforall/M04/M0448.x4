COMMENT    There exists significant disagreement in the
           magnitude of low-energy region of the N-14(g,n)
           cross section as measured by three methods:
           direct neutron detection, induced activity, and
           neutron time-of-flight. This paper reports two
           measurements of this reaction cross section, one
           from threshold to 16.5 mev using an activation
           method, and the other from threshold to 15.5 mev
           by directly detecting the emitted neutrons.

COMMENT    The threshold of (g,n+p) reaction is 12.5 MeV so
           the cross section measured is really the sum of
           cross sections of (g,n) and (g,n+p) reactions.
SAMPLE     The sample consisted of 142.41 g of chemically pure
           glycine ((C-2)(H-5)(NO-2)), placed in a perspex
           container 109 mm in diameter and 104 mm long.
METHOD     (EXTB)
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) 4PI Halpern-type detector.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PLA) The yields of neutrons was determined at
           bremsstrahlung energies ranging from 10.0 to 16.0
           MeV at 100 keV intervals. A total of 26 independent
           yield curves were mesured. the cross section was
           unfolded from the measured yield curves using the
           variable bin Penfold-Leiss (VBPL) method.

SAMPLE     A total of 15 samples of dicyandiamide
            ((C-2)(H-4)(H-4)) were pressed into discs
           30.4 nn in diameter and 13.7(0.1) mm thick.
           each disc weighed 14.191(0.004) g.

DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PLA) Three independent activity yield curves
           were measured in 1 MeV intervals from 8 to 18 MeV,
           from which an average yield curve was constructed.
           cross section was unfolded from the average yield
           curve using the variable bin Penfold-Leiss (VBPL)
           method.
