METHOD     (MAGFR,COINC)
DETECTOR   (TRD) The cloud chamber.
SAMPLE     The cloud  chamber  filled  with  He-3  gas  with   a
            pressure  of  0.9  atm  was  used  simultaneously as
            detector and target.
ANALYSIS   Since in  the  (g,p)  reaction only two particles are
            emitted it is possible to determine  the  energy  of
            the  g-quantum  from  the  emission  angle  and  the
            momentum of  only  one  of  outgoing  particles.  By
            measuring   both   tracks  the  correctness  of this
            identification of event can  be  checked.  Then  the
            cross  section  can  be  obtained by dividing of the
            number  of  events  in  narrow  range  of   g-quanta
            energies  by  number of photons in the same range of
            bremsstrahlung spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The  systematic  errors  caused  by intensity
            measurements are only estimated to be about of 6%.
