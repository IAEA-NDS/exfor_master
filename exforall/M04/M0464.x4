INC-SOURCE (MPH=(22-TI-0(N,G))) EG = 6.7 MEV.
           (MPH=(26-FE-0(N,G))) EG = 7.6 MEV.
           (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G))) EG = 9.0 MEV.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     THE TARGET CONSISTED OF 1500 CUR TRITIUM GAS AT
           PRESSURE OF 10 ATM.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3)
ANALYSIS   THE CROSS SECTION VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY WAY OF
           COMPARATIVE MEASUREMENT ON A DEUTERIUM TARGET. SINCE
           IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE PHOTONEUTRONS FROM
           DISINTEGRATION OF H-3, AS THOSE FROM H-2 HAVE
           ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS, SO
           NO CORRECTIONS NEEDED TO BE INTRODUCED FOR THIS
           COMPARISON.

COMMENT    THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           OF H-3 HAS BEEN MEASURED UP TO 9 MEV USING
           MONOENERGETIC G-RADIATION FROM RADIATIVE CAPTURE OF
           THERMAL NEUTRONS BY TI, FE, AND NI NUCLEI.
