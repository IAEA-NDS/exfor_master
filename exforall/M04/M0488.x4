TITLE      Absolute cross section for the photodisintegration
            of deuterium.

METHOD     (EXTB) An absorption method was used which is free of
            the   errors   involved   in  absolute  photon  beam
            intensity measurements.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
SAMPLE     Two equivalent length absorbers consisting  of  light
            water   ((H-2)O)   and  heavy  water  ((D-2)O).  The
            absorbers consisted  of  stainless  steel  tubes  of
            equal  internal  dimensions  (4.2  cm) and different
            lengths:  about 199.3 cm (filled with  ((H-2)O)  and
            about  200 cm (filled with ((D-2)O).  The lengths of
            the absorbers were chosen to satisfy  the  relation:
            l-H/l-D  =  V-H/V-D,  where  l  and  V represent the
            lengths and molar volumes  of  the  absorbers.  With
            this choice the atomic attenuation of the photons in
            the two tubes becomes identical,  and the difference
            in the transmitted intensities, which varies between
            1.5 and 2.7% over the range of photon energies used,
            is  entirely  due  to  the  nuclear  absorption  via
            H-2(gamma,n) reaction.
PART-DET   (G)
ANALYSIS   The absolute photodisintegration  cross  section  was
            measured   by   comparing   the  transmitted  photon
            intensities after passing the  photon  beam  through
            equivalent  length  of  two  absorbers consisting of
            light and heavy water.

COMMENT    Accurate absolute cross sections  for  the  deuterium
            photodisintegration  were experimentally determined,
            using an absorption method,  at the photon  energies
            in  the  range  from  6 to 11 MeV with uncertainties
            generally  less  than  3%.  The  photon  beams  were
            produced   by   thermal  neutron  capture,  and  the
            absorption through 2 m absorbers of H(2)O and  D(2)O
            was measured.
