TITLE      ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION FOR THE PHOTODISINTEGRATION
           OF DEUTERIUM.

INSTITUTE  (3ISLNEG)
FACILITY   (REAC,3ISLNEG) IRR-2 REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(26-FE-0(N,G)))
           (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G)))
METHOD     (EXTB) AN ABSORPTION METHOD WAS USED WHICH IS FREE
           OF THE ERRORS INVOLVED IN ABSOLUTE PHOTON BEAM
           INTENSITY MEASUREMENTS.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
SAMPLE     TWO EQUIVALENT LENGTH ABSORBERS CONSISTING OF LIGHT
           WATER ((H-2)O) AND HEAVY WATER ((D-2)O). THE
           ABSORBERS CONSISTED OF STAINLESS STEEL TUBES OF
           EQUAL INTERNAL DIMENSIONS (4.2 CM) AND DIFFERENT
           LENGTHS: ABOUT 199.3 CM (FILLED WITH ((H-2)O) AND
           ABOUT 200 CM (FILLED WITH ((D-2)O). THE LENGTHS OF
           THE ABSORBERS WERE CHOSEN TO SATISFY THE RELATION:
           L-H/L-D = V-H/V-D, WHERE L AND V REPRESENT THE
           LENGTHS AND MOLAR VOLUMES OF THE ABSORBERS. WITH
           THIS CHOICE THE ATOMIC ATTENUATION OF THE PHOTONS
           IN THE TWO TUBES BECOMES IDENTICAL, AND THE
           DIFFERENCE IN THE TRANSMITTED INTENSITIES, WHICH
           VARIES BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.7% OVER THE RANGE OF
           PHOTON ENERGIES USED, IS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE NUCLEAR
           ABSORPTION VIA H-2(G,N) REACTION.
PART-DET   (G)
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTION WAS
           MEASURED BY COMPARING THE TRANSMITTED PHOTON
           INTENSITIES AFTER PASSING THE PHOTON BEAM THROUGH
           EQUIVALENT LENGTH OF TWO ABSORBERS CONSISTING OF
           LIGHT AND HEAVY WATER.
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED ONLY.
COMMENT    ACCURATE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE DEUTERIUM
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION WERE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED,
           USING AN ABSORPTION METHOD, AT THE PHOTON ENERGIES
           IN THE RANGE FROM 6 T0 11 MEV WITH UNCERTAINTIES
           GENERALLY LESS THAN 3%.  THE PHOTON BEAMS WERE
           PRODUCED BY THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE, AND THE
           ABSORPTION THROUGH 2 M ABSORBERS OF H(2)O AND D(2)O
           WAS MEASURED.
