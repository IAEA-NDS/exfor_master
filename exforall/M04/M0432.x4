           A variable-energy  beam  of monoenergetic photons was
            obtained by Compton scattering the primary  beam  of
            radiative  capture  photons  from an aluminium plate
            with a continuously variable radius of curvature.
SAMPLE     The target   of  Th-232  consisted  of  156.4  mg  of
            material (4.4 mg/cm**2)  and  was  assayed  at  100%
            Th-232.  The  U-236  target  consisted  of 317 mg of
            material (8.9 mg/cm**2)  assayed  at  89.38%  U-236,
            9.20% U-235, 1.306% U-238, and 0.116% U-234.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Heavy-ion silicon surface barrier  detectors.
            Each  of  four  detectors used was positioned on the
            rod located  at  45  degrees  with  respect  to  the
            gamma-ray beam.
PART-DET   (FF)
METHOD     (EXTB) The yield points were formed from the sum of
            events in the four detectors.
           Compton scattering facility used provides a photon
            beam with a continuous energy distribution, rather
            than one discrete energy. hence, the photofission
            cross section could not be obtained directly, but
            were  extracted  from  a  measurement  of fission
            yield as a function of end-point energy.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,LEAST) The unfolding procedure was the
            modification of least structure method of Cook: the
            cook's routine was developed for use not
            bremsstrahlung spectrum, but the specific spectrum
            of Compton scattered monoenergetic photons.
REL-REF    (N,,B.C.Cook,J,NIM,24,256,1963)
            Unfolding 'least-structure' method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are statistical.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic errors were estimated as to
            be about 30%.
COMMENT    Measurements of  the  photofission  cross sections of
            Th-232 and U-236 for an energy range of 5.0  to  8.0
            MeV are reported. The compton scattering facility at
            ames laboratory research reactor was used for  these
            measurements.  Resonance structure at g-ray energies
            of 6.3 and 7.6 MeV is observed in Th-232 and at 5.3,
            6.0, 6.5, and 7.5 MeV in U-236.
