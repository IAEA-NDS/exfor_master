TITLE      PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF TH-232 AND U-236
           FROM THRESHOLD TO 8 MEV.

FACILITY   (REAC,1USAIOW)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G))) A VARIABLE-ENERGY BEAM OF
           MONOENERGETIC PHOTONS WAS OBTAINED BY COMPTON
           SCATTERING THE PRIMARY BEAM OF RADIATIVE CAPTURE
           PHOTONS FROM AN ALUMINIUM PLATE WITH A CONTINUOUSLY
           VARIABLE RADIUS OF CURVATURE.
SAMPLE     THE TARGET OF TH-232 CONSISTED OF 156.4 MG OF MATERIAL
            (4.4 MG/CM**2) AND WAS ASSAYED AT 100% TH-232.
            THE U-236 TARGET CONSISTED OF 317 MG OF MATERIAL
            (8.9 MG/CM**2) ASSAYED AT 89.38% U-236, 9.20% U-235,
            1.306% U-238, AND 0.116% U-234.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) HEAVY-ION SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS.
           EACH OF FOUR DETECTORS USED WAS POSITIONED ON THE ROD
            LOCATED AT 45 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE GAMMA-RAY
            BEAM
PART-DET   (FF)
METHOD     (EXTB) THE YIELD POINTS WERE FORMED FROM THE SUM OF
            EVENTS IN THE FOUR DETECTORS.
           COMPTON SCATTERING FACILITY USED PROVIDES A PHOTON
            BEAM WITH A CONTINUOS ENERGY DISTRIBUTION, RATHER
            THAN ONE DISCRETE ENERGY. HENCE, THE PHOTOFISSION
            CROSS SECTION COULD NOT BE OBTAINED DIRECTLY, BUT WERE
            EXTRACTED FROM A MEASUREMENT OF FISSION YIELD AS A
            FUNCTION OF END-POINT ENERGY.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,UNFLD,LEAST) THE UNFOLDING PROCEDURE WAS THE
            MODIFICATION OF LEAST STRUCTURE METHOD OF COOK: THE
            COOK'S ROUTINE WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE NOT
            BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM, BUT THE SPECIFIC SPECTRUM OF
            COMPTON SCATTERED MONOENERGETIC PHOTONS.
REL-REF    (N,,B.C.COOK,J,NIM/A,24,256,63) UNFOLDING 'LEAST-
           STRUCTURE' METHOD.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WERE ESTIMATED AS
           TO BE ABOUT 30%.
COMMENT    MEASUREMENTS OF THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF
           TH-232 AND U-236 FOR AN ENERGY RANGE OF 5.0 TO 8.0
           MEV ARE REPORTED. THE COMPTON SCATTERING FACILITY AT
           AMES LABORATORY RESEARCH REACTOR WAS USED FOR THESE
           MEASUREMENTS. RESONANCE STRUCTURE AT G-RAY ENERGIES
           OF 6.3 AND 7.6 MEV IS OBSERVED IN TH-232 AND AT 5.3,
           6.0, 6.5, AND 7.5 MEV IN U-236.
