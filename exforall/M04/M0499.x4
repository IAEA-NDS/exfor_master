TITLE      Photoneutron cross sections in Li-7.

SAMPLE     500 g cylindrical target enriched to 99.9%  Li-7. The
            target was wrapped in transparent tape to protect it
            from the atmosphere.
METHOD     (TOF) Photoneutrons were detected at an angle  of  90
            degrees  with  respect  to  the  photon  beam  by  a
            conventional time-of-flight system having  a  flight
            path of 32 m and a resolution of 0.4 ns/m.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The  bremsstrahlung  end-point   energy   was
            increased in 2 MeV steps from 13 to 25 MeV.  At each
            energy, photoneutron T-O-F spectra were measured from
            Li-7  and  from  (H-2)O  and  (D-2)O  targets.  This
            provided  a  ratio  measurement  of  the  90-degrees
            differential  ground-state  cross  section  for  the
            Li-7(g,n0)Li-6   reaction   relative   to   H-2(g,n)
            differential   cross   section.   Near  14.3  MeV  a
            ground-state neutron from Li-7 has the  same  energy
            (7  MeV) as a deuterium photoneutron (Sherman 1970).
            Each time-of-flight  spectrum  was  converted  to  a
            neutron  energy distribution.  Using the information
            about photon  spectrum  these  energy  distributions
            were converted into cross section. At each end-point
            energy the photon spectrum  was  measured  from  the
            difference    between    photoneutron   spectra   of
            geometrically identical targets of  heavy  and light
            water.  Because  the  first  excited  state in final
            nucleus Li-6 lies at energy 2.185 MeV those neutrons
            resulting  from  photons  within  2.185  MeV  of the
            end-point  energy   can   only   result   from   the
            transitions  to  the ground state of Li-6.  Although
            the 1.377 MeV  gap  between  the  first  and  second
            excited  states in Li-6 is less than 2 MeV end-point
            steps used an approximate first-excited-state  cross
            section    was   extracted   by   substracting   the
            groundstate   component   from   the    experimental
            photoneutron  spectrum for each run.  This component
            was obtained by folding  the  measured  ground-state
            cross  section  with the fitted photon distribution,
            to obtain the  ground-state  neutron  component  for
            this  end-point  energy.  The ground-state component
            was substracted and the  residual  neutron  spectrum
            was converted back to a cross section by dividing by
            the calculated bremsstrahlung spectrum.
CORRECTION Corrections  were  used  for  detector dead time  and
            detector efficiency.
COMMENT    Photoneutron energy  spectra  from  Li-7  have   been
            measured     by     time-of-flight    method,    for
            bremsstrahlung end-point energies  increasing  in  2
            mev  steps  from 13 to 25 MeV.  The ground-state and
            approximate  firstexcited-state  differential  cross
            sections  at  90 degrees have been obtained from 8.5
            to 23 MeV.  No pronounced fine  structure  has  been
            observed.  The  integrated  cross section values for
            both cross sections were  obtained  also.
