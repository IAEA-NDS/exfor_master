TITLE      PHOTONEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS IN LI-7.

SAMPLE     500 G CYLINDRICAL TARGET ENRICHED TO 99.9% LI-7.
           THE TARGET WAS WRAPPED IN TRANSPARENT TAPE TO PROTECT
           IT FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.
METHOD     (TOF) PHOTONEUTRONS WERE DETECTED AT AN ANGLE OF
           90 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE PHOTON BEAM BY A
           CONVENTIONAL TIME-OF-FLIGHT SYSTEM HAVING A FLIGHT
           PATH OF 32 M AND A RESOLUTION OF 0.4 NS/M.

ANALYSIS   THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG END-POINT ENERGY WAS INCREASED IN
           2 MEV STEPS FROM 13 TO 25 MEV. AT EACH ENERGY,
           PHOTONEUTRON T-O-F SPECTRA WERE MESURED FROM LI-7
           AND FROM (H-2)O AND (D-2)O TARGETS. THIS PROVIDED
           A RATIO MEASUREMENT OF THE 90-DEGREES DIFFERENTIAL
           GROUND-STATE CROSS SECTION FOR THE LI-7(G,N0)LI-6
           REACTION RELATIVE TO H-2(G,N) DIFFERENTIAL CROSS
           SECTION. NEAR 14.3 MEV A GROUND-STATE NEUTRON FROM
           LI-7 HAS THE SAME ENERGY (7 MEV) AS A DEUTERIUM
           PHOTONEUTRON (SHERMAN 1970). EACH TIME-OF-FLIGHT
           SPECTRUM WAS CONVERTED TO A NEUTRON ENERGY
           DISTRIBUTION. USING THE INFORMATION ABOUT PHOTON
           SPECTRUM THESE ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS WERE CONVERTED
           INTO CROSS SECTION. AT EACH END-POINT ENERGY THE
           PHOTON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED FROM THE DIFFERENCE
           BETWEEN PHOTONEUTRON SPECTRA OF GEOMETRICALLY-
           IDENTICAL TARGETS OF HEAVY AND LIGHT WATER.
           BECAUSE THE FIRST EXCITED STATE IN FINAL NUCLEUS
           LI-6 LIES AT ENERGY 2.185 MEV THOSE NEUTRONS
           RESULTING FROM PHOTONS WITHIN 2.185 MEV OF THE
           END-POINT ENERGY CAN ONLY RESULT FROM THE
           TRANSITIONS TO THE GROUND STATE OF LI-6. ALTHOUGH
           THE 1.377 MEV GAP BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND
           EXCITED STATES IN LI-6 IS LESS THAN 2 MEV END-POINT
           STEPS USED AN APPROXIMATE FIRST-EXCITED-STATE CROSS
           SECTION WAS EXTRACTED BY SUBSTRACTING THE GROUND-
           STATE COMPONENT FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL PHOTONEUTRON
           SPECTRUM FOR EACH RUN. THIS COMPONENT WAS OBTAINED
           BY FOLDING THE MEASURED GROUND-STATE CROSS SECTION
           WITH THE FITTED PHOTON DISTRIBUTION, TO OBTAIN THE
           GROUND-STATE NEUTRON COMPONENT FOR THIS END-POINT
           ENERGY. THE GROUND-STATE COMPONENT WAS SUBSTRACTED
           AND THE RESIDUAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS CONVERTED
           BACK TO A CROSS SECTION BY DIVIDING BY THE
           CALCULATED BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM.

COMMENT    PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRA FROM LI-7 HAVE BEEN
           MEASURED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHOD, FOR BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           END-POINT ENERGIES INCREASING IN 2 MEV STEPS FROM
           13 TO 25 MEV. THE GROUND-STATE AND APPROXIMATE FIRST-
           EXCITED-STATE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS AT 90
           DEGREES HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM 8.5 TO 23 MEV. NO
           PRONOUNCED FINE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN OBSERVED. THE
           INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION VALUES FOR BOTH CROSS
           SECTIONS WERE OBTAINMED ALSO. TOGETHER THEY ACCOUNT
           FOR 39% OF THE EXCHANGE-AUGMENTED DIPOLE SUM OF LI-7.
