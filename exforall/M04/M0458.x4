METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Radiochemical   methods  were  used  to
            separate   the   parent   from   daughter   nucleus,
            respectively Cu-62 and Cu-64.
SAMPLE     The sample of ZnO (20 g weight) was used.
PART-DET   (B+)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) In the case of Zn-64  the  absolute  activity
            was found by comparison with the activity induced in
            Cu-63 by (g,n) reaction,  which  gives  exactly  the
            same end product Cu-62.
ERR-ANALYS No information.
COMMENT    The yields of the combined reactions (g,d) and (g,np)
            have been measured for Zn-64 and Zn-66 by  isolating
            and  measuring  the activity of the residual nuclei,
            respectively Cu-62 and Cu-64.
