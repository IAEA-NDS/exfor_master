TITLE      MEASUREMENTS OF (G,D) AND (G,NP) REACTIONS IN
           THE THRESHOLD REGION.
AUTHOR     (J.GOLDEMBERG,L.MARQUEZ)

FACILITY   (BETAT,3BZLUSP)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) RADIOCHEMICAL METHODS WERE USED TO
           SEPARATE THE PARENT FROM DAUGHTER NUCLEUS,
           RESPECTIVELY CU-62 AND CU-64.
SAMPLE     THE SAMPLE OF ZNO (20 G WEIGHT) WAS USED.
PART-DET   (B+)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   IN THE CASE OF ZN-64 THE ABSOLUTE ACTIVITY WAS
           FOUND BY COMPARISON WITH THE ACTIVITY INDUCED IN
           CU-63 BY (G,N) REACTION, WHICH GIVES EXACTLY THE
           SAME END PRODUCT CU-62.
ERR-ANALYS NO INFORMATION.
COMMENT    THE YIELDS OF THE COMBINED REACTIONS (G,D) AND
            (G,NP) HAVE BEEN MEASURED FOR ZN-64 AND ZN-66 BY
           ISOLATING AND MEASURING THE ACTIVITY OF THE RESIDUAL
           NUCLEI, RESPECTIVELY CU-62 AND CU-64.
