SAMPLE     The photonuclear target was a berillium oxide  sheet,
            57.3 (0.3) g/cm**2 thick.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The  dependence  of  the  photoproton   cross
            section  on  photon  energy  over 40 - 105 MeV range
            assumed to be smooth was obtained  by  an  iterative
            procedure  from  the  present data.  The O-16(g,p-0)
            cross section then was obtained  from  a  particular
            proton  yield  spectrum  at  any  photon energy in a
            range corresponding to the top 5 MeV  of  the  yield
            spectrum   (the   residual   nucleus  N-15  has  the
            relatively large gap of more than 5 MeV between  its
            ground  state  and  first  excited  state and so all
            protons within about 5 MeV of the  endpoint  of  the
            proton  yield  spectrum  correspond to population of
            the ground state of N-15).

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are due to statistics.
           (ERR-1) The systematic error was estimated to be about
            11%.
COMMENT    The O-16(g,p-0)   reaction   has   been  investigated
            between photon energies Eg = 40 and 105 MeV using  a
            bremsstrahlung   beam,  full  angular  distributions
            being obtained at Eg = 60, 80, and 100 MeV.
CORRECTION In accordance  to  note  added  in  proof  after  the
            publication all cross section  data  were  increased
            (by a compiler) by 6%  in connection with the effect
            of large electron energy losses in the gold radiator
            which previously have been neglected.
