TITLE      THE O-16(G,P-0) REACTION AT INTERMEDIATE PHOTON
           ENERGIES.

SAMPLE     THE PHOTONUCLEAR TARGET WAS A BERILLIUM OXIDE
           SHEET, 57.3 (0.3) G/CM**2 THICK.
ANALYSIS   THE DEPENDENCE OF THE PHOTOPROTON CROSS SECTION
           ON PHOTON ENERGY OVER 40 - 105 MEV RANGE ASSUMED
           TO BE SMOOTH WAS OBTAINED BY AN ITERATIVE
           PROCEDURE FROM THE PRESENT DATA. THE O-16(G,P-0)
           CROSS SECTION THEN WAS OBTAINED FROM A PARTICULAR
           PROTON YIELD SPECTRUM AT ANY PHOTON ENERGY IN A
           RANGE CORRESPONDING TO THE TOP 5 MEV OF THE YIELD
           SPECTRUM (THE RESIDUAL NUCLEUS N-15 HAS THE
           RELATIVELY LARGE GAP OF MORE THAN 5 MEV BETWEEN
           ITS GROUND STATE AND FIRST EXCITED STATE AND SO ALL
           PROTONS WITHIN ABOUT 5 MEV OF THE ENDPOINT OF THE
           PROTON YIELD SPECTRUM CORRESPOND TO POPULATION OF
           THE GROUND STATE OF N-15).
EN-SEC     (E-LVL,7-N-15)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE ERRORS ARE DUE TO STATISTICS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERROR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
            ABOUT 11%.
COMMENT    THE O-16(G,P-0) REACTION HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED
           BETWEEN PHOTON ENERGIES EG = 40 AND 105 MEV USING
           A BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM, FULL ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
           BEING OBTAINED AT EG = 60, 80, AND 100 MEV.
CORRECTION IN ACCORDANCE TO NOTE ADDED IN PROOF AFTER THE
           PUBLICATION ALL CROSS SECTION DATA WERE INCREASED
            (BY A COMPILER) BY 6% IN CONNECTION WITH THE
           EFFECT OF LARGE ELECTRON ENERGY LOSSES IN THE GOLD
           RADIATOR WHICH PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED.
