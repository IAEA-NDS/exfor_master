SAMPLE     THREE SAMPLES WERE USED. THESE WERE (D-2)O (TO
           MONITOR PHOTON DISTRIBUTION), (H-2)O (THE O-16
           SAMPLE), AND A 'BLANK' (AN EMPTY CONTAINER TO
           MEASURE THE BACKGROUNDS).
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE TOTAL GROUND-STATE CROSS SECTION
           WAS DETERMINED FROM THE SERIES OF PHOTONEUTRON
           TIME-OF-FLIGHT SPECTRA BY USING THEIR HIGHEST
           5.2 MEV REGIONS OF BREMSSTRAHLUNG TIP WHICH
           CORRESPOND UNAMBIGIOUSLY TO THE GROUND-STATE
           TRANSITIONS (THE FIRST EXCITED STATE IN O-15
           IS AT 5.2 MEV).
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    PHOTONEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRA FROM THE REACTION
           O-16(G,N0)O-15 WERE MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF
           LABORATORY ANGLE OVER A RANGE OF EXCITATION
           ENERGIES FROM 30 TO 35 MEV. THESE SPECTRA AND
           PHOTONEUTRON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS WERE USED
           TO OBTAIN THE ABSOLUTE PHOTONEUTRON GROUND-STATE
           CROSS SECTION AND ITS QUADRUPOLE COMPONENT.
