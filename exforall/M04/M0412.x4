SAMPLE     Three samples   were  used.  These  were  (D-2)O  (to
            monitor  photon  distribution),  (H-2)O  (the   O-16
            sample),  and  a  'blank'  (an  empty  container  to
            measure the backgrounds).
ANALYSIS   The absolute total  ground-state  cross  section  was
            determined   from   the   series   of   photoneutron
            time-of-flight spectra by using  their  highest  5.2
            MeV  regions  of bremsstrahlung tip which correspond
            unambigiously to the ground-state  transitions  (the
            first excited state in O-15 is at 5.2 MeV).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.
COMMENT    Photoneutron energy   spectra   from   the   reaction
            O-16(g,n0)O-15  were  measured  as  a  functions  of
            laboratory angle over a range of excitation energies
            from 30 to 35 MeV.  These spectra  and  photoneutron
            angular   distributions  were  used  to  obtain  the
            absolute photoneutron ground-state cross section and
            its quadrupole component.

REACTION   (8-O-16(G,N)8-O-15,EP/PAR,SIG)
           E2 component. The scale of the cross section was
            determined relative to that of the deutron.
ANALYSIS   The E2  component  of  cross  section was obtained by
            using the neutron penetrabilities in  the  frame  of
            model of P.C.-K.Kuo.
