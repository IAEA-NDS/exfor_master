TITLE      TWO-BODY PHOTODOSINTEGRATION OF HE-3 BETWEEN 150
           AND 350 MEV.

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAMIT)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) THE G-QUANTA SOURCE IS BREMSSTRAHLUNG
           BUT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ANGLE AND THE ENERGY
           OF THE OUTGOING DEUTERON IS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE
           THE KINEMATICS OF A HE-3(G,D)P EVENT.
METHOD     (MAGFR)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN,SWPC) THE BATES HIGH-RESOLUTION
           SPECTROMETER WITH SYSTEM OF MULTIWIRE CHAMBERS
           AND PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS IN ITS FOCAL PLANE.
SAMPLE     THE HE-3 GAS TARGET WAS CONTAINED IN A CYLINDRICAL
           ALUMINIUM CELL OF 10 CM DIAMETER. THE GAS PRESSURE
           WAS TYPICALLY 1.03 MPA. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE TARGET
           GAS WAS 80.6 (1.8) K. THE TARGET DENSITY WAS ABOUT
           4.6 MG/CM**2. THE PURITY OF THE GAS WAS GREATER THAN
           99.9%.
PART-DET   (D)
ANALYSIS   THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ANGLE AND ENERGY OF THE
           DEUTERON FROM THE REACTION  IS SUFFICIENT TO
           DETERMINE THE KINEMATICS OF AN EVENT. THE CROSS
           SECTION OF THE REACTION FOR NARROW BIN OF ENERGY
           WAS OBTAINED FROM NUMBER OF EVENTS DIVIDED BY THE
           THE NUMBER OF INCIDENT PHOTONS IN THIS ENERGY BIN.

           PARAMETRISATIONS OF THICK-TARGET BREMSSTRAHLUNG.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ONLY ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT 6%.
CORRECTION THE MAIN CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR:
           - DEUTERON LOSSES THROUGH INTERACTIONS IN THE TARGET
             WALL, SPECTROMETER END WINDOW, CHAMBERS, AND
             UPPER COUNTER (1,5%);
           - REDUCTION OF THE LOCAL GAS DENSITY IN THE TARGET
             BECAUSE OF BEAM HEATING (3.8 - 5.5%);
           - CONTRIBUTIONS OF 1.5 - 3.7% FROM THE HE-4 AND
             HEAVIER IMPURITIES IN THE TARGET GAS.
COMMENT    DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR HE-3(G,D)H-1 FOR
           INCIDENT ENERGIES BETWEEN 150 AND 350 MEV AT
           CENTER-OF-MASS PROTON ANGLES NEAR 60 AND 90 DEGREES
           HAVE BEEN MEASURED WITH AN ABSOLUTE UNCERTAINTY OF
           LESS THAN 6%. THE EXPERIMENT USED A SINGLE-ARM
           SPECTROMETER, A GAS TARGET, AND AN UNCOLLIMATED
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM.
