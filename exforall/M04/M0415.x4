INSTITUTE  (2FR SAC)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR SAC)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD) The energy resolution was about 10(2)%.
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4PI detector: 250 l of gadolinium-loaded
           liquid scintillator.
PART-DET   (N)
SAMPLE     Water target of 7 g/cm**2 thick.
ANALYSIS   The detection process permits the measurement of
           the photoneutron multiplicity 'i' and therefore the
           simultaneous and independent measurement of each
           partial inclusive photoneutron cross section
           sig (g,in) for each value of photon energy Eg.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors presented are resulted from
           the combination in quadrature of the purely
           statistical uncertainties of the photoneutron
           counting rates (including background  subtraction),
           the mostly statistical uncertainties related to
           photon beam, and the mostly systematic uncertainties
           associated with the neutron-detector efficiency.
COMMENT    The inclusive partial photoneutron cross section
           sig(g,1n...) and sig(g,2n...), and the total
           photoneutron cross section sig(Eg) = sum(sig(g,in))
           for O-16 have been measured with monoenergetic
           photons in the energy range above the giant
           resonance and below the meson thresholds. the
           measured integrated total photoneutron cross section
           up to 140 MeV is 0.67(0.07) TRK sum-rule units.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from Table 1.
