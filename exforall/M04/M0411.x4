INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) THE TAGGING SYSTEM WAS A SPECIAL PHOTON
           SPECTROMETER CONSISTING OF A LIQUID-DEUTERIUM TARGET
           VIEWED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT DETECTOR FOR NEUTRONS FROM
           THE REACTION H-2(G,N).
METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
PART-DET   (G)
SAMPLE     THE ABSORBER CONSISTED OF TWO U DISKS OF TOTAL
           THICKNESS 13.935 MM AND MASS 530.86 G (DENSITY =
           18.759 G/CM**2).
ANALYSIS   THE ABSOLUTE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION WAS
           DETERMINED FROM 4000 CYCLES OF INTERCHANGE OF
           ABSORBER AND BLANK. THE VALUES OBTAINED FROM
           PARABOLIC FITS TO DATA ARE PRESENTED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) THE STATISTICAL ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR2) THE TOTAL ERRORS WHICH INCLUDE THE
           STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC (ABOUT 0.2%)
           UNCERTAINTIES ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    THE TOTAL-ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION OF URANIUM
           FOR PHOTON ENERGIES BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MEV WAS
           OBTAINED AND USED FOR ESTIMATION OF THE CROSS
           SECTION FOR PAIR CREATION ON THE U-238 NUCLEUS.
