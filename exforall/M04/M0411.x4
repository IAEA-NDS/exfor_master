INC-SOURCE (QMPH,TAGD) The tagging system was a  special  photon
            spectrometer consisting of a liquid-deuterium target
            viewed by time-of-flight detector for neutrons  from
            the reaction H-2(g,n).

SAMPLE     The absorber  consisted  of  two  U  disks  of  total
            thickness 13.935 mm and mass  530.86  g  (density  =
            18.759 g/cm**2).
ANALYSIS   The absolute absorption cross section was  determined
            from  4000  cycles  of  interchange  of absorber and
            blank.  the values obtained from parabolic  fits  to
            data are presented.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The   total  errors   which   include   the
            statistical   and    systematical    (about    0.2%)
            uncertainties are presented.
COMMENT    The total-absorption cross  section  of  uranium  for
            photon  energies  between 10 and 20 MeV was obtained
            and used for estimation of  the  cross  section  for
            pair creation on the U-238 nucleus.
