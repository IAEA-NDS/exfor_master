TITLE      The (gamma,n) reaction in Be-9 at intermediate energies

METHOD     (MANGB,ACTIV) saturated   solutions   of  sodium  and
            potassium  permanganate  were   used.   the   active
            Mn-56(O-2) precipitated from the solution on neutron
            capture in manganese,  was filtered off and  counted
            by Geiger counter.
SAMPLE     The berillium target.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) saturated solutions of sodium  and  potassium
            permanganate   were  used  as  the  Szilard-Chalmers
            neutron detector.  The activity  of  Mn-56(o-2)  was
            measured by geiger counter.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors given are statistical.
CORRECTION six major corrections were required.  These were  the
            corrections for:
            - the differential absorption of gamma-rays in
              beryllium and heavy water (used for background
              measurements);
            - the slight difference in geometry of the samples
              (beryllium and heavy water);
            - the (n,2n) reaction occuring in beryllium,
              produced by photoneutrons;
            - the differential escape of neutrons from the
              detector;
            - the collisions of neutrons and Be-9, with loss
              of neutron energy, incide the blocks;
            - the Be-al alloy used in place of beryllium for
              one experiment.
COMMENT    Cross sections for  the  reaction  Be-9(g,n)Be-8  for
            monochromatic  gamma  rays  in the energy range from
            2.6 to 8.1 MeV have  been  obtained  using  a  large
            Szilard-Chalmers neutron detector.
