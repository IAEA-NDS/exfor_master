TITLE      THE (G,N) REACTION IN BE-9 AT INTERMEDIATE ENERGIES.

METHOD     (MANGB,ACTIV) SATURATED SOLUTIONS OF SODIUM AND
           POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE WERE USED. THE ACTIVE
           MN-56(O-2) PRECIPITATED FROM THE SOLUTION ON NEUTRON
           CAPTURE IN MANGANESE, WAS FILTERED OFF AND COUNTED
           BY GEIGER COUNTER.
SAMPLE     THE BERILLIUM TARGET.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) SATURATED SOLUTIONS OF SODIUM AND
           POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE WERE USED AS THE
           SZILARD-CHALMERS NEUTRON DETECTOR. THE ACTIVITY OF
           MN-56(O-2) WAS MEASURED BY GEIGER COUNTER.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS GIVEN ARE STATISTICAL.
CORRECTION SIX MAJOR CORRECTIONS WERE REQUIRED. THESE WERE
           THE CORRECTIONS FOR:
           - THE DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION OF GAMMA-RAYS IN
             BERYLLIUM AND HEAVY WATER (USED FOR BACKGROUND
             MEASUREMENTS);
           - THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN GEOMETRY OF THE SAMPLES
             (BERYLLIUM AND HEAVY WATER);
           - THE (N,2N) REACTION OCCURING IN BERYLLIUM,
             PRODUCED BY PHOTONEUTRONS;
           - THE DIFFERENTIAL ESCAPE OF NEUTRONS FROM THE
             DETECTOR;
           - THE COLLISIONS OF NEUTRONS AND BE-9, WITH LOSS
             OF NEUTRON ENERGY, INCIDE THE BLOCKS;
           - THE BE-AL ALLOY USED IN PLACE OF BERYLLIUM FOR
             ONE EXPERIMENT.
COMMENT    CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE REACTION BE-9(G,N)BE-8 FOR
           MONOCHROMATIC GAMMA RAYS IN THE ENERGY RANGE FROM
           2.6 TO 8.1 MEV HAVE BEEN OBTAINED USING A LARGE
           SZILARD-CHALMERS NEUTRON DETECTOR.
