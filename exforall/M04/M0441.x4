METHOD     (INTB) A  g-ray  source (Sb or Y) was inserted in the
            beryllium shell and carefully mounted in  a  central
            position.
SAMPLE     The beryllium sample was in form of  spherical  shell
            of inner radius r1 = 15.31 mm and of outer radius r2
            = 16.81 mm (shell thickness t = 1.5 mm).  The  shell
            was  found  to Be spherical and of uniform thickness
            to within 0.005 mm.  The mass of the shell was 8.838
            g.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The  neutron detector assembly consisted of BF3
            counters embedded  in  a  5-foot  diameter  graphite
            sphere moderator.
ANALYSIS   Counting statistics of 1%  were obtained and then the
            Be  shell was removed for the background count.  The
            true-counts-to-background  ratio  was  approximately
            7:1 for the y case and 70:1 for the Sb source.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors given for cross section values are
            root-mean-square uncertainties calculated taken into
            account all corrections.
           Common uncertainties:
           (ERR-1) gamma-ray source strength;
           (ERR-2) purity of g-ray source;
           (ERR-3) neutron detector dead time;
           (ERR-4) flatness of detector sensitivity;
           (ERR-5,0.0,0.1) finite source size;
           (ERR-6,0.0,0.1) attenuation of g-ray in Be shell;
           (ERR-7) geometry of Be shell and position  of
            g-ray source;
           (ERR-8) absolute  source  strength  of NBS N2 Sb-g-Be
            neutron source.
COMMENT    The present method of measuring the Be-9 photoneutron
            cross section using radioactive sources  Y-89  (1.85
            MeV)   and   Sb-124   (1.69   MeV)   is  capable  of
            considerably  higher   precision   than   techniques
            previously used.
