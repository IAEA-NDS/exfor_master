TITLE      PRECISION MEASUREMENT OF THE BE-9(G,N) CROSS
           SECTION.

INC-SOURCE (MPH=(51-SB-124(0,G))). EG = 1.69 MEV.
           (MPH=(39-Y-88(0,G))).   EG = 1.85 MEV.
METHOD     (INTB) A G-RAY SOURCE (SB OR Y) WAS INSERTED IN THE
           BERILLIUM SHELL AND CAREFULLY MOUNTED IN A CENTRAL
           POSITION.
SAMPLE     THE BERILLIUM SAMPLE WAS IN FORM OF SPHERICAL SHELL
           OF INNER RADIUS R1 = 15.31 MM AND OF OUTER RADIUS
           R2 = 16.81 MM (SHELL THICKNESS T = 1.5 MM). THE
           SHELL WAS FOUND TO BE SPHERICAL AND OF UNIFORM
           THICKNESS TO WITHIN 0.005 MM. THE MASS OF THE SHELL
           WAS 8.838 G.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) THE NEUTRON DETECTOR ASSEMBLY CONSISTED OF
           BF3 COUNTERS EMBEDDED IN A 5-FOOT DIAMETER GRAPHITE
           SPHERE MODERATOR.
ANALYSIS   COUNTING STATISTICS OF 1% WERE OBTAINED AND THEN
           THE BE SHELL WAS REMOUVED FOR THE BACKGROUND COUNT.
           THE TRUE-COUNTS-TO-BACKGROUND RATIO WAS APPROXI-
           MATELY 7:1 FOR THE Y CASE AND 70:1 FOR THE SB SOURCE.
CORRECTION SOME KINDS OF CORRECTIONS TO THE DATA WERE USED.
           THESE WERE CORRECTIONS FOR:
           - NEUTRON COUNTER DEAD-TIME;
           - FINITE SOURCE-SIZE;
           - COMPTON SCATTERING OF G-QUANTA IN THE SOURCE;
           - G-RAY ATTENUATION IN THE BE SHELL;
           - NONUNIFORM ACTIVATION OF THE ANTIMONY SPHERE;
           - EFFECT OF THE 2.76 MEV G-RAYS IN THE Y-89 SPECTRUM;
           - BRANCHING RATIO OF THE SB-124 DECAY;
           - EFFECT OF THE 2.09 MEV G-RAY IN THE SB-124 SPECTRUM.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS GIVEN FOR CROSS SECTION VALUES ARE
           ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE UNCERTAINTIES CALCULATED TAKEN
           INTO ACCOUNT ALL CORRECTIONS.
COMMENT    THE PRESENT METHOD OF MEASURING THE BE-9
           PHOTONEUTRON CROSS SECTION USING RADIOACTIVE
           SOURCES Y-89 (1.85 MEV) AND SB-124 (1.69 MEV) IS
           CAPABLE OF CONCIDERABLY HIGHER PRECISION THAN
           TECHNIQUES PREVIOUSLY USED.
