TITLE      Photofission cross section of Th-232.
AUTHOR     (H.X.Zhang,T.R.Yeh,H.Lancman)

FACILITY   (DYNAM,1USABLN)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(73-TA-181(P,G)74-W-182)) The   energy   of  the
            emitted g-ray is fully  Doppler-shifted.  It  varies
            with  the  angle  of emission relative to the proton
            beam.
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     Foils of thorium, 30 mg/cm**2 thick, containing 99.9%
            of Th-232.
PART-DET   (FF)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Two  8  micron  thick strips of polycarbonate
            films (KIMFOL) with thorium sample between them.
ANALYSIS   The photofission  cross  section  sig(g,f)  at photon
            energy Eg is related to the fission fragments counts
            in a strip.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The  errors  are  given  include  counting
            errors,  errors  in  efficiency  calibration  of the
            g-ray and fission fragment detectors,  uncertainties
            in the angular distribution of the fission fragments
            and g-rays,  and uncertainties in the  alignment  of
            the  thorium  foils and kimfol films relative to the
            proton target.
CORRECTION The cross   sections   given   were   corrected   for
            contributions  caused  by  the  unwanted  gamma-rays
            emitted  from some (p,g) resonances.  Except for one
            case,  these corrections did not exceed 10%  of  the
            presented  values.  The  sum of the corrections from
            fission caused by neutrons from (g,n),  (g,2n),  and
            fission,  as well as contribution from (g,nf),  were
            estimated to be smoller than 2%.
COMMENT    The photofission cross section of Th-232 was measured
            in the 5.8 - 12.0 MeV energy range with  an  average
            photon  energy  resolution  of 600 eV.  Intermediate
            structure was observed at 5.91, 5.97, and 6.31 MeV.
