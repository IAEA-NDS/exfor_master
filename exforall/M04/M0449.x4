TITLE      PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF TH-232.
AUTHOR     (H.X.ZHANG,T.R.YEH,H.LANCMAN)

INSTITUTE  (1USABLN)
FACILITY   (DYNAM,1USABLN)
INC-SOURCE (MPH=(73-TA-181(P,G)74-W-182)) THE ENERGY OF THE
           EMITTED G-RAY IS FULLY DOPPLER-SHIFTED. IT VARIES
           WITH THE ANGLE OF EMISSION RELATIVE TO THE PROTON
           BEAM.
METHOD     (EXTB)
SAMPLE     FOILS OF THORIUM, 30 MG/CM**2 THICK, CONTAINING
           99.9% OF TH-232.
PART-DET   (FF)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) TWO 8 MICRON THICK STRIPS OF POLYCARBONATE
           FILMS (KIMFOL) WITH THORIUM SAMPLE BETWEEN THEM.
ANALYSIS   THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION SIG(G,F) AT PHOTON
           ENERGY EG IS RELATED TO THE FISSION FRAGMENTS COUNTS
           IN A STRIP.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE GIVEN INCLUDE COUNTING ERRORS, ERRORS
           IN EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION OF THE G-RAY AND FISSION
           FRAGMENT DETECTORS, UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION OF THE FISSION FRAGMENTS AND G-RAYS,
           AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE THORIUM
           FOILS AND KIMFOL FILMS RELATIVE TO THE PROTON
           TARGET.
CORRECTION THE CROSS SECTIONS GIVEN WERE CORRECTED FOR
           CONTRIBUTIONS CAUSED BY THE UNWANTED GAMMA-RAYS
           EMITTED FROM SOME (P,G) RESONANCES. EXCEPT FOR
           ONE CASE, THESE CORRECTIONS DID NOT EXCEED 10%
           OF THE PRESENTED VALUES. THE SUM OF THE CORRECTIONS
           FROM FISSION CAUSED BY NEUTRONS FROM (G,N), (G,2N),
           AND FISSION, AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTION FROM (G,NF),
           WERE ESTIMATED TO BE SMOLLER THAN 2%.
COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF TH-232 WAS MEASURED
           IN THE 5.8 - 12.0 MEV ENERGY RANGE WITH AN AVERAGE
           PHOTON ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 600 EV. INTERMEDIATE
           STRUCTURE WAS OBSERVED AT 5.91, 5.97, AND 6.31 MEV.
