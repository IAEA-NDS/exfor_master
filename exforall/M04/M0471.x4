SAMPLE     The liquid  He-3  target  has   been contained in the
            He-4 cryostat dewar. The 30 liter of He-3 gas in the
            storage  tank were the slowly pumped into the target
            space where condensation of He-3 liquid was visually
            observed  at  a pressure of about 525 torr.  Typical
            operating pressures and temperatures  for  the  He-4
            bath  space  and He-3 target space were 110 torr and
            2.69  degrees  K,  450  torr  and  2.70  degrees  K,
            respectively.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) The neutron detection  system  was  a  modified
            'Halpern-type  detector'  consisting of BF3 counters
            immersed  in   a   mineral-oil   moderator.   Eleven
            counters,  each  having a diameter of 2 inchs and an
            active length of 15.7 inches,  were placed  parallel
            and around the central 6.75 inches beam tube.
COMMENT    The He-3(g,n)2p cross section has been measured in  1
            MeV  steps  from  threshold  to  30  MeV  using  the
            national bureau of standards  betatron  and  a  He-4
            cryostat  to produce a 40-cm***3 liquid He-3 target.
            The  measured  cross  section  shows  a  broad  peak
            between  14  and 20 MeV with a maximum cross section
            at about  0.90  mb.  The  integrated  cross  section
            values were obtained also.

            registered   in   the  standard  ion  chamber  (beam
            monitor).  The cross section was unfolded  from  the

            penfoldleiss method.
