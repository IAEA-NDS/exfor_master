SAMPLE     THE LIQUID HE-3 TARGET HAVE BEEN CONTAINED IN THE
           HE-4 CRYOSTAT DEWAR. THE 30 LITER OF HE-3 GAS IN THE
           STORAGE TANK WERE THE SLOWLY PUMPED INTO THE TARGET
           SPACE WHERE CONDENSATION OF HE-3 LIQUID WAS VISUALLY
           OBSERVED AT A PRESSURE OF ABOUT 525 TORR. TYPICAL
           OPERATING PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES FOR THE HE-4
           BATH SPACE AND HE-3 TARGET SPACE WERE 110 TORR AND
           2.69 DEGREES K, 450 TORR AND 2.70 DEGREES K,
           RESPECTIVELY.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (BF3) THE NEUTRON DETECTION SYSTEM WAS A MODIFIED
           'HALPERN-TYPE DETECTOR' CONSISTING OF BF3 COUNTERS
           IMMERSED IN A MINERAL-OIL MODERATOR. ELEVEN COUNTERS,
           EACH HAVING A DIAMETER OF 2 INCHS AND AN ACTIVE
           LENGTH OF 15.7 INCHES, WERE PLACED PARALLEL AND
           AROUND THE CENTRAL 6.75 INCHES BEAM TUBE.
COMMENT    THE HE-3(G,N)2P CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN MEASURED IN
           1 MEV STEPS FROM THRESHOLD TO 30 MEV USING THE
           NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS BETATRON AND A HE-4
           CRYOSTAT TO PRODUCE A 40-CM***3 LIQUID HE-3 TARGET.
           THE MEASURED CROSS SECTION SHOWS A BROAD PEAK
           BETWEEN 14 AND 20 MEV WITH A MAXIMUM CROSS SECTION
           AT ABOUT 0.90 MB. THE INTEGRATED CROSS SECTION VALUES
           WERE OBTAINED ALSO.
