DETECTOR   (GLASD) Two cylindrical glass detectors.
ANALYSIS   The angular distributions of fission fragments were
            treated in form of w(theta) = a + b*(sin(theta))**2
            + c*(sin(2teta))**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.
COMMENT    Results of measurements are presented for angular
            distributions of photofission fragments of Th-232
            and U-234,236,238 by bremsstrahlung g-rays in the
            end-point energy range Eg-max = 6 - 10 MeV.
