FACILITY   (MICRT,4CCPFEI)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB)
PART-DET   (FF)
DETECTOR   (GLASD) TWO CYLINDRICAL GLASS DETECTORS.
ANALYSIS   THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE
           TREATED IN FORM OF W(TETA) = A + B*(SIN(TETA))**2 +
           C*(SIN(2TETA))**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN.
COMMENT    RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED FOR ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTIONS OF PHOTOFISSION FRAGMENTS OF TH-232
           AND U-234,236,238 BY BREMSSTRAHLUNG G-RAYS IN THE
           END-POINT ENERGY RANGE EG-MAX = 6 - 10 MEV.
