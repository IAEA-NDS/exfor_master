ANALYSIS   FROM EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRA OF SCATTERED PHOTONS
           PEAK CENTROIDS AND AREAS WERE EXTRACTED USING
           THE COMPUTER PROGRAM 'SAMPO'. THE CENTROIDS WERE
           CONVERTED TO ENERGIES USING A LINEAR CALIBRATION
           BASED ON FIVE LEVELS (FROM 2.125 TO 8.920 MEV)
           STRONGLY EXCITED IN PHOTON SCATTERING FROM B-11.
           THE SCATTERING YIELDS WERE CONVERTED TO CROSS
           SECTIONS USING AN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF THE
           PRODUCT OF INCIDENT PHOTON INTENSITY WITH THE
           DETECTOR EFFICIENCY.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY.
           (DATA-ERR2) SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE
           NO LARGER THAN 8%, ARISING FROM UNCERTAINTIES IN
           THE PHOTON FLUX (5%), GEOMETRICAL FACTOR (5%),
           ATOMIC ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT (3%), AND PHOTON
           ENERGY (1%).
COMMENT    RESONANT PHOTON SCATTERING FROM FE-56 HAS BEEN
           MEASURED FROM 5 TO 10 MEV USING GE(LI) DETECTOR AND
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAMS WITH END-POINT ENERGIES OF 7.6
           AND 10.3 MEV. AVERAGE ELASTIC AND INELASTIC (TO THE
           FIRST EXCITED STATE) PHOTON SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS
           WERE MEASURED FROM 5.8 TO 11.5 MEV (I.E. TO ABOVE
           NEUTRON THRESHOLD).

ANALYSIS   THE TOTAL PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS SECTION WAS
           EXTRACTED FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL ELASIC AND
           INELASTIC PHOTON SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS
           UNDER THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE SCATTERING IS
           DOMINATED BY DIPOLE EXCITATIONS (AS EXPECTED FROM
           CONSIDERATION OF THE E1, M1, AND E2 SUM RULES) AND
           THAT INELASTIC SCATTERING TO MORE HIGHLY EXCITED
           STATES (THAN FIRST EXCITED STATE) CAN BE NEGLECTED.
