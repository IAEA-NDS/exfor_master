SAMPLE     2.4 g/cm**2 target of natural iron (92% Fe-56).

ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) From  experimental   spectra   of   scattered
            photons  peak  centroids  and  areas  were extracted
            using the computer program  'sampo'.  The  centroids
            were   converted   to   energies   using   a  linear
            calibration based on  five  levels  (from  2.125  to
            8.920  MeV)  strongly  excited  in photon scattering
            from B-11.  The scattering yields were converted  to
            cross  sections  using an empirical determination of
            the product of incident photon  intensity  with  the
            detector efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors  only.  Systematic  errors
            are estimated to be no larger than 8%,  arising from
            uncertainties in the photon flux  (5%),  geometrical
            factor (5%), atomic absorption coefficient (3%), and
            photon energy (1%).
COMMENT    Resonant photon   scattering   from  Fe-56  has  been
            measured from 5 to 10 MeV using Ge(Li) detector  and
            bremsstrahlung  beams with end-point energies of 7.6
            and 10.3 MeV.  Average elastic and inelastic (to the
            first   excited   state)   photon  scattering  cross
            sections were measured from 5.8 to 11.5 MeV (i.e. to
            above neutron threshold).

ANALYSIS   The total photoabsorption cross section was extracted
            from  the  experimental elastic and inelastic photon
            scattering cross sections under the assumptions that
            the  scattering  is  dominated by dipole excitations
            (as expected from consideration of the E1,  M1,  and
            E2  sum rules) and that inelastic scattering to more
            highly excited states (than first excited state) can
            be neglected.
