ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) From   experimental   spectra   of  scattered
            photons peak  centroids  and  areas  were  extracted
            using  the  computer program 'sampo'.  The centroids
            were  converted   to   energies   using   a   linear
            calibration  based  on  five  levels  (from 2.125 to
            8.920 MeV) strongly  excited  in  photon  scattering
            from  B-11.  The scattering yields were converted to
            cross sections using an empirical  determination  of
            the  product  of  incident photon intensity with the
            detector efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors only.
           (ERR-1,0.0,8.) Systematic  errors  are  estimated  to
            be no larger than 8%, arising from uncertainties  in
            the  photon   flux  (5%), geometrical  factor  (5%),
            atomic   absorption  coefficient  (3%),  and  photon
            energy (1%).
COMMENT    Resonant photon  scattering  from  Fe-56   has   been
            measured  from 5 to 10 MeV using Ge(Li) detector and
            bremsstrahlung beams with end-point energies of  7.6
            and 10.3 MeV.  Average elastic and inelastic (to the
            first  excited  state)   photon   scattering   cross
            sections were measured from 5.8 to 11.5 MeV (i.e. to
            above neutron threshold).

ANALYSIS   The total photoabsorption cross section was extracted
            from  the  experimental elastic and inelastic photon
            scattering cross sections under the assumptions that
            the  scattering  is  dominated by dipole excitations
            (as expected from consideration of the E1,  M1,  and
            E2  sum rules) and that inelastic scattering to more
            highly excited states (than first excited state) can
            be neglected.
