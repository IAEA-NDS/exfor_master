METHOD     (MAGFR) The  photoprotons  are magnetically deflected
            out of the photon beam and focused onto a detector.
SAMPLE     The deuterated  target  consisted  of  a stack of two
            pieces of deuterated polyethylene  foil,  the  total
            thickness  of which was determined to be 9.76 (0.18)
            mg/cm**2.  The components,  given by percentages  in
            weight,  are:  75.54%  for C-12, 23.73% for H-2, and
            0.73%  for H-1.  The concentrations for  oxygen  and
            nitrogen were found to be below 0.5%.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) The   detector   is   circular,   ruggedized,
            partially depleted surface-barrier detector  with  a
            sensitive  area  of 2000 mm**2 and a depletion depth
            of about 300 mu.  This detector was cooled to  about
            200 degrees k by the use of liquid nitrogen.
ANALYSIS   Using the same deuterated  target,  the  same  magnet
            system  and the same detector,  the yield of compton
            electrons was measured that were  emitted  into  the
            same  solid  angle  as  the photoprotons.  Since the
            compton cross section is well  known,  the  rate  of
            photoprotons  in  terms  of the incident photon flux
            can be calculated accurately and is  independent  of
            the  properties of the beam monitor and the shape of
            the bremsstrahlung if the  spectrometer  is  set  in
            both  measurements to the same primary photon energy
            bin.

COMMENT    The absolute  differential  cross  section  for   the
            photodisintegration of the deuteron at 0-degrees for
            the outgoing proton has been measured at  10.74  MeV
            lab  photon  energy  using  bremsstrahlung  beam,  a
            deuterated  target,   a   magnet   system,   and   a
            surfacebarrier detector.  The absolute cross section
            was determined with an angular distribution of  1.25
            degrees.  The  result,  pertaining to a 4.6 MeV wide
            photon energy interval,  favours a  minimum  in  the
            differential  cross  section  around  10  MeV photon
            energy.
