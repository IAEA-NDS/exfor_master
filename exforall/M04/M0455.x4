TITLE      FORWARD PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF THE DEUTERON
           AT 10.74 MEV PHOTON ENERGY.

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (MAGFR) THE PHOTOPROTONS ARE MAGNETICALLY
           DEFLECTED OUT OF THE PHOTON BEAM AND FOCUSED ONTO
           A DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     THE DEUTERATED TARGET CONSISTED OF A STACK OF TWO
           PIECES OF DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE FOIL, THE TOTAL
           THICKNESS OF WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO BE 9.76 (0.18)
           MG/CM**2. THE COMPONENTS, GIVEN BY PERCENTAGES IN
           WEIGHT, ARE: 75.54% FOR C-12, 23.73% FOR H-2, AND
           0.73% FOR H-1. THE CONCENTRATIONS FOR OXYGEN AND
           NITROGEN WERE FOUND TO BE BELOW 0.5%.
PART-DET   (P)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) THE DETECTOR IS CIRCULAR, RUGGEDIZED,
           PARTIALLY DEPLETED SURFACE-BARRIER DETECTOR WITH
           A SENSITIVE AREA OF 2000 MM**2 AND A DEPLETION
           DEPTH OF ABOUT 300 MU. THIS DETECTOR WAS COOLED
           TO ABOUT 200 DEGREES K BY THE USE OF LIQUID
           NITROGEN.
ANALYSIS   USING THE SAME DEUTERATED TARGET, THE SAME MAGNET
           SYSTEM AND THE SAME DETECTOR, THE YIELD OF COMPTON
           ELECTRONS WAS MEASURED THAT WERE EMITTED INTO THE
           SAME SOLID ANGLE AS THE PHOTOPROTONS. SINCE THE
           COMPTON CROSS SECTION IS WELL KNOWN, THE RATE OF
           PHOTOPROTONS IN TERMS OF THE INCIDENT PHOTON FLUX
           CAN BE CALCULATED ACCURATELY AND IS INDEPENDENT OF
           THE PROPERTIES OF THE BEAM MONITOR AND THE SHAPE OF
           THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG IF THE SPECTROMETER IS SET IN
           BOTH MEASUREMENTS TO THE SAME PRIMARY PHOTON ENERGY
           BIN.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERROR ONLY.
COMMENT    THE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE
           PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF THE DEUTERON AT 0-DEGREES FOR
           THE OUTGOING PROTON HAS BEEN MEASURED AT 10.74 MEV
           LAB PHOTON ENERGY USING BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM, A
           DEUTERATED TARGET, A MAGNET SYSTEM, AND A SURFACE-
           BARRIER DETECTOR. THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION WAS
           DETERMINED WITH AN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF 1.25
           DEGREES. THE RESULT, PERTAINING TO A 4.6 MEV WIDE
           PHOTON ENERGY INTERVAL, FAVOURS A MINIMUM IN THE
           DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION AROUND 10 MEV PHOTON
           ENERGY.
