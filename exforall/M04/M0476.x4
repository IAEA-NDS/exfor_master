FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR SAC)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,KINDT) Kinematically determined (reaction
           particle tagged) energy of incident photon.
           Bremsstrahlung was used as a photon source, but the
           the energy of the photon originating the reaction
           event is determined by the momentum of the particle
           particle analyzed in the magnetic spectrometer.
METHOD     (MAGFR,COINC,EDE)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN) Magnetic spectrometer and plastic
           scintillators.
SAMPLE     The liquid He-3 (temperature of 2.6 degrees K and
           average thickness of 0.132 (0.012) g/cm**2) and
           He-4 (temperature of 4.2 degrees k and average
           thickness of 0.131 (0.12) g/cm**2) targets.

ANALYSIS   For each run characterized by a given set of
            kinematical conditions two-dimensional histograms
            for the energy losses in the spectrometer detectors
            were established and protons (and electrons and
            pions also) was clear-cut identified.
CORRECTION The corrections were made for:
           - proton absorption in the copper absorber situated
             in front of the telescope (this correction never
             exceeded 15%);
           - counting losses due to the high counting rate in
             the telescope scintillators (this correction was
             estimated to be 2 - 8%);
           - events originating in the target walls (this
             correction was estimated to be about 1.5%).
COMMENT    Differential cross sections for the reactions
            He-3(g,p)d and He-4(g,p)t were measured at proton
            c.m. angles of 60 and 90 degrees for photon
            energies ranging from 150 to 450 mev with an
            average resolution of 8 MeV. Deuterons and tritons
            were analyzed in a magnetic spectrometer whereas
            coincident protons were detected in a plastic
            scintillator telescope. The He-3 and He-4 two-body
            photodisintegration differential cross sections show
            a monotonically decreasing variation with photon
            energy. In addition, partial data on the differential
            cross section of the reaction He-4(g,n)He-3 at 90
            and 120 degrees of neutron c.m. angle are given.     M
