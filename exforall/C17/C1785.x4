           (J,NP/A,834,192c,2010) Preliminary data
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed at the 10 MeV FN
           Tandem Van de Graaff at the University of Notre Dame
METHOD     (ACTIV,BGCT) 24Na activity determined using beta-gamma
           coincidence technique
SAMPLE     Natural carbon target with thickness of 1 mm.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) two 1-mm-thick plastic scintillation counters
           were used to detect the beta rays from 24Na
           (HPGE) Cascading gamma rays (1369- and 2754-keV) were
           detected by two Ge clover detectors.
           To stop the beta particles from reaching the germanium
           detectors, the carbon target and the two plastic
           detectors were surrounded by a box made with 2-mm-thick
           copper sheets. The detection system was shielded with
           7-cm-thick lead to reduce the cosmic ray background.

ANALYSIS   Compound formation cross section was derived from the
           measured 12C(13C,p)24Na thick target yield considering
           a theoretical branching ratio to the proton emission
           channel
