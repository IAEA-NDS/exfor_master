TITLE      Activation Analysis for Oxygen and Other Elements by
           Helium-3-induced Nuclear Reactions
AUTHOR     (S.S.Markowitz,J.D.Mahony)

INSTITUTE  (1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) The heavy-ion linear accelerator,
           HILAC.
SAMPLE     0.00025-inch (0.93 mg. per sq.cm.) stacked foils of
           Mylar. Mylar, a polyester, contains 33.2% oxygen,
           62.7% carbon, and 4.1% hydrogen.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,NAICR) The positron emission rate of the Mylar
           foils was measured with end-window gas-flow
           proportional methane-filled counters. The counters
           were calibrated with a 3x3 inch NaI(Tl) scintillation
           counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimates of errors indicate that
           accuracies of +-10% should be possible, the per cent
           errors being standard deviations.
CORRECTION The correction to the counting rate for
           self-absorption of positrons in the Mylar was
           determined by an empirical curve. This correction was
           1.7%.
