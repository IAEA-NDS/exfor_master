SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 195 mg/cm2 placed at
           the target location of the A1900 fragment separator
METHOD     (ASEP,TOF,EDE)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Fragment separator A1900 was used as an
           energy-loss achromat. Reaction products were momentum
           analysed and identified in focal plane by time of
           flight and energy loss measurement.
           (SI,SISD) The filtered secondary beam was
           implanted in beta counting system consisting of three
           detectors in front of a 1mm thick silicon strip
           detector, in which the ions were implanted and 1 cm
           thick planar HPGE detector.
           (HPGE)The beta counting system was surrounded by
           segmented array of 16 HPGE detectors.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty derived from fits of mass
           spectra, including systematic uncertainty coming from
           determination of the spectrometer transmission and
           from monitoring of beam intensity.
