           (J,PR/C,74,064612,2006) Experimental setup described
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Measurement was carried out at Holifield
           Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge
           National Laboratory
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-96,ENR=0.8525)
           Chemical form metal
           Thickness     380 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detectors placed in the
           beam upstream of the target were used for time of
           flight measurement. Silicon strip and annular
           detectors, described later were used alternatively.
           (SISD)  Four double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSD
           of thickness 300-500 mu-m were used for the detection o
           fission fragments. These detectors placed at distance o
           12.64 cm from the target had an area of 5 x 5 cm2 and
           provided energy, position, and time information for the
           detected fragments.
           (SI) In the second method, an annular silicon detector
           was used for the detection of fission fragments. In
           this case, the detector was placed at a distance of
           2.9 or 4.2 cm away from the target The annular
           segmented strip detector had a thickness of 300 mu-m,
           an inner radius of 11.5 mm, an outer radius of 35 mm,
           and strip widths of 0.391 and 0.1 mm, respectively,
INC-SOURCE Proton beams (500 MeV) with an intensity of 70 mu-A
           struck Ta metal production targets. Beams of
           radioactive 9Li were extracted with energies up to
           18.4 keV, mass-separated by passage through two
           dipole magnets, and accelerated to their final
           energy by radiofrequency quadrupole and drift-tube
           linear accelerators.
