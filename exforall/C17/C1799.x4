DETECTOR   (IOCH) Twin ionization chamber was used to detect
           decay products of beta delayed alpha decay of 16N
           i.e. alpha particles and 12C ions in coincidence.
           Incident beam of 16N was energy degraded and stopped
           in thin  carbon foil, mounted on a rotating wheel.
           The wheel served as a cathode of the twin ionization
           chamber. After 15 sec irradiation time, the carbon
           foil was moved on rotating wheel into the twin
           ionization chamber for coincident measurement of
           alpha particles and 12C ions.
METHOD     Indirect measurement of reaction rate, based on
           measurement of beta-delayed  alpha decay of 16N,
           angular distribution of E1 and E2 alpha capture and
           of  elastic alpha scattering on 12C. In this
           experiment, beta-delayed alpha  decay of 16N was
           measured.
INC-SOURCE Beam of 16N ions was produced by bombarding a deuterium
           gas cell cooled to -180 deg C with beam of 15N with
           energy of 82 MeV.
ANALYSIS   R-matrix theory was used to obtain reaction rates at
           300 keV
