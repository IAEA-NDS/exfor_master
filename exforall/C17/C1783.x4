TITLE      Gamma-strength functions in 60Ni from two-step
           cascades following proton capture

REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,81,024319,2010)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) Experiment performed at the tandem
           accelerator of Edwards Accelerator Laboratory,
           Ohio University
SAMPLE     Natural cobalt foil with thickness of 1 mu-m
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma transitions measured with two high-
           purity germanium detectors (40% and 60% efficiency)
           placed at an angle of 125 deg in a distance of 8 cm
           from the target.
ANALYSIS   Two step cascade spectrum determined from coincidence
           gamma ray spectra. Net spectrum was obtained by
           subtraction of total and background spectra measured
           in detector D2.  Total gamma ray spectrum was
           measured in D2 and gated with 1332 keV peak in D1.
           Background spectrum was measured in D2 and was gated
           on events below and above the 1332 keV peak.
