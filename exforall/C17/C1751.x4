DETECTOR   (SI) Two solid state detectors of 30 mm diameter,
           cooled to -20deg C were mounted symmetrically left
           and right of the beam direction at angles
           corresponding to full momentum transfer to the
           compound nucleus. The solid angles were defined by
           collimators of 25 mm diameter. Right detector was 57
           mm away from the target the left one was at a
           distance of 150 mm.
           (IOCH) For Au measurement, the left Si detector was
           replaced by an ionization chamber with Frisch grid.
           The anode was subdivided to allow for E-dE
           measurements.
