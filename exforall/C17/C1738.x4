FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
           88-Inch Cyclotron with the Gas-filled Separator (BGS).
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.984)
           (82-PB-207,ENR=0.011)
           (82-PB-206,ENR=0.005) Two separate experiments, one
           with thick (470 microg/cm2) and one with thin (104
           microg/cm2) 208Pb targets have been conducted.
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SISD,MWPC) The detection setup for the experiment
           with the thin targets was slightly different from the
           detection setup employed for the experiment with the
           thick targets. In the experiment with the thin 208Pb
           targets, a focal plane detector was used to detect
           the recoils. The focal plane detector consisted of
           three 300-microm thick silicon cards (each 6x6 cm2),
           each consisting of 16 vertical strips, giving a total
           of 48 silicon strips which provide horizontal
           resolution. The experiment involving the thick
           targets had a similar experimental setup except that
           a double sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) was used
           instead of the focal plane detector, and there were
           no upstream or punch-through detectors. The DSSD is 1
           mm thick and has 16 horizontal and 16 vertical strips
            (5x5 cm2), allowing for a very good position (the
           pixel size is 3x3 mm2) and energy resolution (35
           keV). A multiwire proportional counter (MWPC) was
           placed upstream from the focal plane detector.
METHOD     (ASPEC,COINC,TOF) Cross sections were deduced from
           the count of alpha-decay chains. The presence or
           absence of signals from the MWPC in coincidence with
           signals from the focal plane detector allowed for
           discrimination between implantation events and
           radioactive decays in the focal plane detector.
           Product identification was based on a complex
           trigger. For example, 256Rf atoms were identified by
           observation of an evaporation residue [8.0 < E (MeV)
           < 20.0, TOF signal between the DSSD and the MWPC]
           followed by a spontaneous fission [E (MeV)> 90MeV, no
           TOF signal between the DSSD and the MWPC] within 150
           ms in the same DSSD pixel. To obtain a statistically
           significant result within a relatively short
           irradiation time, thick lead targets were used to
           measure the high energy side of the excitation
           function.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties. The
           systematic error in the absolute beam energies from
           the cyclotron is 1%.
COMMENT    Cross section upper limits are given at 84% confidence
           level.
