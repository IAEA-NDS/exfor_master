SAMPLE     A thick target of RbCl with sufficient aluminum.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) For irradiations short with respect to
           the half-lives the relative yields of radioactive
           products are inversely proportional to their
           half-lives. Thus, after a 1-hr irradiation, the ratio
           of the Y88/Y87 activities is about 0.03 of the ratio
           of the saturation activities. The Y88 activity formed
           is consequently very small and may be ignored, Y90 is
           also formed in relatively small quantities. The
           Y86/Y87 factor, however, is about 5.0, and the
           presence of Y s6 is a problem. The formation of the
           bulk of the Y86 may be eliminated by using
           alpha-particles of an initial energy of about 35 MeV.
           Degradation of the alpha-particle energy by the
           proper amount is achieved by covering the rubidium
           chloride target with sufficient aluminum. The yttrium,
           after purification, is loaded onto a Dowex-1 column
           in the carbonate form. Y85,87 decay to strontium
           isotopes. The Sr87m is milked with a citric acid
           solution(0.005% at pH 5.0).
