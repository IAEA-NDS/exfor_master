FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP) Experiment performed at Radioactive
           Ion Beams in Brazil (RIBRAS) at the University of Sao
           Paulo
SAMPLE     Polyethylene plastic (CH2) with thickness of 1.6
           mg/cm2, mounted together with a thin gold target
           with thickness of 350 mu- g/cm2. Simultaneous
           elastic-scattering measurement of 8Li on carbon and
           gold targets was used to obtain the overall
           normalization
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Three telescopes covering the range of
           laboratory angles from 20deg to 60deg. The
           telescopes consisted of 20 mu-m Si dE detectors with
           an area of 300 mm2 backed by 1000 mu-m thick Si E
           detectors. The telescopes had rectangular apertures
           that subtended a solid angle of about 12 msr. 12 msr.
METHOD     (EDE)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(3-LI-8,EL)79-AU-197,,DA)
INC-SOURCE 8Li radioactive beam was produced in a primary 9Be
           target by the neutron transfer reaction 9Be(7Li,8Li).
           The 9Be production target had a thickness of 16 mu-m
           and was mounted in an ISO chamber just before the first
           solenoid.The secondary 8Li beam produced in the forward
           direction is collected and focused within an angular
           range of 2.0deg < theta < 6.0deg by the first solenoid
           of the double-superconducting solenoids of the RIBRAS
           facility.The energy of the secondary 8Li beam was
           23.9 MeV at the center of the carbon target with an
           average intensity of about 5.0E+4 pps.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in target thickness
           (ERR-2) Systematic uncertainty in the secondary
           beam intensity
