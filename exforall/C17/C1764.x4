HISTORY    (20091215C) Compiled by S.H.
SAMPLE     231Pa by electrodeposited on silver disks.
           Mass of the samples was 14.2 to 16.1 mu-g and
           diameter 9 mm.Subsequently the silver disks
           were covered with aluminium foils (34.9 mu-m
           thickness,99.99%, Alfa Aesar) acting as catcher
           foils to avoid any losses of activity by recoil
           processes
DETECTOR   (SI) Activity of 230Pa and 230U in individual
           thin foils was performed by alpha spectrometry
           using Soloist alpha spectrometer from ORTEC
           (HPGE) Activity of 24Na in monitor foils was
           measured by HPGe detector with resolution of
           2.04 keV at 1332.5 keV.
