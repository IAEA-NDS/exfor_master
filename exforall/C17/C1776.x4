FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the Lawrence
           Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron using
           newly implemented 242Pu target facility at the
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS).
SAMPLE     A 9.5-cm diameter rotating target wheel containing
           four target segments with 440, 340, 320, and 270
           mu-g/cm2 of 242Pu in form PuO2 as PuO2 on 2.4 mu-m
           thick Ti backing. Pu target was enriched in 242Pu
           more than 99.9%.The targets were prepared by
           molecular plating. 48Ca beam entered BGS through a
           45 mu-g/cm2 thick carbon window.
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SISD) Focal plane detector consisted of
           multiwire proportional counter, used to determine
           time of flight and location of impact of evaporation
           residues. Second focal plane detector consists of
           48 Si-strips (three 6x6cm2 cards, sixteen strips each),
           which provide horizontal resolution and was used for
           implantation of evaporation residues. Vertical position
           was determined by resistive charge division within
           each strip.
METHOD     (OLMS,TOF)
INC-SOURCE 48Ca11+ beam produced by Advanced Electron Cyclotron
           Resonance source was accelerated to 263 MeV by the
           LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron with typical intensities of
           300 - 400 pnA.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty are given with 68%
           statistical confidence interval using Schmidt's
           prescription
