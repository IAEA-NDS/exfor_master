FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment preformed at the ISAC I
           facility using TUDA detector array. Radioactive 18F
           beam was accelerated using RFQ/Linac of the ISAC 1
           facility.
SAMPLE     Polyethylene (CH2)n target with thickness of (31.6 +-
           1.9)mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (SISD) Reaction products were detected by two
           silicon strip detectors (LEDA) and two double sided
           silicon strip detectors (S2)
           (SI) Measurement of scattered beam particles was
           achieved using a DE-E monolithic detector and a
           2mu-m aluminium shielded silicon photodiode. From
           this measurement beam intensity and beam
           purity  (i.e. 18-F/18-O ratio) was determined.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) Reaction products identified combination of
           time of flight and E-dE methods.
           (COINC) The products of the 18F(p,a)15-O reaction
           were detected in coincidence
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Production of the 18F radioactive beam was
           achieved using the ISOL method. An accelerated 500
           MeV beam of protons from the main cyclotron were
           directed onto a high power silicon carbide target to
           produce the 18F, which was then extracted and ionised
           using a FEBIAD ion source. The extracted beam was
           further accelerated to a pre-separator and then the
           mass separator where the 18F and isobaric elements were
           selected. From here the beam was post accelerated to
           the TUDA.
