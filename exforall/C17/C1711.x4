FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV) Experiment was performed at the
           Accelerator Laboratory of the University of
           Jyvaskyla, employing the K130 cyclotron
SAMPLE     Self-supporting metallic foil enriched in 96Ru to
           96.5% with thickness of a 500 mu-g/cm2 .
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Prompt gamma rays were detected at the target
           position by the JUROGAM array consisting of 43
           EUROGAM phase I and GASP type Compton-suppressed
           germanium detectors.
           (MAGSP)Gas-filled recoil magnetic separator was used
           with subsequent implantation of selected ions in a
           double-sided silicon strip detectors
           (SISD)Double-sided silicon strip detector (DSS)has an
           effective area of 60x40 mm2, with 200 individual
           strips at a pitch of 1 mm in both directions,
           leading to 4800 independent pixels in total.
METHOD     Recoil-decay tagging method was used to get
           clean prompt gamma ray spectra. Aplha decay of
           implanted nuclei was used to identify the nucleus
           172Hg.
