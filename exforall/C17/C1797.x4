           at Stony Brook.
           (CYCLO,1USABNL) 60-in. cyclotron at the Brookhaven
           National Laboratory (BNL).
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of natural uranium oxide
           evaporated onto a backing of nickel (1.1 mg/cm2) or
           aluminum (4.4 mg/cm2). The targets were all thicker
           than 200 microg/cm2 of U3O8 i.e., the thickness was
           greater than the recoil ranges of the products in the
           target material.
PART-DET   (FF)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol foils weighing ~0.75 mg/cm2 were used
           as detectors.
METHOD     (EXTB,REC) Spontaneously fissioning nuclei that
           recoil away from the target undergo fission either in
           flight or after being stopped by the catcher placed
           downstream. Fission fragments recoiling backward are
           detected by dielectric track detectors placed on the
           target cover plate. In the irradiations at Stony
           Brook, the beam was collimated (2.2-mm diam) and was
           allowed to hit the target placed in a 3.2-mm
           aperture. In the BNL experiments the collimator and
           target apertures were 4.8 and 6.4 mm, respectively.
           Energies up to 28 MeV for the 4He ions were obtained
           at Stony Brook, and higher energies at BNL. Cross
           sections for the formation of isomers were calculated
           at each bombarding energy. The effective target
           thickness was assumed to be equal to the recoil range
           of the reaction products in the target material (U3O8).
            Radial fragment distributions were used to deduced
           half lives of fission isomers.
