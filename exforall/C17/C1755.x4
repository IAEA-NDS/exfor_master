FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAYAL)Experiment performed at the Wright
           Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University
           using the extended stretched transuranium tandem Van
           de Graaff accelerator.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting Si target with thickness of
           311 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)The reaction products were momentum analyzed
           using an Enge split-pole spectrograph.
           (TELES,DRFTC,SCIN)Reaction products were detected at
           the focal plane of the magnetic spectrograph by a
           position-sensitive ionization drift chamber (PIDC)
           filled with 150 torr of isobutane gas, backed by a
           plastic scintillator.The PIDC was used to measure
           position along the focal plane via front and rear
           wires with delay chip readouts, and energy loss in
           the drift region dE, via a cathode. Scintillator was
           used to determine the residual energy of the particles.
           (MAGSP)The reaction products were momentum analyzed
           using an Enge split-pole spectrograph.
           (SISD)Protons emitted from excited states in 27Si
           were detected by the Yale lamp-shade array, an array
           of five 16-strip silicon detectors arranged in a
           lamp-shade configuration.
                Definition of angles
           ANG1 - Laboratory angle of split pole Enge
           spectrograph, used to detect alpha particles.
           The spectrograph was placed at a 3deg angle with
           respect to the beam axis to avoid prohibitively large
           event rates due to the forward scattered beam at
           0 deg to 2 deg.
           ANG2-CM - CM angle of proton, detected in Yale
           lamp-shade array
METHOD     (EDE,COINC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty. Main source of
           uncertainty was background determination in the total
           focal-plane spectrum, which was much larger than any
           systematic or statistical errors in the measurement.
