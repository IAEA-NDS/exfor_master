FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)The experiment was performed at
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 1 mm (185 mg/cm2)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Knockout residues were momentum analyzed by
           the S800 spectrograph.
           (IOCH)Knockout residues were identified in S800 by
           energy loss in the chamber and time-of-flight through
           the spectometer
           (DRFTC)Two cathode readout drift chambers measured
           the position and scattering angle in both the
           dispersive and nondispersive directions, and these
           measurements were connected to the kinematics at the
           target using ray-tracing through the magnetic field
           of the S800. This allowed for the determination of
           the momentum along the beam axis and the reaction
           angle at the target.
           (HPGE) The Segmented Germanium Array, an array of 32-
           fold segmented high purity germanium detectors,
           detected gamma rays emitted from the recoiling
           nucleus after the knockout reaction.
METHOD     (COINC)Particle-gamma coincidences provided data
           about the cross sections to the excited states in
           the final nucleus.
CORRECTION Gamma-ray spectra were Doppler corrected using the
           segmentation of the detector by identifying the
           segment in which the most energy was deposited as
           the first interaction point.
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 32Al was produced by
           fragmentation of a 140 MeV/nucleon primary beam of
           48Ca on a 806 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target. The resulting
           fragments were separated using the A1900 mass
           separator with a momentum acceptance of 0.5%. The
           secondary beam particles were identified by their
           time of flight from the extended focal plane of
           the A1900 to the object box of the S800 spectrograph.
           The cocktail beam was 71% pure 32Al with the
           remainder being 33Si. The fully-stripped secondary
           beam emerged from the magnetic separator with an
           energy of 91 MeV/nucleon
