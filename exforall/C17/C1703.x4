           88-Inch Cyclotron with the Gas-filled Separator (BGS).
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SISD,MWPC) Si strip detectors and  multiwire
           proportional counter (MWPC).
METHOD     (ASPEC,REC) Cross sections were deduced from the
           count of alpha-decay chains. Dubnium compound
           nucleus evaporation residues are formed with the
           momentum of the projectile and recoil from the
           target. After separation in the BGS, the dubnium
           recoils passed through a multiwire proportional
           counter (MWPC) and were implanted into a focal plane
           detector (FPD). The FPD was composed of an
           implantation detector and an upstream detector. The
           implantation detector consisted of three silicon
           cards, each containing 16 vertical strips that
           allowed for determination of the horizontal position.
           Energy was calibrated using a four-point alpha source
           containing 148Gd, 239Pu, 241Am, and 244Cm. Events
           identified as alpha particles were required to be
           anticoincident with the MWPC and punch-through
           detectors, in the same strip as and within a vertical
           position of +-3 sigma of the evaporation residue.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Error bars represent the uncertainties due to
           counting statistics and are presented at the 1 sigma
           level.
           (EN-ERR) Systematic uncertainty in the absolute energy
           from the 88-Inch Cyclotron is estimated to be ~1%.
