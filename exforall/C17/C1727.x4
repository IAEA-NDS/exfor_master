FACILITY   (CYCTM)Experiments were performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at NSCL, Michigan State University.
SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 376 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)The particle identification was performed
           event by event with the focal-plane detection system
           of the large-acceptance spectrograph S800.
           (IOCH)The energy loss was measured with the
           ionization chamber
           (SCIN)Time-of-flight information taken using plastic
           scintillators was corrected for the angle and
           momentum of each ion
           (HPGE)High-resolution gamma-ray detection system
           SeGA, an array of 32-fold segmented high-purity Ge
           detectors was used solely for study of excited states
           of reaction products.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) Cross section were determined from data
           measured by the large-acceptance spectrograph S800.
INC-SOURCE The secondary beams of 48K (pure) and 46Cl (purity
           exceeding 98%) were produced from a 140 MeV/u stable
           48Ca beam impinging on a 705 mg/cm2 9Be production
           target and separated using a 390 mg/cm2 Al degrader
           in the A1900 fragment separator
