FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) The experiment was carried out at Van
           de Graaff accelerator of the Laboratory for
           Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics, which is part of
           the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory.
SAMPLE     Target of 17-O was prepared by anodizing 0.5mm thick
           tantalum backings in 17-O enriched water.
           The enrichment amounted to 91.2%. Target thickness
           was 4.4 +- 0.2 keV
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Prompt gamma rays were detected using a large-
           volume (582 cm3) high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           detector placed at an angle of 55deg with respect to
           the proton beam direction and at a distance of 36 mm
           between the detector front face and target midpoint.
