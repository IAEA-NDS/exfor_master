FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
           System (ATLAS).
INC-SPECT  The 87Rb stable beam delivered by the ATLAS had a
           charge state of 17+, an energy of 4.61(1) MeV/u, and
           an average intensity of 3.7 x 104 pps.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SIBAR) The active target MUlti-Sampling
           Ionization Chamber (MUSIC).
SAMPLE     The MUSIC detector was filled with pure 4He gas at
           555 Torr held by Ti foils of 1.30(5) mg cm-2
           thickness at the entrance and exit sides for the beam.
METHOD     (EDE) With electrically segmented (stripped)
           detectors in a single direction, the search for
            (alpha,xn) events may follow in steps: 1) The PID
           method - a global analysis that looks at energy
           losses summed over several strips dE - Etotal, similar
           to the Particle IDentification (PID) with silicon
           detectors and their variants. The PID method was
           first employed to identify (alpha,xn) and scattering
           events, which occurred in each strip of the MUSIC
           detector. 2) The Traces method - a local analysis
           that tracks energy loss per strip. Then, the Traces
           method was used to count (alpha,xn) events.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Horizontal (energy) uncertainties of the
           measured cross sections correspond to the spatial
           extension of the strip, and vertical uncertainties
           include both statistical and systematic contributions.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties comprise the
           impact of independently varying the conditions
           applied in the analysis to select the 87Rb beam and
           identify (alpha,xn) events as well as the uncertainty
           in the gas pressure (1 Torr).
CORRECTION To determine the center-of-mass energies deduced from
           the measurement of the beam energy losses in the
           MUSIC detector were corrected for the thick-target
           yield.
