INSTITUTE  (1USANOT)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) 10 MV FN Tandem accelerator, the
           Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of
           Notre Dame.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Large volume, closed-end coaxial HPGe Canberra
           detector (Model: GC3518).
SAMPLE     natCaF2 powder sealed in the back with a small piece
           of Cu wire. The dimensions of the target were then
           just the internal dimensions of the packed cathode, 1
           mm in diameter and 3.5 mm in length. Using the mass
           of the packed CaF2 powder and these internal
           dimensions of the cathode, the density for each
           packed cathode was calculated, with an overall
           average density of around 3.0+-0.2 g/cm3.
ANALYSIS   The total yield can then be found by using the
           calculated initial activity and the total charge
           collected on the cathode material Q, using
           Y=lambda*Ao/((Q/t1)*(1-exp(-lambda*t1))), where t1 is
           irradiation time, A0 is initial activity, lambda is
           isotope's decay const.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error bars on the measured data points were
           the result of the propagation of uncertainties due to
           Poisson statistics in the number of counts in the
           peak, uncertainties in the efficiency of the detector,
           the given uncertainties of lambda and Igamma from
           NNDC, a 5% uncertainty on the collected charge from
           the beam current, and uncertainties in the recording
           times.
           (ERR-1) The collected charge from the beam current.
