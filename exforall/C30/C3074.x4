INSTITUTE  (1USAUCX,1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88-Inch Cyclotron located at
           Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in
           Berkeley, California.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A single ORTEC GMX Series (model GMX-50220-S)
           High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector was used in
           this experiment. The detector is a nitrogen-cooled
           coaxial n-type HPGe with a 0.5 mm beryllium window, and
            a 64.9 mm diameter, 57.8 mm long crystal.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The foils were irradiated with 8 nA of
           proton beam current for 1 h, 37 min and 24 s. After
           irradiation, the foils were removed from the beamline
           and transferred to the HPGe counting lab
           approximately 15 min after EoB. The foils were
           counted for four weeks following EoB. Each foil was
           counted multiple times, in order to reduce
           uncertainty and aid in isotope identification. The
           stacked-target activation technique, in which one can
           measure a reaction cross section by quantifying the
           activity induced within a thin foil of known areal
           density, using a beam of known intensity.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) First, every line emitted from each isotope
           of interest was fit in each spectrum collected. The
           number of counts in each peak was used to determine
           the activity of the isotope at the time the spectrum
           was taken. These activities as a function of
           "cooling" time (time since EoB) were used to
           calculate the EoB activity, A0, for that isotope.
           Each A0 was then used to determine a cross section
            (for the lanthanum foil data) or a beam current
            (for the copper/aluminum foil data). The NPAT code,
           developed at UC Berkeley, was used for spectrum
           analysis, fitting decay curves, and calculating the
           proton energy spectrum in each foil.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the reported cross
           sections had five main contributions: uncertainties
           in evaluated half-lives and gamma intensities (~1%) ,
           EoB activity determination (~1%), detector efficiency
           calibration (~3%), foil areal density (~1%) and
           proton current determination (~5%). Each
           contribution to the uncertainty was assumed to be
           independent and was added in quadrature.
           (ERR-S) EoB activity determination.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties in evaluated half-lives and
           gamma intensities.
           (ERR-2) Detector efficiency calibration.
           (ERR-3) Areal density.
           (ERR-4) Proton current determination.
CORRECTION The photopeak efficiencies were also corrected for
           detector dead-time, as well as self-attenuation
           within the foils - using photon attenuation cross
           sections retrieved from the XCOM database.

SAMPLE     The lanthanum foils used in this experiment were of
           99% purity and were purchased from Goodfellow
           Corporation (Coraopolis, PA 15108, USA). The foils
           were cold rolled to 25 microm thickness, cut to
           1" by 1" squares, and sealed in glass ampules with an
           inert cover gas (to prevent oxidation). The
           dimensions and masses of these foils were measured,
           and they were sealed in 3M 5413-Series Kapton
           polyimide film tape - each piece of tape consists of
           43.2 microm of a silicone adhesive (nominal 4.79
           mg/cm2) on 25.4 microm of a polyimide backing
            (nominal 3.61 mg/cm2). Ten sets, each consisting of
           a single aluminum, copper and lanthanum foil packet,
           were prepared in this manner for cross section
           measurements at ten different energies.

SAMPLE     The lanthanum foils used in this experiment were of
           99% purity and were purchased from Goodfellow
           Corporation (Coraopolis, PA 15108, USA). The foils
           were cold rolled to 25 microm thickness, cut to
           1" by 1" squares, and sealed in glass ampules with an
           inert cover gas (to prevent oxidation). The
           dimensions and masses of these foils were measured,
           and they were sealed in 3M 5413-Series Kapton
           polyimide film tape - each piece of tape consists of
           43.2 microm of a silicone adhesive (nominal 4.79
           mg/cm2) on 25.4 microm of a polyimide backing
            (nominal 3.61 mg/cm2). Ten sets, each consisting of
           a single aluminum, copper and lanthanum foil packet,
           were prepared in this manner for cross section
           measurements at ten different energies.

SAMPLE     The copper and aluminum monitor foils were cut from
           25 microm- thick sheets into 1" by 1" squares, and
           were also measured and sealed in Kapton tape. These
           foil packets were then secured over the hollow
           aperture of 2.25" by 2.25" aluminum sample holders),
           which protected the foils during handling and
           centered them in the beam pipe. Ten sets, each
           consisting of a single aluminum, copper and lanthanum
           foil packet, were prepared in this manner for cross
           section measurements at ten different energies.
