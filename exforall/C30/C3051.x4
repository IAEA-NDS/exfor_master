           Bangladesh
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88-Inch cyclotron at LBNL of USA.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivities of the product
           radionuclides were measured non-destructively using a
           high-purity germanium gamma-ray detector.
SAMPLE     Fe foils of 25 microm thickness (supplied by
           Goodfellow; chemical purity: 99.0 %) were used as
           target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The activity measurement for each sample was
           repeated by giving sufficient decay interval to check
           the half-lives of the activation products as well as
           to avoid interferences by overlapping gamma-lines
           from undesired products. At 5 cm counting distance,
           the effect of the sample size on the efficiency and
           also the random coincidence loss became almost
           negligible.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The peak area (counts) under a characteristic
           gamma-ray of a reaction product was converted to
           count rate and then converted to the decay rate by
           applying corrections for gamma-ray intensity and
           efficiency of the detector. The decay rate was
           extrapolated to the end of bombardment (EOB). From
           the decay rate at EOB and the measured deuteron beam
           flux, the cross section for the formation of the
           radioactive product was calculated using the
           well-known activation equations.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The combined uncertainty in the cross section
           was estimated from the uncertainties associated with
           measurements: peak area (0.5-7 %), efficiency of the
           detector (4 %), gamma-ray intensities (0.006-1.4 %),
           half-life (0.0001-0.05 %) and deuteron flux (6 %).
           The overall uncertainty of measured cross sections
           amounted to 8-12 % (1 sigma).
           (ERR-S,0.5,7.) Peak area.
           (ERR-1) Detector efficiency.
           (ERR-2,0.006,1.4) Gamma-ray intensities.
           (ERR-3,0.0001,0.05) Half-life.
           (ERR-4) Deuteron flux.
CORRECTION The correction for the true coincident gamma-ray
           summing was also negligible.
