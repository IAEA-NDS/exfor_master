DETECTOR   (SI,SISD) Three side-by-side double-sided silicon-
           strip detectors (DSSDs). To allow for cross-section
           calculations, two silicon pindiode detectors were
           positioned at angles of +-27.2(1) degree directly
           from the beam direction. These detectors monitor the
           integral of beam intensity times target thickness
           through the detection of Rutherford-scattered beam
           particles.
SAMPLE     The target composed of four arc-shaped segments
           forming a rotating target wheel with a diameter of
           12.2 cm. A fast-acting beam chopper can interrupt the
           beam in case of system failures, protecting the
           target. Each target segment consisted of a 2.1(1)
           mu-m thick natTi backing foil onto which 244Pu
           had been electrodeposited. The electrodeposition was
           performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
           The beam first passed through the Ti foil before
           entering the 244Pu layer. Prior to irradiation, the
           target foils were measured to have an average target
           thicknesses of 0.435(40) mg/cm2 244Pu (as 244PuO2)
           through gamma-ray analysis of the decay of the
           short-lived 240mNp, which is part of the decay path
           originating from 244Pu.
METHOD     The targets were irradiated for a total of 22.1 days
           with an average center-of-target center-of-mass frame
           energy of 220(3) MeV, which corresponds to an average
           compound-nucleus excitation energy of 41(2) MeV
           according to the Thomas-Fermi mass tables. During
           these measurements, the recoiling evaporation
           residues (EVRs) were separated from the beam and
           unwanted nuclear reaction products in the BGS based
           on their differing magnetic rigidities (Bro) in 0.45-
           Torr He. At the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS)
           focal plane, the EVRs were implanted into the
           SuperHeavy RECoil (SHREC) detector. This detector is
           comprised of three side-by-side double-sided silicon-
           strip detectors (DSSDs).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error represents statistical (counting)
           errors only.
           (ERR-SYS) There is also systematic error on the cross
           section, which results in an additional 12%
           systematic uncertainty in the measured cross sections.
