INC-SPECT  The resulting secondary beam, which exhibited an
           approximately 85% purity in 38Ca and a typical rate
           of 1.6*10**5 38Ca ions per second. The mid target
           energy of the 38Ca projectiles was 60.9 MeV/u,
           corresponding to a velocity of v/c ~ 0.345.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,SPEC,SCIN) The high-resolution gamma-ray
           tracking array GRETINA, consisting of 12 detector
           modules; each of which contains four 36-fold
           segmented high-purity germanium crystals. The
           particle identification in the entrance and exit
           channel was performed on an event-by-event basis
           using plastic timing scintillators and the S800
           focal-plane detection system.
SAMPLE     Secondary 188 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target located at the
           target position of the S800 magnetic spectrograph.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainties.

REACTION   (4-BE-9(20-CA-38,X)20-CA-36,PAR,SIG)
METHOD     (COINC) Employing particle-gamma coincidences, the
           exclusive cross sections to the 0+ and 2+1 states are
           obtained. Lacking a gamma-ray detectable in GRETINA,
           exclusive cross sections to the 0+1 and 0+2 states
           are indistinguishable. In the following, their summed
           cross section is denoted sigma(0+) = sigma(0+1) +
           sigma(0+2).
ANALYSIS   Exclusive 2+1 cross section was subtracted from the
           inclusive cross section to obtain 0+ value.

REACTION   (4-BE-9(20-CA-38,X)20-CA-36,,SIG)
METHOD     (TOF) The outgoing reaction residues were
           distinguished based on their energy loss determined
           in the S800 ionization chamber and the time of flight
           measured between the object position of the analysis
           beam line and the plastic scintillator at the back of
           the S800 focal plane.
ANALYSIS   The inclusive two-neutron removal cross section for
           the formation of 36Ca was determined from the
           efficiency corrected number of 36Ca residues detected
           in the S800 focal plane, the number of incident 38Ca
           projectiles, and the areal density of the target.
