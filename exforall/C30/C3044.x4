SAMPLE     (38-SR-86,ENR=0.964)
           (38-SR-87,ENR=0.0133)
           (38-SR-88,ENR=0.0226) A series of enriched 86Sr
           targets provided as 86SrCO3 powder (isotopic
           composition: 96.4% 86Sr; 1.33% 87Sr; and 2.26% 88Sr;
           supplied by Eurisotop, France). Thin strontium
           carbonate samples were prepared by the sedimentation
           technique at the Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ),
           Germany.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity of a reaction product in the
           activated monitor foil or Sr sample was measured
           nondestructively using high-purity germanium
           gamma-ray detectors associated with the necessary
           electronics and MAESTRO data acquisition software.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty in the cross section
           was obtained by summing in quadrature the individual
           uncertainties in: counting statistics (1-10%),
           efficiency of the detector (4%), gamma-ray intensities
            (1-7%), half-life (0.1-0.2%), deuteron flux (6%) ,
           and sample homogeneity (up to 5%). The overall
           uncertainties of the measured cross sections are
           between 10 and 15% (1sigma), including 5% systematic
           uncertainty in the estimation of the contribution of
           the subsidiary reactions deduced from the nuclear model
            calculations. The uncertainty in counting statistics
           for 84mRb ranged from 7 to 15%. Particularly for the
           two lowest deuteron energy points it was
           approximately 21%.

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV) The stacked-sample activation technique
           was applied to measure excitation functions of
           deuteron-induced reactions on a series of enriched
           86Sr targets. Two stacks of 86SrCO3 samples with the

           irradiated with deuterons of primary energies 33 and

           Laboratory. Thereafter, the radioactivity
           measurements of all the samples irradiated at LBNL
           were done there.

           Catholique in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, each for 30
           min at a beam current of approximately 200 nA. Those
           irradiated samples were transferred by special
           transport to the Nuclear Chemistry Laboratory of the
           FZJ, about 200 km away, where gamma-ray spectral
           measurements were carried out.
ANALYSIS   Cumulative cross section of this product describes

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV) The stacked-sample activation technique
           was applied to measure excitation functions of
           deuteron-induced reactions on a series of enriched
           86Sr targets. Two other stacks were irradiated with
           50-MeV primary energy deuterons using the external
           beam of the CGR930 Cyclotron of the Universite
           Catholique in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, each for 30
           min at a beam current of approximately 200 nA. Those
           irradiated samples were transferred by special
           transport to the Nuclear Chemistry Laboratory of the
           FZJ, about 200 km away, where gamma-ray spectral
           measurements were carried out.
