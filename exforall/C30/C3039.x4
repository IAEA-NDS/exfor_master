INSTITUTE  (1USAWIS,1USANOT)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) The University of Notre Dame's FN
           Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator (National
           Electrostatic Corporation) with a source of negative
           ions by cesium sputtering (SNICS) ion source.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium gamma-ray detector
            (Canberra, model GC3518) surrounded by lead shielding.
SAMPLE     Thin, vacuum-deposited natGe targets (0.41+-0.02 microm
            natGe on 25.4 microm Kapton) were purchased from Astra
           Technology Unlimited, Inc. Nickel (15.6+-0.4 microm
           natNi, 99.9%) and aluminum (52.7+-0.4 microm natAl,
           99.0%) foils were purchased from Goodfellow Cambridge
           Ltd.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA)
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were calculated from the activation
           equation for thin foils. After the AEOB was obtained
           from HPGe, the cross section is sigma=AEoB/(I*n*x*(1 -
           exp(-lambda*tirrad))), where I is the number of
           incident particles per unit time, n is the target
           nuclei per unit volume, x is the target thickness,
           lambda is the radionuclide decay constant, and tirrad
           is the irradiation time.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) All uncertainties in this work correspond to
           values within one standard deviations of the mean.
           The uncertainty in measured radionuclide activities
           was calculated by the standard deviation of the
           activities measured in each of several HPGe
           measurements. These standard deviations are larger
           than the uncertainties calculated by error
           propagation of individual activity uncertainties,
           resulting in overall EoB 71As activity uncertainties
           of 2-11%. The uncertainties of counting (0.3-11%) ,
           foil thickness (3.6%), abundance (2.7%) , detector
           efficiency (2.2-2.6%), and beam intensity (3-11%)
           were considered for the uncertainty of cross section
           measurements by error propagation.
           (ERR-S,0.3,11.) The uncertainties of counting.
           (ERR-1) Foil thickness.
           (ERR-2) Abundance.
           (ERR-3,2.2,2.6) Detector efficiency.
           (ERR-4,3.,11.) Beam intensity.
