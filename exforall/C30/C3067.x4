           (1USAUSA) Department of Physics, University of Illinois

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USACBF) The electron accelerator at Thomas
           Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The bremsstrahlung gamma-ray beam was produced
           by impinging an electron beam accelerated on a copper
           radiator (6.0 mm thick, enough to completely stop a
           10 MeV/c electron beam).
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) The C3F8 filled glass vessel.
METHOD     In a series of experiments the photodisintegration
           reaction 19F(gamma,alpha)15N was studied. If gamma
           rays from the bremsstrahlung beam interact with the
           fluorine via the 19F(gamma,alpha) 15N reaction, the
           15N and alpha particles in the outgoing channel are
           stopped in the C3F8 liquid, which leads to the
           formation of a bubble in the superheated C3F8. If a
           bubble is observed by the camera, ten consecutive
           frames taken at 10 ms intervals are stored in the
           computer providing information about the location and
           the motion of the bubble in the fluid.
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL) The method employs the advantages of detailed
           balance (time-reversal symmetry) using a thick
            (1-10 g/cm2) liquid target and a gamma-ray beam.
           Since 19F is a mono-isotopic element, no background
           reactions from the photodisintegration of other
           isotopes can occur. Due to the fact that in the
           15N(alpha,gamma) 19F reaction excited states in 19F
           are populated as well, no direct comparison between
           the measured radiative capture and photodissociation
           yields can be made. However, sufficient information
           about energies, widths, and branching ratios of the
           critical states in 19F is available to calculate the
           expected yields for the 19F(gamma,alpha) 15N
           reaction. Filling in equation for this reaction gives
           the time-reversal factor as
           sigma(gamma,alpha)/sigma(alpha,gamma) =
           mu*c**2*Ecm/Egamma*2, where mu is a reduced mass of
           the 15N and alpha particle, c speed pf light, Ecm
           center-of-mass energy of the 15N and alpha-particle
           system, and Egamma the energy of the resulting gamma
           ray.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Time-reversal factor from (alpha,gamma) to
            (gamma,alpha).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Symmetric 1 sigma uncertainties.
           (ERR-1,,3.) The chamber efficiency from the
           temperature and pressure is less than 3%.
