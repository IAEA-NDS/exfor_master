FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
           System (ATLAS).
INC-SPECT  The 88Sr stable beam delivered by ATLAS was selected
           for the charge state 16+, an energy of 4.56(3) MeV/u,
           and an average intensity of 3*10**4 pps. The beam
           rate was kept at this low rate to ensure the
           stability of the data acquisition system. Similarly,
           the 88Sr beam of the second measurement was 4.55(1)
           MeV/u at 3*10**4 pps. Horizontal error bars of
           measured cross sections (energy resolution) come from
           the width of MUSIC detector strips.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The electrically segmented MUlti Sampling
           Ionization Chamber (MUSIC). The anode of MUSIC is
           segmented into 18 strips of equal width (1.578 cm)
           along the beam axis; the 16 inner strips are
           alternatively divided into a short and long section
           perpendicular to the beam direction.
SAMPLE     The MUSIC detector was filled with pure 4He gas at
           501 Torr (506 Torr for the second measurement). Two
           Ti foils of 1.30(5) mg/cm2 thickness located at the
           entrance and exit sides of the detector were used to
           hold the gas. The beam energy loss after passing
           through the entrance foil was measured to be 45.1(4)
           MeV.
METHOD     Two measurements were performed at ATLAS with the
           MUSIC detector, in inverse kinematics, while
           following the active target technique.

ANALYSIS   Calculations of the thermonuclear reaction rate were
           performed with the EXP2RATE code by Rauscher. They
           included the cross sections from present measurements
           at high energies and extrapolated values at low
           energies. The rate was evaluated with the geometric
           mean. It was also determined from HF+ATOMKI-V2
           calculations performed with the TALYS code. The
           resulting rate was scaled by a factor of 0.32 as
           obtained for the cross sections. Within temperatures
           of 2-8 GK, these two evaluated rates agree within a
           factor of 0.9-1.5.
