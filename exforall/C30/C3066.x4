FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)
           at Michigan State University.
SAMPLE     An areal target density of 69(3) mg/cm2. The
           NSCL/Ursinus Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) Target thickness
           was determined via a comparison of the measured
           kinetic energy distribution of the reacted outgoing
           beam to a detailed GEANT4 simulation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Stated uncertainties include statistical
           uncertainties, the stability of the secondary beam
           composition, uncertainties coming from the choice of
           software gates and the target thickness.
CORRECTION The correction of the gamma-ray yields for observed
           feeders.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Eight GRETINA modules, containing four, 36-
           fold segmented HPGe detectors each, were mounted in
           the north half of the mounting shell to accommodate
           the LH2 target. In this configuration, two modules
           are centered at 58, four at 90, and two at 122
           degrees with respect to the beam axis.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   Partial cross sections were calculated from the
           experimental gamma-ray yields by normalizing these to
           the number of incoming beam particles and the number
           of target nuclei.
