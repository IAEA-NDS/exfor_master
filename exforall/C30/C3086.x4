FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) ATLAS facility at the Argonne
           National Laboratory.
INC-SPECT  A 7.1 MeV/u 15C secondary beam was produced at the
           ATLAS in-flight system RAISOR with an intensity of
           approximately 10**6 particles s-1 with negligible
           contamination (less than 1%).
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,IOCH) The particle identification (PID) was
           performed by analyzing the cyclotron period of
           emitted light charged particles in a uniform magnetic
           field, combined with four sets of dE-E telescopes to
           detect 14C residues. The intensity of the incoming
           beam was monitored using a downstream ionization
           chamber.
METHOD     (EDE) The kinematic reconstruction was achieved
           through high precision position-sensitive silicon
           detector arrays, which provided both position and
           energy information. This approach enabled the
           extraction of differential cross sections for
           transfer reactions populating the ground state (g.s.)
           of 14C, covering a range of center-of-mass angles
            (c.m.) from 15 to 35 degrees.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties of the differential
           cross section mainly come from the statistical error
           and the systematic uncertainties resulting from the
           acceptance correction and the timing gate efficiency
           correction.
CORRECTION The acceptance correction and the timing gate
           efficiency correction.
