INC-SPECT  A beam of protons with center-of-mass energies
           between 1.5 and 4.5 MeV was impinged upon a target of
           isotopically enriched 94Mo. The beam current ranged
           from 5-900 nA and was increased at lower beam
           energies to compensate for the decreasing reaction
           cross section. The uncertainty in the center-of-mass
           energy comes from a combination of the uncertainty in
           the beam energy resolution and the energy loss
           through the target. The beam resolution from the 5U
           has an uncertainty of 1-2 keV and the energy loss
           through the targets ranged between 20 and 60 keV.

REACTION   (42-MO-94(P,G)43-TC-95,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The targets were placed in the center of the
           high efficiency total absorption spectrometer
            (HECTOR). HECTOR is composed of 16 NaI(Tl) segments
           each read by two photomultiplier tubes. These
           segments are arranged to cover nearly the entirety of
           the 4pi solid angle.
SAMPLE     (42-MO-94,ENR=0.9899) The 94Mo target, 588(66)
           microg/cm2 thick with 98.99% enrichment, was made by
           evaporation onto a gold backing. The gold backing, 96
           mg/cm2, was used to stop the beam at the target
           location to reduce the background contaminants from
           beam straggling, in particular fluorine that may be
           present in the beam-pipe components. The thickness of
           the target was verified using x-ray fluorescence.
METHOD     The cross section was measured using the
           gamma-summing technique. When the 95Tc that was
           produced in the reaction deexcites to the ground
           state, a cascade of gamma rays is emitted. In the
           gamma-summing technique all of the gamma rays emitted
           in the cascade are summed up to give the total amount
           of energy detected during that event.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainties.
           (ERR-S,,10.) Statistical uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) The number of beam particles.
           (ERR-2) Dead time.
           (ERR-3,5.,20.) The relative uncertainty of the
           summing efficiency was around 5% for the standard
           analysis runs and around 20% for the runs analyzed
           using the filter.

REACTION   (42-MO-94(P,G)43-TC-95,,SGV)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the reaction rate was
           obtained by performing a Monte Carlo technique. The
           cross-section values were randomly sampled from a
           Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard
           deviation from the measured point and then the
           integral was computed. This process was repeated 100
           000 times to obtain a probability distribution for
           the true value of the reaction rate at each
           temperature.
