INSTITUTE  (1USALRL)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALRL) The Lawrence Livermore National
           Laboratory's  Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
           using the High Voltage Engineering Europa  10 MV
           modified FN-model tandem accelerator.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detectors (HPGe) were
           employed in the acquisition of spectral data as
           singles counts. The detectors used varied but had
           relative efficiencies between 13 and 33% with
           full-width halfmaximum resolutions of 0.675-0.900 keV
           and 1.66-1.74 keV at 122 and 1332 keV, respectively.
           The gamma spectra were collected for each foil over a
           series of weeks. Spectral analysis was performed
           using the GAMANAL code.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties affiliated with each
           experimentally mined value are 1 sigma and represent
           a total uncertainty of combined counting statistics,
           nuclear data, and systematic values.
CORRECTION Absorber attenuation correction for a given
           photopeak. The GAMANAL code also performs a detector
           background correction based on previous counts,

SAMPLE     For the proton irradiation, a sequence of
           Ta-Y-Ta-Pt-Pt-Pt-Ta-Y-Ta foils was used. The tantalum
           foils were 16.4 mg/cm2 and served to both degrade the
           incident ion energy and catch recoiled atoms from
           adjacent foils. The target platinum foils were each
           53.8 mg/cm2 and the yttrium monitor foils were 2.24
           mg/cm2.

SAMPLE     For the deuteron irradiations, a stack of
           Ta-Cu-Ta-Pt-Pt-Ta-Cu-Ta-Ta-Pt foils was used.
           Tantalum foils for this stack were 24.9 mg/cm2 thick
           except for the last tantalum foil which served as a
           beam stop at 0.75 mm thick. Platinum foils were 105.6
           mg/cm2 and copper foils were 11.2 mg/cm2. The last
           platinum foil served as a neutron flux monitor to
           characterize deuteron breakup and secondary neutron
           production. Platinum foil thicknesses varied for each
           run due to availability.
