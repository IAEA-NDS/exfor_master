INSTITUTE  (1USAUAL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAUAL) TR-24 cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A calibrated Canberra GC2018 High-Purity
           Germanium (HPGe) detector.
SAMPLE     Vanadium (2N8) and tantalum (3N8) sheets of 0.12- and
           2-mm thickness, respectively, were purchased from
           EPSI Metals (Ashland, OR, USA), and 0.025 mm copper
           foils (98.8% purity) were purchased from Goodfellow.
           The stacked foil target design used during
           irradiation. The Ta target holder (coin) had a
           thickness of 2 mm, a width of 25 mm, and a 1 mm deep
           divot in the center with a diameter of 10 mm. First,
           a Cu foil was placed in the divot, followed by V, Cu,
           V, and Cu foil on top. The foils were held in place
           with a retaining ring.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) After irradiation, targets were
           collected within 10 min, and each irradiated foil was
           dissolved in 5 mL of 7 M HNO3. Two samples were
           taken: one was a 100 microL sample from the dissolved
           solution, diluted to 1 mL and the second sample was 1
           mL taken from the dissolved solution. The 100 microL
           samples were used for immediate gamma ray
           spectrometry measurements (within 30 min by the End
           Of Bombardment-EOB), measuring the 63Zn and 49Cr
           activities in the Cu and V foils, respectively.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Equation was used to determine the activity
           of each radionuclide yielded at the End Of
           Bombardment (EOB)
           A=(Np)/(epsilon*tL*Cd*Igamma*exp(-lambda*tD)),
           where Np is the net peak area (Number of counts),
           epsilon is detector efficiency at photopeak,
           lambda is the decay constant of the radionuclide, tL
           is the live time of the detector (s), Igamma is the
           branching ratio of the gamma-ray associated with the
           photopeak, tD is the time passed since End of
           Bombardment (EOB) in respect to measurement time (s),
           and Cd is the correction factor.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error propagation for these cross
           sections was calculated where the sources of error
           were collected as absolute uncertainties. Briefly,
           the half-lives, half-life uncertainties, gamma rays,
           gamma ray branching ratio and uncertainties were
           obtained from National Nuclear Data Center. The
           uncertainty for all net peak areas was collected with
           each measurement, and each selected beam energy
           experiment was repeated a total of 4-5 times.
CORRECTION Results do not include a correction for the decay of
           the nuclides that occurs during the irradiation.
