TITLE      Compound-statistical features of deuteron-induced
           reactions: (I). Radiative capture of 4-15 MeV
           deuterons

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAPUP)
INC-SPECT  0.1 to 1 microA beams of 14.9+-0.12 MeV deuterons
           from the University of Pittsburgh cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,NAICR) 4pi methane-flow proportional counter,
           and 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI(T1) scintillator and a 512-
           channel pulse-height analyser.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,STTA) Stacks of targets at the center of
           a scattering chamber were bombarded normally with
           deuterons. After each bombardment, the targets in the
           stack were subjected to radiochemical separations.
           The resultant samples of reaction-product nuclides,
           mounted as circular precipitates of known area under
           mylar coverings, were then counted absolutely.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The quoted errors in the cross sections
           include the contributions of uncertainties in the
           counting efficiencies, chemical yields, decay scheme
           parameters, target thicknesses and incident beam
           intensities. The errors in the deuteron energies
           represent the uncertainty in the incident beam energy,
           compounded by the estimated energy spread during
           degradation through the target stacks.

SAMPLE     The targets were prepared from Merck electronic-grade
           Si containing <2.1*10**-7 atom percent of phosphorus
           and less than one part in 10**9 of other, electrically
           active impurities. The deposits were dried, weighed,
           covered with 99.99% A1 foil, compacted by pressing,
           stacked and mounted in rigid frames for bombardment.
           Typical targets contained 10 to 20 mg Si/cm2.

REACTION   (56-BA-138(D,G)57-LA-140,,SIG)
SAMPLE     "Specpure" BaCO3 powder from Johnson, Matthey and Co.
           was filtered from suspension in pure ether onto
           Whatman No. 50 filter paper discs. The resultant
           targets were dried, weighed, sealed in place with a
           mylar-base tape about 7 mg/cm2 thick and then
           sandwiched tightly between A1 foils.
