           Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The target was placed at the center of
           HECTOR, the High Efficiency TOtal absorption
           spectrometeR. HECTOR is a NaI(Tl) array comprised of
           16 segments providing a nearly 4pi solid angle
           coverage for gamma-ray detection.
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.98) An enriched (98(1)%) target of
           90Zr, with a thickness of 969(48) microg/cm2. The
           energy spread of the beam from the accelerator is
           about 5 keV, the energy loss in the target ranged
           from 34 to 66 keV for the highest and lowest beam
           energy utilized, respectively.
METHOD     The gamma rays from the deexcitation cascade
           following the proton capture were detected in HECTOR.
           The excited state populated via the proton capture is
           well defined and given by: Ex = Ecm + Q, where Ecm is
           the total kinetic energy in the center of mass frame
           and Q = 5.154 MeV is the reaction Q-value. Thus, the
           total energy carried by the gamma rays in the
           deexcitation cascade is ES = Ex. The events where the
           whole cascade is absorbed by the detector form the
           sum peak, a peak corresponding to the ES energy. In
           such case, the capture cross section for the reaction
           of interest can be obtained from: sigma =
           NS/(Nt*Nb*epsilon), where NS is the number of counts
           within the sum peak, Nt is the target areal density,
           Nb is the number of beam particles impinged on the
           target and epsilon is the summing efficiency.

ANALYSIS   For each beam energy, the sum peak is fitted with a
           combination of a Gaussian peak and a linear
           background to account for incomplete summation
           events. Then the linear background is subtracted from
           the sum-peak and the resulting spectrum is integrated
           within +-3 sigma range around the centroid of the
           sum-peak. The summing efficiency was determined using
           Geant4 simulations. gamma-ray cascades corresponding
           to a total energy equal to ES were used to model the
           detector response. A combination of cascades with
           varying number of gamma rays was used in each
           simulation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The primary source of uncertainty in the
           cross-section calculations stems from the
           efficiency simulations. The relative uncertainty of
           the simulated efficiency is 10-12%. The beam current
           was measured with a Faraday cup with an uncertainty
           of 5% and the target thickness is known with a 5%
           uncertainty.

ANALYSIS   The experimental results of this work were used to
           determine the best theoretical description of
           reaction cross section for 90Zr(p,gamma)91Nb using
           the Hauser-Feshbach (HF) formalism. Talys 1.9 code
           was used to explore combination of various models
           for level density (LD) and gamma-ray strength function
            (gSF) to calculate the reaction cross section. The
           best model from Talys was then used to calculate the
           reaction rate for 90Zr(p,gamma)91Nb.
