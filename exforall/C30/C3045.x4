DETECTOR   (MAGSP,IOCH,SCIN) Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph
            (SE-SPS), where its two dipole magnets focused the
           charged particles toward the focal-plane detector.
           The detector includes a position-sensitive ionization
           chamber filled with isobutane gas, and a plastic
           scintillator for measuring the remaining energy of
           the particles after passing through the ionization
           chamber.
SAMPLE     (5-B-11,ENR=0.99) The first was a self-supporting 10B
           target containing 11B, 12C, and 16O contaminants with
           a total density of about 70 microg/cm2. The 11B
           contamination was on the order of 8%. To assist in
           the identification of states coming from the 11B(d,p)
           12B reaction caused by the 11B target contamination,
           data were taken at each angle with a second target
           enriched in 11B (>99%) with a density of about
           70 microg/cm2 on a 20 microg/cm2 carbon backing.
METHOD     The targets were installed in the sliding-seal
           scattering chamber upstream of the SE-SPS. Particle
           trajectories can be reconstructed and momentum
           spectra can be constructed by using the acquired
           position information from position-sensitive anode
           pickup pads with delay-line readout. Particle
            (reaction) identification is achieved by measuring
           the energy loss in the ionization chamber and the
           remaining energy with the plastic scintillator. The
           solid-angle acceptance of the SE-SPS was set at 4.6
           msr for this experiment. To determine differential
           cross sections at different scattering angles in the
           laboratory frame, measurements were performed from 10
           to 50 in 5 degree steps. The magnetic field of the
           spectrometer was set to measure the 11B excitation
           energy range from about 8.4 to 13.6 MeV.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental uncertainties, they were
           dominated by a 15% uncertainty attributed the beam
           current integrator which is used to determine the
           number of incoming deuteron beam particles. Because
           of the large number of counts for each peak, the
           statistical uncertainties are very small. Thus, when
           combined, the error bars tend to be right around 15%
           for each data point.
