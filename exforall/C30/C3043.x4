FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAMIT) General Ionex Tandetron tandem ion
           accelerator with a maximum terminal potential of 1.7
           MV, the Cambridge Laboratory for Accelerator Studies
           of Surfaces (CLASS) at the Massachusetts Institute of
           Technology.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Ortec silicon surface barrier detector with a
           depletion depth of 2 mm was mounted at 135 degree
           scattering angle in IBM geometry. The detector had a
           16.45 microm stainless steel foil placed in front to
           stop the backscattered 3He atoms. The maximum energy
           resolution of the detector is of 22 keV as specified
           by the manufacturer.
SAMPLE     The areal density of 7Li in the film was determined
           to be 181.101*10**15 atoms/cm2, and the areal density
           of F was 195.785*10**15 atoms/cm2. The uncertainty in
           the areal density measurements was determined to be
           5.1% for 7Li and 11.47% for 19F based on the fitted
           spectra from SimNRA. Accounting for the natural
           abundance of the isotopes of lithium (7.5% 6Li and
           92.5% 7Li), the LiF film stoichiometry is very
           close to 1:1. The equivalent thickness of the film is
           42.593 nm when assuming a LiF density of 2.64 g/cc.
           The estimated thickness from Lebow was stated as 50
           nm, showing close agreement between this measurement
           and the manufacturer's specification.
METHOD     The 7Li cross section measurements were made using a
           thin lithium fluoride (LiF) film deposited on a
           molybdenum (Mo) substrate prepared by Lebow Company.
           The measurements were taken at 100 keV incident
           energy steps.
ANALYSIS   The differential cross sections were obtained using
           the equation dsigma/dOmega = Y/(Q*Sigma*Nt), where Y
           is the yield of each reaction, obtained by
           integrating the peak of the nuclear reaction product
           of interest, Q is the collected charge, Sigma is the
           solid angle of the detector, and Nt is the areal
           density of the target isotope.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in the cross sections was
           calculated with as a square root of errors of yields,
           collected charge and areal density added in
           quadratures.
