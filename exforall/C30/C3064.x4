INC-SPECT  The secondary beam of interest, 25Al, had an average
           beam intensity of 7.5*10**3 particles per second, 25%
           of the total number of particles reaching the
           secondary target. The 25Al beam particles were also
           identified and selected during the event analysis
           through their characteristic time correlation with
           the accelerator RF reference. The optimal beam
           intensity was obtained at a magnetic rigidity of
           0.5597 Tm, corresponding to 102 MeV of 25Al in the
           13+ charge state.
DETECTOR   (SI) For detection of the decay protons, two annular
           Micron Semiconductor S2-type detectors with 64 microm
           and 1000 microm thicknesses were positioned at 69 mm
           and 82 mm downstream of the target, subtending angles
           between 8 and 22 degree from the beam axis.
SAMPLE     512(51) microg/cm2 thick deuterated polyethylene (CD2)
           film, which was produced by solvent casting on a slide
           of defined area. The target thickness was then
           determined by weighing the resulting foil before it was
            cut and mounted on targets frames.

ANALYSIS   The cross sections listed were extracted from the
           peak areas in the spectrum, the integrated number of
           beam particles determined from the ion chamber data,
           the target density, and the simulated detection
           efficiency for the respective excitation energies.
           Here, the resonances are assumed to decay exclusively
           by proton emission.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The uncertainties in the cross sections
           are dominated by systematic uncertainties in the
           efficiency calculations and target thickness.
           (ERR-1) Efficiency calculations.
           (ERR-2) Target thickness.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties.

REACTION  1(13-AL-25(P,G),,WID)
          2(13-AL-25(P,G),,WID/STR)
ANALYSIS   (SLA) This experiment determined the total cross
           section for the population of this state in the (d,n)
           reaction, but the limited experimental sensitivity to
           the neutron-angular distribution does not allow for
           the disentanglement of the l=0 and l=2 contributions.
           The reaction mechanism was investigated using a CRC
           calculation using the program FRESCO. Applying the
           mirror-nucleus spectroscopic factors directly would
           predict a slightly higher cross section than
           measured. We therefore scaled the spectroscopic
           factors of Hamill et al. down to reproduce the
           observed cross section, while retaining the l=0/l=2
           ratio. In order to extract the proton-resonance width
           from the l=0 spectroscopic factor, the R-matrix
           expression was employed GammaP = C**2*Sl=0*GammaS.P.,
           where C**2*Sl=0 is a spectroscopic factor and
           GammaS.P. is a single particle width.
