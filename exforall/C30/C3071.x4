INC-SPECT  A 11Be beam was produced by bombarding a 1mm thick 9Be
           target with a 30 MeV/nucleon 13C primary beam.
DETECTOR   (SI,TELES,SCIN) The BlueSTEAl detector system was
           used to measure the scattering and breakup cross
           sections in the 11Be-C collision. This detector
           comprises four layers of Micron S2 Si DSSD (one 0.5
           mm thick and three 1.5 mm thick) and a phoswich
           plastic scintillator with 1.1 cm thickness. Two dE-E
           telescopes were built from the four Si DSSDs [0.5 mm
           + 1.5 mm (Si 1&2) and two 1.5 mm (Si 3&4)]. The Si
           1&2 telescope was placed 2.54 cm upstream from the
           target to monitor the beam's spatial spread and
           purity and to shield the Si 3&4 telescope from the
           defocused beam.
SAMPLE     For the scattering and reaction target, we used
           natural carbon in the form of flexible graphite with
           99.8% purity with a thickness of 8.7(3) mg/cm2. The
           thickness was determined from a weighted average of
           the values measured by two different weighing scales,
           a caliper, and the energy loss of 11Be scattering
           events. To check the scattering yields and the
           thickness of the target from the energy loss, two
           other targets with thickness 17.4(6) and 34.8(12)
           mg/cm2 were also used during the experiment.
METHOD     (EDE) Particle identification (PID) dE-E method by
           was obtained with the Si 3&4 telescope. The numbers
           of 11Be and 10Be detected at different angles were
           used to obtain differential cross sections for both
           scattering and inclusive breakup. The phoswich
           detector was placed about 30 cm downstream from the
           target to count the beam rate with clear elemental
           identification.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties (1 sigma) of the measured
           cross sections are about 7%-19%, depending on the
           angle.
           (ERR-S,1.,17.) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-1,,0.1) Beam intensity.
           (ERR-2) Target thickness.
           (ERR-3) Solid angle.
