FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) UND FN tandem, the radioactive beam
           facility of the University of Notre Dame.
INC-SPECT  The secondary 8B beam was produced in-flight, as part
           of a cocktail beam together with 7Be and 7Li. The
           reaction used was 3He+6Li with the two proton
           transfer channel 3He(6Li,n)8B, leading to 8B. A
           primary bunched beam of 6Li was accelerated at 37 MeV
           by the UND FN tandem, and impinged on a 2.5 cm long
           gas target of 3He at a pressure of 850 Torr. In the
           middle of the target, the beam energies corresponded
           to 26.5 MeV, 19.2 MeV, and 14.3 MeV for 8B, 7Be,
           and 7Li, respectively.
DETECTOR   (SISD,TELES) The reaction products, including
           elastically scattered particles, were detected in
           four two-stage dE-E telescopes. Each of these
           consisted of a double-sided silicon strip detector
            (DSSSD) and a pad silicon detector.
SAMPLE     A natZr target of 1.95 mg/cm2 thickness.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) The elastically scattered 8B nuclei were
           very well separated from the other beam products with
           the dE-E technique. For the breakup measurement, an
           unambiguous separation has to be obtained between the
           7Be fragments resulting from 8B breakup and the 7Be
           contamination in the secondary beam, elastically
           scattered by the natZr target. This was achieved for
           a very small part of the data with a time-of-flight
           (TOF) technique which was imposed between the start
           of the DSSSD detectors and the radio frequency of the
           pulsed beam. For the rest of the data the separation
           was obtained by energy. For that energy thresholds
           for a pure 7Be fragment detection were obtained,
           through comparison of energy distributions of the
           elastic scattered 7Be secondary beam and of the 7Be
           fragments, the last obtained in a CDCC calculation.
           Finally recovery ratios were applied for the missing
           events.

REACTION   (40-ZR-90(5-B-8,X)4-BE-7,,DA)
ADD-RES    CDCC calculations have been performed assuming a
           three-body model for the reaction (7Be+p+90Zr). It
           should be noted that a natural target was employed;
           however, authors may anticipate that this does not
           impact the conclusions, as we do not expect a
           significant dependence of the breakup on the specific
           isotope.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Error bars assigned to the data are only due
           to statistics.

REACTION   (40-ZR-90(5-B-8,X)4-BE-7,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) The integrated breakup cross section. This
           result was obtained by integrating the experimental
           angular distribution, but assuming the same shape as
           in the CDCC calculation for all missing angles.
