SAMPLE     The enriched 86Sr material was provided as 86SrCO3
           powder. Thin strontium carbonate samples were
           prepared by the sedimentation technique. A 50 mu-m
           thick Al foil (chemical purity 99.0%) was used as the
           backing for sedimentation. The net weight of the
           sediments lay in the range of 5 to 7 mg. Each
           sedimented sample was then covered by a 10 mu-m thick
           Al foil of 16 mm diameter, welted around the backing
           foil.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The energy resolution (FWHM) at 1332.5 keV of
           60Co of the HPGe detectors used was 2.5 keV. For
           efficiency calibration of the detector, standard point
           sources were used 54Mn, 133Ba, 137Cs and 152Eu.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
MONITOR    Thin foils of Al, Ti, Fe and Cu of natural isotopic
           composition (purity: Al (99.0%); Ti (>99.6%);
           Fe (99.6%); Cu (99.9%), thickness of both Fe and Ti
           foils - 25 mu-m, Al foil - 50 and 250 mu-m, Cu foil -
           50 mu-m) were used as beam monitors and inserted into
           the stack. Each foil was cut in circular disc with a
           diameter of 13 mm.

ANALYSIS   Contributions from isotopes 87Sr, 88Sr were calculated
           by TALYS code and calculated contribution was
           subtracted from the measured cross sections.
CORRECTION Correction on contribution to 87Y-M through the small
           amount of 87Sr and 88Sr in the sample was done.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Correction factor contains the ratio of the
           corrected and uncorrected cross sections.

           and <1%, respectively.
