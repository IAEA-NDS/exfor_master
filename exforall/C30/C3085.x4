INSTITUTE  (1CANCRC)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USADAV) A variable-energy 76-inch isochronous
           cyclotron, the Crocker Nuclear Laboratory of the
           University of California at Davis.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A Canberra high-purity germanium detector
            (model GC2518).
SAMPLE     The 226Ra as radium sulfate precipitates were then
           deposited by vacuum filtration onto 10 microm thick
           track-etched polycarbonate (PCTE) membrane filters
           of 0.2 microm porosity (Sterlitech PCT0225100). The
           targets contained 810+-85 kBq (21.9+-2.3 microg) of
           226Ra deposited on the filtration membrane. The
           implied thickness of the 226Ra on the filtration
           membrane was 120 microg/cm2, though the thickness was
           not measured.

METHOD     (ACTIV) The principle of the measurement technique is
           to quantify decay product activities after
           irradiation, relative to the number of beam-target
           interactions, as monitored by elastic scattering of
           the protons from the radium target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors considered in analysis of the
           226Ra(p,xn) cross sections include systematic
           uncertainties for the technique as well as counting
           statistics and fitting uncertainties for each
           measurement. Uncertainties assigned to the
           226Ra(p,xn) cross section results are obtained by
           propagation of the above sources of error. Some, such
           as the offline counting statistics for a single
           acquisition session, are independent, affecting only
           a single result. Others, like the proton peak
           integration, affect the values for all isotopes
           studied at one energy. Finally, systematic errors in
           determining, for example, the proton scattering
           detector acceptance aperture, affect the scale of the
           entire data set, but do not disturb the internal
           consistency of relative cross section comparisons. In
           the following summary, absolute uncertainties for
           each cross section are estimated, but the relative
           errors, for example in the ratio between 224Ac and
           225Ac cross sections, may be less and are not
           addressed. Combined in quadrature, the above
           measurement uncertainties result in overall 1-sigma
           uncertainties ranging from 8.2% to 14.9% on the
           reaction cross sections.
