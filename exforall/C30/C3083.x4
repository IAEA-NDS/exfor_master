FACILITY   (VDG,1USANOT) The Notre Dame Nuclear Science
           Laboratory St. ANA Pelletron accelerator.
INC-SPECT  The 5 MV accelerator delivered proton and alpha-
           particle (4He+) beams with an intensity of up to 65
           microA on target.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) An Inradoptics Scintinel cylindrical stilbene
           crystal 2 inches in diameter x 2 inches in length.
SAMPLE     Beam-stop backings of Ta with a thickness of 0.5 mm
           were used for all targets. The primary target was one
           with deeply implanted 22Ne. The 22Ne targets were
           produced by implanting 22Ne ions onto a 0.5 mm thick
           Ta backing with a dosage of 300 mC over an area of 3
           cm2 at an energy of 200 keV. The distribution of the
           implanted 22Ne atoms in the Ta backing was measured
           using the well-known resonance in the 22Ne(p,gamma)
           23Na reaction at Elab = 1278 keV. Because of the
           implantation profile, a beam energy of Elab = 910 keV
           was required to reach the central portion of the
           thick-target yield plateau for the narrow Elab = 830
           keV resonance.
METHOD     (PSD) Stilbene has a lower scintillation efficiency
           than standard liquid scintillators but provides
           excellent pulse shape discrimination (PSD), which
           represents the detector's ability to discriminate
           between gamma-ray and neutron events at lower light
           output (i.e., neutron energy). This was critical for
           this experiment because, at the Elab = 830 keV
           resonance in the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction,
           neutrons were produced with a maximum outgoing energy
           of En ~ 285 keV at 0 degree, well below the threshold
           of many types of standard liquid scintillators.
