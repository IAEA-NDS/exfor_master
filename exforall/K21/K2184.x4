           Bremsstrahlung

PART-DET   (G,P)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Radiator of the Bremsstrahlung is a thin Al
                   target(2.5 mg/cm2). Incident gamma energy was
                   determined from outgoing proton energy as Eg =
                   12.11+(17/16)Ep.
           (POLIS) POL-BM: The linear polarization of the gamma
                   rays from 4 MeV to 6 MeV.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is H2O.
           - Physical-form of target is liquid.
           - Target-thickness: 1 inch times 1 inch in size. 200
             micron thick nuclear plate
           - Backing: Thin watertight bakelite holders were used.
FACILITY   (BETAT,2JPNTOH)
DETECTOR   X-ray film was used to measure the angular
           distribution of the Bremsstrahlung.
           (PLATE) D2O soaked plate, H2O soaked plate, Non-soaked
                   plate were used.
           (IOCH) The irradiation dose was measured by a
                  Victoreen chamber embedded in a small cube of
                  Lucite which was calibrated by the chamber at
                  the center of a 10 cm cube of Lucite.
