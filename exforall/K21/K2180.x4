INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is 30 to 60 micro-Ampere.
           (MPH) The gamma-rays were produced by bombaring thick
                 target of Li metal and CaF2 with protons of
                 energy of 500 keV and 350 keV.
SAMPLE     - Target is natural.
           - Chemical-form of target is BeO.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2JPNKTO)
DETECTOR   Efficiency: The counting efficiency of G.M counter was
           calculated theoretically.
           (PROPC) to detect alpha particles. Methane flow type.
                   One of which was coated with thick layer of
                   BeO, and the other was remained uncoated. The
                   Be-coated counter was 6 cm in diam. and 20 cm
                   in effective length.
           (GEMUC) to measure the gamma-rays
