TITLE      Formation of 24Na in 'Fission-Like' Reactions
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(P,N+P)29-CU-64,,SIG) Beam intensity monitor.
           Absolute detector efficiency measured using standard
            sources.  Relative efficiency calibration made using
            182Ta source.

METHOD     (ACTIV,INTB)
           Counting rates of the 64Cu-61Cu monitor were made
            with monitor samples were sandwiched between 2 Al
            absorbers to ensure annihilation of positrons in
            a well-defined geometry. A correction Of 1.3% was
            made for absorption of 55-keV gammas in Al absorbers.
ANALYSIS   Authors assume the production of 24Na in the 40Ca,
            45Sc, and V reactions results from a binary break-up
            reaction resulting in two approximately equal
            fragments. This assumption is based mainly on the
            shape of the excitation function and an order of
            magnitude agreement with the fission cross section
            calculations from the Blann code.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given on source of
            uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Measured values are compared to fission cross
            section calculations based on a subroutine of the
            statisical evaporation model code of Blann and Plasil.
STATUS     Data taken from Table3 in reference.
