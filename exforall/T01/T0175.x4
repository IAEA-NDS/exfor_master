TITLE      Radiochemical measurements of 200-MeV proton-induced
            fission of 133Cs
AUTHOR     (B.J.Wagner,T.E.Ward,V.E.Viola Jr)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
SAMPLE     Spec-pure cesium nitrate (CsNO3) targets about 100
            mg/cm**2 thick. Material obtained in ultrapure form
            with 0.01 ppm heavy or medium element contamination.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (ACTIV,RCHEM) Radiochemical separation times 1-2 hrs.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-ray spectra measured by low background
            Ge(Li) detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total quoted error includes uncertainty due to:
           . statistics (13-60%),
           . detection efficiency (35),
           . chemical yields (10%),
           . target thickness (5%),
           . current integration (5%).
STATUS     No reply from V. Viola to author proof.
HISTORY    (20020724C) VM. Converted from data set O0616 and
             updated. Product cross sections added.

ANALYSIS   Based on estimated average total symmetric fission
            = 2.0+-1.3 microb, asummetric fission = 2.7+-0.9
            microb, which are averages of the product of the
            production cross section and the estimated fission
            yield for each mass chain. Upper limits of 15% and
            6% were placed on chain yields for symmetric and
            asymmetric mode, respectively. 42K and 77As were
            assumed to be products of asymmetricfission,
            remaining nuclides of symmetric fission.
