TITLE      Investigation of 6Li-induced reactions from 54 to 99
            MeV on Pd targets
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAINU) 6Li+++ Beam.
SAMPLE     Foils were produced from metal powder by annealing
            and rolling. Foil was oriented at an angle of 45
            degrees with respect to the beam making target
            thickness sqrt(2) times values given.
METHOD     (EXTB). Beams were obtained directly from the
            accelerator without the use of degrader foils.
           (BCINT). Longitudinally segmented Faraday cup.
           Target thickness was determined by measuring the
            amount of energy degradation of known alpha particle
            groups from a 212Po source.
DETECTOR   (GELI). Used for in-beam and off-line measurements.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . target angle and enrichment,
           . dead time losses,
           . Faraday cup leakage and composite production of a
             species via both reactions and decay.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimated error in data of the combined
            uncertainties from:
            . fitted gamma ray areas,
            . beam charge integration,
            . target thickness measurements,
            . gamma ray branching ratios.
ADD-RES    (COMP). Geometry-dependent Hybrid Model, which
            describes the time evolution of nuclear reactions by
            means of compound-nuclear evaporation and pre-
            equilibrium nucleon emission processes.
CRITIQUE   Paper does not contain some important details of
            experiment.  Therefore, the interpretaion of some
            results is ambiguous.
STATUS     No reply from C. Castenada to author proof.

INC-SPECT  Energy resolution is 1.8 keV at 1.1 MeV.
METHOD     (GSPEC). Spectra of gamma rays in prompt coincidence
            with the beam bursts and interbeam-burst (delayed)
            gamma rays were recorded separately.
EN-SEC     (E,G) In-beam gamma rays of 165 and 864 keV and 1.0
             abundance were measured.
           ** COMMENT BY CAJAD COMPILER ** ENSDF-91 does not
            list 165 keV transition for 105Ag.

            the abundance of 719 keV gammas from metastable state
            decay is 0.045. Therefore, contribution from metastabl
            state decay is small.
