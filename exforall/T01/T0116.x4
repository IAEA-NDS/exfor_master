TITLE      190 MeV proton-induced symmetric and asymmetric
            fission
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT,TOF) Energy signals and timing
            signals relative to the cyclotron Rf and between
            detectors were used for fragment identification.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SOLST,SOLST). Fission fragments were detected in
            a 163-cm diameter scattering chamber using solid-state
            detectors.
           Typically, a single 300-mm**2 Si detector was placed
            on one detector arm, at 90 degrees, about 15 cm from
            the target. An array of three 600-mm**2 Si detectors
            was located about 30 cm away on an opposing detector
            arm. All detectors were not more than 100 micrometers
            thick.
           The fixed angle of 300mm2 Si detector at 90deg in subs.
            2,4,7,9,11,13 is  denoted as ANG1, relative angle of
           oposing detector is denoted as ANG2.
MONITOR    Energy and relative mass spectra calibrated using
            252Cf source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors due to assumption that angular
            distributions are isotropic.
           Data reader uncertainties are much smaller.
ADD-RES    (A-DIS). Relative fragment mass distributions at a
            few angles.
STATUS     (COREL,T0118001)
           No reply from F. Becchetti to author proof.

SAMPLE     Chloride or fluoride compounds of natural U, 400
            microg/cm2 were evaporated onto thin carbon foils.
           The target was placed at 45 degrees with respect to
            the incident beam.
ANALYSIS   (4PI1A). Calculated from data at about 90 degrees,
            assuming nearly isotropic angular distributions.
STATUS     (CURVE) Graph of fission probability vs Z**2/A. Data
            are digitized by compiler and fission cross sections
            are derived using total cross sections calculated
            using semi-empirical formula for geometric cross
