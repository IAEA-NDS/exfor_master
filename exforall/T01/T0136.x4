REACTION   (93-NP-237(A,N)95-AM-240,,SIG)
SAMPLE     237Np targets, thickness 0.05-0.3 mg/cm2, prepared by
            electroplating Np on nickel foils of about 5 mg/cm**2.
           Three Cu monitor foils (about 2 mg/cm2) were stacked
            behind the Np target.
METHOD     (BCINT) Beam current integration gave an additional
            determination of the total number of incident
            particles.
           (CHSEP) Chemical yield was determined by use of an
            241Am spike.
DETECTOR   (GELI). Resolution about 2.7 keV.
           Target thicknesses were determined by the alpha
            radiation emitted from 237Np using a Si(LI) surface
            barrier detector.

DETECTOR   (TRD) Strips of Mica of about 0.1 mm thickness mounted

            150 degrees with respect to the beam direction,
            inclined at 60 degrees with respect to the target
            surface. After the irradiation the strips were etched
            in hydrofluoric acid and scanned with a microscope.

METHOD     (STTA,EDEG) Energies in the different foils of the

            et al., Nucl.Data A7, 233 (1970).
