            Since no details are known about absolute alpha
            branchings and other decay modes as spontaneous
            fission or electron capture the given values are

ERR-ANALYS No information on error analysis is given.
COMMENT    The absolute cross section at the peak of the
           excitation function was estimated to approximately
           20 nb.

DECAY-DATA (104-RF-261,65.SEC,A,8250.)
           (102-NO-257,26.SEC,A,8250.)
            Measured parent and daughter activities could not
            be separated.
ERR-ANALYS No information on error analysis is given.
COMMENT    Direct production of 257No by the (18O,alpha 5n)
            reaction is insignificant over the energy range
            studied and, consequently, the measured excitation
            function is essentially that of the 248Cm(18O,5n)261Ku
            reaction.
