TITLE      Empirical Evaluation of Gamow-Teller Strength Function
            For 37Cl->37Ar and Its Implication in the Cross
            Section For Solar Neutrino Absorption by 37Cl.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
INC-SPECT  Overall energy resolution was better than 600 keV.
           Better energy resolution (300-keV) was obtained with
            second target.
SAMPLE     CaCl2 foil target, enriched to >98% 37Cl, and about
            90 mg/cm**2 thick, placed between 25-mg/cm**2 Ca foil.
           The large difference (13.5 MeV) in (p,n) Q-value
            between the 40Ca and 37Cl nuclei permits a clean
            observation of low-lying states in 37Ar.
           A second target, 32.2 mg/cm**2 of CaCl2 with aluminized
            mylar as protective layers, was also used to obtain a
            cross check on the absolute cross section values.
DETECTOR   Time-compensated neutron detectors with subnanosecond
            time resolution.
METHOD     (TOF)
            A self-supporting 100 mg/cm2 foil also bombarded at
             120 MeV under identical experimental conditions, and
             the 2 spectra after proper normalization were
             subtracted.
MONITOR    (3-LI-7(P,N)4-BE-7,,DA)
           Energy dependence of neutron detector efficiency
            checked by measuring known cross section of the
            12C(p,n)12N(gs) reaction.
