TITLE      Excitation functions for spallation products and
           fission isomers in 237Np(4He,xn)241(-x)Am reactions

FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USABNL)
           (VDGT,1USASTB) beam energies of the cyclotron were
           calibrated against the Van de Graaff accelerator by
           measuring the pulse heights of alpha particles
           scattered from a gold target.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(A,X)30-ZN-65,CUM,SIG) integrated beam
           current determined using natural copper foils
            (7 mg/cm**2 thick).

DECAY-MON  (30-ZN-65,245.D,DG,1115.) Data were taken from M.N.
           Namboodiri et al., Phys.Rev., C7, 1222 (1973).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error bars are given only in the graphical
           display of the excitation functions. From these a
           rough estimate of about 20% can be made. No
           information is given on contributions to these
           uncertainties.

METHOD     (REC)
          RStacked detector technique. Ratios were
           measured using a detector stack of two different
           thickness due to the fact that detection efficiency
           varies with the minimum dip angle of the impinging
           fission fragments. This minimum dip angle which
           increases with detector thickness depends on the
           time-of-flight and thus on the half-life of the
           recoiling fission isomers. This difference in
           detection efficiency of the two foils allows the
           determination of the cross section ratio.
DETECTOR   (TRD)
          1Plastic sheet (makrofol, 0.72 mg/cm2) mounted
           perpendicular to the beam very nearly in the same

           the excitation function.
