           (VDGT,1USASTB)
            Beam energies of the cyclotron were calibrated
            against the Van de Graaff accelerator by measuring
            the pulse heights of alpha particles scattered from
            a gold target.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(A,X)30-ZN-65,CUM,SIG) integrated beam
            current determined using natural copper foils
            (7 mg/cm**2 thick).

METHOD     (REC)
          RStacked detector technique. Ratios Were measured using
            a detector stack of two different thickness due to
            the fact that detection efficiency varies with the
            minimum dip angle of the impinging fission fragments.
            This minimum dip angle which increases with detector
            thickness depends on the time-of-fligth and thus on
            the half-life of the recoiling fission isomers. This
            difference in detection efficiency of the two foils
            allows the determination of the cross section ratio.
DETECTOR   (TRD)
          1Plastic sheet (MAKROFOL, 0.72 mg/cm2) mounted
            perpendicular to the beam very nearly in the same
            plane as the target layer.

            thicknesses.

           (2.) Probably Contributions from Other Fission Isomers
              such as 237(m1/m2)Pu. A limit of <0.03 microb was
              calculated for the formation cross section of 5 nsec
              237Am, which corresponds to about the maximum of the
              excitation funtion.
