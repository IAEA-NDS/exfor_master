TITLE       (p,He3) and (p,t) Cross-Section Measurements
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAORL)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)
           Beam current was measured by using a monitor for
            which no details were given.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The residual nuclei were identified from a
            graphical analysis of the complex decay curves.
DECAY-DATA Decay data taken from J.M. Hollander et al.
REL-REF    (R,,J.M.HOLLANDER+,J,RMP,25,469,1953) Decay data.
            This reference reports experimental values and does
            not give recommended values for half-lives and decays.
COMMENT    The main purpose of this work was testing of the order
            of magnitude of the cross sections for a comparison
            with theoretical calculations and not an exact
            determination of the cross sections.
STATUS     Data taken from table in reference.
