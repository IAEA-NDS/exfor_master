TITLE      Radiochemical study of the combined (p,pi0) and (p,
            gamma) reactions on bismuth with protons from 62 to
            480 MeV.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Si surface barrier detectors.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)
           Irradiation times were typically of the order of one
            hour. Sample counting was made in a period over one
            year.
CORRECTION Cross sections were corrected for target thickness.
           Measurements at proton energy of 210 MeV at Triumf
            with two foils of different thicknesses (2.5 and 19
            mg/cm**2) showed that contribution from secondary
            reactions could be as high as 10% for the thin target.
