TITLE      Total Neutron Yields from 100 MeV Protons on Pb and
            7Li Targets.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (BCINT) Typical average beam currents during an
            irradiation were 50 nA with an estimated overall
            uncertainty of <1.5%.
DETECTOR   (MTANK) Large tank in the form of a vertical
            cyclinder (1.7-m high by 1.5-m diameter).
           Gamma activity of the Au foils was counted on an
            automatic system with two NaI(Tl) detectors.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,INT)
            Thermal neutron flux distribution inside the water
            tank was measured by activating gold foils.
            Macroscopic (n,gamma) cross section of 197Au for 2200
            m/sec velocity neutrons was assumed as 5.835 1/cm.
CORRECTION Flux in tank corrected for measure dazimuthal
            variations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Separate error analysis in which statistical
            and systematic errors were assigned to each of the
            separate factors needed to derive the measured yield
            indicated a an overall uncertainty of +-6%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Data are compared with theoretical results
            from the computer codes NMTC and MORSE.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 2 in reference.
           (APRVD) Approved by A. Lone, 20 June 2001.
