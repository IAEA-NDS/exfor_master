TITLE      Measurements of thick target fission yields as a probe
            of fission excitation functions for deep sub-barrier
            energies
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAYAL) The WNSL Yale Tandem Van De Graaff
            accelerator.
SAMPLE     Thick targets of 238U, thickness 155 mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   Fission fragments were detected at back angles by an
            annular photo-voltaic detector (PVD).
           (NAICR) Gamma rays detected using large NaI(Tl)
            crystal.
METHOD     (BCINT) Typical beam currents on target varied from
            0.5 to 6.0 Projectile Na.
           (COINC) Gamma-rays detected in coincidence with heavy
            fission fragments.
MONITOR    252Cf source used to calibrate PVDs. Standard gamma-ray
            sources used to calibrate NaI(Tl) detector.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Measured yields compare well with those
            calculated from published thin target cross sections.
STATUS     No reply from N. Ajitanand to author proof.
