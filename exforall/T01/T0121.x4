TITLE      Ta181(p,n)W181 and Au197(p,n)Hg197 Excitation
            Functions Between 4 and 13 MeV
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USALRL)
INC-SPECT  Incident beam energy about 200 keV.
SAMPLE     Stacks of 24 foils mounted in brass holder used for
            relative measurement; each foil had a thickness of
            10 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (BCINT,STTA)
DETECTOR   (NAICR).Pulses from 2 NaI spectrometers set at 180
            degrees were summed up to reduce errors from sample
            positioning.
CORRECTION Corrected for background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of error is given.

STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by L.F. Hansen, 29 December 2000.
HISTORY    (20001121C) Converted from data set B0045;
            updated at NNDC. Originally compiled by KaChaPaG and
            updated by CaJaD.
