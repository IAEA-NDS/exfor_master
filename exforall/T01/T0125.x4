SAMPLE     0.10-mil foils of natural vanadium.
MONITOR    (23-V-51(P,EL)23-V-51,,DA) Value at 90 degrees
            determined independently and relative data was
            normalized to this point.
           Incident flux relative to elastic scattering in CsI
            monitor detector at 25 degrees.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty given is rms standard error is
            approximately 2%.  A possible systematic uncertainty
            of 1% due to selection of elastic scattering events
            from recorded spectrum.

SAMPLE     Metallic foils of about 6 cm**2 of natural vanadium in
            a target frame.
METHOD     (BCINT,ACTIV) After irradiation the target foils were
            dissolved in acid. The activities then were compared
            with solutions of 51Cr and 65Zn, respectively, which
            were calibrated using X-ray/Gamma-ray coincidence
            counting techniques. In addition 65Zn was also
            compared with a standard source from the National
            Bureau of Standards.
