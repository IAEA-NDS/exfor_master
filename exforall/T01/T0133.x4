TITLE      Excitation Function For 15O Production Via the
            14N(d,n)15O Reaction
INC-SPECT  Incident beam energy ranged from 0.6 to 14.35 MeV.
           For energies below 2 MeV, the error in the energy
            spread of the initial beam is estimated to be not
            greater than 6%.
           Energy given in energy of degraded beam midway the
            target cell.
           Beam intensities ranged from 70-130 nanoamp with
            typical irradiation times of 10 to 20 sec.
SAMPLE     Nitrogen gas of high purity at pressures of 200 to 400
            Torr, in 3 to 5 cm long, 2 cm diameter quartz tubes
            with 21.51 mg/cm**2 thick Al windows.
METHOD     (BCINT)  Energy losses in the Al windows of the gas
            target and the Faraday cup were calculated according
            to Williamson et al., CEA-R3042 (1966).
           Incident beam energy was magnetically analyzed.
           After irradiation, the 15O gas was cryogenically
            transferred from the target cells to a counting glass
            vial containing activated charcoal.
DETECTOR   (NAICR). Well crystal
DECAY-DATA (8-O-15,2.03MIN,AR,511.)
MONITOR    Detector calibrated by means of standard 11C sources.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION Contributions of 13N from the (d,dn) reaction and 11C
            from (d,an) the reaction were corrected for by
            following the radioactive decay for 20 to 50 minutes
            in 1 to 2 minutes intervals.
ERR-ANALYS Overall errors of obtained by summing up all individual
           uncertainties in quadrature are of the order of 8-12%,
           and contain contributions due to uncertainty in:
           . window thickness (3%),
           . target thickness (2%),
           . transfer of the 15O activity to the counting vial
             (4%),
           . dead time and detector efficiency (3%),
           . beam current integration (1%),
           . counting statistics and decay curve analysis (3%).
           Uncertainty in beam energy is estimated <50 keV.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 1 of reference.
