COMMENT    Authors state that their values disagree with values
            obtained by J.P. Blaser, Helv.Phys.Acta 24, 3 (1951)
            obtained by the activation method seems to be wrong.
            They seem to have overlooked the fact that Fig.8 of
            that publication gives the cross sections for the
            production of 114(M)In. (KaChaPaG compiler)

CORRECTION Below 2.5 MeV, correction for 37Cl impurity is too
            large to be meaningful, so data have been omitted.
