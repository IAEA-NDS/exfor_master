TITLE      Excitation functions for the bombardment of Fe-56 with
           protons
FACILITY   (CYCLO)
INC-SOURCE The maximum error in the quoted energy is considered
           Not to exceed +- 3 %.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of metallic foils of separated
           Fe-56 (1-2 mg/cm2) held between about
           7 mg/cm2 aluminum foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI)
ERR-ANALYS The probable errors in the cross sections (without any
           allowance for errors in the decay schemes used) are
           about 6 %.
STATUS     Data taken from JIN,32,1419,1970--table 1.
