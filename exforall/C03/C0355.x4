TITLE      STUDY OF THALLIUM, LEAD, AND BISMUTH NUCLEI PRODUCED
           IN THE BOMBARDMENT OF GOLD WITH 380-MEV PROTONS
FACILITY   (SYNCY)
SAMPLE     GOLD (COMMERCIALLY RATED AS 99.99% AND 99.999% PURE).
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,3P+N)11-NA-24,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
COMMENT    TM-170 WAS CHOSEN AS THE STANDARD SINCE IT EMITS
           GAMMA RAYS OF 84 KEV, AN ENERGY AT WHICH THE UNIT
           EFFICIENCY IS REQUIRED, AS WELL AS AN ENERGETIC
           BETA PARTICLE. THE DECAY SCHEME OF THIS NUCLIDE IS
           SIMPLE AND WELL KNOWN.
CORRECTION EACH VALUE HAD BEEN CORRECTED FOR CONTRIBUTION
           RESULTING FROM THE SPALLATION OF BISMUTH AND LEAD
           IMPURITTIES IN THE GOLD TARGET.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS WERE ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE DEVIATIONS FROM THE
           MEAN OF SEVERAL DETERMINATIONS.
