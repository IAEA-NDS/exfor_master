TITLE      Study of (p,n) reactions between 100 and 400 MeV
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACAR)
INC-SOURCE The uncertainty of the proton energy had been estimated
            to be less than +-5% at energies from 130 to 420 MeV
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,STTA)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           0.001 in. and 0.003 in. Al metallic foil  99.99% pure
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.B.Cumming,J,ARN,13,261,1963)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Standard deviations from the average for
             identical determinations.
           In addition there were systematic uncertainties of
             about:
           (ERR-2)  +-10% for the monitor cross section
           (ERR-3)  +-5% for target alignment
           (ERR-4)  +-5% for decay curve resolution
           (ERR-5)  +-3% for chemical yield determination.
           (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty, taken to be the
            geometric mean of these individual uncertainties, had
            a value of about +-17%.
