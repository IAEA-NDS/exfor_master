FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven Alternating Gradient
           Synchrotron.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     These target stacks consisted of (1) three 25 microm
           thick aluminum foils, or (2) a 50 microm thick
           uranium foil sandwiched between two sets of three 25
           microm thick aluminum foils, (3) a similar stack
           with a 75 microm thick thorium foil instead of the
           uranium, (4) a similar stack with 50 microm thick
           tantalum foil. The three uranium thicknesses used
           were 53 mg/cm2, 88 mg/cm2, and 147 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,GSPEC) After irradiation in the
           circulating beam of 28 GeV protons at the Brookhaven
           Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, a rectangular area
           from each of the target stacks was stamped out for
           chemical separations. The samples were assayed either
           on a calibrated 30 cm3 Ge(Li) X-ray detector or on a
           calibrated Ge(Li) X-ray detector, with the dimension
           of 5 mm x 100 mm2 and a thin Be window. For all
           samples of a given element, the assay was made with
           the same detector and under exactly the same
           conditions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors were combined in quadrature to give
           the proper weighting factors in the procedure.
           (ERR-S,0.2,1.3) Counting statistics.
           (ERR-1,3.,5.) Chemical yield determination.
           (ERR-2,0.7,3.4) Secondary corrections.
           (ERR-3,0.3,1.2) Recoil loss corrections.
           (ERR-4) Detector efficiency.
CORRECTION The final results have been corrected for recoil
           losses and for secondary contributions both to the
           monitor reaction 27Al(p,3pn)24Na and to neutron-
           excess products as determined in this work.
