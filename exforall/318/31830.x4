ANALYSIS   By Daniel Jose Martin-Lambarri (2020-10-21):
            The neutron flux is measured rutinely by the TRIGA
            Mark III engineers with the Au foil activation method,
            and it was the flux value we used.
FACILITY   (REAC,3MEXINI) 1 MW TRIGA MARK III reactor
ADD-RES    The 13C(n,g)14C thermal cross section measured by
            graphite irradiation and AMS was 0.18+/-0.03 b,
            which is biased by the 14C originated from the 14N
            impurities (~1%) in the graphite sample through the
            14N(n,p)14C reaction.
