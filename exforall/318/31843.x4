SAMPLE     Cf-252 target (~1E+06 fission/min)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,SIBAR) The fission fragments deposited
           all of their kinetic energy in both dE/dx counters.
           The Cf-252 was deposited on a Pt backing, its
           strength was about 10**6 fission/min, the rate of the
           6.1 MeV alpha's on the particle telescope was
           2.10**3 c/sec, while the fission rate was about
           10**2 fission/sec.
           The resolution for 6.1 MeV alpha particles was 12% full
           width at half-maximum.
METHOD     (COINC) Alpha particle and fission fragments are
           detected in coincidence.
ADD-RES    (E-DIS) Energy spectra of light charged particles in
                   arbitrary units
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
