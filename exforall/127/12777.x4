TITLE      Polarized neutron capture on 3He at E(n) = 9.0 MeV
INC-SOURCE All of the data were taken with a 5.1-cm long
           deuterium-filled gas cell having a pressure of 620 kPa
            (absolute). This cell produced an energy spread of
           about 770 keV for the 9.0 MeV neutrons.
REL-REF    (I,12707001,L.Ward+,J,PR/C,24,317,1981)
           The experimental arrangement used in the present work
           was quite similar to the setup described in J,PR/C,24.
SAMPLE     The 3He target consisted of a stainless steel cell
           having a wall thickness of 1.6 mm and filled to a
           pressure of 196 atm
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) 2 Detectors, each consisting of a NaI
            crystal (25.4 X 25.4 cm) and a NE110 plastic
           anticoincidence shield

ANALYSIS   The numerical integrations over the source, target,
           and detector were performed with Monte Carlo techniques
COMMENT    Angular distributions data not available
CORRECTION The angular distribution data for the cross section
           measurements were corrected for finite geometry effects
           of the deuterium gas cell, the 3He target, and the
           detector.
