TITLE      TIME REVERSAL AND CHARGE SYMMETRY STUDIES IN SINGLE
           NUCLEON TRANSFER REACTIONS IN THE A = 5 SYSTEM
FACILITY   50-MEV POLARIZED NEUTRON FACILITY AT 76-INCH CYCLOTRON.
           IT INCLUDES A SPIN ROTATION MAGNET
INC-SOURCE (D-T) TRITIUM GAS TARGET, LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED. THE
           INCIDENT SPECTRUM WAS NON-MONOENERGETIC. LOW ENERGY
           NEUTRONS SEPARATED BY TIME OF FLIGHT.
           BEAM POLARIZATION NOT GIVEN.
SAMPLE     6.4 CM X 15.2 CM HIGH, 4HE GAS CELL. LIQUID NITROGEN
           COOLED AND PRESSURIZED AT 5.5 BAR. 0.102 MM THICK AL
           WINDOW.
MONITOR    CH2 CONVERTER FOLLOWED BY A TELESCOPE COMPOSED OF 3
           NE102 DETECTORS, 15 X 7.5 X 0.12 CM.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) PAIRS OF DEL-E, E TELESCOPES, SCINTILLATORS,
           NE102. 11 X 5 X 0.12 CM FOR DEL-E DETECTORS AND
           10.1 X 5.1 X 2.5 CM FOR THE E DETECTORS.
METHOD     PAIRS OF TELESCOPES, LEFT AND RIGHT, MEASURED THE
           ANALYSING POWER. ONE PAIR WAS KEPT AT 20 DEGS., LAB, TO
           MEASURE ABSOLUTE BEAM POLARIZATION WITH HIGH PRECISION
           AND ACCURACY. EVENT BY EVENT DATA ACQUISITION.
           DEUTERONS SELECTED BY PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION IN DEL-E,
           E TELESCOPE. DEUTERONS PRODUCED BY LOW ENERGY NEUTRONS
           DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY TIME OF FLIGHT.
ANALYSIS   DIRECT COMPUTATION OF SPIN UP, DOWN, DETECTOR LEFT,
           RIGHT COMBINATION. EVENT BY EVENT ANALYSIS INCLUDED
           PARTICLE SEPARATION AND TIME OF FLIGHT CUTS.
CORRECTION MEASURED ASYMMETRY CORRECTED FOR THE FINITE EXTENT OF
           THE TARGETS AND DETECTORS.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
           UNCERTAINTIES IN SCATTERING ANGLE AND THE FINITE
           ACCEPTANCE CORRECTION.
