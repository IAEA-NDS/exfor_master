           (2SPNSPN) University of Huelva, Spain
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD) The LNL-tandem XTU accelerator
INC-SOURCE The 7Be radioactive beam for this experiment was
           produced with the facility EXOTIC. A 34.2 MeV 7Li(3+)
           primary beam with intensity around 100 pnA impinging on
           a H(2) gas target.
SAMPLE     Ni-58 target was  1.0 mg/cm**2 thick.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (EXTB) The 7Be secondary beam was produced via the
           two-body reaction p(7Li,7Be)n
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SI) Charged reaction products were detected
           by means of the three delta E-E telescopes of the DINEX
           Each telescope was composed of two double-sided silicon
           strip detectors-DSSSDs, with thicknesses of 40-42 and
           1000 mum for the delta-E and E-res layers,respectively.
           Each DSSSD had an active area of 50*50 mm**2 and the
           detector front and back sides were both segmented into
           16 strips in order to define a pixel structure with 256
           elements of approx. 9 mm**2 area.

           was done.

COMMENT    *By authors*.A larger variety of triggering reaction
           mechanisms-
           Exclusive breakup-7Be->3He + 4He
           3He-stripping- 7Be + 58Ni->4He + 61Zn,
           n-stripping-7Be + 58Ni-> 6Be(= 4He + p + p) + 59Ni,
           n-pickup- 7Be + 58Ni->8Be(= 4He + 4He) + 57Ni,
           4He-evaporation after a compound nucleus reaction.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The interaction of 7Be projectiles with a
           58Ni target can essentially produce 3He ions by two
           main processes-
           exclusive breakup- 7Be-> 3He + 4He
           4He-stripping- 7Be + 58Ni->3He + 62Zn
