FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP)the Scanditronix MC 40 cyclotron at the
           Joint Research Centre (Ispra, Italy)
SAMPLE     The target material was wrapped into aluminium foil of
           25 mum thickness. 44CaCO(3) targets of 2 mg in form of
           44CaCO3 samples were irradiated for approximately 1 h
           with a proton beam of 9 MeV on the target material,
           at a current of 10-15 muA. A two hour irradiation of
           10 mg 44CaCO3 at the same energy and 19 muA current was
           conducted in order to determine the activity of
           produced impurities other than 44mSc. In order to
           simulate the production of 44Sc in the PET centre 20 mg
           of 44CaCO3 was irradiated for 4 h using protons of
           10 MeV energy and beam current of 12.4 muA.
