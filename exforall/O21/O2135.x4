ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1,15.).The uncertainty in the peak area analysis
           was estimated to be about 15%.
           (ERR-2,6.).The uncertainty in the efficiency of the
           detector about 6%.
           (ERR-3,10.).The uncertainty in the proton flux
           measurement about 10%.

SAMPLE     Samples were prepared using RbCl of natural isotopic
           abundance(95%). The powder was sedimented on an
           aluminium backing (15 mm in dia, 0.1 mm thick) and
           covered with a 0.01-mm-thick Al foil. This way samples
           were obtained with contents of 0.010-0.030 g/cm**2. The
           sample thickness was determined by weighing.
           Production yields of Sr-82 and Sr-85 were measured
           experimentally using thick RbCl-nat targets.
