SAMPLE     Thorium layers of defined geometry containing 8.5-
           14.6 mug/cm**2 were used. Silver plates of 99.99%
           purity with 0.1-mm thickness and 16-mm diameter were
           used as cathode materials and a platinum wire was used
           as an anode. The silver disks were covered with
           aluminum foils, 22.5-mum thickness, 99.99%, which acted
           as catcher foils to avoid any losses of activity by
           recoil processes and were used as monitor foils.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,10.).Error in the beam current is less than 10%
           (ERR-2,,2.).The uncertainty in the thickness of the
           monitoring foil is less than 2%.
           (ERR-3,,5.).The uncertainty in the determination of the
           activity of 22Na, include the uncertainty of its decay
           data is less than 5%.
           (ERR-4,,2.).The uncertainty associated with dissolution
           of the 230Th target layer and preparation of new
           samples for alpha-spectrometric measurements is less
           than 2%.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table.
