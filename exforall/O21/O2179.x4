SAMPLE     A cylindrical target(11.24 mm long and 30 mm diameter)
           filled with liquid-hydrogen of 85.9+-1.5 mg/cm**2,
           produced in a cryostat, was used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) the small plastic-scintillator, 50*30 mm**2 was
           used as trigger of the data acquisition.
           A ToF Wall composed of 28 plastic-scintillator was
           placed behind the second MWPC to measure the time-of-
           flight.
           To detect the light-charged particles in coincidence
           with the fission a segmented plastic-scintillator wall
           was placed around the first He-pipe in front of the
           double ionization chamber.
           (IOCH)  ionization chambers MUSIC and double ionization
           chamber (TwinMUSIC),active volume of 50 cm long,
           20 cm high and 20 cm wide, two multi-wire proportional
           chambers (MWPC), with a resolution (FWHM) of 200 mum
           and 1 mm, respectively
           the neutron detector LAND, 1 m long, 2 m high and 2 m
           wide, was used to determine the neutron multiplicities.

CORRECTION The main contributions to the uncertainties are
           attributable to uncertainties of the target thickness,
           attenuation of the beam intensity in the target,
           fission events lost on the pipe and the detection
           efficiency of the TWIN chamber. The largest corrections
           are attributable to the attenuation of the beam
           intensity in the target considering the attenuation to
           half the target (values obtained for the energies 370,
           500 and 650 MeV were 3.6%, 3.8% and 4.0%, respectively)
           the correction of the fission events lost on the pipe
           and the detection efficiency of the TWIN chamber
            (around 88%). The secondary reactions were also
           calculated with the nuclear reaction rate in half the
           target obtaining values smaller than 2.2% for all
           energies.
