SAMPLE     Ti-44 was used as target
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI) For the detection of light particles a
           delta-E-E telescope, consisting of two Micron
           Semiconductor Ltd S2-type silicon detectors of 65 mum
           and 1000 mum thickness
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).The main source of uncertainty in the measured
           cross sections a rises from the accuracy of the
           geometry, approx. 4%.

REACTION   (22-TI-44(A,P)23-V-47,,SIG)
COMMENT    *By authors*. A detailed analysis found no evidence for
           the presence of 44Ti(a,p) reactions in the data,
           leading to an upper limit of 40 microbarn, at a 68%
           confidence limit. This is about half the NON-SMOKER
           prediction, and constitutes a step towards explaining
           the 44Ti excesses already observed in CCSNe. Future
           experimental studies utilising this and other isotopes
           reclaimed from accelerator waste are anticipated,
           with improved beam intensities expected.
