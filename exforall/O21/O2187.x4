SAMPLE     A LiF 500 mug/cm**2 thick target housed in a thin
           walled spherical scattering chamber. The LiF target was
           95% enriched in 6Li and evaporated on a 500 mug/cm**2
           thick Au backing. To minimize Li evaporation the target
           was cooled during the experiment and the gold backing
           was mounted towards the beam.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (EDE)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) BC501 liquid scintillation detectors for neutron
           (TELES,SI) Delta-E(15 mum)-E(200 mum) Silicon Telescope
           for absolute cross section normalization through the
           measurement of the elastically backscattered 3He beam
           particles on Au.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors on
           figure-The main error source comes from the target
           thickness. Other uncertainties come from BC501
           detection efficiency and from solid angle subtended by
           the detectors. The overall uncertainties are about 10%.
