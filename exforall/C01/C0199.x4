TITLE      Measurement of cross sections for Aluminium-26 and
            Sodium-24 induced by protons in Aluminium.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAHRV) 160-MeV synchrocyclotron.
INC-SOURCE External diameter 160-MeV proton beam 11.1 mm.
           Proton fluences measured using a transmission ion
            chamber and Faraday cup calibrations were made at
            several energies.
SAMPLE     High purity (99.999%) aluminium disks, machined to
            12.7 mm in diameter.
           In order to keep the energy loss in the target less
            than 2 MeV, two different thicknesses used.
           Target parameters and proton numbers for each energy
            are the following:

           Total detection efficiency determined using calibrated
            88Y, 60Co and 133Ba sources. Efficiency 3.42x10**(-3)

DETECTOR   (GELI)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors quoted are upper limits; the
            detector efficiency, which depends on calibrated
            sources with 5% uncertainties is one of the major
            factors.
           Statistical errors in the mean are generally less
            than 1 %.

METHOD     (AMS) After the aluminium targets were counted for
            24Na, they were analyzed for 26Al at the University
            of Pennsylvania's Tandem Accelerator Laboratory mass
            analysis facility.
           (CHSEP) Targets were completely dissolved with HCl,
            precipitated with NH4OH, and converted to Al2O3 by
            baking in an 800-deg C oven for several hours.
            About 2 mg of the Al2O3 from each target was pressed
            into a copper cathode and loaded into a cesium-
            sputter ion source.
           (EDE)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Combination gas (DE) - Si surface-barrier
            (E) detector.
PART-DET   (RSD) Measurements were made by producing Al-negative
            ions, accelerating them through 36 keV and mass
            analyzing them through 90-deg before injection into
            the tandem accelerator operated at 7.5 MeV. Al27+
            ions at 60 MeV were analyzed in a velocity selector,
            then a 90-deg bending magnet followed by another
            45-deg magnet before detection.
MONITOR    Isotopic ratios normalized by comparison to standard
            sample having a ratio of 9.86x10**(-12), made from
            NBS-standard 4229-24, and based on 26Al half-life of
            7.03 x 10**5 yr.  Normalization factor 1.13.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Random errors given.
           Additional systematic uncertainty (5.7%) due to
            uncertainty in normalization (3%) and in 26Al
            half-life (5%).
