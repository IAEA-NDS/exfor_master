TITLE      Spectral function of p-n pairs in 6Li, from the
            6Li(p,p alpha)pn reaction at 200 MeV.
FACILITY   (MESON,1CANTMF) The TRIUMF facility.
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) 200-MeV proton beam about 80% polarized and
            periodically cycled between up and down polarization
            states.
SAMPLE     A 95.45 % enriched 6Li target of thickness 10.5 (1.0)
            mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   Protons and alpha-particles detected in coincidence
            by two telescopes coplanar with, and on opposite
            sides of, the beam.
           (COIN,SCIN,NAICR) Proton detected by system of 2
            plastic scintillators (each 0.63 cm thick) and a
            NaI(Tl) crystal (12.7-cm-diam x 15.2-cm-thick) 2
            meters from the target. One plastic detector provided
            time-of-flight information, the other, 1.4 cm ahead
            of the NaI detector, defined the 1.14 msr solid angle.
           (COIN,SOLST,SOLST) Alpha particles detected using
            telescope of two Si detectors (0.1 and 5 mm thick);
            solid angle of 1.22 msr defined by brass collimator.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE,TOF)
MONITOR    Beam intensity and polarization monitored using
            elastic scattering in CH-2 polarimeter of analyzing
            power 0.285, 11.5 m upstream from the target.
CORRECTION Corrected for random coincidences and events from the
            4.55% 7Li in the target (Random coincidences were
            always <4% of true coincidences except for most
            inelastic event sample for k = 1.53 1/fm (k is the
            momentum of each nucleon relative to Q = 0 of the p-n
            c.m.) where they were 14%.
           Events were subtracted from those in each proton
            energy bin to eliminate the remaining reaction tail
            from higher energy protons, as determined from the
            previously mentioned response function.
           A second correction was made to cover the events
            which should have appeared in that bin, but were
            lost through nuclear reactions in NaI.
           Counting losses due to dead time of electronics and
            data-acquisition computer were negligible (<0.1%).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty given.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 1.
           (APRVD) Approved by R.E. Warner, March 4, 1999.
