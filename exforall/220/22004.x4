TITLE      -NEUTRON YIELD FROM THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF
            CF-252(NU)
SAMPLE     .CF ON VYNS PLASTIC THICKNESS FROM 20 MICRO
            GRAMM PER SQUARE CENTIMETER ON INCLUDING A
            GOLD COATING.IN TOTAL 39 SOURCES WERE USED
            WITH A WIDE RANGE OF SOURCE THICKNESS, BACKING
            THICKNESS AND SCATTERING CONDITIONS IN ORDER
            TO RANDOMIZE THEIR INFLUENCE
METHOD     (MANGB) MAGNESE BATH FOR MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRON
            EMISSION RATE
           .FISSION COUNTING IN TWO 2PI SECTIONS INDIVIDUALLY
            AND IN COINCIDENCE

CORRECTION .FOR NEUTRON EMISSION MEASUREMENT
            - FOR FAST NEUTRON CAPTURE IN CHARGED PARTICLE REACTIO
            - FOR LEAKAGE
           .FOR FISSION FRAGMENT MEASUREMENT
            - BACKGROUND WAS ALWAYS ZERO
            - DEAD TIME
            - DECAY OF OTHER FISSILE ISOTOPES THAN CF-252
ERR-ANALYS .(ERR-T)FOR FISSION FRAGMENTS THE UNCERTAINTIES ARE
            STATISTICAL
            FOR THE MG-BATH MEASUREMENT THERE IS A
            SYSTEMATIC COMPONENT IN THE ERROR DUE TO THE
            DETERMINATION OF THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SOLUTION
             (0.05 PER CENT) AND DUE TO THE BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION
            A CORRELATED UNCERTAINTY IS DUE TO THE EFFICIENCY
            DETERMINATION OF THE MG-BATH(0.3 PER CENT)
