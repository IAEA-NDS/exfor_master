TITLE      -ACTIVATION CROSS SECTION AND ISOMERIC CROSS-SECTION
            RATIO FOR THE NB-93(N,A)Y-90M,G PROCESS.

INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO) DEUTERONS WERE ACCELERATED TO 3.0 - 8.0 MEV
            WITH A VARIABLE ENERGY COMPACT CYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 4.1 TO 10.6 MEV WERE
            PRODUCED WITH A DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET. THE MEAN NEUTRON
            FLUX DENSITIES RANGED BETWEEN 9.50E+06 AND 3.70E+07
            N/CM2SEC.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH-
            RESOLUTION GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY WAS USED TO MEASURE
            THE ACTIVITY FROM THE Y-90M AND Y-92M PRODUCTS.
           (CHSEP) THE Y-90G PRODUCT WAS RADIOCHEMICALLY SEPARATED
            AND THE BETA- ACTIVITY WAS COUNTED. THE CHEMICAL YIELD
            RANGED FROM 77 TO 94 PERCENT.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 35 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WAS USED FOR THE GAMMA
            MEASUREMENTS, WHILE BETA- RAY COUNTING WAS EMPLOYED
            FOR THE BETA EMITTER Y-90G. THE LATTER MEASUREMENT WAS
            STARTED ABOUT 30 HOURS AFTER THE END OF THE
            IRRADIATION, IN ORDER TO HAVE COMPLETE DECAY OF Y-90M.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)
           (26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG)
            THE CROSS SECTIONS FOR THESE REACTIONS WERE TAKEN FROM
            ENDF/B-V.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES CONSISTED OF ABOUT 5 G OF NIOBIUM POWDER
            (CHEMICAL PURITY GREATER THAN 99.5 PERCENT) PACKED IN
            A POLYETHYLENE TUBE, 1.1 CM DIAMETER AND 1.2 CM LONG.
            NICKEL AND IRON FOILS WERE PLACED IN FRONT AND AT THE
            BACK OF THE SAMPLE TO SERVE AS NEUTRON FLUX MONITORS.
            THE SAMPLES WERE GENERALLY PLACED AT ABOUT 0.6 CM FROM
            THE BACK OF THE GAS TARGET BEAM STOP. IRRADIATIONS
            WERE PERFORMED FOR 2.5 TO 3.0 HOURS.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR BACKGROUND NEUTRONS FROM
            THE TARGET CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL AND FROM THE D-D
            BREAKUP REACTION. THE GAMMA COUNT RATES WERE CORRECTED
            FOR SELF-ABSORPTION, PILEUP, COINCIDENCE LOSS,
            GEOMETRY, EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTOR AND GAMMA-RAY
            ABUNDANCE. CORRESPONDINGELY, THE BETA COUNT RATES WERE
            CORRECTED FOR CHEMICAL YIELD, ABSORPTION IN THE
            COUNTER WINDOW, FINITE-SIZE GEOMETRY AND EFFICIENCY OF
            THE DETECTOR.
