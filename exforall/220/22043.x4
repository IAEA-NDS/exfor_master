FACILITY   (VDG  ) HARWELL 6 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR,
            USED FOR IRRADIATION AT 2.7 MEV.
           (DYNAM) 3 MV DYNAMITRON ACCELERATOR, USED FOR
            IRRADIATIONS AT THE OTHER ENERGIES.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) FOR EN = 1.09 - 2.70 MEV.
           (D-D  ) FOR EN = 3.29 - 5.76 MEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) USED FOR X-RAY ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF
            THE IRRADIATED FOILS. CALIBRATED WITH CBNM
            STANDARDIZED NB-93-M SOLUTION.
           (FISCH) STANDARD PARALLEL-PLATE IONISATION CHAMBER,
            USED FOR NEUTRON FLUENCE MEASUREMENTS. THE MASS
            OF THE 95.1+/-0.5 MICRO-G DEPOSIT OF 99.94 PERCENT
            U-235 WAS DETERMINED BY ALPHA COUNTING.
