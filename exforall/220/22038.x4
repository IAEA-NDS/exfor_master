TITLE       Independent yields of Xe-133,135 in the fission of
            U-235,238 and Pu-239 by 14 MeV neutrons
AUTHOR     (P.Alexander)

FACILITY   (CCW,2GERMNZ) Cockroft-Walton accelerator at the
            Gutenberg University in Mainz.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A deuteron beam current of 4 milli-A at 550
            keV produced a 14 MeV neutron flux of 1.5E+11
            neutrons/cm2 on target. The samples was located
            5 mm from the tritium target. Irradiation time
            between 1 and 8 min.
METHOD     (CHSEP) The Xe gas fission products were separated
            by means of fast chemistry before gamma counting.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Two different Ge-Li detectors were used for
            gamma spectroscopy of the Xe fission products.
CORRECTION  No details given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Only rms error for repeated measurements.
            The total errors are estimated to be at minimum 10 to
            30%.
ANALYSIS    With the ISIS-2 fitting program,the experimental
            counting data were analysed. The program determines
            the parameters ZP and W (the FWHM value) which
            characterize the Gaussian charge distribution
