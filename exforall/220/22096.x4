TITLE      -DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR GAMMA-RAY PRODUCTION
            BY 14 MEV NEUTRONS WITH SEVERAL ELEMENTS IN STRUCTURAL
            MATERIALS.
AUTHOR     (I.MURATA,J.YAMAMOTO,A.TAKAHASHI)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNOSA)
FACILITY   (CCW) OKTAVIAN PULSED 14 MEV NEUTRON SOURCE FACILITY OF
            OSAKA UNIVERSITY. THE PULSE WIDTH WAS 3 NSEC AND THE
            REPETITION RATE WAS 2 MHZ.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 1.0E+03 NEUTRONS/PULSE WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBAR-
            DING A 10 CI TITANIUM-TRITIUM TARGET WITH DEUTERONS OF
            243 KEV.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO REDUCE THE
            BACKGROUND OF SCATTERED NEUTRONS FROM THE SAMPLE,
            ROOM-RETURNED NEUTRONS AND GAMMA-RAYS.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) A 180 CM3 GERMANIUM DETECTOR WAS USED TO MEA-
            SURE DISCRETE GAMMA-RAYS BETWEEN 500 AND 3000 KEV. THE
            DETECTOR WAS PLACED IN A SHIELD OF LEAD, PARAFFIN,
            CONCRETE ETC. AT A DISTANCE OF 150 CM FROM THE SAMPLE.
            THE DISTANCE FROM THE TARGET TO THE SAMPLES WAS 20 CM.
            SEVEN ANGLES FROM 30 TO 150 DEGREES IN THE LAB SYSTEM
            BETWEEN THE INCIDENT NEUTRONS AND THE EMITTED GAMMA-
            RAYS WERE MEASURED. THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS DETER-
            MINED USING SOURCES OF CS-137, CO-60, NA-22, NA-24,
            MN-56 AND NI-57.
           (NAICR) A SODIUM-IODODE CRYSTAL OF 12.7 CM DIAMETER AND
            12.7 CM IN LENGTH WAS USED TO MEASURE THE ENERGY DIS-
            TRIBUTIONS OF GAMMA-RAYS FROM 0.7 TO 10 MEV. THE DE-
            TECTOR WAS PLACED IN A HEAVY SHIELDING WITH A FLIGHT
            PATH OF 316 CM FROM THE SAMPLE. MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE
            AT 45 AND 125 OR 135 DEGREES. UNFOLDING OF THE SPECTRA
            WAS PERFORMED USING CALCULATED RESPONSE FUNCTIONS WITH
            THE COMPUTER CODE FERDOR.
           (SCIN) A NE 213 LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTOR, LOCATED
            AT A DISTANCE OF 4 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE IN THE
            DEUTERON BEAM DIRECTION, OPERATING IN TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            MODE WITH NEUTRON-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION, WAS USED TO
            MONITOR THE RELATIVE NEUTRON YIELD. ABSOLUTE CALIBRA-
            TION OF THIS DETECTOR WAS MADE BY MEASURING THE IN-
            DUCED ACTIVITIES IN IRRADIATED ALUMINUM AND NIOBIUM
            FOILS.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE THE NATURAL ELEMENTS CARBON, ALUMI-
            NUM, SILICON, CHROMIUM, IRON, NICKEL, COPPER AND
            MOLYBDENUM.
           .FOR THE DISCRETE GAMMA-RAY MEASUREMENTS THE SAMPLES
            WERE HOLLOW CYLINDERS OF 30 MM O.D. X 26 MM I.D. X
            70 MM LONG. FOR AL, THE WALL THICKNESS WAS 5 MM. THE
            SI SAMPLE WAS A 25 MM DIAMETER X 50 MM LONG CYLINDER.
            THE C SAMPLE WAS A HOLLOW CYLINDER OF 40 MM O.D. X
            15 MM I.D. X 50 MM LONG.
           .FOR THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION MEASUREMENTS THE SAMPLES
            WERE PURE ELEMENTAL DISCS OF 10 CM DIAMTER AND 5 MM
            THICK, EXCEPT FOR THE SI AND FE SAMPLES.
CORRECTION .DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM, NEUTRON
            MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND ATTENUATION IN THE SAMPLE AND
            FOR GAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE TOTAL ERRORS WERE COMPOSED OF THE
            FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTIONS. STATISTICAL ERRORS FOR INDI-
            VIDUAL DISCRETE GAMMA-RAY PEAKS, 1 TO 7 PERCENT. UN-
            CERTAINTIES IN THE PEAK EFFICIENCIES OF THE GE DETEC-
            TOR, 4.5 PERCENT BELOW 1.3 MEV AND 6.0 PERCENT ABOVE.
            THE ERRORS IN THE NEUTRON FLUX DETERMINATION WERE 7
            TO 10 PERCENT. IN THE CASE OF THE NAI MEASUREMENTS,
            ERRORS ACCORDING TO THE UNFOLDING ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
ANALYSIS   .ANGLE-INTEGRATED CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE DISCRETE
            GAMMA-RAYS WERE OBTAINED BY LEGENDRE POLYNOMIAL
            FITTING.
