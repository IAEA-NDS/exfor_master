TITLE      -NEUTRON CAPTURE IN THE 1.15 KEV RESONANCE OF FE-56
            USING MOXON-RAE DETECTORS.
AUTHOR     (F.CORVI,C.BASTIAN,K.WISSHAK)
INSTITUTE  (2ZZZGEL)
           (2GERKFK) K.W.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) THE GEEL 150 MEV LINAC WAS USED WITH
            THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS. ELECTRON ENERGY = 100 MEV,
            FREQUENCY = 100 HZ, PEAK CURRENT = 100 A, PULSE
            WIDTH = 1 NS, BEAM POWER = 1 KW.
INC-SOURCE .ROTARY URANIUM TARGET.
           .MODERATOR CONSISTING OF A 4 CM SLAB OF WATER CANNED
            IN BERYLLIUM. THE FLIGHT PATH WAS AT 9 DEG WITH
            RESPECT TO THE NORMAL TO THE MODERATOR FACE.
           .A 0.5 MM CADMIUM FILTER ABSOBED NEUTRONS FROM PRE-
            VIOUS CYCLES.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED SIMULTANEOUS WITH
            CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS USING A DOUBLE-GRIDDED IONIZA-
            TION CHAMBER PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CAPTURE SAMPLE.
           .THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS COLLIMATED DOWN TO 8 CM DIA-
            METER.
           .THE EXPERIMENT COVERED THE ENERGY RANGE 2 - 50000 EV.
METHOD     (TOF) A FLIGHT PATH OF 28.4 M WAS USED.
DETECTOR   (MOXR) THREE DIFFERENT MOXON-RAE DETECTORS WERE USED
            SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH BISMUTH, BISMUTH + CARBON, AND
            CARBON CONVERTERS, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE FIRST RUN,
            THE DETECTORS WERE PLACED AT 120 DEG WITH RESPECT TO
            THE NEUTRON BEAM DIRECTION. IN A SECOND RUN THE ANGLE
            WAS 90 DEG.
           (IOCH) THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY A
            DOUBLE-GRIDDED IONIZATION CHAMBER HAVING AT ITS CENTER
            A CATHODE WITH BACK-TO-BACK B-10 DEPOSITS 40 MICRO-
            GRAM/CM2 THICK. THE CHAMBER WAS OF THE CONTINOUS GAS
            FLOW TYPE, USING A MIXTURE OF 95 PER CENT ARGON AND
            5 PER CENT CARBON-DIOXIDE AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.
           (SCIN) A 0.5 MM THICK LI-GLASS DETECTOR WAS USED TO
            MAKE AN INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON FLUX.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G),,ARE) CAPTURE AT THE 4.91 EV RESONANCE,
            USING THE SATURATED RESONANCE METHOD.
SAMPLE     .A 19.47 GRAM, 8 CM DIAMETER BY 0.5 MM THICK METALLIC
            IRON SAMPLE, ENRICHED TO 99.87 PER CENT, WERE SAND-
            WICHED BETWEEN TWO GOLD FOILS OF THICKNESSES 20 AND
            30 MICROMETERS, RESPECTIVELY.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR
            A. THE DIFFERENCE IN NEUTRON FLUX AT 1152 AND 4.91 EV,
            B. THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAY
               SPECTRUM OF THE 1152 EV RESONANCE IN IRON,
            C. THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAY
               SPECTRUM OF THE 4.91 EV RESONANCE IN GOLD,
            D. THE VARIATION OF THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WITH
               GAMMA-RAY ENERGY FOR EACH CONVERTER MATERIAL,
            E. MULTIPLE SCATTERING,
            F. THE GAMMA-RAY SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLE.
            THE COMBINATION OF CORRECTIONS B, C AND D AMOUNTS TO
            0.883, 0.964 AND 1.076 FOR THE BI, BI + C AND C CON-
            VERTERS, RESPECTIVELY.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) AFTER SUBTRACTING THE BACKGROUND, THE DATA WERE
            ANALYSED WITH THE AREA CODE TACASI, USING GAMMA-GAMMA
            = 574 MILLI-EV, EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE = 326 K, AND
            EFFECTIVE SCATTERING RADIUS = 9 FM.
           .THE SHAPE OF THE GAUSSIAN RESOLUTION FUNCTION WAS
            VARIED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE BEST FITS.
