TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR AL-27(N,2N)AL-26
            (T1/2=7.16E+05YR) REACTION WITH ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE
            AROUND 14 MEV.

INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOH)
           (1USALRL) IRRADIATION SITE.
FACILITY   .RTNS-II, ROTATING TARGET NEUTRON SOURCE II AT
            LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A TI-T TARGET MOUNTED ON A 50 CM DIAMETER
            ROTATING TARGET WATER COOLED COPPER DISC. IRRADIATIONS
            WERE PERFORMED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION TECHNIQUES. THE MEASUREMENTS WERE
            PERFORMED AFTER ABOUT ONE YEAR OF COOLING TIME.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 70 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WAS USED FOR THE ACTI-
            VITY MEASUREMENTS. THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED AT A DIS-
            TANCE OF 20 MM FROM THE DETECTOR. THE MEASUREMENT
            TIMES WERE ABOUT 75 TO 120 HOURS. THE IRON DOSIMETRY
            FOILS WERE MEASURED IN THE SAME DETECTOR SYSTEM.
           (HPGE) THE ZIRCONIUM-NIOBIUM FOILS WERE MEASURED AT
            RTNS-II USING A 80 CM3 HIGH PURITY GERMANIUM DETECTOR
            IN 2 OR 3 DAYS AFTER TAKING OUT THE FOILS.
MONITOR    (26-FE-54(N,P)25-MN-54,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (25-MN-54,312.2D)
SAMPLE     .ALUMINIUM DISC SAMPLES OF 2 CM DIAMETER AND 0.5 CM
            THICKNESS WERE MACHINED FROM HIGH PURITY METAL INGOT.
            21 SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO 7 GROUPS BY THREE DISCS
            AND FIXED AT A DISTANCE OF 12 CM FROM THE SOURCE,
            COVERING ANGLES FROM 25 TO 85 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO
            THE INCIDENT DEUTERON BEAM. 21 IRON DOSIMETRY FOILS
            WERE PUT ON THE SURFACE OF EACH SAMPLE DISC TO
            EVALUATE THE NEUTRON FLUENCE. IN ADDITION, 7 SETS OF
            ZIRCONIUM-NIOBIUM FOILS WERE ATTACHED IN FRONT OF EACH
            SAMPLE SET TO MEASURE THE AVERAGE ENERGIES OF THE IN-
            CIDENT 14 MEV NEUTRONS.
           .THE AVERAGE NEUTRON FLUENCE WAS ABOUT 5.0E+16 N/CM2.
CORRECTION .DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR FLUCTUATIONS DURING IRRADI-
            ATION, BACKGROUND FROM SCATTERED NEUTRONS, SUM-COIN-
            CIDENCE LOSS EFFECTS, GAMMA-RAY SELF-ABSORPTION,
            FINITE SOLID ANGLE IN THE GAMMA-RAY MEASUREMENTS AND
            FOR THE EFFECT OF LARGE VARIATION OF THE ENERGY WIDTH
            OF THE SOURCE NEUTRONS WITH THE EMISSION ANGLE.
