INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Parallel plate ionization chamber (60 mm
            inner diam., 17 mm between electrode and the sample)
           (TELES,PROPC,CSICR) Proton recoil telescope consisted
            of two gas proportional counters and CsI(Tl)
            scintillator (1 mm thick, 3 cm diam.).
            The radiator had a thickness of 28.04 mg/cm2.
            The sensitivity of the telescope were experimentally
             determined in a separate experiment using the
             associated particle method.
           (SCIN) NE213 scintillation detector with neutron-
            gamma discrimination to observe parasitic neutrons,
            though no such neutrons were found.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Enriched (99.912%) 235U (25 mm diam., 94 ug/cm2 thick)
            prepared by electro-deposition on a Ptplate.
           Isotopic composition was determined by mass
            spectrometry at ORNL.

CORRECTION Corrected for
            - coincidence losses of recoil protons
            - fission counts extrapolation to zero pulse height
            - self-absorption of sample
            - interaction of recoiled protons
            - neutrons scattered by target material
            - neutrons scattered by chamber material
            - attenuation of source neutrons
