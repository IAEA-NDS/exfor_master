INC-SOURCE (D-T) MONO-ENERGETIC NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY THE
            T(D,N) REACTION, USING A TARGET WITH TRITIUM ABSORBED
            IN TITANIUM. DIFFERENT NEUTRON ENERGIES WAS OBTAINED
            BY ROTATING THE SAMPLE/DETECTORS AROUND THE TARGET
            FROM 0 TO 143 DEGREES.
METHOD     (REC)
DETECTOR    A FISSION CHAMBER AND A PROTON RECOIL COUNTER TELE-
            SCOPE WAS COUPLED IN A BACK-TO-BACK FORM FOR SIMUL-
            TANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF THE FISSION FRAGMENTS AND THE
            NEUTRON FLUENCE. BOTH DETECTORS HAD A CONTINOUS FLOW
            OF A GAS MIXTURE OF 95 PERCENT ARGON AND 5 PERCENT
            CARBON-DIOXIDE. THE ARRANGEMENT WAS PLACED WITH THE
            SAMPLE/RADIATOR AT A DISTANCE OF 15 CM FROM THE
            TARGET.
           (FISCH) THE FISSION CHAMBER WAS A PARALLELL PLATE
            IONIZATION CHAMBER WITH AN INNER DIAMETER OF 60 MM
            AND A DISTANCE OF 17 MM BETWEEN THE ELECTRODE AND THE
            SAMPLE.
           (TELES,PROPC,CSICR) THE PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE CON-
            SISTED OF TWO GAS PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AND A 1 MM
            THICK, 3 CM DIAMETER CSI(TL) SCINTILLATOR. COINCI-
            DENCES BETWEEN ALL THREE UNITS WERE REQUIRED. THE
            RADIATOR HAD A THICKNESS OF 28.04 MILLIGRAM/CM2.
            THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TELESCOPE WERE EXPERIMENTALLY
            DETERMINED IN A SEPARATE EXPERIMENT USING THE ASSOCI-
            ATED PARTICLE METHOD.
           (SCIN) A NE 213 SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH NEUTRON-
            GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS USED TO OBSERVE PARASITIC
            NEUTRONS. NO SUCH NEUTRONS WERE FOUND.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .THE U-235 SAMPLE, 25 MM IN DIAMETER AND 94 MICROGRAM/
            CM2, WAS PREPARED BY ELECTRO-DEPOSITION ON A PLATINUM
            PLATE. THE ISOTOPIC PURITY WAS 99.912 PERCENT, DETER-
            MINED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY AND BY USING THE PEAK-
            SEPARATION TECHNIQUE IN A MEASURED ALPHA SPECTRUM.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR COINCIDENCE LOSSES IN THE
            TELESCOPE, BACKGROUND WITHOUT RADIATOR, BACKGROUND
            FROM ROOM-SCATTERED NEUTRONS, THRESHOLD IN THE FISSION
            CHAMBER, SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE FISSION SAMPLE AND FOR
            NEUTRON ATTENUATION IN THE SAMPLE BACKING.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE TOTAL ERRORS ARE BETWEEN 2.5 AND 2.8
            PERCENT. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS ARE THE SAMPLE ASSAY
            (1.0 PERCENT), THE (N,P) SCATTERING CROSS SECTION AND
            ITS ANISOTROPY (1.2 PERCENT) AND THE FISSION COUNTING
            STATISTICS, INCLUDING EXTRAPOLATION AND BACKGROUND
            (1.0 TO 1.5 PERCENT).
