TITLE      -Experimental study on the 3P size resonance in the
            P-wawe neutron strength function
AUTHOR     (L.Koester,W.Waschkowski,J.Meier)
INSTITUTE  (2GERMUN)
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Several filters. Average energy of the filtered
            neutrons 143 KeV with a full half width of 20 KeV.
            80 per cent of all neutrons have energies between
            130 KeV and 151 KeV
DETECTOR   (BF3) (B-10)F3 counter in water shielding
PART-DET   (N)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) No explanation given for the uncertainties
                   on the cross sections values.
                   Errors on parameters of strength function
                   include error on cross section ,on other
                   parameters of calculation
ANALYSIS   .The average total scattering cross sections have
            been obtained from the measured total cross sections
            by substracting  the nonelastic or radiative capture
            cross section at 143 KeV.The best fit on the average
            scattering cross section provides the P wave strength
            function.
