SAMPLE     Samples were attached to the water cooled neutron
           target. Samples were sandwiched between two gold
           foils.
           Sample thickness: La - 2.60E-4 at/b, Au - 1.14E-4 at/b
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Li-6 glass detector to monitor neutron beam.
            Placed on the beam axis at 70 cm distance from the
            neutron source.
           (GE) Ge detector of 45 cm3 volume, 1.6keV energy
           resolution at 1.33 MeV was used to count the induced
           activities of the samples.
CORRECTION For gamma-ray self-absorption.
           For decay during irradiation including the time
           dependence of neutron yield.

             Uncertainty of extrapolation is not mentioned in the
             article.
ANALYSIS    Cross section value was derived by extrapolation of
            measured cross section at kT=25keV to 30 keV assuming
            temperature dependence proportional to 1/sqrt(k*T)
ADD-RES     In Table 3 there are "Adopted values" for other
            isotopes at kT=30 keV:
            Ba-138 - 3.96+-0.23 mb, Ce-140 - 10.82+-0.53 mb,
            Pr-141 - 119+-16 mb , Nd-142 - 46+-4 mb .
