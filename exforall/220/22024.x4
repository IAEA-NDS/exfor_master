TITLE       Measurement of fission cross section ratios of U-236,
             Np-237 and Am-243 relative to U-235 from 0.7 to 7 MeV

INC-SOURCE Continuous beams were used, except in the case of
            Am-243, where pulsed neutrons were used in order to
            reduce the uncertainty caused by subtracting the
            spontaneous fission counts of the impurity Cm-244.
           (P-T) Reaction with absorbed tritium-titanium targets
            were used to produce neutrons in the energy range
            0.7 - 3 MeV.
           (D-D) Reaction with a deuterium gas target was used
            to produce neutrons in the energy range 4.2 - 7 MeV.
INC-SPECT  Source neutron spectra were measured with tof by using
            a NE213 scintillation detector, placed at a distance
            of 14 m from the target in the 0 degree direction.
           Mean neutron energies and spreads at the sample
            position were then calculated by a Monte Carlo method.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A fission chamber of the parallel plate
            ionization type was used.
           The U-235 sample and another sample were mounted back
            to back in the chamber 2 cm from the collector
            electrode.
PART-DET   (FF)
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
SAMPLE     The sample materials were electrodeposited on 36 mm
            diameter by 0.3 or 0.4 mm thick platinum plates.
           The diameter of deposition was 25 mm.
           Isotopic composition and number of atoms were
            determined by measuring the alpha spectrum and
            activity.
           Details of the samples are given in Table 1 of NETU-47.
           During irradiations, the samples were placed
            perpendicular to the beam at a distance of 5 to 10 cm
            from the target.
CORRECTION The cross section ratios were corrected for events
            caused by room-scattered neutrons.
           Corrections due to the pulse-height discrimination
            were made by extrapolating to zero pulse-height,
            using a Gaussian function.
           Corrections were also applied for self-absorption of
            fission fragments in the samples, as well as for
            fission induced by low energy neutrons.
           Contributions from impurities in the samples,
            especially the spontaneous fission of Cm-244 present
            in the Am-243 sample, were also corrected for.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors on cross section ratios were
            determined in a covariance analysis of the
            experimental data.
STATUS     Data were taken from NETU-47,1986.
