            isomeric fission of Pu-240.

SAMPLE     The Pu-240 fission isomers were produced by the
           reaction U-238(alpha,2n) using a 25 MeV alpha beam from
           Munich MP tandem accelerator 50 micro-g/cm2 U-238,
           evaporated on 20 micro-g/cm2 carbon.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The U-238 sample was located in a 4 mm diameter
            hole of a 4 cm2 surface barrier annular detector. The
            recoil nuclei fission in flight in front of two addi-
            tional surface barrier detectors, placed at about 50
            degrees with respect to the beam axis. The detectors
            were calibrated with a Cf-252 source.
PART-DET   (FF)    Fission fragments.
CORRECTION  Corrections were applied for Doppler effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given include an estimate for
            systematic errors due to uncertainties in the calib-
            ration procedure.
COMMENT     Relative mass yields and average kinetic energy versus
            fragment mass, are given in figure.
