TITLE      -SPECTRUM-AVERAGED NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS MEASURED
            IN THE U-235 FISSION NEUTRON FIELD IN MOL.
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) REACTOR BR1 AT MOL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) THERMAL FISSION IN U-235.
INC-SPECT  .PERTURBED U-235 FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE DISK-SHAPED, HIGH PURITY METALLIC
            FOILS, 10 MM IN DIAMETER AND BETWEEN .125 AND .5 MM
            THICK.
           .THE SAMPLES WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO FOILS OF NI
            OR IN, AND SEVERAL SANDWICHES WERE STACKED TOGETHER
            TO A MAXIMUM THICKNESS OF 4 MM DURING IRRADIATIONS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) TWO DIFFERENT GE(LI) DETECTOR SYSTEMS WERE
            USED, ONE IN MOL FOR SHORT-LIVED PRODUCTS AND THE
            OTHER AT PTB FOR PRODUCTS WITH LONGER HALF-LIVES.

COMMENT    .A U-235 DOUBLE FISSION CHAMBER WAS USED TO MONITOR
            THE FLUENCE RATE OF THERMAL NEUTRONS IN THE REACTOR
            DURING IRRADIATIONS.

CORRECTION .THE REACTION RATES WERE CORRECTED FOR STRUCTURAL
            MATERIAL PERTURBATIONS IN THE FISSION NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM BY PERFORMING ONE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSPORT
            CALCULATIONS. THESE CALCULATIONS MADE USE OF
            ENDF/B-IV CROSS SECTIONS IN A 171 GROUP STRUCTURE
            /VITAMIN-C/.
           .CORRECTIONS WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR BACKSCATTERING OF
            NEUTRONS FROM THE IRRADIATION CAVITY WALLS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) THE TOTAL ERRORS ARE COMPOSED OF-
            COUNTING STATISTICS
            ERROR IN THE SCATTERING CORRECTION
            ERROR IN THE RELATIVE PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY
