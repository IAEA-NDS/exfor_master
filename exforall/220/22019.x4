TITLE      -RECENT EXPERIMENTS ON CF-252 SPECTRUM-AVERAGED
            NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS.
FACILITY   .NONE.
INC-SOURCE (CF252) CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION NEUTRON
            SOURCE, ENCAPSULATED IN A DOUBLE ZIRCALOY
            CYLINDER WITH OUTER DIMENSIONS OF 10 MM IN
            DIAMETER AND 10 MM IN HEIGHT. THE WALL
            THICKNESS OF THE CYLINDER WAS 1.5 MM.
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE STRENGTH WAS APPROXIMATELY
            4.7E+09 N/SEC ON APRIL 1, 1982.
INC-SPECT  .CF-252 NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .HIGH PURITY METALLIC DISKS, 10 MM IN DIAMETER AND
            .125 - .5 MM THICK.
           .POWDERS (CU-O, I2-O5, HG-O) WERE PRESSED IN LUCITE
            CYLINDERS WITH INNER DIAMETER 10 MM AND LENGTH .8 MM.
            WALL THICKNESSES WERE .2 MM AT THE FRONT AND REAR
            PLANE AND 1. MM AT THE ENVELOPE.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE IRRADIATIONS WERE PERFORMED  USING THE
            SANDWICH METHOD, I.E. EACH SAMPLE WAS PLACED
            BETWEEN TWO FOILS ACTING AS NEUTRON FLUX
            DENSITY MONITORS.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) LARGE VOLUME (130 CM3) GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH
            A NOMINAL EFFICIENCY OF 28 PERC.
