TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF HELIUM PRODUCTION CROSS SECTION
            OF ALUMINIUM FOR 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS.

FACILITY   .JAERI D-T NEUTRON GENERATOR, FNS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) DEUTERONS ON TRITIUM.
METHOD     .HELIUM ACCUMULATION METHOD. THE IRRADIATED SAMPLES
            WERE EVAPORATED IN AN ELECTRIC FURNACE TO RELEASE
            HE ATOMS ACCUMULATED IN IT DURING NEUTRON BOMBARDMENT.
            THE GAS RELEASED WAS ANALYSED WITH A QUADRUPOLE MASS
            SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   .QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER. THE APPARATUS WAS CALI-
            BRATED BY USING HE-ION IMPLANTED AL DISKS WHICH WERE
            PREPARED WITH A SMALL ACCELERATOR.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) TO OBTAIN THE HE PRO-
            DUCTION CROSS SECTION, THE (N,A)-ACTIVATION
            CROSS SECTION WAS USED AS A STANDARD. THE RESIDUAL
            ACTIVITY OF THE SAMPLES WERE MEASURED WITH AN
            ABSOLUTELY CALIBRATED GELI DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     .DISKS OF 10 MM DIAMETER BY 0.5 MM THICK ALUMINIUM
            WITH A CHEMICAL PURITY OF 99.99 PERCENT. THE SAMPLES
            WERE ASSEMBLED AS A SANDWICH AND WRAPPED WITH THIN
            AL FOIL TO EXCLUDE ALPHA-PARTICLE LOSS FROM THEM.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS GIVEN ARE ESTIMATES FROM STATIS-
            TICAL AND SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM MAIN REFERENCE.
