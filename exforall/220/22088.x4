TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTION FOR SM, GD
            AND DY IN THE THERMAL ENERGY REGION.

           (2JPNJPN) CENTURY RESEARCH CENTER CORPORATION, TOKYO,
            H.K.
FACILITY   (REAC) TRIGA-II, 100 KW REACTOR AT MUSASHI.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM THE REACTOR, FILTERED
            THROUGH A 30 CM LONG NEARLY PERFECT SINGLE CRYSTAL
            SILICON ROD. BEAM BURSTS OF 275 MICROSEC LENGTH (FWHM)
            WAS OBTAINED BY A BORON-NITRIDE CHOPPER, 12 CM IN DIA-
            METER AND 12 CM HIGH, HAVING NINE SLITS OF 0.4 CM X
            7.0 CM. THE ROTATION FREQUENCY WAS 2000 RPM. THE
            NEUTRON BEAM WAS COLLIMATED TO 4 CM DIAMETER. THE
            ENERGY RESOLUTION WAS 18 PERCENT AT 0.0253 EV.
INC-SPECT  .SILICON FILTERED THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
METHOD     (TOF) TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT USING TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            TECHNIQUES WITH A FLIGHT PATH OF 6.77 M.
DETECTOR   (BF3) THREE BORON-TRIFLOURIDE COUNTERS WERE SET AT THE
            END OF THE FLIGHT PATH.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES OF 99.9 PERCENT PURITY SM2O3, GD2O3 AND DY2O3
            WERE USED. THE OXIDE POWDER WAS DILUTED WITH AL METAL
            POWDER OF 99.98 PERCENT PURITY. THE SAMPLE HOLDER WAS
            A CYLINDER, 64MM IN DIAMETER AND 20 MM THICK, MADE OF
            ALUMINUM. THE DENSITY OF THE SAMPLES WAS ADJUSTED TO
            GIVE 20 PERCENT TRANSMISSION.
           .THE BACKGROUND WAS MEASURED BY COVERING THE SAMPLES
            WITH A CADMIUM PLATE OF 1.3 MM THICKNESS.
CORRECTION .THE TRANSMITTED SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR MEASURING
            TIME, NUMBER OF CHOPPER ROTATIONS, THE MONITORED
            REACTOR POWER AND THE BACKGROUND NEUTRON COUNTS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE TOTAL ERRORS WERE COMPOSED OF THE
            FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTIONS. DENSITY OF THE SAMPLE, THICK-
            NESS OF THE SAMPLE, STATISTICAL ERROR OF SIGNAL AND
            MONITOR NEUTRON COUNTING.
ANALYSIS   .TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED BY DIVIDING THE
            OPEN BEAM SPECTRUM BY THE TRANSMITTED NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM.
STATUS     .DATA WERE TAKEN FROM THE MAIN REF.
