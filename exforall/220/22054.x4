TITLE      -RELATIVE YIELDS OF SOME GAMMA-RAY EMITTING NUCLIDES
            FROM THERMAL NEUTRON FISSION OF U-235.
AUTHOR     (K.DEBERTIN)
INSTITUTE  (2GERPTB)
FACILITY   (REAC ) FORSCHUNGS- UND MESSREAKTOR FMRB, BRAUN-
            SCHWEIG, AND FORSCHUNGSREAKTOR FR2, KARLSRUHE.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL REACTOR SPECTRUM. FLUX DENSITIES WERE
            BETWEEN 0.02E+12 AND 70.0E+12 NEUTRONS/CM2 SEC.
METHOD     .DIRECT GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRIC METHODS.
            SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF ACTIVITIES FROM SEVERAL
            FISSION PRODUCTS. CALIBRATION WITH STANDARD SOURCES
            OF THE SAME NUCLIDES.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GELI SPECTROMETER, WITH 2.8 KEV RESOLUTION
            AT 1333 KEV. DISTANCE BETWEEN SAMPLE AND DETECTOR
            WAS 10 TO 90 CM, DEPENDING ON ACTIVITY.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F)58-CE-144,CUM,FY,,SPA)
DECAY-MON  (58-CE-144,284.D,DG,134.)
SAMPLE     .PLATE SECTIONS OF MTR-FUEL ELEMENTS. MEASURMENTS
            WERE PERFORMED ON AN INTERMEDIATE LAYER WITH THE
            DIMENSIONS 40 * 20 * 0.6 MM, CONTAINING A URANIUM
            ALUMINIUM ALLOY WITH ABOUT 300 MILLI-G URANIUM,
            ENRICHED TO 90 PER CENT U-235. IRRADIATION TIMES
            WERE BETWEEN 40 SEC AND 109 DAYS.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR SELF ABSORPTION AND
            MEASURING GEOMETRY.
           .A SMALL CORRECTION DUE TO FAST FISSION YIELDS
            WERE APPLIED FOR RU-106.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE QUOTED UNCERTAINTIES CORRESPOND TO
            A CONFIDENCE LEVEL OF 68 PER CENT.
ANALYSIS   .THE GIVEN VALUES ARE AVERAGES OF SEVERAL MEASURE-
            MENTS.
COMMENT    .MONITOR DATA TAKEN FROM E.A.C. CROUCH, VALUES
            RECOMMENDED BY THE CHEMICAL NUCLEAR DATA COMMITTEE,
            U.K.A.E.A., TO BE PUBLISHED.
