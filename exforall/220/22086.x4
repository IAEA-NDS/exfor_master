TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE 1.15 KEV
            RESONANCE IN FE-56 BY PROMPT GAMMA-RAY DETECTION.
AUTHOR     (D.B.GAYTHER,J.E.JOLLY,R.B.THOM)
INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
           (2UK WIN) R.B.T.
FACILITY   (LINAC) HARWELL ELECTRON LINAC HELIOS. PULSE LENGTHS OF
            10 - 40 NS.
INC-SOURCE .FAST NEUTRON TARGET AT HELIOS LINAC.
INC-SPECT  .WHITE SPECTRUM. 2.4 EV - 120 KEV MEASURED.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME-OF-FLIGHT WITH A 42 M EVACUATED FLIGHT PATH.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) TWO 0.4 L CELLS OF C6D6, MOUNTED ON PHOTOMULTI-
            PLIER TUBES WITH QUARTZ WINDOWS, PLACED ON EITHER
            SIDE OF THE CAPTURE SAMPLE. THE CELLS CONSISTED OF
            THIN-WALLED BERYLLIUM CYLINDERS WITH QUARTZ WINDOWS.
            THE DETECTOR RESPONSE WAS CALIBRATED WITH STANDARD
            SOURCES UP TO 2.6 MEV AND WITH THE REACTION
            F-19(P,AG)O-16 FOR THE ENERGIES 6.13, 6.92 AND 7.12
            MEV. THE COMPUTER CODE EGS4 WAS ALSO USED FOR DE-
            TECTOR RESPONSE CALCULATIONS.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G),,WID) AT THE 4.9 EV
            RESONANCE.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE WAS AN 80 MM DISC PLACED NORMAL TO THE
            INCIDENT NEUTRON BEAM AND CONTAINED IN AN EVACUATED
            FLIGHT TUBE MADE OF THIN-WALLED CARBON FIBRE. THE
            SAMPLE CONSISTED OF LAMINATED IRON AND GOLD SHEETS
            IN THE FORM 0.3 MM FE - 25 MICROMETER AU - 0.3 MM FE.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
COMMENT    .THE RATIO OF THE CAPTURE AREA FOR THE 22.8/1.15 KEV
            RESONANCES IN FE WAS ALSO GIVEN, 2.55 +/- 0.16.
