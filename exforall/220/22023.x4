COMMENT    .THE SAMPLES WERE ARRANGED IN A COMPACT SEMISPHERICAL
            GEOMETRY. THE ARRANGEMENT COULD BE DIVIDED INTO THREE
            ANGULAR RANGES, CORRESPONDING TO THREE DIFFERENT
            NEUTRON ENERGIES.
ADD-RES    .RATIO OF HE-3 TO H-3 CROSS SECTIONS ARE GIVEN (GRAPH).
STATUS     .DATA WERE TAKEN FROM MAIN REF.
HISTORY    (861106C)  NO.
