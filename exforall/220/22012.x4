INC-SOURCE (A-BE) Neutrons in the energy range 6.3 to 8.3 MeV
            were produced via the Be-9(alpha,n) reaction, using
            1.86 to 2.76 MeV 200 uAmp alpha beams upon 0.52 um
            thick Be-layers on high-pressure water-cooled copper
            backings.
INC-SPECT   Two monoenergetic neutron groups were present, but
            the lower were always below the thresholds of the
            reactions studied.
SAMPLE      Pure Al samples with 36 mm diameter and 20 mm
            thickness.
METHOD     (ACTIV) For the short-lived Na-24-m product, a cyclic
            milli-second pulsed irradiation-activity measurement
            technique was utilized.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 40 cm3 Ge-Li detector were used for
            activity measurements.
           (SCIN ) A 5 cm diameter by 5 cm thick NE213 liquid
            scintillator with n-gamma discrimination,
            positioned at 90 degrees with respect to the neutron
            beam direction, was used for neutron flux
            measurements. The efficiency of this detector,
            with a threshold of 2.9 MeV, was determined to
            be 16.5% in the enrgy region considered.
CORRECTION  Corrections were applied for neutron attenuation
            and gamma self-absorption in the samples.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors, composed of systematic and
            statistical errors.
           (ERR-1) -error in detector efficiency            6%
           (ERR-2) -error in discriminator level            5%
           (ERR-3) -error in attenuation correction         3%
           (ERR-4) -geometry                                2%
           (ERR-5) -conversion of flux from 90 to 0 deg.    5%
