TITLE       Independent isomeric yield ratio of Pm-148 in the
            thermal-neutron induced fission of U-233
AUTHOR     (H.Umezawa)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNJAE)
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) JRR-3 reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Graphite reflector region used.
INC-SPECT   Well thermalized neutrons. Cadmium ratio for gold
            activation was 200. Thermal neutron flux was
            2.0 x 10**11 neutrons/cm2/sec.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical techniques.
           (ACTIV) Activity measurement of the fission products.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 50 cm3 GeLi detector. Resolution 2.4 keV at
            1332 keV. Shielded with lead of thickness 100 mm.
            The photopeak efficiency was determined with cali-
            brated sources of Co-57, Co-60, Cs-134, Eu-155 and
            Au-198.
PART-DET   (DG)
SAMPLE      20 milli-g of U-233 as uranium-oxide, wrapped in a
            piece of copper foil.
            100 milli-g of neodymium-oxide (96.16% Nd-146),
            used for correction for neutron capture in Pm-147.
            The samples, together with a cobalt flux monitor,
            were irradiated for 50 hours.
CORRECTION  Corrections were applied for the sizable neutron
            capture cross section of Pm-147.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The quoted errors include statistical
            counting errors, scattering among the repeated
            counting data, discrepancy between duplicate runs
            and an uncertainty of 20% in the amount of
            formation via neutron capture.
COMMENT     The thermal neutron flux was measured with a cobalt
            monitor.
