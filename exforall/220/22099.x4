TITLE      -Neutron capture cross section of Au-197 - a standard
            for stellar nucleosynthesis.
AUTHOR     (W.Ratynski,F.Kaeppeler)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) A Van de Graaff accelerator delivered a
            beam of 1912 keV protons. The accelerator was operated
            in a dc mode during irradiations and in pulsed mode
            when obtaining the neutron energy spectrum with time-
            of-flight. The beam current had a density of less than
            1 microamp/mm2.
CRITIQUE   .Although the term 'Maxwellian spectrum' is used
            throughout the paper this is understood in a stellar
            context, the actual average cross section (<sigma>kT)
            being defined as the averaged reaction rate (cross
            section multiplied by velocity) divided by the mean
            thermal velocity (vT) within the stellar plasma of
            thermal energy kT :
               <sigma>kT  = <sigma x velocity>/ vT
            using the accepted Maxwell velocity distribution
            formula the term vT can easily be shown to be
            (2kT/m)**0.5, m being the reduced mass. This is equi-
            valent to folding the cross section with an energy
            spectrum proportional to a Maxwellian distribution
            times velocity (E(n) x exp(-E(n)/kT)) with a normal-
            isation factor of 2/(Pi)**0.5, instead of a true
            Maxwellian (E(n)**0.5 x exp(-E(n)/kT)). it is this
            former spectrum that is reproduced experimentally
            using the p-Li7 source, and the resulting average
            cross section without the 2/(Pi)**0.5 factor appears
            in the data table.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Metallic Li-7 target with a thickness of 100
            keV and diameters of 3 - 6 mm, on a backing consisting
            of 1, 0.7 or 0.5 mm copper or 0.2 mm silver.
INC-SPECT  .Near Maxwellian spectrum with kT = 25.0 +/- 0.5 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV,TOF) Activation of both gold and beryllium. By
            choosing the proton energy to 1912 keV, a kinematic
            collimation of 120 degrees was obtained, and the
            activation of the target and the sample was thus
            directly related.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A Li-6 glass detector was used for determining
            the neutron spectrum and proton energy by time-of-
            flight.
           (HPGE) A coaxial high purity germanium detector with a
            peak to compton ratio of 32 and an energy resolution
            of 1.7 keV at 1.33 MeV was used for measuring the
            activities from gold and beryllium. The detector was
            carefully efficiency calibrated with a set of
            standard sources. The samples were positioned 76 mm
            from the detector and typical counting times were
            16 - 24 hours for gold and 1 - 2 hours for beryllium.

SAMPLE     .Homogeneous spherical segments of gold, having dia-
            meters of about 1 cm and thicknesses of 0.02 and 0.05
            mm, covering the solid angle of neutron emission,
            ensured that the sample appeared equally thick to
            all neutrons. The thicknesses and homogeneities were
            carefully determined by several methods.
           .Two cylindrical gold samples were placed to cover the
            remaining part of the solid angle in order to monitor
            background neutrons from scattering.
           .The samples were irradiated for 1 to 4 hours.
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for scattered background
            neutrons, beryllium losses, time variation of neutron
            flux during irradiations. The activity measurements
            were corrected for the extended sources and the self
            absorption.
           The measured cross section is multiplied by 557/568 to
           take into account the contribution of neutrons higher
           than 110 keV (upper boundary of the neutron energy
           obtained at the neutron source used). The correction
           factor was determined based on the differential cross
           section of Macklin (priv.comm.)
