FACILITY   (VDG) A 4 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR WAS USED FOR
            PRODUCING NEUTRONS OF ENERGIES IN THE RANGE 5 - 19.9
            MEV.
           (CCW) A COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR WAS USED FOR PRO-
            DUCING NEUTRONS OF 14.6 MEV ENERGY.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) THE TRITIUM TARGET WAS ABSORBED IN A 0.4 MG/CM2
            THICK TITANIUM LAYER, EVAPORATED ON A 0.25 MM THICK
            COPPER BACKING. THIS TARGET WAS USED TO PRODUCE
            NEUTRONS FROM 14.6 TO 19.9 MEV.
           (D-D) A SIMILAR DEUTERIUM TARGET WAS USED TO PRODUCE
            5 MEV NEUTRONS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) THE ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED WITH A CALIBRATED
            PURE GERMANIUM DETECTOR, OR BY
           (D4PI) A 4PI-BETA-GAMMA SPECTROMETER.
SAMPLE     .ALUMINIUM FOILS OF PURITY EXCEEDING 99.99 PERCENT AND
            WITH THICKNESSES RANGING FROM 0.05 TO 0.5 MM WITH THE
            DIAMETER 25.4 MM WERE USED. THE SAMPLES WERE
            IRRADIATED FOR ABOUT 30 MIN WITH A DEUTERIUM BEAM
            CURRENT OF 3 - 10 MICROAMPS. FOR THE MEASUREMENTS AT
            14.6 MEV THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED AT AN ANGLE OF 45
            DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEUTERON BEAM, WHILE AT
            THE OTHER ENERGIES THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED AT 0
            DEGREES. THE DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE TO THE SAMPLES
            WAS 50 TO 100 MM.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE
            D+D NEUTRONS IN THE D+T NEUTRON FIELD, AND FOR BACK-
            GROUND NEUTRONS FROM THE TARGET ASSEMBLY AND THE ROOM.
