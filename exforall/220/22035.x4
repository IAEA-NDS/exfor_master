INC-SOURCE (D-T) 3 mg/cm2 T-Ti layer supported by a 4 cm *0.3 mm
            silver sheet cooled by a thin waterfilm.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Each irradiated sample was heated in the
            presence of 30 ml H2-carrier. Then the carrier gas and
            tritium were pumped out,collecting in a gas tube which
            was filled with methane to 10**13 hPa and subjected
            to gas phase anticoincidence beta- counting.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Proton recoil telescope for the fluence.
            A gas counter was used.The efficiency was 68.2%

SAMPLE      Two sets of eleven beryllium samples each were
            irradiated.They were metallic discs (diam=2cm)from
            material of purity between 99.5 and 99.8 per cent
            and sandwiched between 2 aluminium sheets.

INC-SPECT   En-mean represents the average energy of the neutron
            spectrum seen by each sample.Its uncertainty is
            estimated to be 30 keV. EN-RSL-FW means full
            width of the neutron spectrum.
