TITLE       Absolute yields of Mo-99 in the thermal neutron-
            induced fission of U-233 and Pu-239

FACILITY   (REAC,2SWTWUR) Diorit reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal reactor with additional D2O moderators.
INC-SPECT  .Thermal neutrons. Irradiation times 70 - 80 hours.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Chemical separation.
           (ACTIV) Measurement of the gamma and beta activi-
            ties from the fission products.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) Calibrated NaI and GeLi detectors
            used for gamma counting.
           (PROPC) Proportional counter for beta measurements.
           .No information given on how fission rates were
            determined.

SAMPLE      No information given.
CORRECTION  The activities were corrected for chemical yield,
            detector efficiencies and decay properties of
            Mo-99. for the proportional counter, corrections
            for self-absorption were also applied.
            The fission rates were corrected for counting
            efficiency and counting losses.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors were calculated on the basis of
            the spread of the individual measurements and on the
           (ERR-SYS) systematic error in the decay schemes
COMMENT    Authors believe that the main source of systematic
           errors lies in uncertainties of the decay schemes.
ANALYSIS    The given values were calculated as mean values
            of several measurements with the three different
            detectors mentioned.
