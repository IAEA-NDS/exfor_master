TITLE      -ABSOLUTE YIELDS OF MO-99 IN THE THERMAL NEUTRON-
            INDUCED FISSION OF U-233 AND PU-239.

INSTITUTE  (2SWTUBE) C.E., H.R.G.
           (2SWTWUR) H.R.G, A.S., H.S.P.
FACILITY   (REAC ) DIORIT REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL REACTOR WITH ADDITIONAL D2O MODE-
            RATORS.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRONS. IRRADIATION TIMES 70 - 80 HOURS.
METHOD     (CHSEP) CHEMICAL SEPARATION.
           (ACTIV) MEASUREMENT OF THE GAMMA AND BETA ACTIVI-
            TIES FROM THE FISSION PRODUCTS.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) CALIBRATED NAI AND GELI DETECTORS USED FOR
           (GELI ) GAMMA COUNTING.
           (PROPC) PROPORTIONAL COUNTER FOR BETA MEASUREMENTS.
           .NO INFORMATION GIVEN ON HOW FISSION RATES WERE
            DETERMINED.

SAMPLE     .NO INFORMATION GIVEN.
CORRECTION .THE ACTIVITIES WERE CORRECTED FOR CHEMICAL YIELD,
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES AND DECAY PROPERTIES OF
            MO-99. FOR THE PROPORTIONAL COUNTER, CORRECTIONS
            FOR SELF-ABSORPTION WERE ALSO APPLIED.
           .THE FISSION RATES WERE CORRECTED FOR COUNTING
            EFFICIENCY AND COUNTING LOSSES.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS QUOTED CORRESPOND TO ONE
            STANDARD DEVIATION, AND INCLUDE A SYSTEMATIC
            ERROR OF 2 PER-CENT.
ANALYSIS   .THE GIVEN VALUES WERE CALCULATED AS MEAN VALUES
            OF SEVERAL MEASUREMENTS WITH THE THREE DIFFERENT
            DETECTORS MENTIONED.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM MAIN REFERENCE.
