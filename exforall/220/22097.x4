TITLE       NU(m*) measurements for U-233 and U-235(n-th,f)
            reactions
AUTHOR     (Y.Nakagome,I.Kanno,I.Kimura)
REFERENCE  (C,88MITO,,743,1988) Main reference. same data for
             U-233 are presented in following publications:
           (J,NST,25,111,1988) Data only for U-233 (tbl.2).

            and full description of Double-energy double-velocity
            measurement system for fission fragments
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO) Y.Nakagome, I.Kimura, experimental site
           (2JPNJAE) I.Kanno.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO) Kyoto University reactor, KUR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutrons from a super mirror neutron
            guide tube facility. The neutrons were guided through
            the facility to a distance of 11.7 m from the reactor
            core, and then collimated to 1cm * 7 cm by a beam slit
            made of LiF. The neutron flux was 5.0E+07 n/cm2/sec.
INC-SPECT  .Thermal neutron spectrum.
METHOD     (TOF) The fission fragment velocities were detected by
            time-of-flight in two opposite directions with flight
            paths of 59 cm, while the fragment energies were
            determined with Si detectors.  ( Double-energy double-
            velocity measurement system for fission fragments was
            used.) The resolution of TOF measurement system (about
            133 ps).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two 20 microgram/cm2 NE-102A plastic scin-
            tillator film detectors, coupled via Lucite light
            guides to photomultiplier tubes, were used as start
            detectors for the time-of-flight. The scintillators
            were placed at a distance of 3 cm from the uranium
            target.
           (SIBAR) On each end of the flight tubes, three silicon
            surface barrier detectors (SSB) were mounted to detect
            the stop time and also to measure the fragment kinetic
            energy. Energy calibration was performed by using a
            spontaneous fission fragments of 252 Cf. The energy
            resolution of the SSB (about 78 keV)
SAMPLE     .The uranium targets were made from very thin nitro-
            cellulose films in which organic uranium compounds
            were dissolved. The diameter of the targets were 8 mm
            and the thicknesses were 7 and 9 microgram/cm2 for
            U-233 and U-235, respectively. The enrichments were
            99.47 and 90% for the two isotopes, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors concerning fragment masses, kinetic
            energies and velocities for both the light and heavy
            fragments (information from NST,25,111).
