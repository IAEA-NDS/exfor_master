FACILITY   (REAC) KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR, KUR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM A SUPER MIRROR NEUTRON
            GUIDE TUBE FACILITY. THE NEUTRONS WERE GUIDED THROUGH
            THE FACILITY TO A DISTANCE OF 11.7 M FROM THE REACTOR
            CORE, AND THEN COLLIMATED TO 1CM X 7 CM BY A BEAM SLIT
            MADE OF LIF. THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS 5.0E+07 N/CM2SEC.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
METHOD     (TOF) THE FISSION FRAGMENT VELOCITIES WERE DETECTED BY
            TIME-OF-FLIGHT IN TWO OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WITH FLIGHT
            PATHS OF 59 CM, WHILE THE FRAGMENT ENERGIES WERE DE-
            TERMINED WITH SI DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) TWO 20 MICROGRAM/CM2 NE 102A PLASTIC SCIN-
            TILLATOR FILM DETECTORS, COUPLED VIA LUCITE LIGHT
            GUIDES TO PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES, WERE USED AS START
            DETECTORS FOR THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT. THE SCINTILLATORS
            WERE PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF 3 CM FROM THE URANIUM
            TARGET.
           (SOLST) ON EACH END OF THE FLIGHT TUBES, THREE SILICON
            SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS WERE MOUNTED TO DETECT THE
            STOP TIME AND ALSO TO MEASURE THE FRAGMENT KINETIC
            ENERGY. ENERGY CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED USING A
            CF-252 FISSION SOURCE.
SAMPLE     .THE URANIUM TARGETS WERE MADE FROM VERY THIN NITRO-
            CELLULOSE FILMS IN WHICH ORGANIC URANIUM COMPOUNDS
            WERE DISSOLVED. THE DIAMETER OF THE TARGETS WERE 8 MM
            AND THE THICKNESSES WERE 7 AND 9 MICROGRAM/CM2 FOR
            U-233 AND U-235, RESPECTIVELY. THE ENRICHMENTS WERE
            99.47 AND 90 PERCENT FOR THE TWO ISOTOPES, RESPEC-
            TIVELY.
