TITLE      -Cumulative yields of Te-131-m and Te-133-m in the
            fission of U-235.
AUTHOR     (H.Braun,H.O.Denschlag)
INSTITUTE  (2GERMNZ)
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMNZ) TRIGA reactor in Mainz.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .Thermal reactor spectrum. Neutron flux was
            7.0 x 10.**11 neutrons/cm2/sec.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation.  After irradiation
            the solutions were kept for a time longer than 90 min
            for Te-133m and than 6 hours for Te-131m for the
            decay of the precursors.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GeLi detector used for gamma ray activity
            measurements.

SAMPLE     .Aqueous solutions of uranyl nitrate. Irradiation
            time was 30 min.
CORRECTION .A number of smaller corrections were applied for the
            calculation of the absolute cumulative yields of
            Te-131m and Te-133m to take into account:
            -growth and decay in chain 133 during irradiation
             time.
            -Small contamination (2%) of the tellurium
             fraction by iodine.
            -Small account of Te-133g formed independently or via
             the decay of Sb-133 that had not decayed completely
             at the moment of the first separation of iodine.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
ANALYSIS   .Absolute yields were obtained by comparison with
            the cumulative yield of Ba-140. Given data are
            averages of all experimental values.
