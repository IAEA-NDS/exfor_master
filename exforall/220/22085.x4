TITLE      -A MEASUREMENT OF THE NB-93(N,INL)NB-93-M CROSS-SECTION
            IN THE ENERGY RANGE 1 TO 6 MEV.

FACILITY   (VDG) HARWELL 5 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR, USED AT
            2.7 MEV NEUTRON ENERGY.
           (DYNAM) 3 MV DYNAMITRON OF BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY
            RADIATION CENTRE, USED AT THE OTHER ENERGIES.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) USED FOR NEUTRON ENERGIES 1 - 2.7 MEV.
           (D-D) USED FOR NEUTRON ENERGIES 2.8 - 6 MEV.
            THE NEUTRON FLUENCES WERE IN THE RANGE 5.0E+12 TO
            2.4E+13 N/CM2.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A FISSION IONISATION CHAMBER, WITH A DEPOSIT OF
            95.1 +/- 0.5 MICROGRAMS OF 99.94 PERCENT U-235 PAINTED
            ON A 0.127 MM PLATINUM PLATE LOCATED INSIDE THE SUR-
            FACE OF THE CHAMBER WALL, WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE
            NEUTRON FLUENCE. THE DEPOSIT HAD THE SAME DIAMETER AS
            THE NIOBIUM FOIL.
           (HPGE) AN INTRINSIC GERMANIUM X-RAY SPECTROMETER WAS
            USED TO MEASURE THE ACTIVITY OF THE FOILS. THE DETEC-
            TOR WAS EFFICIENCY CALIBRATED WITH A STANDARD SOLUTION
            OF NB-93-M.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) FISSION CHAMBER.
SAMPLE     .NIOBIUM METAL FOIL SAMPLES, PLACED AT ABOUT 20 MM FROM
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE DURING IRRADIATIONS. ALSO FOILS OF
            NI-58, U-235 AND U-238 WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE
            NEUTRON FLUENCE AND AND LOW ENERGY BACKGROUND
            NEUTRONS. THE SAMPLES WERE PACKED AS MULTI-LAYER SAND-
            WICHES.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR FRAGMENT ABSORPTION IN THE
            FISSILE DEPOSIT AND LOSS OF EVENTS BELOW THE PULSE
            HEIGHT DISCRIMINATION LEVEL OF THE FISSION CHAMBER.
