PART-DET   (N)
EN-SEC     ANG is polar angle between beam and neutron in
           laboratory system
SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is 99.8%.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid. Target is a rolled
             plate of metallic 7Li, 35-mm diameter.
