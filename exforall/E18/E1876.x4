           Beta rays higher than 0.3 MeV were counted.
SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is 99.8%.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 8 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing: Electro-deposited onto iron foils

ADD-RES    (DECAY) The half-life of the shorter-lived isomer was
                   determined to be 14.4+-0.2 min from the
                   analysis of the present data by use of 20.8
                   min for the longer-lived isomer.
COMMENT    Disintegration rate of 112In was determined from the
           annihilation radiation measurement with NaI(Tl)
           crystal which was calibrated with a 22Na standard
           source. The position branching was taken to be 21.6%.

COMMENT    Authors assumed that the 10 min isomer of 111In decays
           only to the 2.8 day isomer.
           The disintegration rate of 111In was determined by
           means of gamma-gamma coincidence method.

DETECTOR   (GEMUC) To detect 2.2 MeV positrons. An aluminium
                   absorber was used to cut down beta rays with
                   energies lower than 1.5 MeV. Thus the
                   interference of the 1.29 MeV positions from
                   the 58 min isomer of 108In was minimized.
