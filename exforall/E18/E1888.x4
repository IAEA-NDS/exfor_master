INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is 250 to 340 particle-nA.
SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is unknown.
           - Chemical-form of target: UO2(NO3)2
           - Backing is aluminium. UO2(NO3)2 in 2-propanol is
             electrodeposited onto aluminum backing foil.
           - Backing-thickness is 0.9 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (STTA) A stack of 21 targets set in a multiple-target
                  chamber with 5 mm spacing
           (HEJET) Products attached to the PbI2 aerosol clusters
                   were swept out of the target chamber
           (OLMS) JAERI-ISOL. Mass resolution of A/Delta A is
                  about 850 at the mass number A=208 [S. Ichikawa

COMMENT    Comment by authors: No alpha-gamma coincidence event
           was observed. This result suggests that the level fed
           by the 6457 keV alpha transition is either the ground
           state of 231Np or a low lying level that decays via
           internal conversion.
