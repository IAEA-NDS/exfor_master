INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is 40 to 50 particle-nA.
INC-SPECT  EN: Energy at the half depth of the target layer
           determined by calculating the energy loss of beam in
           the Al foil and target
SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is 98%.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 0.39 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing is aluminium.
           - Backing-thickness: 1.2 micro-meter thick foil

                   evaporation residue from the primary beams and
                   other reaction products.
           (SI) Double-sided position-sensitive silicon detector
                (73x55 mm**2) to construct alpha-decay chain.
