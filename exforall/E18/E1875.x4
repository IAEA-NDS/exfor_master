INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 2 micro-Ampere.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element. 99.9% chemically
             pure
           - Target-thickness is about 150 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Total activations of 0.5 hour and 3600
                   micro-Coulombs were performed.
           (EDEG) By aluminum absorbers. Incident energies were
