           Beam current was continuously monitored by a secondary
           emission chamber, which was calibrated by activation
           method using the shown monitor reaction.
INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 1.4e11 PPS. (Beam intensity
           was continuously monitored by a SEC (secondary
           emission chamber), which was calibrated by the
           activation method using the 27Al(p,3pn)24Na reaction.)
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid. Thin metal foil
             target. Each target consists of three stacked foils
             of the same thickness. A middle foil was used for
             counting and chemical assays, while the outer foils
             served to compensate for recoil loss. Each target
             was bundled together and placed in order of target
             atomic weight.
METHOD     (ACTIV)Irradiation time was 37 min.
           (EXTB)Average intensity of proton beam was 1.4e+11
                 proton/sec.
           (CHSEP)Irradiated targets were stored in a
                  refrigerator (about 6 deg), and the tritium
                  analysis was carried out about three months
                  after the bombardment. The irradiated foil was
                  dissolved completely in acid. See Fig.1 of
                  reference for the dissolution apparatus used in
                  this experiment.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNLEP)External primary beam line of the 12
                          GeV proton synchrotron
DETECTOR   (GELI)To measure 24Na radioactivity in the Al foil
           (SCIN)To measure radioactivity of tritium. Counting
                 efficiency was determined by an auto-external
                 standard method using standard tritium sources,
                 to be about 22%.
CORRECTION Correction for recoil loss was made and about 10%
           error is included because of recoil correction for
           thin target.
