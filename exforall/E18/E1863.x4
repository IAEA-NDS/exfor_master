PART-DET   (A)
           (P) To monitor at scattering angle of 150 deg
INC-SOURCE - Beam intensity: About 4 micro-amperer/cm**2
           - Charge of incident ion is 1+.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target: Al-Li (3.53%) alloy
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNNAG) Maximum voltage of 1.5 MV at Department
                         of Crystalline Materials Science
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) To detect alpha particle (NR detector in Fig.1
                   of the reference), solid angle is 4.23 msr
                   measured by 241Am standard alpha-source
STATUS     (CURVE) Data points are not given in figure. Only
                   continuous line and fitting function with
                   parameters are given. Numerical data in IBANDL
                   are taken.
