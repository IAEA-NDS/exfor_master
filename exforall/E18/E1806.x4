INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is 5E+4 PPS. (Secondary 11Be beam)

SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is unknown.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 350 mg/cm**2.
           - Target is self supported.
METHOD     (COINC) Detect 11Be and prompt gamma in coincidence.
           (EDE) To identify 11Be
           (TOF) To identify 11Be
FACILITY   (PRJFS,2JPNIPC) Secondary 11Be produced in the 100
                           MeV/u 18O fragmentation reaction at
                           Radioactive beam line RIPS [T. Kubo,
                           Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B70(1992)309]
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Plastic scintillator. Used as E-Delta E and ToF
                  counter to identify 11Be. Position information
                  of the E/dE telescope is also used for
                  determine angular distribution.
           (NAICR) DALI system [T. Motobayashi et al., Phys.
                   Lett. B346(1995)9], to detect gamma-rays.
                   Their energy resolution was typically 6% FWHM
                   for the 1275 keV gamma-ray from the 22Na
                   standard source and 50 keV FWHM for 320keV
                   gamma-ray incorporating the angular resolution
                   of about 20 degree. The total full-energy-peak
                   efficiency was calculated to be 15 % for the
                   320 keV gamma-ray from a moving 11Be nucleus
                   by the code GEANT.
