TITLE      Measurements of formation cross-sections of
           short-lived nuclei around the 14 MeV neutron induced

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons in the 14 MeV energy region with a
           yield of about 5E10 n/s. The deuteron beam current
           was about 350 uA with beam energy of 255 keV.
SAMPLE     The natural hafnium and zirconium foils of 99.99%
           purity and about 3 mm thickness were made into
           circular samples with a diameter of 20 mm. Monitor
           foils of Nb (99.95% pure, 1 mm thick) of the same
           diameter as the hafnium and zirconium foils were then
           attached in front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The neutron flux was monitored by the
           accompanying alpha-particles, which were measured
           with an Au-Si surface barrier detector used at the
           angle of 135 deg.
           (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial HPGe
           detector (ORTEC, made in USA), its crystal diameter
           and crystal length are 70.1 mm and 72.3 mm, with a
           relative efficiency of 68% and an energy resolution
           of 1.69 keV at 1332 keV. The efficiency of the
           detector was precalibrated using various standard
           gamma sources, which with their gamma-ray energies
           were 241Am(59.54 keV), 57Co(122.06, 136.47 keV),
           60Co(1173.23, 1332.49 keV), 109Cd(88.03 keV),
           133Ba(81.00, 276.40, 302.85, 356.01, 383.85 keV),
           137Cs(661.66 keV), 152Eu(121.78, 244.70, 344.28,
           411.12, 443.96, 778.90, 867.38, 964.06,1085.84,
           1112.08, 1299.14, 1408.01 keV), 226Ra(186.21,
           242.00, 295.22, 351.93, 609.32, 768.36, 1120.29,
           1238.12, 1377.67, 1509.21, 1729.60, 1764.49, 1847.43,
           2204.06 keV). The absolute efficiency calibration
           curve was obtained at 90 mm from the upper surface of
           the outermost aluminum envelope of the germanium
           crystal, which was the actual counting position used.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The groups of samples were placed at
           angles of 0, 90 and 135 deg respectively, which are
           relative to the direction of the deuteron. The
           distances of samples from the center of the T-Ti
           target were about 40-50 mm. Irradiations of the
           samples were lasted approximately 2 h. The gamma-ray
           activities of 180Lu, 89mZr and 92mNb were measured
           off-line. The cooling time of the sample after the
           end of irradiation is about 5-7 min, it takes about
           30-48 min to measure the sample.

CORRECTION The total correction mainly includes the
           self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma-ray
           energy, the coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays in the investigated nuclide and in the
           counting geometry.
