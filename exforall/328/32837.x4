SAMPLE     The thickness of the lead ball shell is 4 cm, with an
           inner diameter of 3 cm and an outer diameter of 7 cm.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A semiconductor (Au-Si surface barrier)
           detector was used to measure the distribution of
           thermal neutrons within 50 cm of the thickness of the
           paraffin wax layer. The diameter of the effective
           area was 2 cm, and the resolution was about 1-2%.
           (BF3) 5 BF3 long counters were used beyond 50 cm of
           the thickness of the paraffin wax layer. The outer
           radius of each BF3 long counter was about 1 cm and
           its length was about 5 cm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was about
           0.6 mg/cm2 thick.
METHOD     Slow down method
