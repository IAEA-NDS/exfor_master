INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutron beams were produced by the
            3H(d,n)4He reaction at a flux of the order of
            1E8 n/cm2/s. The 300 uA deuteron beam enters through
            a 0.5 mm Mo foil into Ti-tritiated target.
SAMPLE     The Americium target consisted of a 201 MBq 241Am
            source in the form of solution, encapsulated in
            polypropylene tube. A natural Au solution, containing
            about 1 mg Au, was mixed with 241Am solution as
            reference materials for the neutron flux
            determination.
METHOD     (ACTIV) After the 9.5 h irradiation, the samples were
            placed into lead shield tube and transferred to the
            gamma spectroscopy system.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The Au-Si detector was used to detect 4He
            particles.
           (HPGE) The gamma spectroscopy system was based on a
            well-type HPGe detector.
