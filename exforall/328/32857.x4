INC-SOURCE An 18O beam with an energy of 103.0 MeV. The average
           intensity of the 18O beam was about 0.2 pnA, and the
           diameter of the beam spot was less than 3 mm.
           A Faraday cup was installed about 1.3 m away from the
           target to collect the 18O beam dose.
SAMPLE     (26-FE-56,ENR=0.994) The thickness of target is
           402 ug/cm2.
           (26-FE-58,ENR=0.963) The thickness of target is
           260 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SI) An array of dE-E silicon detector telescopes
           was located downstream of the target to identify the
           light ejectile particles.
           (HPGE) Four HPGe detectors were placed perpendicular
           to the beam direction at a distance of about 70 mm
           from the target for gamma-ray detection. The absolute
           peak efficiency of each HPGe detector was about 0.6%
           at 1173.2 keV.
PART-DET   (8-O-16,G)
METHOD     (EDE) Each Fe target was irradiated for approximately
           2.5 days, and the accumulated number of 16O was
           approximately 1.7E5 and 1.3E5 for the 56Fe and 58Fe
           targets, respectively. The number of detected
           gamma-ray events from 58Fe and 60Fe was about 4.5E3
           and 3.4E3, respectively.
ANALYSIS   (SURGT) Surrogate technique: The 58Fe(18O,16O) 60Fe
           and 56Fe(18O,16O) 58Fe reactions represent
           59Fe(n,g)60Fe and 57Fe(n,g)58Fe, respectively.
           The gamma intensities 86.0+-2.0% (824 keV) and
           66.0+-3.0% (811 keV) were adopted for identification
           of 60Fe and 58Fe, respectively.
           According to Eq.3 of S.Q.Yan+,J,PR/C,94,015804,2016
            (EXFOR 32732),the authors assume the compound
           formation cross section is the same for 59Fe+n and
           57Fe+n.
