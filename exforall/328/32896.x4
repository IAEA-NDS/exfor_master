TITLE      Cross-sections of the 238U(n,gamma)239U reaction in

FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRSIU) 3 MV tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The D beam energies of this experiment were 1.5
           MeV and 3 MeV, and the beam intensities were 13 uA
           and 22 uA. The mass thickness of the D-Ti target was
           2.01 mg/cm2, and the D to Ti atomic adsorption ratio
           was 1.77.
SAMPLE     U3O8 black powder with a purity of more than 99.9%
           was kept in an oven (temperature 60 degree) for 12 h
           to remove moisture. It was removed and then pressed
           into three disk-shaped samples with a diameter of 20
           mm. The mass thicknesses of the samples were 0.9724
           g/cm2, 0.9742 g/cm2, and 0.9855 g/cm2. The U3O8
           samples were sandwiched between two Au flakes and
           covered with a 0.3 mm thick Cd case outside. Au
           flakes with the same diameter as the samples and a
           thickness of approximately 0.1 mm were availed to
           identify the flux of the neutrons at the sample using
           the 197Au(n,gamma)198Au reaction.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated for 12 h. The
           sample (0.9724 g/cm2) was irradiated with a D-beam
           energy of 3 MeV at an angle of 0 deg and a distance
           of 3.063 cm from the D-Ti target. The samples (0.9742
           g/cm2 and 0.9855 g/cm2) were irradiated with a D-beam
           1.5 MeV at an angle of 0 deg and a distance of 4.814
           cm and at an angle of 60 deg and a distance of 4.497
           cm from the D-Ti target, and aligned with the center
           of the D-Ti target. The cooling time were 2.7-43 h
           for Au flakes and 3.5-48 h for U3O8 samples. The
           measuring time was 14.5 h.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The BF3 neutron counter meter was positioned
           parallel to the D-beam stream at 388 cm from the
           target head to supervise the stability of the neutron
           fluence throughout the hall in real time during the
           experiment.
           (HPGE) The characteristic gamma-rays produced were
           measured with a single-ended coaxial low-background
           GEM30P4-76 HPGe detector with an energy resolution of
           850 eV FWHM at 122 keV and 1.85 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV
           as well as a 30% relative efficiency. Calibration of
           the detector efficiency used the standard source
           calibrating method, using the 152Eu and 137Cs
           standard sources with known activities to obtain the
           source peak detection efficiency.
