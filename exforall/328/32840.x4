INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron beam was 200 keV effective energy, the
           thickness of T target was 0.76 mg/cm2.
SAMPLE     Two 241Am samples with a diameter of 16 mm was
           electroplated onto 0.5 mm thick and 27 mm diameter
           stainless steel foil. The isotopic abundance in 241Am
           sample was close to 100%. The weight of two 241Am
           samples were 19.03+-0.24 ug and 29.00+-0.36 ug
           respectively.
           Two 238U samples (natural U) with a diameter of 16 mm
           was electroplated onto 0.4 mm thick and 27 mm diameter
           aluminum foil. The weight of two 238U samples were
           78.74+-1.2 ug and 48.38+-0.8 ug respectively.

METHOD     Associated alpha particle to monitor the neutron flux.
