           Pu-239 and U-235 by the activation method

SAMPLE     The Pu-239 and U-235 conversion targets were placed
           on the collimated neutron beam. The three types of
           indicator foils were metal aluminum, quartz crystal
           and mixture of (NH4)2HPO4 and pure paraffin. The
           intensity of neutron on the indicator foil was about
           1E8 n/cm2/s.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) The beta counting device included bell shaped
           Geiger beta counter, high voltage stabilized power
           supply and scaler. The stability was tested using a
           U3O8 standard beta source.
PART-DET   (B)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Four dosimetry reactions were selected to
           determine the parameter beta(239Pu), which are
           31P(n,p)31Si, 27Al(n,p)27Mg, 28Si(n,p)28Al and
           27Al(n,a)24Na, the half-life of the reaction products
           are 2.62 hours, 9.5 minutes, 2.3 minutes and 15
           hours. The indicator foils were removed after two
           hours irradiation, then the beta radioactivity of the
           reaction products were measured, the Al indicator
           foils were measured after cooling for 25 minutes.
