FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRNPC) K(L)Pu pulse reactor was a 3 layers of
           plutonium and uranium mixed sphere, and the average
           neutron energy was 1.59 MeV. CFBR was a multi shell
           enriched uranium quasi spherical structure with a
           reflective layer, and the average neutron energy was
           1.22 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Central fast neutron fluence rate of K(L)Pu
           was 4.99E8 /cm2/s/W. The diameter of the central
           cavity was 40 mm.

SAMPLE     235U electroplated sheet with stainless steel backing
METHOD     (ACTIV) The ratio of 197Au(n,f) and 235(n,f) was
           measured on K(L)Pu and CFBR. The samples of Au and
           235U in diameter of 6 mm were placed in the upper and
           lower ionization chambers of a small "back to back"
           double ionization chamber with Ar gas and 300 V
           voltage. The samples were irradiated for 2 hours, and
           the K(L)Pu reactor power was 10 W. 235U fission count
           was recorded online. The activity of 198Au was
           measured offline with HPGe detector. On CFBR, the
           ionization chamber was wrapped with Cd, and the
           reactor power was 50 W. The ratio of 180Hf(n,g) and
           197(n,g). Hf foil in diameter of 18 mm was wrapped
           between Au foils, and placed in a approximately 40 mm
           square grid made of copper wire. The samples were
           irradiated on K(L)Pu for 4 hours, and power was 25
           W.The samples were irradiated on CFBR for 4 hours,
           and power was 200 W. The activity of 198Au and 181Hf
           was measured offline with HPGe detector.
