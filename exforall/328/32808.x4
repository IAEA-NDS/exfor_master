           The details of neutron generation and calculation of
           neutron energies.
SAMPLE     (63-EU-153,NAT=0.5219) 10 g of high-purity Eu2O3
           powder was pressed at 980 MPa. The thickness of three
           samples were 0.1427 cm, 0.1718 cm, and 0.1065 cm with
           a diameter of 2.0 cm. Each of them was sandwiched
           between two neutron-flux monitor foils made of
           aluminum (whose purity and thickness are of 99.99%
           and 0.3 mm, respectively) having the same diameter as
           the circular sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The entire process for irradiation of all the
           three samples lasted 120 min with a yield about 3 to
           4E10 n/(4 pi*s). The three samples were placed at
           angles of 0, 90 or 135 deg relative to the deuterium
           beam direction, around the T-Ti target at distances
           of about 40 mm from it. After the irradiation process,
           three samples were cooled for 1 h, 30 h and 6.5 years.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities of 153Sm, 150Pm, and
           24Na were determined by a high-purity germanium
           detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P, crystal diameter:
           70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm, made in the USA),
           having a relative efficiency of about 68% and an
           energy resolution of 1.69 keV at 1332 keV for 60Co.

CORRECTION F is the total correction factor of the activity,
           F=fs*fc*fg. fs, fc and fg are correction factors for
           the self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma-ray
           energy, the coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays of the investigated nuclide and the
           counting geometry, respectively.
           Correction factors for the self-absorption:

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty was determined by
           taking the root mean square of the individual
           uncertainties, 5.5-15.8%.

           (ERR-4,0.1,1.) Cooling and measuring times
           (ERR-5,0.1,7.0) some of other uncertainties originated
           from the parameters of the measured and standard
           nuclei, such as the uncertainties in the branching
           ratio of characteristic gamma-rays, in the half-lives
           of the the radioactive product nuclei, and so on.
