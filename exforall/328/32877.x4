INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced using a D2 gas target
            bombarded with deuterons at 6.5, 8.0 and 9.5 MeV. The
            current was 300 nA, the pulse repetition frequency
            was about 3 MHz.
SAMPLE     209Bi metal sample was 50 mm in diameter, 4 mm in
            thickness, and 9.8 g/cm3 in density. Natural Ti
            sample was 50 in diameter, 1 mm in thickness, and
            4.54 g/cm3 in density.
METHOD     (FPGAM,TOF) Time-of-flight method was used to
            determine neutron energy.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A BC501A liquid scintillator detector was used
            to monitor the neutron flux.
           (HPGE) 4 Clover detector was used to measure produced
            gamma-ray. Every detector was made of 4 high-purity
            germanium crystals. The Clover detector was
            calibrated with 152Eu, 60Co, 22Na and 133Ba standard
            gamma-ray radioactive sources.
