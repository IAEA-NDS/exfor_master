FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator at Chinese
           Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons with a yield about 3 to 4E10 n/s were
           generated with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           136 keV and a beam current of 280 uA. The T-Mo target
           used in the generator had a thickness of 0.566 mg/cm2
           and an active zone diameter of 1.2 cm.
SAMPLE     (34-SE-74,NAT=0.0089) 14 g of high purity Se powder
           was pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and a pellet of 0.3 cm
           thickness and 2.0 cm in diameter was obtained. A
           total of three such pellets were prepared. Monitor
           foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm thick) having the same
           diameter as the pellets, were then attached in the
           front and at the back of each sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The entire process of irradiation for all the
           three samples lasted about 60-90 min. The three
           samples were placed at 0, 90, and 135 deg angles
           respectively, relative to the beam direction and
           centred with respect to the tritium-molybdenum (T-Mo)
           target at a distance of about 4 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe detector with a relative efficiency of
           about 68 % and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at
           1332 keV for 60Co. The distance from sample to
           detector was 4.0-8.0 cm. The efficiency of the
           detector was pre-calibrated using various standard
           gamma sources like Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241, and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) The neutron-flux was monitored by the
           accompanying alpha-particles to facilitate
           corrections for small variations in the yield. The
           Au-Si surface barrier detector used in 135 deg
           irradiation accompanying alpha-particle tube was set
           at a distance of 110 cm from the tritium target.

CORRECTION The total correction factor of the activity is given
           by F = fs*fc*fg. fs, fc, and fg are the correction
           factors for the selfabsorption of the sample for a
           given gamma energy, the coincident sum-effect of
           cascade gamma-rays in the investigated nuclide and in
           the counting geometry. Correction factors for the
           self-absorption of the sample at 253.7 and 361.2 keV
           gamma-rays are 1.083, 1.069 for sample 1 (0.3492 cm),
           1.062, 1.051 for sample 2 (0.2621 cm), and 1.083,
           1.069 for sample 3 (0.3492 cm).
