FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Fourteen mega electron volt neutron flux was
           generated using the T(d,n)4He reaction induced by
           the 135 keV deuteron beam energy and 200 uA beam
           current.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A calibrated GEM-60P coaxial HPGe detector
            (72.3 mm long and 70.1 mm in diameter) was used to
           measure the gamma-ray activities of 89mZr, 89gZr,
           95mNb, 95gNb and 24Na nuclei after the samples decay
           for 5~1800 min. The relative efficiency and energy
           resolution of the HPGe detector were 68% and 1.69 keV
            (at 1.332 MeV), respectively. The efficiency of the
           detector was pre-calibrated using various standard
           gamma sources, which were 57Co, 60Co, 109Cd, 133Ba,
           137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am and 226Ra. The uncertainty in the
           efficiency curve was estimated to be about 3%, while
           the uncertainty of the activity of the standard
           source is about 2.5-3.0%.
           (SIBAR) The neutron flux during the irradiation was
           monitored by counting alpha particles using Au-Si
           surface barrier detector positioned at a 135 degree
           angle to correct for the neutron flux variations.
SAMPLE     Three Mo foil circles (99.99% purity, 0.5 mm thick
           and 20 mm in diameter), each of which was placed
           between two Al foil circles (99.999% purity, 0.3 mm
           thick and 20 mm in diameter). A stack of Al-Mo-Al
           was assembled and wrapped in a cadmium foil in order
           to reduce the contribution of thermal and epithermal
           effects.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Three samples were positioned at 0, 90, and
           135 degree angles with regards to the beam and 5 cm
           away from the T-Ti target, irradiated for 2 h, during
           which the total yield was about 3E10~4E10 n/s.

CORRECTION The activity correction factor F can be expressed as
           F=fg*fs, where fg and fs are correction factors at a
           certain counting geometry and gamma-ray
           self-absorption, respectively.
