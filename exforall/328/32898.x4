FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons were produced with an effective
           deuteron beam energy of 134 keV, and a beam current
           of 240 uA.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation of the samples was carried
           out with a total duration of approximately 2 h with a
           neutron yield 4 to 5 E10 n/s in the 4 Pi solid angle.
           Each sample was measured twice. More specifically,
           the first set of measurements was performed between
           12 and 49 min after the end of the irradiation, and
           the second set 20 h after the end of the irradiation.
           The measuring time is 119 s.
SAMPLE     (35-BR-81,NAT=0.4931) Approximately 0.6-0.9 g of NaBr
           powder (99.99% pure) was put within a sample box
            (polymethyl methacrylate). Subsequently, four samples
           with a diameter of 20 mm and eight monitors
            (niobium foil of 99.99% purity) with the same
           diameter were prepared for the irradiation experiments.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A low background high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P, crystal diameter of
           70.1 mm, crystal length of 72.3 mm) with a relative
           efficiency of about 68% and an energy resolution of
           1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV for 60Co. To secure the energy
           and efficiency of the detector, a calibration process
           was carried out by using the standard gamma-ray
           sources 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu, and 226Ra. The curve of
           absolute efficiency calibration was acquired at 8 cm
           from the surface of the germanium crystal.

CORRECTION The correction factors at the energy levels of 616.3
