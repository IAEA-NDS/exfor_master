FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Intense Neutron Generator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A yield 3 - 4 E10 n/(4Pis). The deuteron ion
            beam current was up to 180 uA with of an energy of
            250 keV. The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target
            used in the generator was approximately 2.59 mg/cm2
            thick.
SAMPLE     About 6 g of ruthenium powder of natural isotopic
            composition (purity 99.95%) was pressed into a pellet
            (about 20.0 mm in diameter, 1.5 mm in thickness).
            Monitor foils of natural niobium foils (purity
            99.99%, 0.1 mm in thickness) of the same diameter as
            the pellet were attached in the front and at the back
            of each ruthenium sample. Three group such samples
            were prepared for irradiation and measurement.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation was lasted approximately 17 h.
            The samples were cooled about 18 days.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A lead-shielded HPGe detector (ORTEC, USA).
            The relative efficiency of the detector was 68%, and
            the energy resolution was 1.82 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV
            of 60Co.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Half-life of 95mTc = 61.88 +/- 0.22 d

COMMENT    Changlin Lan: The values in Table 6 are not the
            partial uncertainties.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties in the measured cross-
            sections are found in the range of 2.54 - 2.76%
