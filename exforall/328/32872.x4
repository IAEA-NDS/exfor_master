FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The yield is about 5E10 n/4Pi/s. Solid tritium-
           titanium (T-Ti) target in thickness of 2.59 mg/cm2
           was bombarded by deuteron ions. The beam current of
           the deuterium was up to 180 uA with a maximum energy
           of 250 keV.
SAMPLE     (29-CU-65,NAT=0.3083) Two natural copper and iron
           foils with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of
           0.1 mm were sandwiched between natural niobium foil
           and zirconium foil with the same diameter.
           The samples were placed at 40 and 60 deg angles
           relative to the deuteron beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at a distance of about 4 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The copper samples were irradiated for about
           50 min, cooled for about 8 min each. The gamma-ray
           counting of reaction products in the irradiated
           samples was done for about 30 min each. The distance
           between the samples and the detector is 4.5 cm.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) In order to monitor the variation of the
           neutron yield, accompanying alpha-particles were
           recorded every second during irradiation period by
           Au-Si surface barrier detector, which are placed at
           135 deg relative the direction of deuteron.
           (HPGE) A series of point source (22Na, 60Co, 133Ba,
           137Cs, 152Eu, 210Pb, 241Am) of known activity were
           used to determine the absolute photopeak efficiency
           of a lead-shielded high purity germanium detector
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.82 keV at 1.33 MeV for 60Co.

           sample self-absorption for the specific gamma-ray
           energy (1.002) and sample counting geometry (1.002).
