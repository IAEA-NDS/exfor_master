SAMPLE     Cylindrical metal thulium wiht a diameter of 25 mm,
           height of 30 mm and purity of 99.44%.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Four BC-501A liquid scintillation detectors at
           30, 60, 120 and 150 deg, the distance from the sample
           is 50 cm. A ST-451 liquid scintillation detector was
           placed at about 70 deg with the beam direction, and
           the distance from the sample is about 250 cm, to
           measure the elastic scattered neutrons from the 169Tm
           sample as the normalization of the cross section.
           (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) A polyethylene film was placed
           between the sample and the neutron source. The recoil
           protons from the polyethylene film were measured by a
           gold silicon surface barrier telescope to monitor the
           neutron flux, at 23 deg with the beam.

           four BC-501A liquid scintillation detectors at 30, 60,
           120 and 150 deg in coincidence respectively.
