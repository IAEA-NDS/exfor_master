INC-SOURCE (REAC) Using a crystal neutron spectrometer, the
           neutron beam E=0.0253 eV was selected from heavy-water
           reactor. NaCl (200) crystal was used as the
           monochromator for the spectrometer.Between the
           NaCl(200) monochromator and the measured sample a
           mechanical monochromator was inserted in order to cut
           off the neutrons with high energy. The high energy
           neutron was less than 1%.
SAMPLE     Nuclear emulsion of U was made of U3O8 powder.
           Impurity content was less than 0.4%. The abundance of
           235U was 20.2%(1+-0.1%). The sample was made into
           uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2) and added to the liquid
           emulsion in its aqueous solution. Nuclear emulsion of
           B was made of boric acid.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Nuclear emulsion
METHOD     4 pieces of nuclear emulsions were used. The 1st and
           4th were B, the 2nd and 3rd were U. The 1st and 2nd
           were separated by Al foil in thickness of 100 um. The
           3rd and 4th were the same. The irradiation time was 8
           hours.
