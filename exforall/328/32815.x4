FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem Accelerator
INC-SOURCE The alpha beam intensity was about 100 - 200 enA for
           the on-line experiment. The alpha beam intensity for
           the on-line irradiation was about 1.0 euA, and it was
           monitored by a water-cooling Faraday cup.
SAMPLE     236U target with a diameter of 5 mm was electroplated
           onto 2 um thick aluminum foil. Two thick targets of
           5.0 ug/cm2 were made for on-line experiment and
           eighteen thin targets of 1.0 ug/cm2 were made for
           on-line irradiation and off-line measurement.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) In the on-line experiment, eight diameter of
           8 mm Si(Au) detectors were used with a rotatable base
           for the angular distribution measurement of elastic
           scattering and fission fragments. Four Si(Au)
           detectors were placed symmetrically at the forward
           angle of 25 deg for monitoring the beam quality and
           cross section normalization. For the off-line
           measurement of alpha radioactivity, 18 target-detector
           measurement systems were manufactured.
