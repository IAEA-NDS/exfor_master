FACILITY   (SYNCH,3CPRIHP) The Back-n white neutron source at
           China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons are produced by slamming 1.6 GeV/c
           proton beam, with double bunches per pulse, onto a
           tungsten target with a typical repetition rate of 25
           Hz. The pulse width of each bunch is 41 ns, and the
           interval between the two bunches is 410 ns. The
           neutron flux from thermal to 400 MeV can reach 1E7
           n/cm2/s at the experimental stations, when the proton
           bunches power of the CSNS is 100 kW.
SAMPLE     The 169Tm sample (purity 99.995) was about 40.0 mm in
           diameter, about 0.2 mm in thickness and about 2.42 g
           in weight.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Four C6D6 liquid scintillator, each detector
           was 127 mm in diameter and 76.2 mm in length,
           contained in a 1.5-mm-thick aluminum capsule and
           coupled with a photomultiplier tube. These detectors
           were placed upstream of the sample relative to the
           neutron beam, and the detector axis is at an angle of
           125 degrees with respect to the neutron beam
           direction. The distance between the center of the
           front face of the detector and the sample center is
           approximately 150 mm.
METHOD     (TOF) The length of neutron flight path is
                 approximately 76 m.
           (PHWT) Weighting function calculated by Geant4.
CORRECTION The correction for the normalization, the loss of low
           energy counts below the threshold of the detectors,
           the dead time during data acquisition and data
           analysis, the neutron multiple scattering and
           self-shielding.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainties
           (ERR-S,,0.7) The statistical uncertainty
            -  The systematic uncertainty included the
           uncertainties due to background subtraction,
           normalization, and corrections for both 169Tm and
           197Au as well as the uncertainty caused by the PHWT
           method.
            -  The uncertainty of the standard cross
           section recommended by the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library was
           estimated to be in the order of 6.0% below 200 keV
           and 4.0% between 200 and 300 keV.
