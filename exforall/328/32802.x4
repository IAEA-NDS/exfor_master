FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRSIU) 3 MV tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-T) The mono-energetic neutrons were generated by
           the T(p,n)3He reaction with a proton beam energy of
           5.2 MeV. The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target has a
           thickness of 1.833 mg/cm2. The atom ratio of T to Ti
           in the target is 1.84.
SAMPLE     Four disc-shaped samples were made of U3O8 powder
           with a purity of higher than 99.95%. The thickness of
           the four samples was 0.972, 0.780, 0.831 and 0.841
           g/cm2, respectively. These U3O8 samples were
           sandwiched between two thin Au foils. The sandwichs
           of Au-U3O8-Au were wrapped with 0.3 mm thick cadmium.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A low-background coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector (GEM30P4-76, ORTEC). The detector has a
           relative efficiency of 30%, and an energy resolution
           of 1.85 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV and 850 eV FWHM at 122
           keV. The calibration of energy and efficiency was
           done by the standard point sources 137Cs and 152Eu.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The first three samples were mounted at 4 cm
           from the T-Ti target and at 0, 60 and 90 deg angles
           relative to the direction of the proton beam and
           center of the T-Ti target. The last one was mounted
           at 673 cm and 90 deg angle. These samples were
           irradiated for 5.3 h and cooled for 3.0 h.
