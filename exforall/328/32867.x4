FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced with deuteron beam (250
           keV) and a solid T-Ti target (about 2.5 mg/cm2). The
           fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by the
           accompanied alpha particle with a silicon detector.
SAMPLE     A stack was composed with natural isotope abundance
           of tin (0.25 mm, 99.9% purity), zirconium (0.3 mm,
           99.8% purity), niobium (0.2 mm, 99.9% purity) and
           aluminum (1 mm, 99.5% purity) foils. All of these
           foils were cut into round disk with diameter of 18 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted for 20 h. The
           stack was arranged in a sequence of Nb-Zr-Sn-Al-Nb
           and placed at about 120 deg angle relative to the
           deuteron beam direction at a distance of 5 cm. The
           cooling time is 11.9 d and measuring time is 1.8 d.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activation of each foil was measured with
           a lead shielded HPGe detector (ORTEC Corp., 25%
           relative efficiency, 1.9 keV resolution at 1332.5 keV
           of 60Co). Gamma Vision software (ORTEC Corp.,
           version 6.08) was used to record and analyze the
           gamma-ray spectrometry. The detector was
           precalibrated via stand gamma sources (109Cd, 133Ba,
           152Eu and 137Cs).

MONIT-REF  (,A.A.Filatenkov,R,INDC(CCP)-0460,2016)
           The neutron energy was determined by the cross section
           ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reactions,
           and the neutron flux was determined with the
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb and 27Al(n,a)24Na reactions.
