FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) Heavy water reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The reactor power was 100 kW and the neutron
           flux was about 5E3 n/s/cm2.
SAMPLE     20% enriched uranium is plated on both sides of the
           aluminum foil using a neutral alcohol solution
           electroplating method, with a thickness of 0.5
           mg/cm2. There were 14 sheets in total.
METHOD     Neutrons were moderated by heavy water and measured
           by the BF3 detector.The container for heavy water was
           a large cylinder made of Al, with an outer diameter
           of 800 mm, a length of 700 mm, and a wall thickness
           of 5 mm. The center of the cylinder was a cylindrical
           cavity for placing a fission ionization chamber, with
           an inner diameter of 65 mm. Around the cavity, 40 Al
           tubes with a diameter of 37 mm were symmetrically
           arranged (divided into three circles, each with 8, 12,
           and 20 tubes), and BF3 were placed inside. A graphite
           reflector with a thickness of 500 mm was stacked
           around the system. At the end of the horizontal
           transport channel, a graphite pillar(phi 145 * 600
           mm) was place to the active zone. The cadmium ratio
           of the neutron beam increased from 10 to 56. The
           collimator placed in the horizontal channel is made
           of boron containing paraffin, with a central aperture
           of 6.5 mm, an outer diameter of 200 mm, and a length
           of 1200 mm. The lead protective layer(600*600*600
           mm3) was at the orifice, with a central square hole
           size of 20*20 mm2. Paraffin layer containing B (100mm
           thick) and Cd sheet are used to shield the entire
           system. The system efficiency was 14.72 %. The
           measurement time was about 50 hours.
DETECTOR   (BF3) 2 groups of BF3 were used. One group was 12 CHM-
           8 (B-10 concentration of 80%, 35 mm in diameter, 1000
           mm long, inflation pressure of 400 millimeters of
           mercury, working voltage 2400 V, flat width 300 V).
           The other was 19 CHM-7 (B-10 concentration of 90%, 35
           mm in diameter, 550 mm long, inflation pressure of
           400 millimeters of mercury, working voltage 2600 V,
           flat width 100 V). Total content of boron was 4.33
           grams.
           (FISCH) The fission ionization chamber was entirely
           made of Al, with a diameter of 60mm and a length of
           150mm. The thickness of the front and back walls was
           less than 1mm. The ionization chamber was filled with
           Ar gas with a height of 600 mm of mercury, and the
           working voltage was negative 200 V.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The first source of uncertainty was from
           statistics, especially the statistical uncertainties
           of 5, 4 and 3 neutrons emission probability. The
           second source of uncertainty was from detector
           efficiency. The uncertainties from instrument
           instability and electronic gate width instability
           were ignored for far less than statistical uncertainty.
