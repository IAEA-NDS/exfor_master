FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The T-Mo target used in the generator, had a
           thickness of 0.57 mg/cm2, and an active zone diameter
           of 12 mm. Neutrons were generated with a mean
           deuteron beam energy of 125 keV and a beam current of
           300 uA. Throughout the process of irradiation, the
           neutron flux was monitored by the accompanying
           alpha-particles, so that corrections could be
           performed for small variations in the yield.
SAMPLE     Three samples were made from natural Te (99.995%
           purity) powder, and each one in the form of a pellet,
           about 1.8 mm in thickness and 20 mm in diameter.
           These pellets were then sandwiched between two
           standard Nb foils (99.999% purity, 0.5 mm thick each)
           having equal diameter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The entire process for irradiation of all the
           three samples was lasted about 3 hours with a yield
           about 3 to 4 E10 n/(4 pai s). The groups of samples
           were positioned at 0, 90 and 135 deg relative to the
           beam direction. Cooling time is 27 hours.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector used to
           detect accompanying alpha-particles was positioned at
           135 deg relative to the beam direction and a distance
           of 1.10 m from the target.
           (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities of 121mTe, 121gTe
           and 93mNb were measured by using a high-purity
           germanium detector.

           The HPGE detector has been described.

CORRECTION F is the total correction factor of the activity,
           F=fs*fg. fs and fg are the correction factors for the
           self-absorption of the sample at a specifed gamma-ray
           energy and in the counting geometry, respectively.
           Correction factors for the self-absorption:

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty 7.4-9.5%
           The chief uncertainty sources are as follows and
           some additional uncertainties originated from the
           parameters of the measured and standard nuclei,
           such as the uncertainties in the branching ratio of
           characteristic gamma-rays, in the half-lives of the
           the radioactive product nuclei, and so on.
