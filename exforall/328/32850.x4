TITLE      Methods to subtract the effect of the decay of
           different nuclear reaction products on the
           cross-section measurements and their application to

SAMPLE     About 3-mm-thick Zr foil (99.99% pure) was made into
           four round foils of 20 mm diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high purity
           germanium ORTEC detector made in USA with a relative
           efficiency of 68% and an energy resolution of 1.69
           keV at 1332 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were radiated lasted for 6-8 h.
           The sample was cooled for about 5-7 min before the
           first measurement, while the sample was cooled for
           about 14-29 h before the second measurement.
