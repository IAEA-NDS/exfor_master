FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRAEP) 1.2 m
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 4.5 MeV proton beam with 50 - 180 Hz, pulse
           width 30 - 200 ms, 0.2 - 1.0 mA, is induced on 0.5 -
           0.8 mm metal Li.
SAMPLE     Graphite prisms are stacked with graphite blocks, the
           average size of blocks is 19.86 x 19.86 x 30.01 cm3.
           Graphite has a density of 1.653 g/cm.
DETECTOR   (BF3) 2 BF3 detectors are 2 cm in diameter and 25 cm
           long. The detector is covered with Cd tablet in
           thickness of 0.5 mm and B4C in thickness of 2 cm. The
           other 2 BF3 detector as monitors are placed in the
           distance of 2 - 3 m and about 45 deg and 120 deg.
METHOD     (DIFUS) In 1st measurement, the samples smaller than
           119.39 x 119.17 x 79.88 cm3 are covered with borax in
           thickness of 8 cm. The samples smaller than 79.45 x
           79.45 x 90.03 cm3 are covered with borax in thickness
           of 8 cm and paraffin in thickness of 10 cm. In 2nd
           measurement, the samples smaller than 119.17 x 119.17
           x 90.03 cm3 are covered with borax and paraffin.
CORRECTION The background is 0.3 - 0.6 %. The systematical error
           from the size of graphite is 1%, and contained in the
           uncertainty of average cross section.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are obtained from the Table 3 in
           At.En.Sci.Technol,10,146,1976.
