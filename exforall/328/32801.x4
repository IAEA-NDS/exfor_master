FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 5SDH-2 1.7MV Tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The incident deuteron beam energy and intensity
            were 3.276 MeV and about 7 uA, respectively.
            The neutron source target is a titanium-tritide (TiT)
            foil with 12 mm diameter.
SAMPLE     Each RbCl sample was sandwiched between two niobium
           foils with thickness of 0.5 mm and diameter of 20 mm.
           The niobium purity was 99.999%. The RbCl sample with
           thickness of 1.0 mm and diameter of 20 mm was made by
           pressing RbCl powder with purity of 99.50%.
DETECTOR   (GE) A high resolution Ge detector (ORTEC GEM60P)
           with high efficiency (relative efficiency of 60%).
           The efficiency calibration of Ge has been done
           carefully with a set of standard gamma-ray sources
           including 152Eu, 226Ra, 133Ba, and 60Co procured by
           England Aeatechnology. The detector efficiency for
           1332 keV is 0.00482.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 85Rb samples were irradiated about 107 h
           on the surface of a two-ring orientation assembly,
           placed at the angles of 0, 29, 48, 64, 79, 94, 110,
           129, and 161 deg with respect to the deuteron beam
           direction and TiT target center. The irradiation
           history can be divided into any number of separate
           parts, each with a relative neutron flux given by the
           counts. The total neutron flux, as measured by the
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb monitor reaction, is apportioned
           into each irradiation step.

            The used standard cross-section data were conducted
            by the interpolation method.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for self-absorption in the
           sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main uncertainty sources were due to the
           gamma-ray detector efficiency, counting statistics,
           and standard cross-section.
