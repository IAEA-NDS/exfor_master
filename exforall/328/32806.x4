INC-SOURCE (P-T) Proton beam energy is 5.2 MeV. The proton beam
           current was close to 35 uA and focused to bombard
           solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target. The T-Ti target
           has a thickness of 1.833 mg/cm2 and the atom ratio of
           T to Ti is 1.84. Tantalum foil is behind the T-Ti
           target which could stop the proton beam. At the end
           of the target, a continuous cooling water flow with a
           thickness of 4 mm was used to avoid local overheating.
SAMPLE     Four disc-shaped samples with a diameter of 20 mm and
           15 mm were made of ThO2 powder with a purity of more
           than 99.9%, the area of sample 1 is 3.142 cm2 and the
           area of all other sample is 1.767 cm2. The masses of
           the four samples are 1.501 g, 1.233 g, 1.199 g and
           1.288 g, which the mass thickness(tm) of samples are
           0.478 g/cm2,0.698 g/cm2, 0.679 g/cm2 and 0.729 g/cm2.
           These ThO2 samples were initially sandwiched between
           two Au foils and then covered with 0.3 mm thick
           cadmium. The Au foils (same diameter with thorium
           samples and 0.1 mm thickness) were used to determine
           the average neutron flux by 197Au(n,g)198Au reaction.
           Meanwhile, the Cd box with high thermal neutron
           capture cross-section was used for eliminating the
           impact of scattered slow-thermal neutrons. The first
           three samples were installed at 3.5 cm from the
           center of the T-Ti target and at 0, 45 and 90 deg
           angles to the proton beam, respectively. The last one
           was mounted at 690 cm and 90 deg angle, which was
           used to determine the contribution of the background
           neutron in whole hall.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The irradiation lasted for 6 h. The Au
           foils were cooled for 2-3 h then placed into detector
           to get gamma-ray spectra to further calculate the
           average neutron fluence. The irradiated targets of Th
           were cooled more time (1-2 days) and detected enough
           time for getting as many statistics as possible.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectra of these irradiated
           samples were detected with a low-background coaxial
           high-purity germanium detector (GEM30P4-76, ORTEC).
           The detector has a relative efficiency of 30% and an
           energy resolution of 850 eV FWHM at 122 KeV and 1.85
           KeV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.
           (BF3) The neutron flux fluctuation was monitored with
           a BF3 long counter that was placed at an another 45
           deg angle and 481 cm from the target.

CORRECTION The total correction factors of this neutron
           irradiation experiment mainly involved four parts:
           the multiple scattering neutron factor(Fs), the flux
           attenuation factor(Fa), the gamma-ray self-absorption
           factor(Fg) and the neutron flux fluctuation
           factor(Ff).
