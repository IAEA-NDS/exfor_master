FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons with a yield of about 5E10 n/4PIs. The
           beam current of the deuterium was up to 180 uA with
           an effective energy of 112 keV.
SAMPLE     The iron film of 99.99% purity was tailored into
           circular samples with a diameter of 15 mm and a
           thickness of 0.1 mm. Each Iron target was sandwiched
           between natural niobium foil and zirconium foil with
           the same diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity
           germanium detector. The relative efficiency of this
           low background gamma-ray spectroscopy was 68% and the
           energy resolution was 1.69 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Three natural abundance iron samples
           sandwiched with zirconium and niobium foil were
           irradiated at three angles for 50 min. Due to the
           short half-lives of the product isotopes,
           measurements were started within 10 min after
           irradiation.
