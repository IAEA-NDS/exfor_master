FACILITY   (SYNCH,3CPRIHP) Endstation #1 (ES#1) of the CSNS Back-
           n white neutron source
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Protons accelerated up to 1.6 GeV in the
           Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) impinged on a
           tungsten target with a repetition rate of 25 Hz and
           thus produce spallation neutrons. The Back-n beamline
           provided neutrons of a wide energy spectrum (from
           about eV to higher than 100 MeV) while the
           interference of the charged particles emitted from
           the tungsten target was eliminated by the bending
           magnet. The neutron source operated in double-bunch
           mode, with the time width of each proton bunch about
           43 ns, and the separation duration between the two
           proton bunches was 410 ns. The beam power during the
           present experiment was 50 kW. The neutron flight path
           was 57.99 m from the source to the sample. The
           diameter of the neutron beam spot was approximately
           15 mm, and the neutron flux was about 9.35E5 n/cm2/s.
SAMPLE     Four samples were used for the measurement, a
           high-purity graphite foil (carbon sample) of about
           8.82 ug/cm2 thickness for the foreground measurement
           of the 12C(n,xd) reactions, a low-density polyethylene
            (CH2) sample of about 9.48 u/cm2 thickness for the
           n-p scattering measurement, an empty target for
           instrumental and neutron beam background measurement,
           and alpha sources for signal tests for the detectors,
           their electronics, and the data acquisition
            (DAQ) system. The alpha sources were back-to-back
           241Am sources, each with about 33 kBq activity. All
           the samples were mounted onto a customized aluminum
           holder, which has four sample positions. Three of
           them are rounded squares of 76.8 mm in side length
           for the graphite foil, empty target, and CH2 sample,
           and one is a rectangle for the alpha sources.
           Therefore, the incident neutron beam spot was well
           covered by the sample (15 mm vs 76.8 mm).
METHOD     (EDE) The measurement of the charged particles
           was achieved using the LPDA detector system. Ten sets
           of dE-E telescopes of the LPDA system were used in
           the vacuum chamber. The telescopes were placed in the
           forward direction from 10.1 to 55.0 deg with respect
           to the incident neutron beamline. The telescopes at
           the angles ang L = 10.1, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0 deg
           were placed on the left side of the neutron beamline
           while the other five sets of telescopes at ang L =
           15.1, 25.1, 35.0, 45.0, 55.0 deg were placed on the
           right. The total beam duration for the measurement
           was approximately 210 h, split into seven rounds each
           consisting of about 18 h of CH2 measurement, about 6
           h of graphite measurement, and about 0.5 h of empty
           target measurement.
           (TOF) Neuron flight path (57.99 m)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,CSICR) Each telescope is composed of a 300
           um thick Si-PIN detector (dE unit) and a 30 mm thick
           CsI scintillator (E unit). The signals from each Si-
           PIN detector were amplified and preprocessed by a
           Mesytec MSI-8 amplifier, while the signals from each
           CsI detector were multiplied by a silicon
           photomultiplier and then processed by a main amplifier.
