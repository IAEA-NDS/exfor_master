FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator, the yield is
                          approximately 3.0E10 n/4Pi/s
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The T(d,n)4He reaction with a deuteron beam
                 (250 keV, 180 uA) produced 14 MeV neutrons.
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,NAT=0.999) Two natural U3O8 powder samples
            (99.9% purity) were made into round disks of 20 mm
           diameter with thicknesses 1.1 mm (U-1 sample) and
           1.0 mm (U-2 sample). Each sample was placed between
           a Nb foil (20 mm diameter, 0.01 mm thickness,
           99.999% purity) and Zr foil (20 mm diameter,
           0.01 mm thickness, 99.99% purity). The sandwich
           sample was covered with a Cd box for preventing
           scattering of thermal neutrons.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The Au-Si detector relative to the deuteron
           beam at 135 deg monitored the accompanying 4He
           particle to measure the neutron yield and neutron
           flux per 10 s, which would give a correction for
           neutron fluctuation.
           (HPGE) A series of standard point sources (22Na,
           60Co, 133Ba,137Cs, 152Eu) of known activity were used
           to determine the absolute full energy peak efficiency
           of a lead-shielded high purity germanium detector
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.82 keV at 1.33 MeV for 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time of the U-1 sample was
           60 min for the measurement of fission product nuclei
           with a lifetime of a few hours. To measure
           longer-lived fission product nuclei, the U-2 sample
           was irradiated for 17 h. The U-1 sample was measured
           at a distance of 9 cm from the detector after
           76.53 min of cooling. The U-1 and U-2 samples were
           measured after 22.08 h and 20.59 days, respectively,
           at a distance of 4.5 cm from the detector.

           cascade summing correction, scattered neutron
           correction, dead time correction, and isotopic
           impurities.
