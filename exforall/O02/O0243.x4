REACTION  1(26-FE-58(P,N)27-CO-58-G,,SIG)
           This cross section has been measured, until isomer
           state of Co-58  was exist. Gamma spectra were
           measured on later less than 0.6 Half-Life Co-58-m.

          3(26-FE-58(P,N)27-CO-58-G,M+,SIG)
           This cross section has been measured after total

          4(26-FE-58(P,N)27-CO-58,,SIG)
           This is sum cross sections for 1 and 2 Reactions.
