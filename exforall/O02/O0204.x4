REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,26,931,1982)
SAMPLE     Pure (99.9% or 3N) target foils of Y,Zr and in some
           gases vapor deposited Sr were stacked with monitor
           and guard aluminum (5N) foils, each being about 20 mum.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,CUM,SIG,,,EVAL)
MONIT-REF  (,J.Tobailem+,R,CEA-N-1466(1),1971)
           Exact thickness was determined by weighting
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2BLGLVN) Louvain-La-Neuve (59,75 and 80 MeV)
           (ISOCY,2FR PAR) Orsay-SC (150,168 and 200 MeV)
           (LINAC,2FR SAC) Saturne-II (1 and 2.5 GeV)

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1,,1.) Error in homogeneity and purity of
              target foils
           (ERR-2,2.,4.) Errors associated with monitoring were
             2-4% for counting of Na
           (MONIT-ERR) uncertainty in monitor reaction
                       cross section.
           (ERR-3,5.,10.) Uncertainty in the efficiency of the
                          detector
           (ERR-4,3.,10.) Uncertainty in the photopeak integration
                          and statistical errors

METHOD     (ASEP) Several months after irradiation targets and
           blank foils were stored (ten a time) in an extraction
           system in which an ultrahigh vacuum (better than
           10**(-9) Torr) was progressively attained by pumping
           and baking all elements. Targets were baked several
           days at 80. to 100. degr.C and authors checked that
           this procedure did not outgas any spallogenic
           krypton. Each foil was then melted inside a
           molybdenum crucible heated by an electronic
           bombardment oven routinely operating at 1900.degr.C.
           Extracted gases were exposed in two step to Ti and
           Cu-O-Pd getters between 700. and 200.degr.C for
           eliminating active species. Krypton(95-98%) was then
           adsorbed on a first activated charcoal trap at -120
           degr. The remainder was adsorbed together with 98-99%
           argon on a second trap at -196 degr.C. Argon and
           krypton were successively introduced into mass
           spectrometer.

METHOD     (ASEP) Several months after irradiation targets and
           blank foils were stored (ten a time) in an extraction
           system in which an ultrahigh vacuum (better than
           10**(-9) Torr) was progressively attained by pumping
           and baking all elements. Targets were baked several
           days at 80. to 100. degr.C and authors checked that
           this procedure did not outgas any spallogenic
           krypton. Each foil was then melted inside a
           molybdenum crucible heated by an electronic
           bombardment oven routinely operating at 1900.degr.C.
           Extracted gases were exposed in two step to Ti and
           Cu-O-Pd getters between 700. and 200.degr.C for
           eliminating active species. Krypton(95-98%) was then
           adsorbed on a first activated charcoal trap at -120
           degr. The remainder was adsorbed together with 98-99%
           argon on a second trap at -196 degr.C. Argon and
           krypton were successively introduced into mass
           spectrometer.

SAMPLE     A Vapor-deposited Sr target,0.16 mg/cm**2 thick
ANALYSIS   All results average two to four independent measurement
           weighted by individual errors.
COMMENT    From authors: Unfortunately, the deposit broke during
           preparation or handling of the stack, so that only the
           isotopic composition of spallation produced krypton

METHOD     (ASEP) Several months after irradiation targets and
           blank foils were stored (ten a time) in an extraction
           system in which an ultrahigh vacuum (better than
           10**(-9) Torr) was progressively attained by pumping
           and baking all elements. Targets were baked several
           days at 80. to 100. degr.C and authors checked that
           this procedure did not outgas any spallogenic
           krypton. Each foil was then melted inside a
           molybdenum crucible heated by an electronic
           bombardment oven routinely operating at 1900.degr.C.
           Extracted gases were exposed in two step to Ti and
           Cu-O-Pd getters between 700. and 200.degr.C for
           eliminating active species. Krypton(95-98%) was then
           adsorbed on a first activated charcoal trap at -120
           degr. The remainder was adsorbed together with 98-99%
           argon on a second trap at -196 degr.C. Argon and
           krypton were successively introduced into mass
           spectrometer.
SAMPLE     A Vapor-deposited Sr target,0.16 mg/cm**2 thick, was
           used.
ANALYSIS   All results average two to four independent measurement
           weighted by individual errors.
COMMENT    From authors: Unfortunately, the deposit broke during
           preparation or handling of the stack, so that only the
           isotopic composition of spallation produced krypton
           could be obtained.
