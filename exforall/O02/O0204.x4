           Was Adsorbed Together with 98-99% Argon on a Second
           Trap at -196 Degrees. Argon and Krypton were
           Successively Introduced Into Mass Spectrometer.
SAMPLE     A Vapor-Deposited Sr Target,0.16 Mg/Cm**2 Thick,was
           Used.

METHOD     (ASEP). Several Months After Irradiation Targets and
           Blank  Foils  were  Stored (TEN A TIME) In an Extration
           System in Which an Ultrahigh Vacuum (BETTER THEN 10**-9
           TORR)  Was Progressively Attained by Pumping and Baking
           All Elements. Targets were Baked Several Days at 80 to
           100 Centigrades and Authors Checked That this
           Procedure did not Outgas Anyspallogenic Krypton. Each
           Foil was Then Melted Inside a Molybdenum Crucible
           Heated by an Electronic Bombardment Oven Routinely
           Operating at 1900 Centigrades. Extracted Gases were
           Exposed in Two Step to Ti and Cu-O-Pd Getters Between
           700 and 200 Centigrades For Eliminating Active
           Species. Krypton(95-98%) Was Then Adsorbed on a First
           Activated Charcoal Trap at -120 Degrees. The Remainder
