SAMPLE     The target, in form of stripped metal foils of
           different thicknesses with isotopic enrichment of
           Pb-204 to 47.9%,Pb-206-23.7%,Pb-207-11.6%,Pb-208-16.8%,
           were used. The targets were cut into 6 mm diameter
           discs. These discs were weighed, marked and grouped
           into 2 stacks. The first stack consisted of 18 targets
           with thicknesses between 88 and 118 mg/cm**2. The total
           thickness of this stack was 1.86 g/cm**2. The second
           stack was formed of 42 foils with thicknesses ranging
           from 42 to 83 mg/cm**2. The total thickness of the
           second stack was 3.24 g/cm**2.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV)
           (EDEG) The thin natural lead foils were stacked in
           front of the stack of lead-204 stack as a beam degrader
           from primary 73 MeV to 40 MeV.
           (GSPEC) The measurements of gamma-activities equipped
           with HPGe detector were started after the activities
           of the parents Bi-200,Bi-201,Bi-202 had decayed to
           Pb-200,Pb-201 and Pb-202.
REL-REF    (M,O0306001,C.Deptula+,J,NKA,35,3,1990) - error
             analysis is given
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total cross sections was obtained by
           summing up in squares all the individual errors (see
           REL-REF for details).
           The values reported with uncertainties represent the
           average of three determinations.
