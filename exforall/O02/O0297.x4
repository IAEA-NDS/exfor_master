SAMPLE     The Target,in Form of Stripped Metal Foils of Different
           Thicknesses with Isotopic Enrichment of Pb-204
           To 47.9%,Pb-206-23.7%,Pb-207-11.6%,Pb-208-16.8%, were
           Used.The Targets were Cut Into 6 mm Diameter Discs.
           These Discs were Weighed, Marked and Grouped Into
            2 Stacks. The First Stack Consisted of 18 Targets with
           Thicknesses Between 88 and 118 Mg/Cm**2. The Total
           Thickness of this Stack was 1.86 G/Cm**2. The Second
           Stack was Formed of 42 Foils with Thicknesses Ranging
           From 42 to 83 Mg/Cm**2. The Total Thickness of the
           Second Stack was 3.24 G/Cm**2.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE).Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy

METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB)
           (ACTIV)
           (EDEG) The Thin Natural Lead Foils were Stacked in
           Front of the Stack of Lead-204 Stack As a Beam Degrader
           From Primary 73 MeV to 40 MeV.
           (GSPEC).The Measurements of Gamma-Activities Equipped
           With Hpge Detector were Started After the Activities
           Of the Parents Bi-200,Bi-201,Bi-202 had Decayed to
           Pb-200,Pb-201 and Pb-202.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           The Total Cross Sections was Obtained by Summing Up in
           Squares All the Individual Errors.
           The Values Reported with Uncertainties Represent the
           Average of Three Determinations.
