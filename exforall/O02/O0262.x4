SAMPLE     Targets in foil form were used. The carbon target was
           in the form of polystyrene. Beryllium foil was 0.002-in
           thickness. The Co and Zn foils were prepared by
           electroplating from an aqueous solution on to a
           polished piece of stainless steel. The amount of oxygen
           contamination in each of the target were obtained.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,BCINT)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error including:
             * The statistical error
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the determination of the area
           under the elastic scattering peak (with the exception
           of the few cases).
           (ERR-2) Error in beam current measurement
             Errors in other parameters were negligible compared
             to those mentioned above.
CORRECTION Needed corrections for geometry and multiple scattering
ADD-RES    (P-SPC)
           Calculation of the corrections on multiple scattering.

COMMENT    -By Authors- Oxygen Contimination 2.5% by Weight. Zn
           Has Five Stable Isotopes and in All But One of these
           The Lowest Level Appears to be Higher Than One MeV.
           Zn-67 /4.1% Abundance/ has a Number of Low-Lying
           States. On the Basis of Reasonable Estimates of the
           Excitation of these States, It is Possible That the
           Elastic Points Might be 1% High at the Minima in the
           Elastic Cross Section with Negligible Error Elsewhere.

COMMENT    -By Authors- Energy Levels at 0.04, 0.295, 0.357, and
           0.49 MeV. The 0.49-MeV Level Appeared Quite Strongly
           And was Separated Out by Pulse-Height Analysis at All
           Angles. However, this Separation is Just at the Limit
           Of Resolution and Considerable Error Might be Present
           At Some Angles For this Element. In Particular, at the
           95-Degree Minimum in the Elastic Cross Section an 11%
           Correction is Required. It is Estimated That the Limits
           Of Error on this Subtraction are 11+-5%. At the 145-
           Degree Minimum a Subtraction of 25+-10% was Necessary.
           The Error Due to Subtractionof Inelastic Scattering to
           The 0.49-MeV Level is Negligible For Angles Less Than
           80 Degrees. The Marked Presence of the 0.49-MeV Level
           Would Mask any Asymmetry in the Elastic Peak Caused by
           The 0.295- And 0.357-MeV Levels. All Three of these
           Levels are Included Inthe Elastic Peak at All Angles.

COMMENT    -By Authors- Scattering to a Level at 0.44+-0.03 MeV
           Was Observed. At the Time this was Observed, It had not
           Been Previously Reported, But Since Then a Level at
           Approximately this Energy has Been Detected in Coulomb
           Excitation Experiments, Scattering to this Level was
           Observed to be Essentially Identical with That to the
           Rhodium Level at the Same Energy and the Same Remarks
           Can be Made About the Errors in the Silver Curve As
           Were Made For Rhodium. The Ag Level
           At 0.09 MeV would Certainly have Been Included in the
           Elastic Peak, and any Asymmetry Due to the 0.31-MeV
           Level would have Been Masked by the Higher Level.

COMMENT    -By Authors- There are Six Stable Isotopes with Many
           Levels Below 0.4 MeV, and any Inelastic Scattering to
           These Levels is Included in the Elastic Peak. However,
           These Levels are Apparently Much Less Strongly Excited
           Than Similar Levels For Medium Atomic Mass Nuclei,
           Since the Elastic Peak Shows No Distortion and There is
           Very Little Inelastic Scattering Observed Outside the
           Elastic Peak. Since the Cross Section Decreased Almost
           Monotonically with Increasing Angle, the Worst Possible
           Cases are in the Range from 140 Degrees to 170 Degrees.
           From the Shape of the Curve and the Lack of Appreciable
           Low-Energy Tail, It is Estimated That the Elastic Curve
           Might be at Most 3% Too High in this Region. Any Error
           Due to Inelastic Scattering would be Negligible at
           Lower Angles.
