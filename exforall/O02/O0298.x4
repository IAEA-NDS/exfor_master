HISTORY    (19970221C)
           (19970303U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     High Purity Metal Foils of Tc were Used. The Thickness
           Of Tc Foils were Determined by the Weight and Area
           Measurements For Each Individual Foil. The Stack
           Consisted of 25 Numbered Tc-Foils Each of Square Shape-
           -Dimensions 15+-0.2mm*15+-0.2mm, 0.2+-0.01mm Thickness,
           Weights Varied Between 0.4147 and 0.5079G- Was Exposed
           To an External Proton Beam.

           One Additional Measurement was Carried Out at the
           Bombarding Proton Energy 35.4+-0.3 MeV at the Cyclotron
           U-120M  of the Nuclear Research Institute, Czechoslovak
           Academy of Siences,Rez.

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
           (EXTB,BCINT)
           (GSPEC)
           The Stack was Irradieted For 6-7 Hours with a Proton
           Beam Current of 50-100 Nanoamperes.
           The Stacks were Repeatedely Measured Over a Period of
           Several Days.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           The  Total Errors in the Cross Section were Obtained by
           Taking Square Roots of the Sums of the Squares  of  All
           The  Individual  Errors,  Like  Those  in the Detection
           Efficiency, Counting Geometry and Statistics,
           Attenuation Corrections, Proton Beam Monitoring, Decay
           Schemes,  Computer  Spectral  Integration,  Etc.  The
           Resulting Total Error is Thus Partly Systematic and
           Amounts to Between 10-15%.  On Average, the Error in
           Cross Sections was a High As 15%.
