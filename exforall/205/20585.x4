                                            device described.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) 70 MeV electron Linac of
                                             the CBNM at Geel.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)    Fast neutron produced by bombarding
            uranium target with the 70 MeV electron beam.
            Thermal and resonance neutrons produced by slowing
            down in two 4 cm thick polyethylene disks.
SAMPLE      Pu 241 acetate layer  sprayed on a 0.2 mm Al disk.
            Thickness 1.08 milli-g/cm2,diameter 60 mm.
            Isotopic composition in atoms percent.
            0.011 Of Pu238, 1.046 of Pu239, 3.657 of Pu240,
            93.432 of Pu241, 1.854 of Pu242.
METHOD     (TOF)   8.1 m flight path.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)    Four large(6.cm**2) Si-Au surface-barrier
            detectors. Aluminium  screens of different thickness
            inserted between sample and detectors for ternary
            fission measurements.
ANALYSIS    Ratio ternary to binary of the areas under the
            strongest resonances were calculated.
PART-DET   (FF)    Fission fragments for binary fissions.
           (A)    Alphas for ternary fissions.
COMMENT     Correlations between the T/B values and the spin
            of the resonances are made in terms of the
            channel theory of fission.
CORRECTION .Background, influence of Pu239 and Am241 estimated
            as negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Only statistical  errors given.

REACTION   (94-PU-241(N,F)2-HE-4,TER,FY,,RES/REL)
             Alpha-particle accompanied ternary fissions.
            Ternary to binary fission ratios are normalized to the
            value 100 for the 10.95 eV resonance.
COMMENT     Data-heading keyword EN-RES denotes  resonance
            energy or middle of energy interval, no details
            given in reference.
