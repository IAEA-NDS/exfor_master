AUTHOR     (W.DILG)
TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON-PROTON TOTAL CROSS
            SECTION AT 132 EV-.
FACILITY   .FRM RESEARCH REACTOR, MUNICH.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON BEAM AT 132 EV FROM RESONANCE
            SCATTERING ON COBALT. NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD ABOUT
            5.6 EV.
SAMPLE     .LIQUIDS IN STAINLESS STEEL CYLINDERS WITH QUARTZ
            WINDOWS. REACTOR GRADE WATER (RESISTIVITY = 2M-0HMS
            CM), BENZENE (99.9 PERCENT WITH 0.011 PERCENT WATER,
            METHANOL (99.8 PERCENT, 0.1 PERCENT WATER, TOLUENE
            OF PURITY 99.7 PERCENT, 0.02 PERCENT WATER.
METHOD     .TRANSMISSION.
DETECTOR   .RESONANCE ACTIVATION OF FOIL.
MONITOR    .ABSOLUTE.
COMMENT    .NEUTRON PROTON X-SECTIONS WERE DERIVED FROM TOTAL
            X-SECTION MEASUREMENTS ON EACH LIQUID BY SUBTRACTION
            OF THE CARBON AND OXYGEN TOTAL X-SECTIONS, USING
            THE ADOPTED VALUES  SIGMA(C) = 4.746+-0.005 B AND
            SIGMA(O) = 3.761+-0.007 B. PRINCIPAL SOURCES ARE
            ZN/A,26,442,7103 FOR C, AND  PL/B,36,208,7109 FOR O.
STATUS     .NUMERICAL VALUES PUBLISHED IN TEXT.
HISTORY    (760618C)
           (761217E)
CORRECTION .TOTAL X-SECTIONS CORRECTED FOR DEAD TIME LOSSES,
            AIR SCATTERING WITHOUT SAMPLE, INSCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS .STANDARD DEVIATION OF COUNTING STATISTICS AND
            SYSTEMATIC ERRORS FOR SAMPLE PURITY,DENSITY,
            TEMPERATURE AND LENGTH, AND CORRECTION ERRORS
            FOR DEAD TIME AND INSCATTERING.

COMMENT    .FREE SCATTERING X-SECTION FOR ZERO NEUTRON ENERGY
            DERIVE FROM TOTAL X-SECTIONS AT 132EV. THE QUOTED
            VALUE FROM THE PREVIOUS MOST ACCURATE VALUE FROM
            HOUK PR/C,3,1836,71 OF 20.436+-0.023B. THE
            DIFFERENCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A SYSTEMATIC SHIFT
            IN HOUK S DATA ABOVE 50 EV FROM FAST NEUTRON
            BACKGROUND OR RESOLUTION AFFECTING THE FIRST
            TIMMING CHANNELS.
            NEW VALUES FOR N-P SINGLET AND TRIPLET SCATTERING
            LENGTHS AND EFFECTIVE RANGES ARE GIVEN.

CORRECTION .CORRECTED FOR CAPTURE, EFFECTIVE RANGE, MOLECULAR
            BINDING AND DEUTERIUM CONCENTRATION.
ERR-ANALYS .ERROR INCLUDES STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC
            EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS, OXYGEN AND CARBON X-SECTION
            ERRORS AND UNCERTAINTY IN MOLECULAR BINDING.
