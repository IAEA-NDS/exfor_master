TITLE      -RADIATIVE NEUTRON CAPTURE ON SI,RB,SR AND Y IN THE
            DIPOLE GIANT RESONANCE REGION.-
FACILITY    SAMES ELECTROSTATIC ACCELERATOR
           .BEAM INTENSITY ON TARGET IS 2 MICRO-A.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    T(D,N)-RECTION, THE KINETIC ENERGY OF
            NEUTRON AT ANGLE OF ABOUT 97 DEG IS 14.06 +- 0.01 MEV.
SAMPLE      NATURAL SAMPLES. CYLINDERS WITH 3 CM DIAMETER
            AND 5 CM LENGTH.
           .SI IS A POLYCRYSTALLINE INGOT, RB AND SR ARE USED AS
            CARBONATES, AND Y AS AN OXIDE.
            CHEMICAL PURITY IS BETTER THAN 99 PERCENT.
METHOD     (TOF  )    TOF METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF THE ENERGY
            OF INCIDENT NEUTRONS AND FOR DISCRIMINATION OF PHOTONS
            FROM NEUTRON SCATTERED BY THE SAMPLE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) PLASTIC NE-102 SCINTILLATOR OF 100 MICRON FOR
            ALPHA DETECTION FROM T(D,N)-REACTION, WITH 56AVP PHOTO
            MULTIPLIER. 1.2 MU AL-FOIL PREVENTS DIFFUSED DEUTERONS
            OR BACKGROUND PARTICLES FROM ALPHA-DETECTION.
           .AN ALPHA-PARTICLE COUNT ALSO SERVED AS MONITOR.
           (NAICR)    A CYLINDRICAL NAI(TL) OF 12.7*12.7 CM2,
            COUPLED TO A FAST PHOTOMULTIPLIER XP 1040.
           .PULSES FROM GAMMA-DETECTOR ARE REGISTERED IN A MULTI-
            CHANNEL ANALYSER, WHICH IS GATED BY COINCIDENCE PULSES
            BETWEEN THE TIME-TO-PULSE-HEIGHT-CONVERTER SIGNAL AND
            THE LINEAR ALPHA-PARTICLE DETECTOR SIGNAL.
           .ENERGY RESOLUTION OF GAMMA IS ABOUT 2 MEV IN THE
            REGION OF INTEREST. THE LINEARITY IS VERIFIED. AND
            ENERGY UNCERTAINTY IS LOWER THAN 250 KEV.
           .TIME RESOLUTION OF THE SPECTROMETER IS 3 NS.
           .ALPHA PARTICLE DETECTOR IS AT 97 DEGREES
            WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT DEUTERON BEAM.
           .THE AXIS OF THE GAMMA-DETECTOR AND THE DIRECTION OF
            INCIDENT NEUTRONS ARE PERPENDICULAR. A LEAD ABSORBER
            SHIELDS THE NAI CRYSTAL FROM DIRECT NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS    DIRECT AND COLLECTIVE CAPTURE MECHANISM INCLUDING
            THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.
MONITOR     ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS
PART-DET   (G    ) GAMMAS.
