TITLE       Delayed-neutrons from arsenic isotopes 84As, 85As
            and 86As
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMNZ) Fast pneumatic tube system of the Mainz
           reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flashes of 0.1 sec duration and
            about 1.e+14 neutrons/cm2 maximum flux.
SAMPLE       0.50 mg of U-235 and known activity of As-74 (17.7 d)
            dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.1 N HNO3 and sealed in small
           glass capsules.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Two chemical separations :
           - by selective absorbtion, complete within 2.5sec,
           - solvent extraction step added, complete within 5.0sec
DETECTOR   (PROPC)    He-3 counter of about 4 % efficiency and
            3 counts/min background - for neutrons counting.
           (NAICR)    3 * 3 inch NaI(Tl) scintillator for As-74
            activities.
           (GELI)    Gamma-ray spectra of short-lived arsenic,
           selenium and bromine isotopes by a 40 cm3  Ge(Li)
           detector with a resolution of 2.8 keV FWHM at 1332 keV.
COMMENT    Of authors.The neutron flux was not monitored since the
            integrated fluxes recorded with a fission chamber were
            found to be reproducible within +- 3 % .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are 2 standard deviations in article.
            However exact calculations of errors were not always
           possible.
            Error valuse were re-calculated by compiler from
            two sigma to one sigma.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Neutron decay curve was analyzed
            Delayed neutron yields (As-84, 985) were obtained by
           comparing the neutron activities in the As fraction
           with those of the corresponding delayed-neutron groups
           in unseparated samples of U-235, irradiated and
           counted under the same  conditions.
            Delayed neutron yields for As-86 was obtained from
           0.8 sec activity amounting ~ 7 % of 2.0 sec component.
