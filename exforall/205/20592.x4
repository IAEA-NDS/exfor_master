TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF AVERAGE CROSS SECTION FOR TH232(N,
            2N)TH231 REACTION TO NEUTRONS WITH FISSION-TYPE
            REACTOR SPECTRUM AND OF GAMMA-RAY INTENSITIES OF
            TH231-
FACILITY   .KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR (KUR).
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    IRRADIATION IN KUR CORE.
INC-SPECT  .VERY CLOSE TO FISSION SPECTRUM ABOVE 1 MEV.
SAMPLE     .AT IRRADIATION 0.5 G OF THORIUM NITRATE.
           .AT DETECTION,AFTER CHEMICAL SEPARATION (SEE DETAILS
            IN P.493 OF MAIN REFERENCE),FOUR SEPARATED FOILS
            0.8 CM**2 OF SURFACE.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION.
