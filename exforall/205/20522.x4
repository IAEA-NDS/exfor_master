INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT   80% of neutrons have an energy of 14.7 +- 0.3 MeV
            for thin sample (S32,Ca40,Ge70,Y89 and La139).
            However, for measurements on Cr50, Fe54, Zn64, Mo92
            and Au197, due to the sample thickness, the mean
            energy of neutrons was around 14.6 +- 0.4 MeV.
            N-flux density was about (7 to 9)*E+9/cm2/sec.
           (EN-RSL-HW) Energy spread value
SAMPLE      High purity target in powder form.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation in combination with specific
            radiochemical methods.
            Each value is based on four or more independent
            measurements.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) For some nuclide, gamma-gamma coincidence
            unit employing two 12.5 * 7.5 cm NaI(Tl) crystals.
           (GELI)  Ge(Li) detector, 28 cm3, connected to a 4000

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The major error originated from
            poor counting statistics. Other sources of error were
            the uncertainties in the cross-sections of monitor
            reactions and the various uncertainties involved in
            obtaining the disintegration rates.
             Confidence level of 90% cross-sections have errors
             of about 30%.
