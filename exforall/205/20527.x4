TITLE       Some activation cross-sections for 14.7 MeV neutrons
            on nickel

FACILITY   (CCW,2UK DUR) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux was monitored with a proton recoil
            counter.
           (EN-RSL-HW) Standard deviation
            The mean neutron energy and its standard deviation
            were estimated as 14.7 +- 0.2 MeV, when allowance is
            made for the variation of neutron energy as a function
            of angle to the beam, and of the decrease in energy of
            the beam as it penetrates the target.
SAMPLE      Nickel oxide, 0.7800+-0.0003 g. of Ni/g. of Ni-O,
            in a Ni-O/Fe mixture irradiated in a cylindrical
            polyethylene container.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
            After irradiation of NiO/Fe mixture, rapid clean
            separation was performed by electromagnet.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 76 * 76 mm NaI crystal.
           (GEMUC) Separated Fe was counted by G-M counter after
           dissolving in a standard acid mixture.

CORRECTION  A carrier free solution of Co-58 used for calibration
            was found to contain a small quantity of Co-60.
            Appropriate corrections were made.
COMMENT     Co-58 was determined using the 811 keV photo-peak, and
            the system was calibrated for Co-58 by 4pi beta-gamma
            coincidence counting.

COMMENT     The determination of the nickel reaction was done
            via the daughter nucleus Co-57.
            The determination of Co-57 was carried out using the
            122 (+136) keV peak.
            The system was calibrated for Co-57 by 4pi beta-gamma
            coincidence counting.
