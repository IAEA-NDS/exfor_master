TITLE      -SOME ACTIVATION CROSS-SECTIONS FOR 14.7 MEV NEUTRONS
            ON NICKEL.-
FACILITY   (CCW  )    COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    DEUTERON-TRITIUM, TITANIUM-TRITIUM TARGET.
INC-SPECT   14.7 +- 0.2 MEV NEUTRON ENERGY.
            NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED WITH A PROTON RECOIL
            COUNTER.
SAMPLE      NICKEL OXIDE, 0.7800+-0.0003 GR. OF NI/GR. OF NI-O,
            IN A NI-O/FE MIXTURE IRRADIATED IN A CYLINDRICAL
            POLYETHILENE CONTAINER.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION,
            AFTER IRRADIATION OF NIO/FE MIXTURE, RAPID CLEAN
            SEPARATION WAS PERFORMED BY ELECTROMAGNET.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    76 * 76 MM NAI CRYSTAL.
           .SEPARATED FE WAS COUNTED BY G-M COUNTER AFTER DISSOLV-
            ING IN A STANDARD ACID MIXTURE.

COMMENT     CO-58 WAS DETERMINED USING THE 811 KEV PHOTO-PEAK, AND
            THE SYSTEM WAS CALIBRATED FOR CO-58 BY 4PI BETA-GAMMA

CORRECTION  A CARRIER FREE SOLUTION OF CO-58 USED FOR CALIBRATION
            WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN A SMALL
            QUANTITY OF CO-60.  APPROPRIATE CORRECTIONS WERE MADE.
