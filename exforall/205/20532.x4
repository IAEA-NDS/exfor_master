TITLE      -GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA FOLLOWING THE CAPTURE OF 14 MEV
            NEUTRONS BY 27-CO-59, 41-NB-93 AND 45-RH-103.-
FACILITY    SAMES ELECTROSTATIC ACCELERATOR, DEUTERON ENERGY
            OF 200 KEV. BEAM INTENSITY ON TARGET IS CA 2 MICRO-A.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    T(D,N)-REACTION.
SAMPLE      CYLINDERS (3 CM DIA., 5 CM LONG). NIOBIUM
            AND RHODIUM SAMPLES ARE METALIC, COBALT IS IN OXIDE.
METHOD     (TOF  )    TIME OF FLIGHT IS USED TO REDUCED THE BACK-
            GROUND DUE TO SCATTERED NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    CYLINDRICAL NAI(TL) SCINTILLATOR.
ANALYSIS    THE CROSS-SECTIONS ARE CALCULATED BY INTEGRATING
            THE GAMMA-SPECTRUM OVER THE EXCITATION ENERGY INTERVAL
            FROM THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE NEUTRONS TO THIS
            ENERGY PLUS THE NEUTRON BINDING ENERGY.
MONITOR     ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT
PART-DET   (G    ) GAMMAS
COMMENT     COMPARISONS OF THE MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS WITH
            CALCULATIONS BASED ON THE DIRECT AND COLLECTIVE
            CAPTURE MODELS WERE MADE WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS.
