TITLE      -THERMAL-NEUTRON FISSION CROSS SECTION OF RA-226.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    THERMAL COLUMN IRRADIATION FACILITY OF
            KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR, KUR.
INC-SPECT   IRRADIATION CONDITIONS WERE, (UNIT OF FLUX N/CM2/SEC),
            CHEM.PROC. N-FLUX(THR) N-FLUX(FAST) CD-RATIO(AU) IRR.
               A       7.2 * E+10  9.9 * E+7    5210.       77HR.
               B       9.2 * E+10  8.8 * E+7    8190.       75.5HR
SAMPLE     .RA-226 CHLORIDE SOLUTION WAS PURIFIED FROM THORIUM AND
            URANIUM IN TWO WAYS TO ENSURE THAT CONTAMINATION WAS
            NEGLIGIBLE (SEE TEXT,PAG.487 FOR DETAILS).
            THE PURIFIED RA-226 CHLORIDE SOLUTION WAS DROPPED
            ONTO A CIRCULAR AREA OF DIAMETER 0.5 CM ON
            POLYCARBONATE FILM AND DRIED. TARGET THICKNESS WAS
            LESS THAN 10 MICROGR./CM**2.
METHOD     .THE SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED FOR ABOUT 70 HR. THE
            CROSS-SECTION WAS DEDUCED BY TRACK LENGTH MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (TRD  )    FISSION TRACK DETECTOR, THIN POLYCARBONATE
            FILM (TEIJIN-PANLITE).
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN
            AS 98.8B FOR THERMAL FLUX MONITOR.
           .FAST FLUX MONITORED WITH THE TH-232(N,F) CROSS SECTION
            USING A VALUE OF 78MB.
PART-DET   (FF)       FISSION FRAGMENTS.
