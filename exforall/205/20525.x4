SAMPLE     .RA-226 CHLORIDE SOLUTION WAS PURIFIED FROM THORIUM AND
            URANIUM IN TWO WAYS TO ENSURE THAT CONTAMINATION WAS
            NEGLIGIBLE (SEE TEXT,PAG.487 FOR DETAILS).
            THE PURIFIED RA-226 CHLORIDE SOLUTION WAS DROPPED
            ONTO A CIRCULAR AREA OF DIAMETER 0.5 CM ON
            POLYCARBONATE FILM AND DRIED. TARGET THICKNESS WAS
            LESS THAN 10 MICROGR./CM**2.
METHOD     .THE SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED FOR ABOUT 70 HR. THE
            CROSS-SECTION WAS DEDUCED BY TRACK LENGTH MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (TRD  )    FISSION TRACK DETECTOR, THIN POLYCARBONATE
            FILM (TEIJIN-PANLITE).
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN
            AS 98.8B FOR THERMAL FLUX MONITOR.
           .FAST FLUX MONITORED WITH THE TH-232(N,F) CROSS SECTION
            USING A VALUE OF 78MB.
