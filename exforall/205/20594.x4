TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF AVERAGE CROSS SECTION FOR U233(N,
            2N)U232 REACTION-
FACILITY   .KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR (KUR)
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    CORE OF THE KUR   ,IRRADIATION TIME OF
            48 HOURS AT 4000 KW OF REACTOR POWER.
INC-SPECT  .ENERGY SPECTRUM OF FAST NEUTRONS ABOVE 1 MEV VERY
            CLOSE TO FISSION SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .PURIFIED SAMPLE OF U233 OBTAINED FROM IRRADIATION
            IN THE KUR THERMAL COLUMN OF THORIUM SAMPLES WITH
            LATER     CHEMICAL SEPARATION. DETAILS IN P.669 OF
            NUCL.SCI.TECHN.,10,668(1973).
           .CONCENTRATION OF U232 ABOUT 3.E-9.
METHOD     (ACTIV)      MEASUREMENT OF THE NUMBER OF ATOMS OF
            U-233 AND U-232 BY ALPHA-RAY COUNTING BEFORE AND
            AFTER IRRADIATION AND MONITORING OF THE MEAN FAST
            NEUTRON FLUX.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)      FOR ALPHA-RAY COUNTING SILICON DETECTOR.
           (GELI )      A GE-LI DETECTOR WITH PREVIOUSLY
            CALIBRATED EFFICIENCY WAS USED FOR MEASURING THE
            ACTIVITIES INDUCED BY NEUTRONS IN SEVERAL SAMPLES
            IN ORDER TO DETERMINATE THE AVERAGE FAST NEUTRON
            FLUX. SEE STANDARD FOR MORE DETAILS.
