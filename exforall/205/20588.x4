TITLE      -THE U238(N,ALPHA)TH235 REACTION WITH THERMAL
            NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   .HIGH FLUX REACTOR OF THE LAUE-LANGEVIN INSTITUTE,
            GRENOBLE.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)   87 M CURVED NEUTRON GUIDE TUBE.
INC-SPECT  .VERY PURE THERMAL SPECTRUM. RATIO OF THE NUMBER
            OF SLOW NEUTRONS TO THAT OF EPITHERMAL AND FAST
            NEUTRONS ABOUT 10E+6. DIRECT GAMMA-RAY FLUX FROM
            REACTOR REDUCED BY A FACTOR  1.E+6.
           .VERY INTENSE NEUTRON FLUX =  1.E+9 CM-2.SEC-1.
SAMPLE     .U238 LAYER PREPARED BY EVAPORATION OF UF4 ON A THIN
            VYNS FOIL COVERED WITH GOLD. THICKNESS OF UF4 = 200
            +-10 MICRO-G/CM**2.
           .ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IN ATOMS PERCENT =
            0.00016+-0.00001 OF U234, 0.01755+-0.00005 OF U235,
            LESS THAN 0.00001 OF U236,
            99.9823+-0.0001 OF U238.
METHOD     (PHD  )  PULSE-HEIGHT ANALYSIS.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)  GOLD-SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR,
            RESOLUTION = 30 KEV FOR 5 MEV ALPHA PARTICLES.
ANALYSIS   .U238(N,ALPHA) CROSS SECTION OBTAINED BY NORMALIZING
            THE ALPHA PARTICLE SPECTRUM TO THE KNOWN THERMAL
            NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION CROSS SECTION OF U235.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
           .ENERGY CALIBRATION WAS BASED ON THE KNOWN ENERGY OF
            THE NATURAL ALPHA PARTICLES EMITTED BY U238 AND
            RN220 AND ITS DAUGHTER PRODUCTS PRODUCED FROM
            CONTROLED TH232 IMPURITY PRESENT IN THE VACUUM
            CHAMBER.
COMMENT    .PRESENT VALUE IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER
            THAN PREVIOUS UPPER LIMIT.
           .WITH OBTAINED VALUE OF ALPHA ENERGY THE Q-ALPH VALUE
            OF THE REACTION AND THE MASS AND Q-BETA VALUES OF
            TH225 ARE DEDUCED
           .LARGE ALPHA PARTICLE CLUSTERING PROBABILITY FOR
            THE U239 COMPOUND SYSTEM IS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
            FOR THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL VALUE
            AND STATISTICAL MODEL CALCULATIONS.
