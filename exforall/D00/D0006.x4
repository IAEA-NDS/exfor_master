TITLE      UNIFIED ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR
           NEUTRON PRODUCTION BY THE HYDROGEN ISOTOPES FOR CHARGED
           PARTICLE ENERGIES BETWEEN 6 AND 17 MEV.
                ** PART II H-2(D,N)HE-3    EXPERIMENT **
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALAS)
            WITH A TIME OF FLIGHT SYSTEM. KLYSTRON BUNCHER USED.
INC-SPECT  THE ENTRANCE FOIL WAS MOLYBDENUM AND THE BEAM STOP WAS
           MADE OF GOLD.
           THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE ENERGY LOSS IS KNOWN TO ABOUT
           +-0.02MEV. THE ENERGY SPREAD IS LESS THAN 0.1MEV(FWHM).
SAMPLE     THE TARGET(SAMPLE) CELL, ABOUT 3 CM LONG, WAS FILLED
           WITH DEUTERIUM AT A PRESSURE OF CA. 1.7 ATM.  THE CELL
           WAS COOLED BY A FINE JET OF AIR
METHOD     (TOF) FLIGHT PATH = 256 CM. QUASI-ABSOLUTE METHOD.
           THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
           WAS DETERMINED ORIGINALLY BY H-1(N,N)H-1 AND IT WAS
           CHECKED OVER A WIDE RANGE BY MEANS OF H-3(D,N)HE-4
           REACTION AND H-2(T,N)HE-4 REACTION.
           TO ESTABLISH AN ABSOLUTE SCALE FOR THE TOF MEASUREMENTS
           THE SAME CROSS-SECTION STANDARD AND THE SAME EXPERIMENT
           CONDITIONS WERE USED FOR ALL 3 REACTIONS, H-3(P,N)HE-3,
           H-3(D,N)HE-4 AND H-2(D,N)HE-3 (AND ALSO FOR H2(T,N)HE4)
           THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP HAS BEEN CALIBRATED WITH
           APPROPRIATE REFERENCE CROSS SECTION, RATHER THAN
           NORMALIZING RELATIVE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION TO AN
           ABSOLUTE 0-DEG EXCITATION.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           12 CM DIAMETER BY 6-CM LONG LIQUID SCINTILLATOR, NE-213
            COUPLED TO A 56 AVP PHOTO-TUBE.

           CURVE BY H-1(N,EL)H-1 SCATTERING EXPERIMENT.
CORRECTION TO OBTAIN THE DATA WITH ACCURACY AS CLOSE TO 1 PERCENT
           AS POSSIBLE, WHENEVER AN EFFECT WAS FOUND TO BE LARGER
           THAN 0.5 PERCENT, THE DATA WERE CORRECTED CORRES-
           PONDINGLY.
ERR-ANALYS THE COMBINATION OF THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY WITH THE
           UNCERTAINTY OF THE BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION.
