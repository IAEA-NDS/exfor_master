ANALYSIS  1Experiment 1. Mean value for 10 targets of different
           weight.
          2Experiment 2. Mean value for 10 targets of different
           weight.
SAMPLE     Copper targets were prepared frompure copper (99.9%)
           foil supplied by the Royal Mint Refinery. A 2.135 cm
           diameter (nomilally 13/16") punch was used to punch
           out foils which were 4.9 mg/cm2 thick.

SAMPLE     The aluminium was supplied by BACO Aluminium Foils Ltd.
           as 99.99% pure, and was rolled to an average density of
           7.25 mg/cm2. Each target was punched to the same area
            (3.467 cm2) weighted, and then sandwiched between
           similar aluminium foils.
