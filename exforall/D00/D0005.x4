TITLE      Unified absolute differential cross sections for
           neutron production by the hydrogen isotopes for charged
           particle energies between 6 and 17 MeV.
                ** part I   H-3(p,n)He-3    experiment **
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALAS)
            with a time of flight system. Klystron buncher used.
INC-SPECT  the entrance foil and the beam stop were made of Ni-58.
           the absolute value of the energy loss is known to about
           +-0.02MeV. the energy spread is less than 0.1MeV(fwhm).
SAMPLE     The target(sample) cell, about 3 cm long, was filled
           with tritium at a pressure of ca. 1.7 atm.  the cell
           was cooled by a fine jet of air
METHOD     (TOF) flight path = 256 cm. quasi-absolute method.
           the relative efficiency of the liquid scintillator
           was determioned originally by H-1(n,n)H-1. and it was
           checked over a wide range by means of H-3(d,n)He-4 and
           H-2(t,n)He-4 reaction.
           To establish an absolute scale for the TOF measurements
           the same cross-section standard and the same experiment
           conditions were used for all 3 reactions, H-3(p,n)He-3,
           H-3(d,n)He-4 and H-2(d,n)He-3 (and also for H2(t,n)He4)
           The experimental setup has been calibrated with
           appropriate reference cross section, rather than
           normalizing relative angular distribution to an
           absolute 0-deg excitation function.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           12 cm diameter by 6-cm long liquid scintillator, Ne-213
            coupled to a 56 avp photo-tube.
PART-DET   (N)
MONITOR    Absolute, TOF method with a well established efficiency
           curve by H-1(n,el)H-1 scattering experiment.
CORRECTION to obtain the data with accuracy as close to 1 percent
           as possible, whenever an effect was found to be larger
           than 0.5 percent, the data were corrected corres-
           pondingly.
ERR-ANALYS The combination of the statistical uncertainty with the
           uncertainty of the background subtraction.
