TITLE      EXCITATION FUNCTION FOR O-15 PRODUCTION VIA
           N-14(D,N)O-15 REACTION.
AUTHOR     (H.VERA RUIZ,A.P.WOLF)

REFERENCE  (J,RCA,24,65,77)
MONITOR    (6-C-12(P,P+N)6-C-11,,SIG)
           THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE CALCULATED FROM MEASURED
           DISINTEGRATION RATES, THE NUMBER OF TARGET NUCLEI AND
           THE NUMBER OF INCIDENT DEUTERONS PER UNIT TIME.
SAMPLE     NITROGEN GAS CONTAINED IN QUARTZ CELLS (2 CM I.D., 3 TO
           5 CM LONG) WITH ALUMINUM FOIL WINDOWS (21.51 MG/CM2).
           NITROGEN GAS FILLED AT PRESSURES FROM 200 TO 400 TORR.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USABNL)
           NUMBER OF DEUTERONS STRIKING THE TARGET WAS MEASURED
INC-SPECT  BEAM INTENSITIES WERE IN THE RANGE OF 70 TO 130 NA WITH
           TYPICAL IRRADIATION TIMES OF 10 TO 20 SEC. THE TOTAL
           USING A FARADAY CUP.
METHOD     SATURATION METHOD.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
           WELL-TYPE NAI(TL) SCINTILLATION COUNTER WITH A 62 PERC.
           EFFICIENCY FOR 511 KEV PHOTONS.
           THE EFFICIENCY WAS CALIBRATED FOR C-11 BY COUNTING
           POLYETHYLENE FOILS WHICH HAS BEEN IRRADIATED WITH
           PROTONS (C-12(P,PN)C-11).

COMMENT    AT ENERGIES LOW THAN 4 TO 5 MEV, THE CONTRIBUTION OF
           N-13 FROM N-14(D,ND)N-13 TO THE TOTAL ACTIVITY IS VERY
           SMALL( LESS THAN 0.03 PERCENT).
