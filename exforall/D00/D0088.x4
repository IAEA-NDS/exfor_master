TITLE      Excitation function of the 64Ni(a,p)67Cu reaction
           for production of 67Cu

METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,EDEG)
SAMPLE     The thin self-supporting metallic foils of 64Ni
            ( e5 = 22 mm) were prepared by electrolytic deposition
           Its isotopic composition was 58Ni (9.8%), 60Ni(6.9%),
           61Ni (0.5%), 62Ni (5.0%), 64Ni (77.8%); the admixture
           of Cu amounted to 0.012% by weight. The surface density
           of the foils ranged between 3 and 8 mg/cm2. Two stacks
           of 64Ni foils, each containing up to 12 samples.
           The first stack contained a number of high purity
           copper foils with the surface densities between 4.3 and
           4.7 mg/cm2 and a few aluminium foils in the sequences
           Cu-Ni and Ni-Al. The copper foils served as beam energy
           absorbers, beam flux monitors and also allowed
           cx-particle beam energy control along the stack. The
           aluminium foils were used as beam energy absorbers
           and catchers of the escaping residual nuclei.
           The second stack contained aluminium foils inserted
           between 64Ni foils and a single copper foil was used
           for the beam current measurement.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in each cross section
           was obtained as a root-mean square value of all the
           individual uncertainties:
              * the surface density of target nuclei (5%),
              * incident cx-particle beam current (8%),
              * detector efficiency (5%),
              * counting statistics (1-10%),
              * decay data (3%).

           Ga-67 produced in Cu monitor foil partly escaped to
           Ni foil.
           For separation of 67Ga and 67Cu the authors used the
           difference in branching ratios of the strongest
           gamma-transitions of those radionuclides
            (both decaying to stable Zn-67). The ratio of
           the adopted gamma-ray abundances of the radiative
           transitions 93.3 and 91.3 keY equals to 2.3
           for 67Cu decay and 12.4 for 67Ga decay, while the ratio
           for 93.3 and 184.6keV transition abundances equals to
           0.33 and 1.85 for 67Cu and 67Ga decays, respectively.
