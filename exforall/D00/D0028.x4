TITLE      Cross sections for reactions with 593 MeV- and 540 MeV-

SAMPLE     .Al discs,0.5mm thick, 3cm in diameter, attached to
            both sides of the other target samples, were used as
            beam monitors.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWTSWT)
            Cyclotron in Schweizerisches Inst.Fuer Nuklearforshung
            595MeV proton beam, beam current was app. 1 micro-a,
            the duration of irradiation was 5 min.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,MOSEP)
            using  relatively thin target samples with a minimum
           of secondary effects.  2 targets containing different
           target materials, being spaced 5cm apart, were
           irradiated simultaneously.
COMMENT    monitor reactions for other reactions with As(2)-S(3),
           Na-Br, Rb-Cl and Y(2)-O(3).
           .the results from 6 experiments without and 4 experi-
           ments with carbon degraders were considered.  however,
            front monitors which were not placed in contact with
           the degrader, were considered in this reaction, in
           order to minimize the secondary particle effect.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG,,,EVAL) = 10.8mb.
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.B.CUMMING,J,ARN,13,261,1963)
ANALYSIS   comparison with the calculated value of cross sections
           in arsenic, bromine, rubidium and yttrium is mentioned.
