REACTION   (52-TE-123(P,N)53-I-123,,SIG)
SAMPLE     A 100 mg quantity of enriched 123Te (96.%) metal
           powder was pressed into the 1.3 cm diam. cavity of an
           aluminium target cap and covered by a 0.075 mm Al foil
           and by a 0.940 mm copper foil to degrade the proton en.
CRITIQUE   Evaluator's remark: Suspicious data. Value for cross
           section and error more than 3 times lower.
