FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at NSCL
SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 188 mg/cm2 was
           located at the target position of the S800
           spectrograph.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analyzed in
           S800 superconducting magnetic spectrometer. Particles
           were identified using detection system in located in
           spectrometer focal plane
           (HPGE) A gamma-ray array GRETINA, consisting of 12
           detector modules, each with 36-fold segmentation was
           used for gamma ray detection. Detector modules were
           arranged in two rings with four located at 58deg and
           eight at 90deg with respect to the beam axis.
           (DRFTC,IOCH,SCIN) The focal plane detector system
           consists of a pair of cathode readout drift chambers
           located about 1 m apart, followed by a multi-
           segmented ion chamber and four large plastic
           scintillators of thicknesses 3 mm, 5 cm, 10 cm and 20
           cm, respectively.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays and reaction
            residues was required
           (PSD) Online pulse-shape analysis of signals from
            segmented HPGe detector provided the gamma-ray
            interaction points. Recoiled nuclei 40SC travel
            at about 30% of the speed of light.
ANALYSIS   Interaction point as well as tracking of incident
           beam was used for Doppler reconstruction of gamma
           ray energy
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The 38Ca secondary beam was produced by
           fragmentation of a stable 40Ca beam at energy of
           140-MeV/nucleon impinging on a 799 mg/cm2 9Be
           production target and separated in the A1900 fragment
           separator. Purity of 38Ca secondary beam was about 86%.
