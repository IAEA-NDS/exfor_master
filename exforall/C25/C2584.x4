FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was carried out using
           coupled cyclotrons at the NSCL East Lansing. This
           facility served to produce 22Mg ions.
           (LINAC,1USAMSU) 22Mg ions were injected into the ReA3
           reaccelerator and accelerated to 5 MeV/u
SAMPLE     Sample was an Active-Target time projection chamber
            (TPC) filled with mixture of 95% He and 5% CO2 at
           the pressure of 600 torr. The active volume of the
           TPC is cylinder of length 1 m and of a radius 29.2 cm.
DETECTOR   The time projection chamber was at the same time He
           target as well as the detector of reaction products.
           Cylindrical TPC is placed in uniform magnetic field
           of 1.9T produced by solenoidal magnet. The sensor
           plane consisted of approx. 10000 equilateral triangle
           pads which provided x-y information of the particle
           track. Drift time of the electrons provided
           longitudinal z component of the track.
           (IOCH) A thin ionization chamber placed in front of th
           TPC, filled with isobutane at 10 torr was used to
           record the beam intensity aand identified the beam
           contaminants. Signal from ionization chamber was used
           also for time reference of the TPC signals.
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used.
INC-SOURCE 22Mg was produced from the fragmentation of a 24Mg
           primary beam accelerated by the coupled cyclotrons
           and selected by the A1900 fragment separator. The
           22Mg fragments were stopped in gas cell and
           transported to electron beam ion source. The ions
           from ion source were injected to ReA3 reaccelerator
           and accelerated to cca 5 MeV/A with average beam
           intensity of 900 pps.
