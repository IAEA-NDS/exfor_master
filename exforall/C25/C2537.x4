INC-SPECT  48Ca-ion bombardments with beam intensities from
           3x10**11 to 6x10**11 particles/s and lasting from 10 h
           up to 2 d.
SAMPLE     (96-CM-248,ENR=0.97) The 248Cm target was 6 mm in
           diameter and contained 20 microg/mm2 of 248Cm
           deposited as CmF, onto 0.013-mm Be by vacuum
           sublimation. Thus, the energy spread within the
           target was 267 to 243 MeV, corresponding to an
           average excitation energy of 40 to 50 MeV for the
           compound nucleus.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (CHSEP,REC) Recoil products from each bombardment
           were stopped 2nd collected in a 0.013-mm Be foil that
           was then chemically processed in one of three
           separation schemes. Each separation scheme was used
           to isolate the SHE's from other reaction products and
           from any 248Cm that may have reached the recoil
           collection foil.

REACTION   (96-CM-248(20-CA-48,X)ELEM/MASS,,SIG)
METHOD     Approximate yields of transcurium nuclides produced
           from transfer reactions in the bombardment of 248Cm
           with 48Ca. Only products recoiling within an included
           angle of 100 deg (lab) were measured.

REACTION   (96-CM-248(20-CA-48,X)ELEM/MASS,CUM,SIG)
METHOD     (CHSEP) The most rapid separation (Scheme I) depends
           only on the coprecipitation of the SHE's with CuS.
           Two CuS precipitations were made, one from acid
           solution and one from basic solution. The yields for
           Au, Hg, and Bi tracer elements were typically greater
           than 80% in identical trial runs. These samples were
           continuously counted for 60 d using surface-barrier
           detectors. Includes yields of all parent nuclides in
           alpha- and beta-decay chains unless otherwise
           specified.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
