DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two 300 Omega-cm gold-surface barrier
           semiconductor detectors.
METHOD     (COINC,PHWT) After traversing the detector-target
           chamber, the beam was collected in a Faraday cup, and
           the integrated beam was monitored with a current
           integrator. Baffles were placed around the detectors
           so that only particles from the target could be
           detected.

REACTION   (88-RA-226(A,F),(SEC),AKE,LF+HF) The average final
           total kinetic-energy release.
SAMPLE     226Ra target was made by electro spraying and

           (90-TH-232,ENR=0.098) All of the targets except
           radium were prepared by evaporation on nickel
           backings of approximately 100-microg/cm2 areal
           density. The 230Th target had areal density of 20-30
           microg/cm2, which was determined from the alpha
           activity of the target and the area of the deposit.
           The 230Th target had an isotopic composition of 90.2%
           230Th and 9.8% 232Th.
