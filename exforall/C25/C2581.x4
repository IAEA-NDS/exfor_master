TITLE      Dominance of direct reaction channels at deep
           sub-barrier energies for weakly bound nuclei on heavy

REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,102,031601,2020)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed at the UND FN
           tandem at the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the
           University of Notre Dame using TwinSol facility
SAMPLE     Thin 208Pb sample
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SI) Reaction products were detected by
           two similar telescope detectors. Each telesccope
           included double sided Si strip detector with
           thickness of 20 mu-m backed by a Si pad detector 150
           mu-m thick. One telescope covered an angular range
           between 25.8deg and 69.2deg on the left side and
           second telescope covered an angular range between
           28.5deg and 66.5deg on the right side
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight (TOF) was used to discriminate
           between secondary beams 8B and 7Be. Tof was started by
           rf timing pulse from beam buncher and stopped by dE
           detector of both telescopes.
INC-SOURCE Primary bunched beam of 6Li with energy of 37 MeV
           impinged on a 3He gas target. The reaction products
           included in the secondary beam were 7Li at 13.1 MeV,
           7Be at 22.4 MeV and 8B at the energy of 30.5 MeV. The
           secondary beams and part of the scattered primary 6Li
           beam were transported via TwinSol to reaction target.
