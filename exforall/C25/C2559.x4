           Photonuclear data from the same experiment.
INSTITUTE  (1USAANL,2AUSIRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) The Argonne 60 in. cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Targets of U-233, U-235, U-238 and Np-237. Usually
           uranium metal foils about 0.002 in. thick were used
           as targets. They were covered with pure Al foils
           which acted as catcher foils for the fission
           products. In most experiments only the catcher foils
           were used for preparing the samples, enabling
           repeated use of the valuable fissionable foils. By
           bombarding a blank aluminum foil alone it was shown
           that no disturbing activity was produced in the
           catcher foils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) Two 3 in. x 3 in. NaI(T1) crystals.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,COINC) The chemical separation of cesium
           was done essentially by two consecutive ironhydroxide
           precipitations preceded and followed by
           precipitations of cesium as cesium-perchlorate.
           Initially, the gamma-spectrum was measured with a 3
           in. by 3 in. NaI(T1) crystal with conventional
           electronics and a 200-channel pulse height analyzer.
           Aluminum absorbers of appropriate thickness
           prevented beta-particles from entering the crystal.
           At a later stage of the work, Compton anticoincidence
           counting equipment became available. Two 4 in. x 4
           in. NaI(TI) crystals facing each other and having the
           sample between them were surrounded by a large
           plastic scintillator. Moreover any gamma-ray which is
           in coincidence with another one was counted with
           reduced efficiency since the second gamma ray in the
           cascade could also produce anticoincidence pulses in
           the surrounding plastic scintillator.
CORRECTION A correction was applied for gamma-absorption in the
           aluminum beta-absorbers.
