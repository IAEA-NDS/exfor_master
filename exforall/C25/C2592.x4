FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at DRAGON
           facility using off-line ion source, ISAC-1
           radio-frequency quadrupole and drift-tube linac
SAMPLE     Windowless He gas target at the pressure of 5.0+-0.1
           torr and thickness of (1.97+-0.04)E+018 atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) DRAGON magnetic spectrometer was used to
           momentum analyze 10Be recoil products
           (SISD) Gridded double-sided Si strip detector with
           thickness of 66 mu-m was placed near the focal plane
           of the DRAGON spectrometer to detect and identify
           reaction recoils.
           (BGO) Gamma rays are detected by an array of 30 BGO
           detectors covering almost whole solid angle around
           the gas target
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used
           (COINC) Coincidence between BGO array and Si strip
           detector was required.
           (TOF) Time of flight of 10B recoil, measured as time
           difference between detected gamma ray in BGO and recoil
           detected in Si strip detector, was used in recoil
           identification
