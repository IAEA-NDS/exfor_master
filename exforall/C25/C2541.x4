INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) 88-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence
           Berkeley Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Alpha particles were measured with 300-mm2
           goldplated surface barrier detectors.
PART-DET   (A,XR)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC,XSPEC) Immediately following the
           irradiation, the catcher foil was dissolved in hot 8M
           HNO, in the presence of Hg+2. The berkelium products
           were oxidized to +4 using CrO, and were extracted
           into bis (2-ethylhexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP)
           in n- dodecane. The berkelium products were plated on
           1-inch diameter platinum disks for x-ray, gamma,
           and/or alpha counting. The time from the end of the
           bombardment (eob) to the start of counting was 12-14
           min with a chemical yield of 50%.

SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.941) The targets were prepared by
           electrospraying the nitrates dissolved in acetone
           onto 1-mil thick beryllium backing foils kept at
           250C. The 0.5-cm2 area targets were heated to red
           heat in an induction furnace to ensure conversion of
           the target material to the oxides. The typical target
           thickness was 400 microg/cm2.
