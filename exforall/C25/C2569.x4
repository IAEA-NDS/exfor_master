FACILITY   (LASER,1USAROC) Experiment performed at OMEGA laser
           facility. It is a 60-terawatt, 60-beam, frequency-
           tripled Nd:glass laser system designed to perform
           precision direct-drive inertial-confinement-fusion
           experiments.
SAMPLE     Spherical plastic shells filled with various fuel
           mixtures. Shells were nominally 15 mu-m thick with
           overcoating of 0.1 mu-m Al. Diameter of the shell was
           860 mu-m. Different target fills were used. For
           primary experiment pD fusion an equimolar mix of
           deuterium and hydrogen fill gas with 5.33 atm of each
           was used. For background measurements pure D2 at
           pressure of 8 atm and pure H2 at 16 atm were used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Elastically scattered neutrons from dense D or
           H was measured by time of flight technique over
           flight path of 13.4 m with advanced liquid
           scintillation detector.
           (CEREN) High energy gamma rays were detected using
           threshold Cherenkov detector. Detector consist of
           converter foil where high energy photons produce high
           energy electrons which enter radiator gas CO2 cell,
           where Cherenkov light is produced if the electron
           exceeds the local speed of light. Cherenkov light is
           relayed to a photomultiplier tube and the electrical
           signal is recorded on a high-bandwidth oscilloscope.
           The threshold depends on gas pressure. In present
           study radiator gas pressure of 400 psi was used,
           which resulted in threshold of 2.9 MeV.
