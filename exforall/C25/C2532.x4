INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USALRL)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) The heavy ion linear accelerator
            (HILAC).
INC-SPECT  On average 3x10**12 ions/sec.
SAMPLE     The target was prepared by subliming 259 microg of
           249Cf as CfF3, onto a 27-microg/mm2 substrate of
           99.999% pure Al.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 50-mm2 and 100-mm2 Si(Au) surface barrier
           detectors.
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (ASPEC,ACTIV) Authors infer from these data that the
           new activity decays by emission of 9.06- and 9.25-MeV
           alpha particles to 259Rf and, therefore, can belong
           only to 263Sg. Some 22 atoms of recoil-transferred
           259Rf were observed to decay in the off-wheel
           detectors. Shortly after these daughter events,
           granddaughter 255No alpha particles were detected
           from four off wheel daughter decays.
ANALYSIS   From the rate of producing our 263Sg activity, authors
           calculate a formation cross section.

REACTION   (98-CF-249(8-O-18,4N)106-SG-263,,SIG)
COMMENT    Very little of this activity was made by 180 ions of
           91 and 100 MeV, indicating a rather narrow excitation
           function, consistent with our calculated excitation
           function for the reaction 249Cf(180,4n), which shows
           a half-width of 7 MeV and a maximum cross section of
           0.2 nb.
