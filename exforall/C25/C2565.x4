INC-SPECT  The integrated beam fluence was 1.49x10**18 ions
           delivered over a period of 41 days. (58% of this time
           was spent taking data for the 59Co+209Bi reaction.)
SAMPLE     Each set of nine 1.4x9 cm sector targets, nominally
           500 microg/cm2 Bi metal evaporated onto 150-300
           microg/cm2 Al substrates, was mounted on a 30-cm
           diameter swiftly rotating wheel.
DETECTOR   (SISD) The focal plane detector system was a linear
           array of five adjacent Si wafers, with each wafer
           having ten detector strips on it that were 3-mm wide
           and 28-mm high. Each detector strip was
           position-sensitive in the 28-mm direction. The
           depletion depth of the detectors was 100 microm and
           the average implantation depth of a compound nucleus
           recoil was 8 microm.
METHOD     (ASPEC,EDE,REC) The beam entered the separator
           through a thin window (50-250 microg/cm2 of C or C-A1-
           C). The beam then struck the 0.5 mg/cm2 Bi metal
           targets which were mounted on a rapidly rotating
           target wheel to dissipate the energy deposited by the
           beam. The signals from the dE/dx detector (which was
           in front of the focal plane array) were used to
           identify recoil implantation and fission events, and
           by their absence, alpha-particle events.
