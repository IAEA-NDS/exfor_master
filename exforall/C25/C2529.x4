DETECTOR   (TRD) Nuclear emulsions.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of a mixture of isotopes of
           curium (95% Cm244 and 4.5% Cm246) mounted on a very
           thin nickel foil. The target was approximately 0.5
           mg/cm2 thick and was covered with ~75-microg/cm2
           aluminum to prevent curium "knockover".

           (96-CM-246,ENR=0.045)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) In a series of experiments it was found
           that Fm250 could be collected on the catcher foils in
           accordance with a parent of half-life 3 seconds
           produced in the reaction Cm246(C12,4n)No254) . The
           number of Fm250 counts observed in a single
           experiment was as great as 40 and corresponded to a
           maximum cross section of a few microbarns for the
           reaction with Cm246. Nuclear emulsions placed above
           the moving belt to receive the alpha particles from
           the decaying 102 atoms are being scanned to determine
           the alpha energy of the 3-second No254, but there are
           difficulties with this method since there are
           hundreds of times as many tracks due to Fm250, Cf245,
           Cf246, and other alpha emitters. The final
           identification of the activity ascribed to Fm250 was
           carried out by dissolving the activity from the
           catcher foil and separating it from the other
           actinide elements by elution with ammonium
           alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate from a column packed with
           Dowex-50 cation exchange resin.
