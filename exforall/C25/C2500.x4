           fission characteristics.
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USALRL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 88-Inch
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     12 targets were made by electrodepositing neptunium
           from aliquots of this solution containing 150-250
           microg of 237Np on 2.5-microm molybdenum foils in a
           1.23-cm area for each target. Measured target
           thicknesses ranged from 118 to 142 microg/cm2. Each
           foil was mounted on a target holder frame, and ten of
           the target holder frames were mounted in the LIM
           Target System, with a spacing of approximately 1 cm
           between the targets. A 25-microm beryllium foil
           served as the volume limiting foil (which confines
           the gas volume downstream of the last target to the
           same as that for the rest of the targets) for the LIM
           Target System, and another 25-microm beryllium foil
           upstream of the targets served as the vacuum window
           for the system.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A light tight transmission-mounted 300-mm
           silicon-surface barrier detector.
METHOD     (CHSEP,XSPEC) Radiochemical and K X-ray measurements.
           Two different chemical separations were performed on
           the reaction products of these irradiations. The
           first separation was designed to determine the
           elemental assignment of the fission activity, the
           second was used to produce an americium sample
           suitable for measurement of the plutonium K x-rays
           from the EC decay of 232Am.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
DECAY-DATA (95-AM-232,1.31MIN) Measured by authors.
