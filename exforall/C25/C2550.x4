INSTITUTE  (1USALRL,2GERGSI,1USABRK)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) The super heavy ion linear accelerator
            (SuperHILAC).
SAMPLE     Target containing 1.14x10**16 atoms/cm2 254Es. The
           target also contained 0.7x10**16 atoms/cm2 of 250Cf
           from decay of the Es. The Es was electroplated in a
           3.0-mm-diam spot on a 2.2 mg/cm2 Be foil that had
           been coated with a 0.2 mg/cm2 Pd layer to prevent
           attack of the Be by the electroplating solution. A
           0.02 mg/cm2 Pd layer was then vaporized over the Es
           oxide deposit to reduce transfer of Es to the recoil
           collecting foils during bombardment.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
METHOD     (REC,CHSEP,COINC) Target was bombarded with 48Ca at
           the SuperHILAC accelerator. Two bombardment energies
           were chosen: one just at the estimated fusion barrier
           and one several MeV above to compensate for any
           extra-push energy that might be required for fusion
           in such a heavy system. The resultant excitation
           energies in the compound nucleus were 26 and 34 MeV,
           respectively. Recoils from the Es target were
           collected on either beryllium or copper foils that
           were chemically processed to yield Super Heavy
           Element (SHE) fractions mounted on thin foils for
           coincident counting. Spontaneous-fission counting was
           performed in a fragment-fragment coincidence mode
           with opposing surface-barrier detectors.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
