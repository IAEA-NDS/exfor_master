TITLE      A Measurement of the 25 Cross-Section for 0.53 MeV
           Neutrons by the Manganese Solution Method

INSTITUTE  (1USAWIS)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USAWIS) The concentric electrode electrostatic
           generator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The protons were accelerated to the
           accurately measured and controlled energy of 2.27 MeV
            (using 1.86 MeV as the threshold).

METHOD     (MANGB) The total yield of neutrons from lithium was
           measured by the manganese solution at two other
           points corresponding to maximum neutron energies of
           0.27 MeV and 1.1 MeV and the yield at these points
           was just one half that at 0.53 MeV.
