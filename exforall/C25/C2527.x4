TITLE      The New Element Berkelium (Atomic Number 97)

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Berkeley Crocker Laboratory
           60-inch cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE The intensity of the bombardments averaged about 2
           microA/cm2 and the time of bombardment was usually
           about 6 hr.
INC-SPECT  The intensity of the beam of helium ions striking the
           sample was determined by measuring the charge
           accumulated on the insulated target dish and foil.
           The energies of the helium ions were calculated as
           ranging from 30 to 35 MeV in various bombardments.
SAMPLE     The Am241 used as target material for the production
           of element 97 was separated from strongly neutron
           irradiated plutonium into which it grew as the
           daughter of the beta-particle decay of ~10-yr. Pu241.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP,ASPEC) The americium targets were placed
           inside a special target assembly. In this assembly
           the particle beam from the cyclotron was passed
           through two thin duralumin foils (each 1.5 mil in
           thickness) before entering the evacuated compartment
           containing the sample, and the compartment was
           isolated from the surroundings. The chemical
           separations were made using a combination of
           precipitation methods and high temperature ion
           exchange columns with Dowex-50 resin. The growth of a
           curium isotope decaying by the emission of alpha-
           particles of energy 5.89 MeV (15%) and 5.79 MeV (85%)
           was observed in a radiochemically pure berkelium
           fraction. The thin deposits of the radiochemically
           pure element 97 fractions on platinum plates were
           examined in the differential alpha-particle pulse
           analyzer. The L x-rays as counted in the xenon-filled
           Geiger counter were used as the basis for calculation
           of disintegration rates and total numbers of atoms.
