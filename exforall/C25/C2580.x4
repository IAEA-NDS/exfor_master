FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was performed using ISAC-
           1/DRAGON facility at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with He gas at a pressure
           of 10.6-11.1 mbar. The effective length of the target
           was (12.3+-0.5)cm.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Selected reaction recoils (23Na) were
           transported through DRAGON recoil separator,
           consisting of two magnetic dipoles and two
           electrostatic dipoles complemented with focusing
           elements.
           (BGO) Windowless gas target is surrounded by a 4PI
           gamma detector array, consisting of 30 BGO
           scintillation detectors. Total solid angle coverage
           of the array was 92%.
           (MCPLT) A pair microchannel plate detectors were used
           for local time of flight measurement for recoil
           identification
           (SISD) A double-sided silicon strip detector placed
           in the DRAGON focal plane where the recoils were
           stopped and their kinetic energy measured.
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used
           (COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays in BGO array
           and recoils detected in DRAGON focal plane detectors
           was required.
INC-SOURCE Isotopically pure  76Se(12+) beam was produced from 74%
           enriched 76Se sample in ISAC Off-line Ion Source.
