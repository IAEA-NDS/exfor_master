REACTION   (92-U-238(54-XE-136,X)86-RN-211,,SIG)
SAMPLE     The target was a 19-mm disc of natural uranium,
           0.25-mm thick. The range of 136Xe from the surface of
           2 the target to the reaction barrier was taken to be
           17 mg/cm2 for all of the Xe + U experiments.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A 300-mm area gold surface barrier detector.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) Following the experiment the target was
           dissolved in a 10 ml solution of 2 M HCl containing 1
           ml of 30% H2O2. The solution was prefiltered to
           remove undissolved carbon deposits that formed on the
           surface of the target during the irradiation. The
           sample was briefly counted for alpha particle
           activity to check the thickness of the precipitate.
           These samples were pulse height analyzed continuously
           for spontaneous fission and alpha events for
           approximately 200 days. The noble gas fraction was
           obtained following irradiations of 0. 25-mm x 16-mm
           diameter natural uranium metal targets. After the
           heavy-ion irradiations the targets were placed in a
           sidearm flask which was connected with Tygon tubing
           to a calcium sulfate trying tube followed by a cold
           activated charcoal trap.

REACTION   (64-GD-160(54-XE-136,X)82-PB-212,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Six pieces of 99.9% pure natural gadolinium metal
            (21.9% 160Gd) were milled and fitted to make a
           collimator with a 0.035-mm diameter aperture.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) Three of the six gadolinium pieces were
           placed in a nitric acid solution and the active
           surface was dissolved. A search was made for 8.78 MeV
           alpha particles from the 212Po daughter of 10.2 hr
           212Pb. No alpha particle events were observed with
           energies above 7.45 MeV in over 16 hours of counting.
           This corresponds to an upper limit cross section of
           2x10**-34 cm2 for the production of 212Pb in the
           136Xe + natGd reaction, and 1 x l0**-33 cm2 136Xe +
           160Gd. for the Xe + Gd react1on.

REACTION   (92-U-238(54-XE-136,X)110-DS-290,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   By making a comparison of the 136Xe + 160Gd and 136Xe
           + 238U reaction to make 212Pb and 290Ds, respectively,
           it can be seen that both reactions require the
           transfer of 18 protons and 34 + n neutrons. Since
           both irradiations were thick target experiments and
           include projectile energies from 1150 MeV to the
           barrier, there would have been transfer product
           nuclei heavier than the target from both reactions
           having the same excitation energies and corresponding
           to the same number of protons and neutrons
           transferred. Based on this result an argument is
           given that the upper limit cross section for the
           production of 290Ds in the 136Xe + 238U reaction is
           4xl0**-36 cm2.
