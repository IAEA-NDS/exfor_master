TITLE      Excitation functions for production of heavy
           actinides from interactions of 40Ca and 48Ca ions

REL-REF    (M,A0173001,D.Lee+,J,PR/C,25,286,1982) The same
           radiations and abundances and techniques were used.
INSTITUTE  (1USALAS,2SWTUBE,2SWTWUR,1USABRK,2GERGSI,2GERMPM)
SAMPLE     Two different targets containing 1.5 and 1.7 mg/cm2
           of 248Cm in the form of Cm203, prepared by stepwise
           electrodeposition with a diameter of 9 mm on 2.4
           mg/cm2 Be foil, were used.
           (96-CM-248,ENR=0.965)
           (96-CM-246,ENR=0.035)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Irradiations of 248Cm with 48Ca ions
           were performed at the SuperHILAC at LBL with incident
           energies on target of 239, 263, and 288 MeV and at
           the UNILAC at the GSI with 263 and 318 MeV.
           Irradiations with 234-, 259-, and 294-MeV 40Ca ions
           were also conducted at the UNILAC. The copper catcher
           foils were dissolved in concentrated HC1 containing a
           few drops of HNO3 and the actinides were
           co-precipitated on ferric hydroxide by the addition
           of ammonia to complex the copper, leaving it in
           solution. The final fractions were evaporated to
           dryness and the resulting samples were counted for
           alpha, spontaneous fission, and gamma activities, and
           data analysis was performed as described before.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The standard deviation associated with the
           quoted absolute cross sections is estimated to be 12%.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for the total measured
           energy losses of about 75 MeV for Ca-40 and 97 MeV for
           Ca-48 ions prior to entry into the Cm target. Energy
           losses in the target were 13 to 16 MeV and the energy
           range is indicated in the tables.
