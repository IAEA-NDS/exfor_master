FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, East
           Lansing
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of (287+-3) mg/cm2 in front
           of the S800 spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Charged particles were momentum analyzed
           using S800 spectrograph
           (SCIN) Event-by-event identification of the incoming
           projectiles and outgoing reaction products was
           performed using plastic timing scintillators and the
           S800 focal-plane detector
           (MWDC,IOCH,SCIN) Focal Plane Detector Array of the
           S800 Spectrometer consists of a series of two x/y
           Position Sensitive Cathode Readout Drift Counters
           separated by 1 m, a segmented Ionization Chamber that
           is 41 cm deep and three scintillators that are 5, 10
           and 20 cm thick, respectively. All detectors have an
           active area of 30 cm x 59 cm.
           (CSICR) Secondary target was surrounded by CAESAR, a
           high-efficiency array consisting of 192 CsI(Na)
           scintillators,to measure deexcitation gamma rays from
           the reaction channels of interest.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
CORRECTION Gamma ray energies were corrected for Doppler shift
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) A secondary beam including 24Mg (54.5%), 25Al
            (29.5%) , and 26Si (13.5%) was produced by impinging
           the 150-MeV/u 36Ar primary beam on a 550-mg/cm2 9Be
           target at the midacceptance position of the A1900
           fragment separator.
