REL-REF    (M,C0481001,P.Dyer+,J,PR/C,23,1865,1981) The
           techniques in extracting the angle integrated cross
           sections.
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's 88-
           Inch Cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  Two high purity Ge detectors of 109 cm volume.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The beams impinged on targets of C, N, 0, Mg,
           Al, Si, and Fe, all of natural isotopic composition.
           The target thicknesses varied from 200 microg/cm2 to
           7.56 mg/cm2 for the various targets. Gamma rays
           produced by various reactions were observed by Ge
           detectors.
