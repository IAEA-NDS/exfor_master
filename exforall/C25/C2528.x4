TITLE      New Isotopes of Neptunium
AUTHOR     (L.B.Magnusson,S.G.Thompson,G.T.Seaborg)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,78,363,1950)

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 184-in. cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE A deuteron beam of about 2 microA/cm2.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,IOCH)
METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP,ASPEC) The essential need in this
           research was for a process for the separation and
           purification of neptunium which would be much more
           rapid than any devised hitherto, since the objective
           was the identification of isotopes believed to be
           short-lived. This need was fulfilled largely by
           modification of the mechanics of previously known
           chemical separation processes. The most rapid
           isolations from the target required only 45 min., but
           some sacrifice in purity resulted. The methods
           described here required, on the average, from an hour
           to an hour and a half. Neptunium was isolated from
           all other radioactive species by combinations of
           co-precipitation and solvent extraction techniques.
           Samples for radioactive assay were mounted on
           platinum plates of 2-mil thickness. A uniform
           geometrical arrangement was used for all Geiger
           counter activity measurements. Alpha-particle
           activity was assayed in "50 percent geometry"
           argon-filled ionization chambers. The determination
           of alpha-particle energies and analysis of mixtures
           of alpha-emitting isotopes were made in a 48-channel
           ionization pulse analyzer in which the energy range
           covered by the 48 channels could be varied.
