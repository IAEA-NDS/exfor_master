SAMPLE     The gas target was provided by filling the entire
           scattering chamber with 4He gas at a pressure of 20 cm
           Hg.
DETECTOR   (SOLST,SIBAR)
METHOD     (EDE) The beam entered the gas through a 0.63-microm,
           nickel foil 25 cm from the center of the chamber. The
           solid state detectors were in the gas at a distance
           of 32 cm from the target volume with no windows in
           between. The particles were detected in a dE-E system,
           consisting of a 0.10-mm totally depleted Si
           surface-barrier detector and a 1.5-mm partially
           depleted Si surface barrier detector.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The agreement in shape of our elastic
           scattering angular distribution with that of
           Darriulat et al. is very good, and we believe our
           absolute cross sections are accurate to better than
           10%.
CORRECTION After correction for energy losses in the entrance
           foil and gas, the beam energy in the present
           experiment was 63.8+-0.4 MeV.

SAMPLE     4He gas at a pressure of 38 cm Hg.
EN-SEC     (E,A)
METHOD     Magnetic Spectrograph Measurements, 5 degrees: In order
            obtain an accurate value for the energy of the 20-MeV
           state of 4He considerable care was taken to obtain
           absolute measurements of the incident and scattered
           energies. The angles of observation for the
           4He(alpha,alpha)4He* measurements were theta lab=5
           degrees and theta lab=13 degrees, chosen to be near
           maxima of the angular distribution as determined from
           the counter telescope data.
ANALYSIS   A constant background has been subtracted from the
           data by drawing a horizontal line through the data
           below the threshold for alpha-particle breakup. This
           background was 85% of the peak height at 5 degrees
           but only 30% at 13 degrees. A self-consistent analysis
           of calibration lines gave the beam energy at the center
            of the scattering chamber as 64.12+-0.06 MeV

           and only a relative cross-section scale is given.
