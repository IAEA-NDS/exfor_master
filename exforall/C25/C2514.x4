FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) LBL 88-inch cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 300 mm2 Si(Au) surface barrier detectors.
SAMPLE     Target materials of 248Cm and 249Bk are produced at
           the High Flux Isotope Reactor, HFIR; at the Oak Ridge
           National Laboratory.
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) In order to verify that the activity
           was indeed properly assigned to Lr, extractions with
           0.1 M thenoyl trifluoroacetate (TTA) in
           methylisobutyl ketone (MIBK) were performed. The KCI
           deposit was dissolved in a buffer solution of
           monochloroacetic acid or acetic acid adjusted to pH
           ranges of 1.86 to 5.5. Extractions with TTA from
           buffer solutions of different pH were performed. The
           organic phase was dried on a Pt plate and alpha
           counted. The entire procedure required about three
           minutes.

INC-SPECT  Targets were irradiated with 117-MeV 1805+
           projectiles resulting in incident energies on target
           of 102-MeV with intensities of about 0.5 particle-
           microA.
SAMPLE     Targets of Bk oxide containing about 0.9 mg/cm2 of
           249Bk (in a 6-mm diameter) were prepared by
           electrodeposition 13 with a 6-mm diameter on 2.75
           mg/cm2 Be foil.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error limit is statistical plus an
           additional ten percent to account for variations in
           the beam intensity and gas jet yields that are
           otherwise not accounted for.
