INSTITUTE  (1USAWAU)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) The university of washington 60-in.
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum volatilization of
           natural silicon onto thin nickel foils. The thickness
           of the silicon was approximately 170 microg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 56-microm-thick transmission-mounted surface-
           barrier detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors include only statistical
           uncertainties in the total number of events recorded.
           (ERR-SYS,,40.) The systematic error, due mainly to
           the incomplete detection discussed above and to the
           uncertainty in the target thickness, is believed to
           Be less than 40%.

REACTION   (14-SI-28(A,8-O-16)8-O-16,PAR,DA)
METHOD     The second type of experiment measured the angular
           distribution for formation of the 016 fragments in
           the ground state or with 6-7 MeV of excitation
           energy. For this measurement the angle-defining
           detector subtended 1.8 degree in the reaction plane,
           while the recoil collecting detector subtended 3.1-4.5
           degrees. Since the angle between the two oxygen
           fragments is approximately 1 degree greater for 7 MeV
           of excitation energy than for 6 MeV of excitation
           energy, as many as 40% of the partners formed with 7
           MeV of excitation energy may not have been detected
           because the angle between the detectors was set to
           correspond to that expected for formation of the
           oxygen fragments with 6 MeV of excitation energy.
