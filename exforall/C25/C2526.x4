           Carbon by Protons

REL-REF    (I,C1647001,H.H.Woodbury+,J,PR,92,1199,1953) The
           counter and associated electronic equipment.
INSTITUTE  (1USACAL)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USACAL) California Institute of Technology 3-MeV
           electrostatic accelerator.
SAMPLE     Two types of targets were used. One was prepared by
           holding cleaned tantalum over a smoky benzene flame;
           the second was prepared by cracking methane
            (natural gas) on a hot strip of tantalum for the
           preparation of C13 targets. The target thickness was
           found by measuring the width of the 1.76-MeV
           resonance in C13(p,gamma)N13. This resonance is
           strong enough to be easily observable in normal
           carbon, and since it has a width of only 2 keV, while
           the targets were 20 to 100 keV thick, the observed
           resonance width was equal to the target thickness.
           Knowing the target thickness in keV, one could then
           calculate the number of carbon atoms per square
           centimeter by dividing by the stopping cross section
           of carbon at the average proton bombarding energy
           used in determining the target thickness.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The scintillation spectrometer consisted of
           an Nal(T1) crystal 1.5, inches long and 1.5, inches
           in diameter mounted on a 5819 photomultiplier.
METHOD     (PHWT) Since the background radiation from the
           electrostatic accelerator and from other reactions in
           the target was generally very much more intense than
           the gamma ray of interest here, it was necessary to
           identify the latter by means of its characteristic
           photopeak produced in the NaI(Tl) scintillation
           counter. Therefore, the measurements required a
           pulse-height spectrum to be obtained at each
           bombarding energy.
CORRECTION To obtain the true yields it was also necessary to
           make a correction for absorption of the gamma rays in
           the target chamber. This was only 2 to 4 percent for
           the measurements at 90 degree, but amounted to
           approximately 20 percent at O degree.
