FACILITY   (ACCEL,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at the ISAC beam
           facility at TRIUMF, Vancouver using DRAGON (Detector
           of Recoil and Gammas Of Nuclear reactions) recoil
           separator
SAMPLE     A windowless, differentially pumped, recirculated gas
           target filled with hydrogen. An average gas pressure
           of 5Torr was used which corresponds to approx.
           3.9E+18 hydrogen atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Gamma rays were detected by high efficiency
           detector array consisting of 30 BGO detectors
           (MCPLT) Heavy ion detection system based on two
           micro-channel plate detectors was used for time of
           flight measurement
           (MAGSP,SISD) Recoil ions (23Na) were momentum
           analyzed by recoil separator and detected using
           double sided Si strip detectors.
METHOD     (TOF) Prompt gamma rays from neutron capture were
              selected using time of flight. Recoil flight time
              was used to select capture events.
              Inverse kinematics was used
           (COINC) Delayed coincidence between 23Na recoils
              and capture gamma rays was required
INC-SOURCE 500 MeV protons are steered onto a production targets
           to produce radioactive isotopes. The isotopes pass
           through a heated tube to a source where they are
           ionized, accelerated off the source's high-voltage
           platform at up to 60 kV and sent through a mass
           separator to select the ion beam of choice. Selected
           beam of 22Ne was then accelerated in room temperature
           linac.
