TITLE      Spallation-Fission Competition in Astatine Compound
           Nuclei Formed by Heavy-Ion Bombardment
AUTHOR     (T.Darrah Thomas,G.E.Gordon,R.M.Latimer,G.T.Seaborg)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,126,1805,1962)
           #doi:10.1103/PhysRev.126.1805
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) The heavy ion linear accelerator
            (HILAC).
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (CHSEP,REC,ACTIV) As no At211 was produced in the Hilac
           bombardments, it was possible to determine chemical
           yields by using At211 as a tracer. Following the
           heavy-ion bombardment, the recoil catcher containing
           the heavy-ion-produced activities and a plate
           containing a known amount of tracer activity were
           simultaneously dissolved in 8M HCl. The astatine was
           separated from other alpha-emitting activities
            (mainly polonium) by extraction into di-isopropyl
           ether (DIPE) . The DIPE fraction was transferred to a
           platinum counting disk and evaporated to dryness
           under a heat lamp. The only absolute counting was
           that of the plates containing At211 tracer. The alpha
           particles from At211 (and EC daughter, Po211) were
           counted in an ionization chamber having 50% geometry.
           In "ratio experiments", stacked foils (consisting of
           gold targets and aluminum foils) were bombarded and
           the ratios of production of low-activity astatine
           nuclides to that of the prominent activities were
           measured. For measurements of Pt(N14,xn) cross
           sections, in addition to other types of experiments,
           it was necessary to do ratio experiments.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were calculated in the usual manner,
           using the branching ratios and half-lives listed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error given for these cross
           sections represent estimated uncertainties in the
           positions of the smoothed curves. These estimates, as
           well as the limits of error given for the other cross
           sections, include uncertainties in the counting rates
           of the radiations from the product nuclei, target
           thickness, and decay during bombardment corrections.
           Uncertainty in the values used for the alpha/EC
           branching ratios have not been included.

           microg/cm2 of gold  metal onto a known
           area of previously weighed 0.25-mi1. Al foils. Target
           thicknesses were determined by weighing the foils
           before and after vaporization.  Targets
           for the "ratio experiments" were of gold leaf (approx

           Al foils, were stacked in the assembly.
