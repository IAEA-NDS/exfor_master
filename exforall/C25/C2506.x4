SAMPLE     A self-supporting beryllium metal foil of
           9.1 mg/cm2 thickness.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 5.1 x 3.2 cm NaI crystals operated in
           fast-slow coincidence.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,EXTB) The proton current 60 nA was
           collected in a Faraday cup. The beam was pulsed:
           0.7 sec irradiation interval, a 10.0 sec counting
           interval. The target was mounted at the center of an
           annular aluminum stopper 10 cm long, and with a wall
           thickness of 3.8 cm. Pairs of 511 keV quanta were
           detected in two NaI crystals operated in fast-slow
           coincidence. The coincidence resolving time of the
           detectors was 12 nsec full width at half maximum.
           The absolute efficiency of the apparatus as a detector
           of B-8 positrons was obtained in two stages: (i) The
           distribution of the stopped positrons in the aluminum
           stopper was calculated; and (ii) a Na-22 source of
           known strength was used to measure experimentally the
           efficiency.
CORRECTION Correction was made:
           - to take into account those B-8 nuclei which recoil
             out of the target at angles such as to be lost; this
             correction is approximately 4% at Ep = 30 MeV and
             12% at Ep =47.5 MeV,
           - for positron annihilation in flight. '
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the cross sections were
           obtained by adding in quadrature statistical errors in
           the number of counts attributed to B-8, statistical
           errors in the background subtraction, inaccuracy in
           the estimation of time at which the beam was cut off.
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in the strength of the Na-22 source
           used to obtain the stopper efficiency (5%),
           (ERR-2) statistical uncertainty in the efficiency
           calibration (2%),
           (ERR-3) inaccuracies in the range formulas and the
           computation of the distribution of positrons stopped in
           the aluminum stopper (5%),
           (ERR-4) inaccuracy in the estimation of time at which
           the beam was cut off (3%),
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in target thickness (5%),
           (ERR-6) uncertainty in the correction for annihilation
           in flight (2%),
           (ERR-7,2.,6.) uncertainty in the correction for lost
           recoil 8B nuclei (2% at Ep=30 MeV, 6% at Ep=47.5 MeV).
