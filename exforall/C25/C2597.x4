INSTITUTE  (1USAOHO,1USALAS)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) The tandem accelerator at Ohio
           University's Edwards Accelerator Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (SI)
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The outgoing charged particles were
           registered by charged particle spectrometer. The
           setup has ten 2-m time-of-flight legs ending with Si
           detectors. Legs are set up at different angles
           ranging from 22.5 up to 157.5 degrees, however we
           used nine angles for 3He+58Fe and two backward angles
           for d+59Co reactions due to some electronics and
           detector problems. The mass of the charged particles
           is determined by measuring both the energy deposited
           in Si detectors and the time of flight. Additionally,
           a neutron detector was placed at the distance of 140
           cm from the target to measure the neutron energy
           spectrum. The mass resolution was sufficient to
           resolve protons, deuterons, 3H/3He, and
           alpha-particles. Additional measurements with a blank
           target have been performed at each angle to determine
           background contribution.

REACTION   (26-FE-58(HE3,X)1-H-1,,DA)
SAMPLE     (26-FE-58,ENR=0.82) Self-supporting foils of 0.625-
           mg/cm2 58Fe (82% enriched) have been used as targets.
ANALYSIS   The absolute cross section has been calculated by
           taking into account the target thickness, the
           accumulated charge of incoming deuteron or 3He beam,
           and the neutron detector efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The overall systematic error for the
           absolute cross sections is estimated to be 15%. The
           errors in ratios of proton and alpha cross sections
           are only a few percents because they are determined
           by counting statistics alone.

REACTION   (26-FE-58(HE3,X)2-HE-4,,IPA/DE)
SAMPLE     (26-FE-58,ENR=0.82) Self-supporting foils of 0.625-
           mg/cm2 58Fe (82% enriched) have been used as targets.
ANALYSIS   The absolute cross section has been calculated by
           taking into account the target thickness, the
           accumulated charge of incoming deuteron or 3He beam,
           and the neutron detector efficiency. In order to
           eliminate contributions from the direct reaction
           mechanism, energy spectra of neutron, protons, and
           a-particles measured at backward angles (from 112 to
           157) have been used for analysis. However, units for
           cross sections are mb/MeV in Fig.3. This is because
           cross sections were determined for each angle in the
           units of mb/MeV/Sr and then multiplied by 4pi to be
           able to compare them with Empire calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The overall systematic error for the
           absolute cross sections is estimated to be 15%. The
           errors in ratios of proton and alpha cross sections
           are only a few percents because they are determined
           by counting statistics alone.

SAMPLE     Self-supporting 0.89-mg/cm2 59Co (100% natural
           abundance) have been used as targets.
ANALYSIS   The absolute cross section has been calculated by
           taking into account the target thickness, the
           accumulated charge of incoming deuteron or 3He beam,
           and the neutron detector efficiency. In order to
           eliminate contributions from the direct reaction
           mechanism, energy spectra of neutron, protons, and
           a-particles measured at backward angles (from 112 to
           157) have been used for analysis. However, units for
           cross sections are mb/MeV in Fig.3. This is because
           cross sections were determined for each angle in the
           units of mb/MeV/Sr and then multiplied by 4pi to be
           able to compare them with Empire calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental errors.
           (ERR-SYS) The overall systematic error for the
           absolute cross sections is estimated to be 15%. The
           errors in ratios of proton and alpha cross sections
           are only a few percents because they are determined
           by counting statistics alone.

ANALYSIS   (PES) In order to improve level density parameters,
           the experimental level densities have been fitted
           with the Fermi-gas function for two different spin
           cutoff factors sigma1 and sigma2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) Uncertainties of obtained level densities
           have been estimated to be about 20% which include
           uncertainties of absolute cross section measurements
           and uncertainties of particle transmission
           coefficients (text on page 044602-6)
