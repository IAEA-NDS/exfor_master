FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the cyclotron
           facility at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
           Laboratory,Argonne
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene (CD2)n target with thickness
           of (9.1+-0.7) mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Projectile-like reaction products were
           momentum analyzed and transmitted to the focal plane
           of the S800 spectrometer, which was run in a
           focused mode and provided clean identification of
           27Si ions.
           (HPGE) Prompt gamma rays were detected using GRETINA
           tracking array. It comprised of 10 modules positioned
           at laboratory angles of 58 deg and 90 deg.
CORRECTION Gamma ray energies were Doppler-corrected.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays in GRETINA
           and 27Si recoils in S800 spectrograph was required
INC-SOURCE A beam of radioactive 26Si ions was produced by
           projectile fragmentation of 150 MeV/A primary 36Ar
           beam. Secondary energy of 26Si ions was 30 MeV/A,
           beam purity was (60+-5) % and typical intensity
           approx. 1E+5 ions/s. Time of flight measrements
           upstream and downstream of the target allowed
           identification of incomming 26Si ions on event by
           event basis.
