TITLE      Energy dependence of 209Bi fragmentation in
           relativistic nuclear collisions

           #doi:10.1103/PhysRevC.23.1044
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) The LBL Bevalac facility.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) spectroscopy.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The target fragmentation products
           stopped in the target or catcher foils and the
           induced radioactivities were measured by gamma ray
           spectroscopy of the target foils and chemically
           separated gold fractions. These measurements were
           made on the sample at regular intervals over a period
           of from 30 min to one year after irradiation. The
           gamma ray emitting nuclei were identified using
           standard techniques and the production cross sections
           were calculated for those activities observed in the
           chemical samples were normalized to those seen in the
           unseparated foils. However, this normalization was
           not possible for the 25.2 GeV 12C data because only
           one foil was irradiated and chemically processed, and
           therefore these production cross sections are
           expressed in arbitrary units.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties given for sigma(Z,A)
           reflect the contribution from statistical
           uncertainties from the measurements and an ad hoc
           factor of 20% of the beta-decay feeding correction
           where applied.
FLAG       (1.) m+g value.
