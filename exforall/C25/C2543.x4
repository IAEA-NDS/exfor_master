INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 88-
           inch cyclotron.
SAMPLE     The targets used in this experiment consisted of 90
           to 100 microg/29Si02 evaporated onto 1.9 cm diameter,
           0.013 mm thick Ta foil backings.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Each target was irradiated within 180
           beam of one of eight energies 30,40,50,58.5,70,80,87
           and 99 MeV which was provided by the Lawrence
           Berkeley Laboratory 88-inch cyclotron. The length of
           the irradiation period varied between 45 and 60
           minutes. The Sc nuclei produced by the reaction
           recoiled into the Ta backing and were stopped. Their
           subsequent decays were measured after the end of the
           irradiation by gamma-ray spectroscopy using a Ge(Li)
           detector. For beam energies above 70 MeV, the 180
           projectile energy exceeded the Coulomb barrier of the
           Ta target backing, allowing the production of
           activities with large cross sections that obscured
           those of interest. Therefore, a chemical separation
           was performed to isolate the Sc activities from the
           targets bombarded with the three highest energy
           beams. The chemical separation technique involved
           coprecipitation of Sc with LaF3.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Thus, by performing a standard analysis of
           the decay curve associated with the 1157 keV
           transition, the activity of each member of the isomer
           pair at the end of the irradiation was calculated.
           Using these activities and correcting for growth and
           decay during the irradiation and for the branching
           ratios to each decay mode, the final isomer ratios
           were computed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
