FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was carried out at the
           ISAC2 facility at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Target consisted of set of four 208Pb foils, backed by
           Al foils. Stacked target thicknesses were 0.585, 0.856,
           1.215 and 0.721mg/cm2.
           The Al foil thicknesses were 5.033 and 0.98mg/cm2.

DETECTOR   (SI) Each Pb target-degrader assembly was at the
           center of a cubical vacuum chamber, where four
           300-mm2 Canberra PIPS silicon detectors viewed the
           target-degrader assembly.
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Proton beams with energy of 500 MeV and
           intensity of approx. 70 mu-A struck Ta metal
           production targets. Beams of radioactive 11Li were
           extracted with energies up to 18.4 keV,
           mass-separated by passage through two dipole magnets,
           and accelerated to their final energy by
           radio-frequency quadrupole and drift tube linear
           accelerators. The "center-of-target" 11Li beam energies
           were 26.1, 27.4, 28.5 and 32.7MeV in the four cubes
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 11Li beam was pulsed on for less than 5
           ns and shut off for 172 ns, during which time the
           alpha decay of any stopped evaporation residue was
           measured. Product nuclei were identified by alpha
           particle energy.

ANALYSIS   There is an ambiguity in the identification of 212mAt,
           215At, and 216mAt based on alpha spectroscopy alone.
           HIVAP and similar calculations predict very small
           cross section for complete fusion product 216At. For
           negligibly small production cross section 216At was
           removed from the 212Atm/215At ambiguity.
