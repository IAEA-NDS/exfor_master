FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) BEVALAC.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (EXTB,GSPEC) An external beam of 20Ne was delivered
           to a 1 m air gap by the BEVALAC at the Lawrence
           Berkeley Laboratory. Two separate irradiations were
           performed, one of the gold foils and one of the
           tantalum foil. Gamma-ray spectrometric measurements
           were made with a single Ge(Li) detector on 5-10 cm2
           area pieces cut from the irradiated target foils,
           which were centered on the beam spot. These
           measurements began 20 min after the end of bombardment
            (EOB) for the gold targets, 14 h after EOB for the
           tantalum target, and continued essentially
           uninterrupted for 40 d. The irradiated target
           materials provided strong radioactive sources which
           allowed measurement in low geometries where
           gamma-gamma summing losses had been measured to be
           small.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) After the gamma-ray measurements were
           completed the spectra were analyzed, decay curves are
           then identified interactively by their gamma-ray
           energy and halflife with the code TAU2. Multiple
           assignments are made to the decay curves at this
           point if the assignment based on the combination of
           half-life and gamma-ray energy is ambiguous. Off line,
           all the assignments are screened to remove multiple
           assignments and ensure that the gamma rays for each
           isotope were observed with the proper abundances
            (i.e., no transition stronger than the observed
           transition can be missing). The cross section is
           then calculated from the statistically weighted
           average of the observed gamma-ray transitions for
           each isotope.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Using a propagation of errors treatment,
           one estimates that on the average, individual points
           in the mass yield curve have a systematic uncertainty
           of -+30% which would be added quadratically to the
           error in the measured value.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty
CORRECTION The cross section calculation includes corrections
           for a nonuniform beam level during the irradiation.
