SAMPLE     Self-supporting targets of ~500 microg/cm2 metallic
           bismuth.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)
ANALYSIS   Production cross sections of the target-like fragments
           were determined by detection of the projectile-like
           fragments assuming binary reaction.
COMMENT    Spontaneous fission 234,236,238,240Cf  and a-decay
           values for 234,236,238Cf are estimates.

REACTION   (83-BI-209(26-FE-56,X)ELEM/MASS,,SIG,,MSC) Primary
           yields (Cross sections including production of
           target-like fragments before particle emission or
           fission)
ANALYSIS   The energy loss (Eloss) distribution for Z=14 is
           found to have a most probable Eloss value of 240 MeV
           and an FWHM of about 40 MeV. As a consequence, even
           for rather large values of projectile energy loss,
           diffusion processes which transfer a large net.
           number of nucleons yield products which are formed in
           relatively low states of excitation. The excitation
           energy of the primary fragments was assumed to be
           determined by the energy loss (divided according to
           the mass ratio of the fragments) and the calculated Q
           values. The yields were then integrated over all
           Eloss values and tabulated.

           Final yields
ANALYSIS   In order to estimate the final cross sections, we have
           calculated the probabilities for deexcitation as a
           function of Eloss assuming neutron emission and
           fission are the major decay channels.
