TITLE      Radiative capture, particle emission and fission in
           heavy nuclei

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USADAV) External beam of the Crocker
           Laboratory 1.5 m cyclotron.
SAMPLE     For bombardments of most isotopes, oxide targets of
           0.1 to 0.5 mg/cm2 thickness were prepared by
           electroplating from 0.4 M ammonium oxalate solution
           onto 1 cm2 aluminum planchets. Foils of 0.002 cm
           thickness were used for 238U bombardments and some
           235U bombardments. Isotopic purity was greater than
           93% for all targets.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Aluminum and platinum foils placed over
           targets to degrade beam energy.
