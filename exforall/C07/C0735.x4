TITLE      Mechanism of the 6Li(6Li,2alpha)alpha reaction from
            36 to 46 MeV
FACILITY   (VDGT,1CANCRC)
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 6Li targets, evaporated onto
            20 mu-g/cm2 carbon backings. Areal density 500
            microg/cm2.
METHOD     (BCINT,EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES) Two Si-detector telescopes, coplanar with,
            on opposite sides of, and at equal angles to the beam.
            Both telescopes had 1.39 msr defining apertures;
            one used a 32 micron deltaE counter followed by a
            1000 micron E-counter, while the other had a 53
            micron deltaE and a 2000 micron E-counter.
MONITOR    The counter telescopes were calibrated to an
            accurancy of 0.1 MeV over the energy range 10 to 40
            MeV using the D(6Li,2alpha) reaction. A 2.2 mg/cm2
            thick CD2 target, was bombarded with a 6Li beam whose
            energy in the center of the target was 29.2 MeV.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by R. Warner, 27 March 2001.
