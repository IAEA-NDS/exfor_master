TITLE      A T(21) analyzing power standard for tensor polarized
            deuteron beams
INC-SOURCE (LAMB) Runs with large it11, t20, or t22 beam
            polarizations were taken to determine T21 analyzing
            power.  Runs with large t21 were used to calibrate
            the T21 analyzing power of the polarimeter.
SAMPLE     16O gas target at 12 torr.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Surface barrier detectors placed symmetrically
            to right and left of beam.
MONITOR    Beam current monitored using Xe(d,d) reaction at 30
            degrees.
ANALYSIS   iT11, T20, and T21 were treated as adjustable
            parameters and were determined by fitting the
            measured peak sums.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty given includes both systematic
            as well as statistical uncertainties.
STATUS     Data taken from Table I in reference.
