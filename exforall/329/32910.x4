INC-SOURCE (D-D) The 2.8 MeV neutrons were obtained by
           bombarding a Ti-D target with a deuterium beam of 300
           keV energy.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.8949) The uranium target with purity
           99.9%, is a thin slice with a side length of 1.5 cm,
           a thickness of 1 mm, and a mass of 0.74 g. The mass
           abundance of uranium isotopes includes U-234(1.15%) ,
           U-235(89.49%), U-236(0.23%) and U-238(9.13%) .
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer system is
           mainly composed of a GEM30P4 HPGe gamma-ray detector
           produced by ORTEC. The resolution of the HPGe
           gamma-ray detector is about 1.7 keV at 1.33 MeV.
           Three standard sources (Ba-133, Eu-152, and Co-60)
           with known activities were applied to the energy
           calibration and efficiency calibration.
           (SIBAR) Based on the He-3-particles from the D-D
           reaction measured by the Au-Si surface barrier
           detector, the average neutron flux was determined to
           be 9.24E8 (/s) .
METHOD     (GSPEC) The uranium target was irradiated for 105 h.
           After cooling for 8.855 h, the counts of the
           full-energy peak of gamma rays emitted by various
           fission products were measured by HPGe gamma-ray
           spectroscopy.
           (ASSOP) The average neutron flux was determined based
           on the He-3 particles from the D-D reaction measured
           by the Au-Si surface barrier detector. This method
           also monitored the neutron flux fluctuation.
CORRECTION The needed corrections containing:
           (1) isotope correction of uranium,
           (2) coincidence summing correction in gamma-ray
           cascade radiation,
           (3) self-absorption correction,
           (4) neutron fluency fluctuation correction.
