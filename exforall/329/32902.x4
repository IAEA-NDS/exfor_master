FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 high-current neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The density of the T-Ti target used was 2.18
           mg/cm2, the average energy and the intensity of the
           incident deuterium beam were 134 keV and about 230 uA,
           the neutron yield was about 2.0E11 n/s.
SAMPLE     A certain mass of high-purity uranium nitrate
            (UO2(NO3)2) powder was pressed into the mold. The
           diameter of the mold was 12 mm, and the thickness was
           about 1 mm. Three sample targets were placed at
           different angles (0, 45, 90 deg relative to the
           incident direction of the deuterium beam).
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high sensitivity HPGe detector with a low
           background lead chamber. The HPGe detector was
           connected to a general-purpose spectrometer
           amplifier (572A from ORTEC) with a shaping time of 1
           us. The energy and efficiency calibration of
           HPGe-gamma spectrometers had been carried out
           carefully using 60Co, 137Cs, 152Eu and 241Am standard
           sources. The detector had an absolute efficiency of
           0.504% at 1.173 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time is about 7000 s, the
           cooling time is about 300 s, and a about 5000 s
           period was arranged for the measurement.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           To eliminate the influence of the D-T reaction
           competitions on the neutron fluence.
MONIT-REF  (,,3,ENDF/B-VII.1,,2011)
CORRECTION The correction coefficient F = Fs * Fc * Fg,
           Fs is the self-absorption correction coefficient,
           Fc is the cascade coincidence correction coefficient,
           Fg is the geometric correction coefficient.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross-section
           mainly comes from the following. Other uncertain
           factors such as the geometry of the sample, the mass
           of the sample, the measurement time, the energy of
           the incident neutron, fluctuation of neutron flux,
           and the cascade coincidence effect of the gamma rays
           are all considered during the data analysis.
           (ERR-S,0.9,10.3) The statistical fluctuations of the
           characteristic peaks of gamma rays
           (ERR-1) The effect of the reference foil
           (ERR-2,2.0,2.5) The detection efficiency
           (ERR-3) The neutron correction factor
           (ERR-4) The self-absorption correction factor
