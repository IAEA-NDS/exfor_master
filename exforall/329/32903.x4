           obtained by dividing them.

SAMPLE     The samples included two copper samples and three
           aluminum samples with a sandwich structure, which
           were wrapped in cadmium foil to absorb thermal
           neutrons. The copper and aluminum samples are all
           natural ones >99.999% in purity. The thicknesses of
           each copper sample and each aluminum sample are 0.20
           and 0.02 cm, respectively. The diameter of all the
           samples is 2.00 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A low-background high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           detector (ORTEC, 46-TP41590A, diameter 82 mm, length
           55.4 mm). The HPGe detector was pre-calibrated for
           energy and detection efficiency using standard gamma
           sources of 60Co and 137Cs.
METHOD     (ACTIV) For each neutron energy, the samples were
           irradiated for about 10h. The three aluminum samples
           were measured separately with each measurement
           duration of about 10 min after the cooling of about
           60 min. The two copper samples were measured
           simultaneously (one on top of another) using the HPGe
           detector after the cooling of about 30 days, and they
           were measured twice (with their positions exchanged)
           in two runs with both measurement durations of about
           48 h.
