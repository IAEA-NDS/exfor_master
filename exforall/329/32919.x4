INC-SOURCE (D-D) Through the 2H(d,n) reaction in the deuterium
           gas target, quasi-monoenergetic neutrons were
           produced. During the measurement, the deuteron beam
           current was about 1.2 uA, and the neutron energy was
           5.0 MeV in the direction of 0 degree with respect to
           the deuteron beam line.
SAMPLE     A 232Th(OH) 4 sample was located at the cathodes of
           the TPC with diameter of 44.0 mm, thickness of 601.9
           ug/cm2, number of nuclei of 1.808E19.
DETECTOR   (TPC) The time projection chamber was used as the
           fission fragments detector.
           (FISCH,SCIN) The small parallel plate fission chamber
           was used for the determination of the absolute
           neutron flux. The EJ309 scintillator detector was
           used as neutron detector to determine neutron energy
           spectrum with the unfolding method.
