FACILITY   (SYNCH,3CPRIHP) The Back-n white neutron source at
           China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The neutrons are generated through the
           bombardment of a spallation target by a proton beam
           with an energy of 1.6 GeV and a frequency of 25 Hz.
SAMPLE     A natural Zr target with an abundance of 91Zr at
           11.23%, has a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of
           7.8 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) An HPGe detector was positioned 202 mm behind
           and to the left of the experimental target, forming a
           125-degree angle with the beam direction, to detect
           the gamma rays emitted during the reaction. As the
           detection efficiency of the detector at 934.3 keV is
           approximately 0.0048%. The energy and efficiency
           calibration of the detector were performed using the
           standard radioactive sources, specifically 60Co and
           152Eu.
METHOD     (TOF) A flight path about 76 m.
CORRECTION Not corrected for direct capture contribution, which
           is estimated to be less than 0.6% according to RADCAP
           code
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,5.0) The statistical error of the
           characteristic gamma rays predominantly ranges
           between 5% and 10%, with some errors exceeding 20%.
           (ERR-1,,1.) The error in neutron intensity is based
           on data provided by CSNS. Its relative error
           decreases gradually with increasing neutron incident
           energy, with a maximum value of approximately 1%.
           (ERR-2) The error introduced by the detector energy
           efficiency curve is approximately 2.5%.
           (ERR-3) Since the gamma characteristic peaks of other
           de-excitation paths were not identified in this
           experiment, their error contribution is taken as 3.3%.
