FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutron yield is approximately (3-5)E10 n/s.
            The neutrons were produced by a T(d,n)4He reaction
            with a D+ beam current of 250 uA. The thickness of
            the solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
            generator was 2.5 mg/cm2, and the energy of the
            incident D+ beam was 300 keV.
SAMPLE     High-purity aluminum (0.5 mm, 99.999% purity) foil
            was sandwiched between natural zirconium (0.1 mm,
            99.5% purity) and niobium (0.1 mm, 99.95% purity)
            foils. Four round disk samples with a diameter of 20
            mm were placed approximately 5.0 cm away from the
            T-Ti target relative to the deuteron beam incident
            angles of 0, 30, 60, and 100 deg. One arc shape
            sample with 0.5 cm in width and about 4 cm in length
            was placed about 3.0 cm away from the T-Ti target and
            about 60 to 135 deg relative to the deuterium ion
            incident direction.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector for the
            detection of accompanying particles.
           (HPGE) The activities of those Nb and Zr samples were
            determined using an HPGe gamma-ray detector with a
            relative efficiency of 68% and an energy resolution
            of 1.82 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.
           (SPEC) A dedicated accelerator mass spectrometer, the
            GYIG 1 MV AMS instrument was used to measure 26Al.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Two sets of aluminum samples placed at
            different locations were irradiated for 20 h.
           (AMS) An ultrasensitive AMS was needed to measure 26Al
