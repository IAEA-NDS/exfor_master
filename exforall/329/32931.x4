FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used
            in the neutron generator was about 2.19 mg/cm2 thick.
            Neutrons with a yield of about 5 E10 n/s were
            produced from the T(d,n)4He reaction with an
            effective deuteron beam energy of 255 keV and a beam
            current of 350 uA.
SAMPLE     (47-AG-109,NAT=0.48161) The natural metallic silver
            plate of 99.99% purity and about 2 mm thickness was
            made into four disc shaped samples with a diameter of
            20 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The sample groups were irradiated for more
            than 7.5 h. The sample groups were placed at angles
            of 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg and 135 deg relative to the
            direction of the deuteron beam, respectively. The
            distances of the sample groups from the center of the
            T-Ti target were about 40 - 50 mm. The samples were
            cooled for more than 186 days after irradiation, and
            the sample were measured for about 10 - 20 h.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The neutron flux was monitored by the
            accompanying alpha-particles, which were measured
            with an Au-Si surface barrier detector used at the
            angle of 135 deg.
           (HPGE) Gamma-ray activities of 108mAg and 92mNb were
            measured by a well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial HPGe
            detector (ORTEC made in U.S.A), of which crystal
            diameter is 70.1 mm, crystal length is 72.3 mm,
            relative efficiency is 68% and the energy resolution
            is 1.69 keV FWHM at 1332 keV for 60Co.
