TITLE      Fusion and Nonfusion Processes in Reactions Induced
           By 10-100 MeV Li-6 Ions with Fe Targets.

METHOD     (BCINT,EXTB,REC)
           The Extracted Beam Energy was Known Within +-0.3 MeV.
           The Thicknesses of All Targets and Catchers were
           Determined by Measuring the Energy Degradiation of
           Alpha Particles from an Am-241 Source.
ADD-RES    (RANGE,COMP)
           From the Measurements the Contributions of Various
           Reaction Mechanisms Could be Identified and Also be
           Determined the Extent to Which Various Mechanisms are
           Involved in the Production of Different Final Nuclei.
HISTORY    (19810115C)Nekw

SAMPLE     Fe-56, Isotopically Enriched Self-Supporting Targets,
           Thickness About 3 Mg/Cm**2. Contributions of Other
           Fe Isotopes were Less Than 0.08%.
METHOD     (SITA)
           The Detector was Placed About 3 Cm from the Target
           And at 90 Degrees with Respect to the Beam. To Look
           For Angular Distribution Effects Additional
           Measurements were Made at 125 Degrees For Two
           Bombarding Energies and Found to be Insignificant.
           Spectra were Collected During 1-2 Hours.
ANALYSIS   Cross Sections For the Production of Individual Nuclei
           Were Obtained by Summing Observed Cross Sections For
           Transitions Leading to the Ground State, or in Some
           Cases to Low Lying Excited States. Corrections For
           Sidefeeding to the Ground-State were not Attempted.

SAMPLE     Fe-56, Isotopically Enriched Self-Supporting Targets,
           Thickness About 3 Mg/Cm**2. Contributions of Other
           Fe Isotopes were Less Than 0.08%.
METHOD     (SITA)
           The Detector was Placed About 3 Cm from the Target
           And at 90 Degrees with Respect to the Beam. To Look
           For Angular Distribution Effects Additional
           Measurements were Made at 125 Degrees For Two
           Bombarding Energies and Found to be Insignificant.
           Spectra were Collected During 1-2 Hours.
ANALYSIS   Cross Sections For the Production of Individual Nuclei
           Were Obtained by Summing Observed Cross Sections For
           Transitions Leading to the Ground State, or in Some
           Cases to Low Lying Excited States. Corrections For
           Sidefeeding to the Ground-State were not Attempted.
ERR-ANALYS Systematic Errors are Estimated to be About 15%.
           Detailed Error Analysis is Missing.
CORRECTION For Dead Time Losses were Included. Corrections For
           Radioactivity Contribution were Found to be Negligible.

COMMENT    Half-Lives, Energies, and Branching Ratios were Taken
           From W.W.Bowman and K.W.Mac Murdo, at.Data.Nucl. Data
           Tables 13,89(1974).
SAMPLE     Fe-54, Isotopically Enriched Self-Supporting Targets,
           Thickness About 4 Mg/Cm**2, Enrichment 96.81%.
           Fe-56 Contribution 3.04%.
METHOD     (STTA,EDEG)
           The Target Assemblies Consisted of Stacks of Fe Foils
           And Al or Kapton Catchers, Interspersed with Al Beam
           Energy Degraders. For Each Bombardment Up to Twelve
           New Target-Catcher Combinations were Used.
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) Gamma-Spectra were Recorded Beginning About 10
           Minutes  After the End of Bombardment and were Followed
           During 3 Months.
ANALYSIS   The Total Production Cross Section of a Given Reaction
           Product was Obtained by Summing the Cross Sections
           Determined Separately from Target and Catcher
           Activities. For All But the Shortest Lived Products
           At Least Four Independent Activity Measurements were
           Made.
ERR-ANALYS The Quoted Errors were Estimated from the Spread in
           The Values of the Cross Section Obtained Through
           Different Measurements For All Relevant Transitions.
           Detailed Informations About the Error Analysis are
           Missing (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG).
