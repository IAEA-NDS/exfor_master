SAMPLE     Ca-Fluoride, Enrichment in Ca-48 96.8%, Thickness 30
           Mg/Cm**2.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           The Absolute Efficiency was Callibrated with an Iaea
           Set of Standards and with Eu-152 and Co-56 Sources.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           (ACTIV) At Each Energy Several Irradiations were
           Carried Out For Periods of 20 Min.  The Beam Currents
           Were in the Range from 30-120 Nanoamperes.  At the  End
           Of Irradiation the Activated Target was Mounted 50 mm
           From the Front Face of a Ge(LI)-Detector.  The Counting
           Period was 20 Min, T00.
           For an Accurate Knowledge of the Triton Beam Energies
           The C-13(P,GAMMA) Resonance at E(P)=1747.6 KeV was Used
           To Calibrate the 90 Degrees Analysing Magnet of the
           Van De Graff.
