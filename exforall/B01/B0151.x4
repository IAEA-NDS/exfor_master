          1(EXTB,STTA,EDEG,BCINT)
           Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R 3042(1966).
           Irradiation Times were About 80 Min.Decay Curves and
           Activities of All Foils of One Stack were Measured
           Simultaneously Using an Automatic Sample Changer.
          2(EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
SAMPLE    1Stack of Foils Composed of Five Sets. Each Set was Made
           Of Three Mylar Foils Each 11.7+-0.2 Micrometer Thick
           And of One Al-Foil For Energy Degradation, Thickness
           27.3 Micrometer. The Outer Mylar Foils Served As Recoil
           Catchers, the Middle Foil was the Target with Oxygen
           Of Natural Isotopic Composition.
          2Water Kept in a Cylindrical Water Cooled Titanium
           Cavity, 50 mm in Diameter and 2 mm Thick. The Beam
           Entered Through a 15 Micrometer Tantal Foil in Front
           Of the Cylinder. During Bombardment the Water is
           Decomposed Into Hydrogen and Oxygen. To Avoid
           Overpressure a Small Vessel Filled with Palladium was
           Connected to the Target Which Acts As a Catalist to
           Reform the Water.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION1The Coincidence Rates have Been Corrected For
           Background Radiation, Random Coincidences and Dead
           Times.
COMMENT   1The Strongest Impurity (C-11,HALF-LIVE = 20.3 MIN)
           After Four Hours was 0.5% of the F-18 Activity.
          2Small Impurities of C-11, N-13 and be-7 were Produced.
           After an Irradiation Time of 3 Hours the Ratio of be-7
           To F-18 is 2.5E-4. C-11 and N-13 are Permissible For
           Medical Use Because of Their Short Half-Lives. These
           Possible Activities Should be Much Less Than
           1 Nanocurie.
ERR-ANALYS1(ERR-T) The Error Given is the Total Error. It Includes
           The Following Uncertainties - Beam Current - 0.4%,
           Detection Probability-2.7%, Number of Target
           Nuclei-1.2%, Determination of the Initial Activities by
           Fitting the Decay Curves-2.3 to 5.1% Including
           Statistics in the Counting Rates.
           The  Following  Uncertainties Contribute to the Error
           Of Energy- Uncertainty of the Primary Beam Energy
           -0.2%, Thickness Spreads of the Preceding Foils-2%
           Each, Air Distances 2.To 4.%.
          2Information is Missing.
STATUS    2(CURVE) By Kachapag
           Yield Given in Dps/Microampere was Converted Into
           Microcurie/Microampere by the Compiler of Kachapag.
