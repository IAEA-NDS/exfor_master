TITLE      Charged-Particle Emission in Reactions of Zr-90
           With 10-86 MeV Protons.

SAMPLE     Target Material Consisted of a Uniform Mixture of
           Enriched Zr-90 As Zr-Oxide and Spectroscopically Pure
           Cu-Oxide.  Zr-Oxide Contained 97.7% 90-Zr and Less Than
           1% of Each of the Other Stable Isotopes.  The  Chemical
           Purity of Zr-Oxide was 99.8%.  The Powdered Target was
           Contained in a Thin Walled Aluminium Tube.
           In Some Experiments Pure Zr-Oxide was Irradiated. (SEE
           UNDER 'METHOD').
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOMIX,CHSEP)
           Mostly a Mixture of Zr-Oxide and Cu-O (FOR MONITORING)
           Was Irradiated.
           In Case of Y-Isotopes the Contributions of Zr-Parents
           Were Determined by Means of Multiple Timed Chemical
           Separations. For these Experiments Pure Zr-Oxide
           Targets Without Cu-O were Used and the Zr-90(P,2PN)Y-88
           Cross Sections were Used As Secondary Monitor.
           In All Other Cases the Precursors had Been Measured
           Directly.

           This Reaction was Used As a Secondary Monitor in Those
           Cases, Where Pure Zr-Oxide Without Cu-O Admixture was
           Irradiated.

CORRECTION The Disintegration Rates at the End of the Irradiations
           Were Calculated from the Observed Counting Rates by
           Correcting For Decay, Counter Efficiency, Absorption,
           Photon Abundance and Chemical Yield.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors Given Include Uncertainties Associated
           With Decay Curve Analysis, Detector Efficiencies,
           Published Uncertainties in Decay Schemes and Chemical
           Yields.

           The Thin Target.

           Analogous Experiment with the Same Goals, But Using
           The Much Heavier Target Nucleus Hg-202. The Results
           Are Compared to the Present Ones.
ADD-RES    (THEO)
           The Main Goal of this Work was to Study Alpha-Particle
           Emission from Definite Reactions. The Complex
           Excitation Functions have Been Decomposed Into a
           Component Due to Emission of One or Two Alpha-Particles
           And a Component Due to the Emission of Individual
           Nucleons. Excitation Energy Spectra For Alpha-Emission
           Events are Derived. The Implications of the Results
           On the Preequilibrium Model of Nuclear Reactions
           Are Discussed.
           Numerical Values For Total Alpha Emission are Deduced
           And Separated Into Direct and Evaporation Part. The
           Results are Compared to Those Calculated For the Hg-202
           Data from the Publication Cited Under 'Rel-Ref'.

           The Formerly Quoted 28.5 Min Isomer of Y-84 had
           Probably Been Assigned Wrongly. In the Meantime,
           Besides the 37 Min State, Which was Measured Here,
           There was Found a Low Spin State (1+) With a Half-Life
           Of 4.6 Sec Which Decays Via B+ and Ec Transitions
           To Sr-84. Since No Isomeric Transition was Found,
           It is Unclear Which Isomer is the Ground State. It
           Is Adopted by the Compiler That the Measured Cross
           Section is Only Partial. (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER).
           Due to the Experimental Conditions It was Assumed
           That the Given Cross Section Contains a Contribution
           From the Precursor Zr-84. (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER).
