METHOD     (EXTB,EDEG,BCINT,SITA,CHSEP)
           The Proton Beam was Degraded by Al Windows, the Flowing
           Cooling Water of the Target Arrangement and the Al Face
           Of the Target-Capsule. The Flowing Water Depth was
           Measured Accurately with a Vernier Caliper. The Target
           Support was Adjusted from the Al Window in Such a Way
           That the Proton Beam in Water was Degraded to the
           Desired Incident Energy. A Diffused Incident Proton
           Beam was Preferred in Order to Eliminate Melting of Te.
           Targets were Irradiated For 3-8 Hours with Proton Beams
           Of 8-13 Microamperes. The Maximum Dose Delivered to a
           Single Target was 70 Microampere*Hours.
SAMPLE     Te-124 Powder was Pressed Into a Target Capsule.
           The Al Face of the Capsule was 21 Mg/Cm**2,
           The Back Side 21-35 Mg/Cm**2 Thick. A Water Cooled
           Target Assembly was Used.

           (19981204A) Converted to Lower Case. Subentry B0169002
           Was Divided to Two Subentries As Different Target were
           Used For the Measurements. See B0169003
