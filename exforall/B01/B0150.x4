TITLE      Application of Glass Solid State Nuclear Track
           Detectors in the Measurement of the Charged Particle
           Fission Cross Section of Uranium.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK BIR)
DETECTOR   (GLASD)Two Glass Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors
           Were Used. The Detectors were Made of Soda Lime Glasses
           Having Uranium As an Impurity.
METHOD     (EXTB,EDEG,BCINT)
           On the Surface of the Glass Detectors Plastic Energy
           Degraders were Fixed. The Energy Degradiation For these
           Plastics was Accurately Known. After Irradiation the
           Glasses are Etched in 4.8% Hydrofluoric Acid For 1 Min
           At 22 Degrees.  Tracks are Counted Under Different
           Sections of the Surface Representing Different Regions
           Of He-3 Energy As Defined by the Energy Degrading
           Echelon.
ERR-ANALYS No Error Analysis Nor Error Values are Given.
COMMENT    Above 28 MeV the Contribution to the Fission Cross
           Section Could Come from Anyone or All of the Following
           Processes- U(HE-3,F), U(HE-3,NF), U(HE-3,PF) Or
           U(HE-3,DF). This is Due to the Fact That Above the
           Coulomb Barrier There is a Great Probability of Direct
           Interaction Between He-3 and Uranium.
