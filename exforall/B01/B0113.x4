TITLE      Excitation functions for quasielastic transfer
            reactions induced with heavy ions in bismuth

INSTITUTE  (2FR PAR,2FR GRA)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,18,1298,1978)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2FR PAR) ALICE Orsay accelerator
SAMPLE     Natural elemental sample (1 to 1.5 mg/cm2 thick)
            evaporated onto an Al-Foil.
           Additional Al foils served as catchers and were counted
            together with the target foils.
METHOD     (SITA,EDEG) Depending on the incident beam and energy,
            a single target or stacked targets were chosen.
           The incident energy was varied either by changing the
            acceleration parameters, or by Using Al degraders.
           In the Latter case, the energy reduction was
            calculated by means of the range-energy table of
            L.C.Northcliffe (1970).
REL-REF    (R,,L.C.Northcliffe+,J,ND/A,7,233,1970)
            Range-energy table
CRITIQUE   The range-energy values of Northcliffe contain
            systematic errors (R.Bimbot et al., Nucl.Instr.Meth.
            153(1978)161). It is unknown whether or not
            corrections for these errors were applied here.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Including
            - errors of the energy of the incident beam,
            - uncertainties on energy losses in Al degraders.
            This last error was estimated to be 15% of the energy
             loss.
            The ions accelerated with ALICE were calculated with
             an uncertainty of 2%.
           (DATA-ERR) Including
            - of beam flux measurement (2%),
            - target thickness and homogeneity (5%),
            - counting efficiencies
               (2-10% for alpha counting, 4% for gamma counting),
            - branching ratios for gamma emitters (5 to 10%), and
            - statistical errors of activities (5 to 50%).

COMMENT   1The Possible Production of Po-210 from at-210 and
           Bi-210 was Considered. The Cross Section For at-210
           Production was Directly Measured by Its Gamma Ray
           Emission, See Under 'Rel-Ref'.  Bi-210 was Determined
           Via Po-210. 48 Hours After Irradiation the Target and
           Catcher Foils were Dissolved and Po-210 was Separated
           By Spontaneous Deposition on Ag. Bi-210 Remained in
           Solution. Six Days Later a Second Separation was
           Performed Giving Po-210 Obtained from the Decay of

COMMENT   1The Possible Production of Po-210 from at-210 and
           Bi-210 was Considered. The Cross Section For at-210
           Production was Directly Measured by Its Gamma Ray
           Emission. Bi-210 was Determined Via Po-210. 48 Hours
           After Irradiation the Target and Catcher Foils were
           Dissolved and Po-210 was Separated by Spontaneous
           Deposition on Ag. Bi-210 Remained in Solution. Six
           Days Later a Second Separation was Performed Giving
           Po-210 Obtained from the Decay of Bi-210.

           In Case of a Contamination with Ar-40 Ions an Activity
           Of Ar-41 Could be Measured. The Cross Section For the
           Production of this Nuclide Being Very Small with Ca-40

           Method is Sensitive to a 1% Ar-40 Contamination
           (3.) The Incident Energy of the Projectiles was
           Determined by the Scattered Proton Technique, Thus
           Lowering the Energy Error to About 0.5%.

REACTION   (83-BI-209(20-CA-40,X)84-PO-210,CUM,SIG,,,EXP)
           The Cumulative Cross Sections Include the Formation
           Of Po-210, at-210 and Bi-210
RAD-DET    (84-PO-210,A)
DECAY-DATA (84-PO-210,138.4D,A,5305.,1.)
METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,STTA,SITA,EDEG,REC)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) 2-Pi Ionization Chamber
FLAG       (2.) The Purity of the Ca-40 Beam was Tested in a
           Subsequent Experiment by Irradiating a Thick Al-Foil.
           In Case of a Contamination with Ar-40 Ions an Activity
           Of Ar-41 Could be Measured. The Cross Section For the
           Production of this Nuclide Being Very Small with Ca-40
           Projectiles, and Much Larger with Ar-40 Ions. The
           Method is Sensitive to a 1% Ar-40 Contamination.
           (4.) The Incident Energy of the Projectiles was
           Determined by the Scattered Proton Technique, Thus
           Lowering the Energy Error to About 0.5%.
