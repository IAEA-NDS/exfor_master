REACTION   (20-CA-40(P,X)19-K-38-G,IND,SIG,,A,EXP) Shielded
           K-38-G Production Due to Radioactive Decay of Ca-38 and
           K-38-M is Negligible.
COMMENT    - By Compiler of Kachapag - The Contributions from
           Other Ca-Isotopes are Most Probably Quite Small.
RAD-DET    (19-K-38-G,DG)
DECAY-DATA (19-K-38-G,7.71MIN,DG,2170.,1.)
           Gamma-Rays in an Energy Window of 2.04 MeV - 2.3 MeV
           Were Counted in Multiscaling Mode.  Counting Started
           Within Two Minutes After the End of Irradiation.
SAMPLE     Natural Calcium Metal Targets (97% CA-40), Thickness
           0.3175+-0.001 Cm, Uniform Diameter 2.162+- 0.003 Cm.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,BCINT)
           The Initial Beam Energy of 158 MeV was Degraded by
           Polystyrene Absorbers. The Residual Energy was
           Calculated Using Range-Energy Tables from J.Janni,
           Report No. Afwl-Tr-65-150 (UNPUBLISHED).
           The Absolute Number of Protons Delivered was Known
           For Each Value of Absorber Thickness Due to
           Calibration of a Transmission Ionization Chamber
           Against a Faraday Cup.
           Irradiations Lasted from 0.3 to 2.4 Min Depending
           On the Absorber Thickness.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)Sodium Iodide Detector Surrounded by 5 Cm
           Thick Lead Shield.
           Absolute Photopeak Detection Efficiency was Calculated
           Using Tabulated Data of C.C.Grosjean and W.Brossaert
            (UNIVERSITY OF GHENT,GHENT,1965) And For the
           Photofraction the Data of M.J.Berger and S.M.Seltzer,
           Nucl.Inst.Meth. 104,317(1972).
           The Calculations were Checked Experimentally Using
           The Monitor Reaction Al-27(P,3PN)Na-24.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) A Competing Reaction Emitting a Gamma-Ray in
           The Observed Energy Window was Ca-40(P,3N+4P)Cl-34-M
           /Half-Life-  32.2Min, E=2.13MeV/.  Decay Curve Analysis
           Was Used to Separate the K-38 Activity from the
           Cl-34-M Activity and an Additional Background of 3.2
           Counts/Channel. The Competing Reaction had a Cross
           Section That was 20% or Less That of Ca-40(P,2PN)K-38
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR). The Measurement Errors of the Cross
           Sections are Estimated to be +-6%.  Further
           Informations About the Errors are Missing.
           (EN-ERR)  The Errors in the Energy Orginate Mainly from
           The Energy Spread in the Relatively Thick Target.
