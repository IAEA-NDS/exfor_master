TITLE      Fission Isomer of Np-237.
AUTHOR     (E.MIGNECO, G.RUSSO, R.DE LEO, A.PANTALEO)
INSTITUTE  (2ITYCAT)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,16,1919,1977)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2ITYMIL)
SAMPLE     Uranium Oxide Target, Enrichment in U-238
           99.99%, Evaporated onto an Aluminium Backing of 50
           Microgram/Cm**2.  The U-Oxide Layer was 2 Mg/Cm**2
           Thick.
DETECTOR   (GLASD,TRD)
ADD-RES    A Lifetime T=(45+-5)Ns of the Np-237 Fission Isomer
           Was Measured.
METHOD     (EXTB,EDEG,SITA)
           Al-Energy Degraders at the Entrance of the Scattering
           Chamber Reduced the Primary Beam Energy of 20 MeV.
           The Fission-In-Flight Method was Used. Fission
           Fragments Emitted Backwards are Detected by a Thin
           Annular Makrofol Foil, 10 Micrometer Thick, Placed on
           The Target Plane. Prompt Fission Yields were Measured
           With Glass Track Detectors, Placed at Several Angles
           With Respect to the Incident Beam Direction. After
           Exposure Glasses and Makrofol Foils were Etched and
           Tracks of Fission Fragments Optically Scanned.
CORRECTION To Calculate Delayed-To-Prompt Fission Ratios the
           Detection Efficiency of the Experimental Geometry and
           The Angular Distribution of Prompt Fission Fragments
           Were Taken Into Account. The Range of Np Recoils in
           U-Oxide was Calculated to be About 110 Microgram/Cm**2.
           For Determination of Escape Efficiencies of Recoiling
           Np Nuclei Calculated Values Based on Lindhard, Sharff
           And Schiott Theory were Used (K.DAN.VIDENSK.SELSK.
           MATH.-FYS.MEDD.33,N0.14 (1963)).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No Error-Analysis is Given. The Significance
           Of the Quoted Errors is Unknown.
           (EN-ERR). See Data-Err.
COMMENT    - Comment by the Authors - The Given Ratios are a
           Factor  1.7 Higher Than Those of K.L.Wolf and J.P.Unik,
           Phys.Lett.43B,25(1973)
STATUS     (CURVE) By Kachapag.
