TITLE      Reactions of Cu-63 and Cu-65 with alpha particles.
AUTHOR     (N.T.Porile, D.L.Morrison)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL).Chemistry department
REFERENCE  (J,PR,116,1193,1959)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USABNL).60 inch cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (EDEG) Energy degradation was calculated according to
           W.A.Aron et al.,aecu-663(1949). Unpublished.
           (STTA) Between one and twelve target foils were
           irradiated in one experiment.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation times varied between 15 seconds and
           1 hour.
           (EXTB) Incident alpha energy was 41 MeV.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION The target foils were generally thick enough to make
           the loss of recoils negligible.
ERR-ANALYS The errors in the cross sections are estimated As
           12 %.  In many cases cross sections were measured in
           duplicate.  The results usually agreed within 5%.
           Regarding a given excitation function the cross
           sections have a relative error of 5% with respect to
           each other. The energy values below 16 MeV can have an
           error of about 1 MeV.
ADD-RES    A method for monitoring the energy of the incident
           beam is described, based on the variation with energy
           of the cross section ratios.

           For energies above 27 MeV the Ga-66 yield includes a
           contribution of the Cu-65(A,3N) reaction.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
SAMPLE     Stack consisting of high-purity foils of natural copper
           0.00025 inch thick used for bombarding energies higher
           than 25 MeV. Below this energy Cu-foils of about
           2 mg/cm**2 were used which were prepared by vacuum
           evaporation onto Al and subsequent peeling off the
           Cu-foil of the backing.
