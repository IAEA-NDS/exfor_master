TITLE      Reactions of Cu-63 and Cu-65 with Alpha Particles.
AUTHOR     (N.T.PORILE, D.L.MORRISON)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL).Chemistry Department
REFERENCE  (J,PR,116,1193,1959)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USABNL).60 Inch Cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (EDEG) Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           W.A.Aron Et Al.,Aecu-663(1949). Unpublished.
           (STTA) Between One and Twelve Target Foils were
           Irradiated in One Experiment.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation Times Varied Between 15 Seconds and
           1 Hour.
           (EXTB) Incident Alpha Energy was 41 MeV.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION The Target Foils were Generally Thick Enough to Make
           The Loss of Recoils Negligible.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors in the Cross Sections are Estimated As
           12 %.  In Many Cases Cross Sections were Measured in
           Duplicate.  The Results Usually Agreed Within 5%.
           Regarding a Given Excitation Function the Cross
           Sections have a Relative Error of 5% with Respect to
           Each Other. The Energy Values Below 16 MeV can have an
           Error of About 1 MeV.
ADD-RES    A Method For Monitoring the Energy of the Incident
           Beam is Described, Based on the Variation with Energy
           Of the Cross Section Ratios.
HISTORY    (19801007C)Lane
           (19940727A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19981110A) Converted to Lower Case. Reaction Lines are
           Corrected.
           (20011010U) Last checking has been done.
