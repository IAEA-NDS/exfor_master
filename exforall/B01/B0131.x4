TITLE      Production of Na-24 from Al-27 by (35-100) MeV protons.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,BCINT)
           The Beam was Degraded from Its Nominal Extraction
           Energy of 102 MeV by Passing Through Beryllium Foils.
           Range-Energy Values were Taken from C.F.Williamson+,
           Cea-R3042(1966). Targets Consisted of a Stack of
           Three Al-Foils, the Centre One Being Used in the
           Analysis, the Outer Ones Serving As Guard Foils.
SAMPLE     Aluminium Foil, Enrichment 99.99%, Thickness 19.8
           Micrometer.
DETECTOR   (PROPC). For Beta-Counting.
           (NAICR). For Gamma-Counting.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The Quoted errors represent only the
           statistical uncertainties, arising from peak-area
           determination, fitting procedure, counter efficiencies,
           target  weighing and  Na-24 Decay-Data.  Not Included
           are systematic errors, e.g.  from determination of  the
           beam intensity, estimated to be about 1%.
           (EN-ERR) The Errors in the Determination of the
           absolute value of the beam energy, estimated to be
           about 0.5% at all Energies.  The energy spread of the
           degraded beam decreases from about 2 MeV at 50 MeV of
           incident energy to about 0.5 MeV at 100 MeV.
ADD-RES    (THEO)
           The Experimental Results are Compared to Calculations
           In the Framework of the Exciton Model. A Possible
           Contribution of a He-3 Producing Reaction Mechanism
           Is Discussed.
CORRECTION The Production of Na-24 by Secondary Neutrons
           Inducing the Al-27(N,A) Reaction has Been Taken
           Into Accout in Both a Theoretical and an Experimental
           Way.
HISTORY    (19800410C)Nekw
           (19981219A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
           CAJAD. Converted to Lower Case.
           (20020110A) V.McLane Remark is included
           (20110607A).Correction in Reference code was made,
           according Memo CP-D/688.
