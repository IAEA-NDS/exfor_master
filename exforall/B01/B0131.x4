TITLE      Production of Na-24 from Al-27 by (35-100) MeV Protons.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,BCINT)
           The Beam was Degraded from Its Nominal Extraction
           Energy of 102 MeV by Passing Through Beryllium Foils.
           Range-Energy Values were Taken from C.F.Williamson+,
           Cea-R3042(1966). Targets Consisted of a Stack of
           Three Al-Foils, the Centre One Being Used in the
           Analysis, the Outer Ones Serving As Guard Foils.
SAMPLE     Aluminium Foil, Enrichment 99.99%, Thickness 19.8
           Micrometer.
DETECTOR   (PROPC). For Beta-Counting.
           (NAICR). For Gamma-Counting.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The Quoted Errors Represent Only the
           Statistical Uncertainties, Arising from Peak-Area
           Determination, Fitting Procedure, Counter Efficiencies,
           Target  Weighing,  and  Na-24 Decay-Data.  Not Included
           Are Systematic Errors, E.G.  From Determination of  the
           Beam Intensity, Estimated to be About 1%.
           (EN-ERR) The Errors in the Determination of the
           Absolute Value of the Beam Energy, Estimated to be
           About 0.5% at All Energies.  The Energy Spread of the
           Degraded Beam Decreases from About 2 MeV at 50 MeV of
           Incident Energy to About 0.5 MeV at 100 MeV.
ADD-RES    (THEO)
           The Experimental Results are Compared to Calculations
           In the Framework of the Exciton Model. A Possible
           Contribution of a He-3 Producing Reaction Mechanism
           Is Discussed.
CORRECTION The Production of Na-24 by Secondary Neutrons
           Inducing the Al-27(N,A) Reaction has Been Taken
           Into Accout in Both a Theoretical and an Experimental
           Way.
HISTORY    (19800410C)Nekw
           (19981219A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
           CAJAD. Converted to Lower Case.
           (20020110A) V.Mc-Lane'S Remark is Included
           (20020115U) Last checking has been done.
