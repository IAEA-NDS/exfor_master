FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS)
SAMPLE     Thick Targets of Li-6 Fluoride, Enrichment in Li-6
           87.9%.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,BCINT)
           The Energy of the Deuteron Beam was Varied in Steps
           Of 20 KeV from E(LAB) 100-180 KeV.
ANALYSIS   The Cross Sections were Calculated from Thick
           Target Measurements Using a Formula Depending
           Mainly on the Slope of the Yield Curve at the
           Incident Energy and the Stopping Power of the
           Bombarding Particles in the Target. Range Tables
           According to C.F.Williamson Et Al., Report Cea-R 3042
            (1966) Were Used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Quoted Errors of the Cross Sections Include
           Statistical and Systematic Errors. Detailed Information
           About the Errors is Missing.
ADD-RES    The Cross Section Data were Extrapolated Down to
           The Region of Astrophysical Interest.
HISTORY    (19800424C)Nekw
           (19940719A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19981206A) Converted to Lower Case. Some Data-Heading
           Are Changed.
