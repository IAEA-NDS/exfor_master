TITLE      The Reaction Rate of the C-13(ALPHA,N)O-16 Process.

FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDAE )
DETECTOR   (BF3)
           A Number of 20 Boron-Trifluoride Tubes, Each with a
           Sensitive Length of 100 Cm and a Diameter of 4 Cm were
           Positioned in a Moderator Assembly in 4 Pi-Geometry.
           The Whole Detector was Shielded by Boron Plastic,
           Cadmium, Paraffin and Concrete. A Detector  Efficiency
           Of (18.3 +- 1.5)% was Obtained.
SAMPLE     Carbon Targets, Made by Heating a 0.1 mm Thick Tantalum
           Foil to Red Heat in an Atmosphere of Methyl Iodide
           Enriched with C-13 to 89%. The Target Thicknesses were
           Determined by Weighing Before and After the Cracking
           Procedure.  Additionally, the Thicknesses of the Thin
           Targets were Determined by Measuring the Width of the
           Sharp Resonance at 1.056 MeV For the C-13(ALPHA,N)0-16
           Reaction.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           The Analyzing Magnet of the Van De Graaff Accelerator
           Was Energy Calibrated by Measuring the Neutron Yield
           Of the C-13(A,N) Reaction at the Sharp Resonance at
           1.056 MeV.
ANALYSIS   The Yield Curve Consists of a Nonresonant Part and a
           Single Sharp Resonance at 1.056 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS No Error Analysis is Given.
ADD-RES    The Neutron Yields were Measured in Order to
           Derive an Expression For the Life-Time of C-13 Nuclei
           Burning by the (ALPHA,N) Process.
CORRECTION Energy Degradation of the Alpha-Particles Due to
           Carbon Deposits on the Targets were Corrected For.
STATUS     (CURVE)
           By the Authors the Neutron Yield Per Microcoulomb
           Was Given. The Yields in Part/Microampere * Hour
           Were Calculated by the Compiler.
