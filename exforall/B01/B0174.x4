TITLE      Excitation Functions of High-Energy Alpha-Particle
           Induced Nuclear Reactions on Aluminium and Magnesium-
           Production of Mg-28.

METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,EDEG)
           The Incident Alpha-Particle Energies were 156 or 97
           MeV. The Beam Currents Varied Between 50 and 520
           Nanoamperes.Irradiation Times were 15 Min For
           Short-Lived Reaction Products and Between 3.5 and
           19 Hours For Studies on Longer-Lived Nuclides. The
           Used Target Stacks Consisted of Up to 52 Single Foils.
           The Energy Degradation of the Alpha-Particles was
           Calculated According to C.F.Williamson Et Al. Report
           Cea-R-3042(1966).The Beam Current was Determined by
           2 Independent Methods. In Addition to Using the
           Formation of Na-24 As Monitor (SEE SUBENTRY B0174002),
           The Na-24 Activity Produced in the First Al-Foil of
           The Stack was Compared to That Produced in a Separately
           Irradiated Thin Al-Foil, For Which the Total Charge
           Was Measured with a Faraday Cup.
ERR-ANALYS 1.For a Few Values Typical Error Bars are Given. In the
           Energy Errors Uncertainties in the Alpha Energies Due
           To Energy and Angular Straggling, and Errors in the
           Thicknesses of Target Foils and in the Range - Energy
           Relationship are Included. The Uncertainty in Energy
           Amounted to 1-3 MeV, Dependent on the Energy Region
           And Target Thickness.
           2.Total Errors were Obtained Summing Up All
           Individual Errors in Quadrature:
           Foil Thicknesses (2%),
           Beam Current Measurement (<5%),
           Detector Efficiency (4%),
           Counting Statistics and Photopeak Integration.
ADD-RES    A Comparitive Study of the Al-27(ALPHA,3P)Mg-28 and
           Mg-26(ALPHA,2P)Mg-28 Reactions For the Production of
           Mg-28 is Made.

REACTION  1(13-AL-27(A,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG,,,EXP)
           After Measuring the Relative Excitation Function Up
           To 156 MeV, the Data were Normalized to the Values
           Of Martens and Schweimer (SEE MONIT-REF) In the
           Overlapping Energy Region of 75-103 MeV.

COMMENT    In the Publication the Reaction was Written As
           Al-27(ALPHA,BE-7)Na-24. Regarding the Production of
           Be-7 It is Supposed, That in Addition to the Cited
           Reaction Also Other Reaction Paths can Lead to be-7
           Production (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER).

ANALYSIS  2The Yield was Calculated Using the Measured Excitation
           Function.
COMMENT    Mg-28 is Formed in a Carrier-Free State.
           Major Radionuclidic Impurities Associated with the
           Production of Mg-28 are be-7 (BO174004), Na-22
            (B0174003), and Na-24 (B0174002).
           Since the Ratios of Mg-28 Yield to Yields of these
           Impurities is Nearly Independent of the Projectile
           Energy, the Authors Conclude That For Radiomedical
           Purposes a Chemical Separation of Mg is Absolutely
           Essential.

           Foils were Inserted.  The Thicknesses of the Foils were

STATUS     (CURVE)
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) A Thick Target Yield For Mg-28 is Calculated
           From the Excitation Function.  A Value of 155
           Microcurie Per Microampere*Hour is Quoted For an
           Alpha-Particles Energy of 140 MeV For a 100% Enriched
           Mg-26 Target.
COMMENT    The Authors Point Out a Distict Difference in Shape
           Of the Excitation Functions of (A,2P)- Reactions
           On Mg-26 and on Al-27 (SEE SUBENTRY B0174007).
           Major Radionuclidic Impurities Associated with the
           Production of Mg-28 are be-7 (B0174004), Na-22
            (B0174003), and Na-24 (B0174002).
           Since the Ratios of Mg-28 Yield to Yields of
           These Impurities is Nearly Independent of the
           Projectile Energy, the Authors Conclude That For
           Radiomedical Purposes a Chemical Separation of Mg
           Is Absolutely Essential.
