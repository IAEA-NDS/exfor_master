            gold

DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     Au foil (~2 mg/cm2 thick, 99.99% pure) and Al catcher
            foils (4.31 mg/cm2).
           Their thicknesses were determined by weighing .
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB)
           Irradiation of stacked Au and Al by alpha beams at
            40 MeV.
           (EDEG) The mean energy in each foil was calculated
            from the tables of C.F.Williamson et al. (1966).
           (ACTIV) Irradiated for 20-30 min
           (BCINT) Average beam current was monitored by a
            current integrator connected to a Faraday cup, and it
            was typically ~0.5 uA.

            Decay data
ERR-ANALYS The Accuracy of the beam energy was better than
            0.3 MeV.
           The experimental overall error in the cross section
            measurement is less than 10%.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Thick target yields calculated by integration
            of measured excitation functions on smooth curves
STATUS     (CURVE)
