DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     Au-197, 99.99% Pure. The Target Assembly was
           Constructed by About 2 Mg/Cm**2 Thick Gold Foils and
           Al Catcher Foils of 4.31 Mg/Cm**2 Thickness. The
           Thicknesses were Determined by Weighing .
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,BCINT,EDEG)
           The Incident Alpha-Particle Energy was 40 MeV. The Mean
           Energy in Each Foil was Calculated from the Tables of
           C.F.Williamson Et Al., Report Cea-R 3042(1966).
           (ACTIV) Irradiations Lasted For 20-30 Minutes.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The Accuracy of the Beam Energy was Better
           Than 0.3MeV.
           The Experimental Overall Error in the Cross Section
           Measurement has Been Estimated to be Less Than 10%.
           Detailed Informations About the Errors are not Given
            (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG).
ANALYSIS   The Thick Target Yields were Calculated by Integration
           Of the Measured Excitation Functions.
ADD-RES    The Production Method of Tl-199 For Medical Purposes
           Was Investigated and the Best Irradiation Conditions
           Determined For the Au-197(ALPHA,2N) Reaction (SEE
           SUBENTRY B0172003).
STATUS     (CURVE)  By Kachapag.
          2The Thick Target Yields Given were Read from the
           Published Smooth Curve at Arbitrary Energy Values
            (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER).

ADD-RES   2The Expected Contaminant Thick-Target Yields of
           Tl-200, Tl-198-M, and Tl-198-G Relative to Tl-199
           Were Calculated As a Function of Incident Alpha
           Particle Energy. From this It was Found That the
           Optimum Irradiation Energy is Between 22 and 28 MeV.
           With this Alpha Energy Region (CORRESPONDING TO A
           TARGET THICKNESS OF 61.4 MG/CM**2) The Thick Target
           Yield of Tl-199 is 980 Microcurie/Microampere*Hour. The
           Amount of Tl-200 Contamination was 0.56% at the End  of
           Bombardment.
