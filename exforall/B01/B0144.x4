TITLE      The C-12 + C-12 Sub-Coulomb Fusion Cross Section.

SAMPLE     Solid Piece of Reactor Graphite, Surface-Purified
           Using an Electron Gun.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           Two Detectors were Used Mounted at 90 Degrees and
           270 Degrees to the Beam Direction.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           In-Beam Gamma-Ray Spectra were Measured. The Beam
           Energy was Increased in Steps of 125 KeV Between
           E=2.46 and 3.89 MeV and 250 KeV Between 4.14 MeV
           And 5.88 MeV. (ALL ENERGIES ARE GIVEN IN THE
           C.M.-SYSTEM). The Target Thickness was Essentially
           Greater Than the Range of the Incident C-12 Ions.
           From the Ratio of Counts in the Two Detectors Used It
           Was Concluded That the Position of the Beam Spot
           Remained Stable During the Experiment.
           Beam Currents Varied Between 3 and 5 Microamps.
ANALYSIS   For Cross Section Calculation It was Necessary Due to
           The Thick Target to Take the Difference of Yields
           Of Two Measurements at Different Bombarding Energies.
           This Yield Then Corresponds to a Definite Target
           Thickness and Beam Energy.
           Absolute Cross Sections were Obtained by Normalizing
           The Measured Yields Above 3.5 MeV to Data Obtained from
           Measuring the Emitted Particles by Mazarakis and
           Stephens, Pr C7,1280(1970).
CORRECTION A Branching Correction was Applied Taking Into Account
           That Some States Populated Via Particle Emission
           Do not Deexcitate Exclusively Via the Observed First
           Excited State. Included in this Correction are the
           Particle Decays Directly to the Ground State, Which
           Represent the Largest Correction. The Branching
           Correction has a Maximum Value of About 50%.
           The Energy Values were Corrected For the Nonlinear
           Effects of the Exponential Drop-Off of Cross Section
           In the Target.
           A Further Correction For Pulse Pile-Up of Cascading
           Gamma-Rays was Applied, Which was Found to Vary with
           Energy Negligibly.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors Quoted in the Data Section Include the
           Uncertainty in Charge Collection Plus the Statistical
           Errors, Which Arise Mainly from the Subtraction of a
           Large Background. Further Information About Errors
           Is Missing.
           (DATA-ERR). See Above.
MISC-COL   (MISC) C.M.-Projectile Energies As Given by the Authors
           The Lab-Energies were Calculated by the Compiler.
COMMENT    The Neutron Decay-Channel has a Q-Value of -2.6 MeV
           And Accounts For Only 5% of the Fusion Cross Section at
           Higher Energies.
ADD-RES    The C-12 + C-12 Fusion Cross Section is Deduced.

           The Given Cross Section May Contain a Small
           Contribution from the C-12(C-12,N)Mg-23 Reaction
           Channel Due to the Fact That the First Excited Levels
           In Na-23 (439 KEV) And Mg-23 (450 KEV) Could not
           Be Resolved.
