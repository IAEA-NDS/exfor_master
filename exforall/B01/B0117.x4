           The Normalization of Total Cross Sections was Performed
           By Comparing Measured Elastic Scattering Cross Sections
           To Predictions of the Optical Model.  The Used O.M.
           Parameters are Specified in the Paper.

DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two Counter Telescopes with Silicon
           Surface-Barrier Detectors of 15 and 2000 Micrometer
           And 7.2 and 1500 Micrometer Thickness.
METHOD     (SITA,EDE,EXTB,MOMIX)
           An Excitation Curve was Measured with Two Counter
           Telescopes, Positioned at 15 Degrees and 25 Degrees,
           In Steps of 0.5-2.0 MeV in the Range E(LAB)=30-64  MeV.
           The Angular Distributions were Measured at E(LAB)=35,
           49 and 62 MeV, Whereby the Two Telescopes were Used
           From 10 to 90 Degrees and 90 to 170 Degrees,
           Respectively.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED)
           To Obtain the Excitation Curve the Differential
           Cross Sections, Measured As a Function of Bombarding
           Energy at Two Angles Only, were Converted Into Total
           Cross Sections by Normalization Factors Interpolated
           Between Those at the Three Energies at Which Angular
           Distributions were Measured. This Procedure was
           Justified by the Fact That these Factors Change Less
           Than 10% Between 35 and 62 MeV.
           A Small Hydrogen Contamination in the Target Yielded
           A Sharp Proton-Knockout Peak Which was Subtracted
           Before Integrating.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Absolute Cross Sections have an
           Estimated Uncertainty of 7%.  For the Values of the
           Excitation Curve a Standard Deviation of 3% was Found
           By Comparing Two or Three Independent Measurements Made
           At 17 Energies.
