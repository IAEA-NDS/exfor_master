METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,EDEG,STTA)
           The Incident Proton Energy was 60 MeV. A Multi-Target
           Assembly with 3 Different Targets was Used. After
           Passing Through the First Target the Degraded Particles
           Were Utilized For the Production of Other Kinds of
           Radioisotopes in the Second and Third Target ,
           Respectively. Irradiations Lasted About 2.5 Hours,
           The Average Beam Current was 1 Microampere.
COMMENT    No Information on the Method of Activity
           Measurement, Detected Radiation, and Decay Data
           Used is Given.
ADD-RES    Simultaneous Production of 123-I, 62-Zn and 13-Nh3.
ERR-ANALYS No Error Analysis is Given.

REACTION   (53-I-127(P,X)53-I-123,CUM,TTY,,DT,EXP)
           In this Reaction Primarily Xe-123 was Produced. After
           Freezing It Out, It was, in Turn, Used to Obtain
           I-123 Via Beta-Decay of Xe-123. The Quoted Yield Refers
           To I-123 Activity, Measured About 7 Hours After the End
           Of Irradiation.

SAMPLE     Na-Iodide Powder, Thickness 1.5 G/Cm**2. The Energy
           Loss in the Target was 10 MeV For 60 MeV Incident
           Protons.
METHOD     During the Irradiation, the Volatile Products in the
           Target are Swept Away by a Carrier He Gas. The
           Xe-Isotopes are Isolated from the Carrier Gas and
           Decay to I-123 and I-125, Respectively.
ANALYSIS   No Radioactive Contaminants Except I-125 were Detected.

SAMPLE     Stacked Copper Foils, Thickness 1.6 G/Cm**2. The Energy
           Loss in the Target was 20 MeV For About 38 MeV Protons.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           The Proton Energy After Passing Through the First
           Target and an Absorber was About 38 MeV. The Irradiated
           Cu-Target was Transferred to a Hot Cell After the
           Irradiation.
ANALYSIS   The Radionuclidic Purity of the Zn-62 was Greater
           Than 99.5%.

SAMPLE     Distilled Water.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           After Passing Through the First and Second Target the
           Proton Energy was 18 MeV. The Sample was Thick Enough
           To Degrade the Proton Energy Completely. During the
           Irradiation, the Volatile Products in the Target are
           Swept Away by a Purge Gas During the Irradiation.
ANALYSIS   The Radionuclidic Purity of 13-N-H3 was Greater Than
           99.5%.
