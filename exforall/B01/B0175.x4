TITLE      A multi-target assembly in an irradiation with high
            energy particles. Simultaneous production of 123I,
            62Zn and 13NH3

METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,EDEG,STTA,CHSEP)
           Irradiation of a multi-target assembly (NaI-Cu-H2O)
            by 60 MeV protons
           After passing through the NaI target the degraded
            particles were utilized for production of other
            nuclides at the Cu and H2O target.
           (ACTIV) Irradiated for ~2.5 hrs at 1 uA in average.
ERR-ANALYS No information on the uncertainty
ADD-RES    127I(p,x)123Xe -> 123I activity 7 hours after the
            end-of-bombardment (14 mCi/2.5 hr for 60->50 MeV).
