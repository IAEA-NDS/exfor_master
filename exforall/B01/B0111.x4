TITLE      Excitation Functions of Proton Induced Nuclear
           Reactions on Rb-85

           (W,HORIGUCHI,197909). Preprint Including Tables with
           Numerical Data.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2JPNOSA)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,MOMIX,MOSEP,EDEG,BCINT)
           Incident Energy of 70 and 60 MeV was Degraded by Means
           Of Copper and Silver Plates.
           Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R 3042(1966).
           The Beam Current of Incident Protons was Measured by
           Means of the Secondary Electron Emission Monitor
           Method. The Monitor was Calibrated with a Faraday Cup
           Before and After Irradiation. In Addition, the Beam
           Current Taken Up by the Target was Determined by
           Monitor Reactions.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           Three Different Detectors were Used Having Fwhm-Values
           Of 550 eV at 122 KeV and 2.0 or 2.5 KeV at 1332 KeV,
           Respectively.
SAMPLE     Mixture of Rb-Chloride Powder, 99.78% Enriched
           In Rb-85 and Al-Powder, Purity Better Than 99.99 %
           Uniformly Spread on a Mylar Film of 50 Micrometer
           Thickness. This Target was Stacked Together with an
           Al-Foil of 10 Micrometer and a Cu-Foil of 20 Micrometer
           Thickness.
           The Target Thickness was Determined by Comparing the
           Na-24 Activity Produced from the Al-Powder to That from
           The Al-Monitor Foils. The Results Agreed Well with
           Thicknesses Obtained by Weighing.
