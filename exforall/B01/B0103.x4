           The Thick Target Yields were Calculated by Integrating
           The Differential Cross Sections Measured from a Stack
           And Renormalizing to Natural Abundance of Mo-98.
           The Experimental Value For this Reaction Published
           Earlier by the Authors (ISOTOPENPRAXIS,5,247(1969), SEE
           ALSO SUBENTRY B0084008) Was a Factor of 1.7 Smaller.
           This is Probably Due to a Less Accurate Current
           Determination Using a Current Integrator Without
           Suppression of Secondary Electrons from the Target.

SAMPLE     Stack 1 Consisting of Mo-Foils of 17.82 Mg/Cm**2 and
           Al-Foils of 3.02 Mg/Cm**2 For Beam Monitoring,Energy
           Degradation,and the Determination of Recoils. Purity of
           The Mo-Foils Higher Than 99%.  The Stack was Irradiated
           For 17.78 Hours with a Maximum Deuteron Energy of 13
           MeV.  Stack 2 Consisting of Mo-Foils of 20.3 Mg/Cm**2
           And Al-Foils of 3.02 Mg/Cm**2 For Beam Monitoring,
           Energy Degradation, and the Determination of Recoils.
           The Stack was Irradiated For 5 Minutes with a Maximum
           Deuteron Energy of 11.7 MeV.
COMMENT    A Contribution from the Reaction Mo-100(D,T)Mo-99 is
           Assumed to be Lower by Two Orders of Magnitude and can
           Be Neglected Therefore.
          1A Difference of 10 to 30% Between Cross Sections
           Obtained from the Two Different Irradiations in the
           Region Above 8 MeV is Probably Due to an Error in the
           Determination of the Beam Current from the Long-Time
           Irradiation of the Al-Monitor.
CORRECTION The Production of Mo-99 by Secondary Neutrons was
           Experimentally Determined and Corrected For.
ADD-RES    Saturation Production Rates were Calculated For 11.7
           And 13.0 MeV on the Basis of the Cross Sections Given.

CORRECTION The Production of Mo-101 by Secondary Neutrons was
           Checked and Stated to be not Significant by the Authors
ADD-RES    A Saturation Production Rate of 2280 Microcurie/
           Microampere at 11.7 MeV was Calculated on the Basis of
           The Cross Sections Given.
FLAG      2(1.) The Thick Target Yield Given is Too High Compared
           With the Saturation Production Rate Calculated by the
           Authors. The Correct Value Should be Lower Than 2280
           Microcurie/Microamperehour. The Discrepancy to the
           Value Given is Due to the Fact That a Formula was Used
           Which is Valid Only For Irradiation Times Short in
           Respect to the Half-Life (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF
           KACHAPAG).
