TITLE      Simultaneous Production of Cu-67, Cu-64 and Ga-67
           And Labelling of Bleomycin with Cu-67 or Cu-64.

REFERENCE  (J,ARI,28,802,1977)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3SAFNLP)
SAMPLE     Natural Zinc, Electroplated onto a Silver-Plated
           Copper Backing.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,CHSEP,BCINT)
           Typical Beam Currents were 300 Microampere.
           (ACTIV) Irradiations Lasted 90 Min.
COMMENT    The Production of Cu-64 and Cu-67 was Investigated
           Together with Routine Ga-67 Production. No Data For the
           Zn-66(D,N)Ga-67 Reaction are Given.
           The Production of Cu-64, Cu-67 and Ga-67 was done
           For the Medical Purpose of Labelling Bleomycin
           Complexes.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No Error Analysis is Given. The Significance
           Of the Quoted Errors is Unknown.
FLAG       (1.)This Value Results of an Irradiation with a Beam
           Current of 500 Microampere Instead of 300 Microampere.
