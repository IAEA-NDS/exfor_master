TITLE      Measurement of the Li-6(HE-3,D)Be-7 and
           Li-7(HE-3,T)Be-7 Cross Sections.

REFERENCE  (J,ANS,30,623,1978)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (SITA,INTB,BCINT)
           Counting Starts a Few Days After Irradiation to Avoid
           Interfering Short-Lived Activities Coming from Reaction
           Of He-3 with Fluorine Contained in the Target Material.
           Several Targets were Exposed Under the Same Conditions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Statistical Error was Typically +- 0.8%.
           Additional Uncertainties Which were Considered are the
           Errors in Target Thickness Determination (5%) And Beam
           Current Integration (0.52%).  Also Considered was a
           1.5% Error in the Calibration Standards and an Error
            (1.25%) Arising from an Efficiency Correction Because
           Of the Experimental Conditions.
ANALYSIS   The Given Cross Section is a Weighted Average of the
           Results with All Used Targets.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Effective Energy in the Target As Given by the
           Authors.
HISTORY    (19800724C)Nekw
           (19940727A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19981117A) Converted to Lower Case.
           (20011010U) Last checking has been done.
