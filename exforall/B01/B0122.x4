TITLE      Investigation of Li-6 Induced Reactions from 54 to 99
           MeV on Pd Targets
AUTHOR     (C.M.CASTANEDA, H.A.SMITH JR, T.E.WARD, T.R.NEES)
INSTITUTE  (1USAINU)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,16,1437,1977)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAINU) 6-Li+++ Beam.
SAMPLE     Self-Supporting Metallic Foils of Enriched Pd-Isotopes.
           Pd-106, Enriched to 98.48 %, 15.9 or 4.35 Mg/Cm**2
           Thick.
           Pd-104, Enriched to 95.25 %, 14.8 or 3.91 Mg/Cm**2
           Thick.
           The Foils were Produced from Metal Powder by Annealing
           And Rolling. The Thickness was Determined by Measuring
           The Amount of Energy Degradation of Known Alpha
           Particle Groups from a Po-212 Source. The Foil was
           Oriented at an Angle of 45 Degrees with Respect to the
           Beam.
METHOD     (EXTB). The Beams were Obtained Directly from the
           Accelerator Without the Use of Degrader Foils.
           (BCINT). A Longitudinally Segmented Faraday Cup.
           (SITA). See Sample.
CORRECTION The Usual Corrections For Target Angle and Enrichment,
           Dead Time Losses, Faraday Cup Leakage and Composite
           Production of a Species Via Both Reactions and Decay
           Were Made.
ADD-RES    (COMP). The Geometry-Dependent Hybrid Model, Which
           Describes the Time Evolution of Nuclear Reactions by
           Means of Compound-Nuclear Evaporation and
           Pre-Equilibrium Nucleon Emission Processes.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR). The Errors of the Cross Sections are
           Estimated to be 25 %. Included are Uncertainties from
           Fitted Gamma Ray Areas, Beam Charge Integration, Target
           Thickness  Measurements and Gamma Ray Branching Ratios.

COMMENT    According to C.M.Lederer Et Al., Table of Isotopes,
           7.Edition,(1978), the 875 KeV Gamma Radiation is
           Emitted from Both the 40.  And 58.  Min Isomers, But
           With Different Intensity.  Due to Lack of Knowledge  of
           Experimental Details the Compiler Cannot Decide, to
           Which Extent Both Isomers did Contribute.  The
           Branching of 85 % , However, is Superseded by More
           Recent Decay-Data (SEE TABLE OF ISOTOPES).  It can be
           Assumed That the High-Spin Isomer is Produced with
           Preference in the Present Experiments (COMMENT BY
           COMPILER OF KACHAPAG).
           * by Compiler of CAJAD *. According to ENSDF-90 Ground
           State of in-108 (7+) Has Half-Life 58.Min, Isomer State
           Of in-108 (2+,E=29.75 KEV) Has Half-Life 29.6 Min.
           875 KeV Gamma Ray Abundance is 0.73+-0.07 For Ground
           State Decay and 0.032+-0.002 For Isomer Decay. As
           Experimental Data Uncertainties is 25%, Therefore the I
           Isomer Decay is not Observed.

COMMENT    According to C.M.Lederer Et Al., Table of Isotopes,

           Emitted from Both the 5.3 and 6.3 Min Isomers, But with

           Branching of 69 % , However, is Superseded by More

           Furthermore, in a Paper by Huang Et Al.,
           Can.J.Phys.,56,936(1978) It is Suggested That the 6.3
           Min High-Spin Isomer, Which is Probably Produced with

           Ground State (COMMENT BY COMPILER OF KACHAPAG).

           State of in-106 (7+) Has Half-Life 6.2 Min, Isomer
           State of in-106 (3+,E=28.6 KEV) Has Half-Life 5.2  Min.
           861 KeV Gamma Ray Abundance is 0.90+-0.05 For Ground
           State Decay and 0.090+-0.016 For Isomer Decay.  As
