REACTION   (3-LI-6(P,HE3)2-HE-4,,SIG)
PART-DET   (HE3)
           (A)
           The reaction products He-3 and alpha-particle were
           measured in coincidence.
METHOD     (COINC,SITA,EXTB,BCINT)
           The angular distributions of He-3 and alpha were
           measured from 20 to 90 degrees in the lab-system in
           steps of 10 degrees. For each detection angle for one
           particle the corresponding angle of the coincident
           particle was fixed by kinematical considerations. Above
           90 degrees, the angular distribution of the alpha
           particles could Be deduced from that of the He-3 at
           forward angles using the kinematics of the reaction.
           typical beam-currents were about 30 nanoamp.
SAMPLE     Lithium fluoride enriched to 96.03%  Li-6 was
           evaporated onto a carbon backing of about 35 mug/cm**2.
           The thickness of the lithiumfluoride in the targets was
            110+-5 mug/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,SIBAR). 500 mum silicon surface barrier
           detectors.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
           The angular distributions were fitted with legendre
           polynomials by the method of least squares. The total
           cross section was extracted from the zero-order
           coefficients of these fits. The coefficients of order
           greater than two in the polynomial expansions were
           essentially zero within errors.
ERR-ANALYS 1. The energy spread of the beam was - due to a 90
           degrees analysing magnet - less than 2 keV.
           (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty of the total cross section
           at a given proton energy is deduced from the least
           squares fit to the angular distribution data at this
           energy. These absolute differential cross sections, in
           turn, are accurate to within 10%. This error includes
           statistical uncertainty (3%), target thickness
           variation -as obtained from repeated checks during  the
           runs using a monitor detector at 90 degrees- (8%),
           error  of current integration (4%) , and uncertainty of
           the solid angle determination (3%).
