           isotopes from fusion and transfer-induced fission
           reactions.

           Since the heavy ion beam was not magnetically analyzed,
           the beam energies were measured with a gold
           surface-barrier detector placed directly in the beam
           path.
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,BCINT,CHSEP)
           chemical separation of iodine was done within
           10 minutes of the end of bombardment. The length
           of bombardment was different for the used projectile
           energies and lasted from 63 minutes to 212 minutes.
           An silver-iodide/silver-bromide precipitate was
           obtained and after filtering, both PRECPITATE and
           filter paper were taped to a holder and placed in
           front of a Ge(Li)-spectrometer.
           The U-layer was dissolved together with part of the
           Al-backing plate to ensure dissolution of all of the
           fission products.
           The chemical yield was determined by neutron activation
           of I-127 in the samples and in a standard.
           The samples were counted, starting approximately
           10 minutes after the end of bombardment and
           extending to 2 to 3 weeks thereafter.
           The average beam flux was 2.6*10**11 particles/sec.
SAMPLE     Enriched U-238 targets, thickness 30 mg/cm**2.
           U-238 was sputtered onto a 5 mm Al-backing plate.
           a thin layer of 50-100 microgram/cm**2 Al was
           evaporated onto the surface of the U-238 to prevent
           oxidation. An effective target thickness was
           calculated,using the tables of Northcliffe and
           schilling, NUCL.DATA tables A7,233(1970), and
           corresponds to the range of Ar-40 ions slowed down from
           the incident energy to the barrier that was taken to
           be 200 MeV.
PART-DET   (DG). The gamma ray spectra were recorded between
           90 keV and 2 MeV.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           the absolute efficiency for the counting geometry
           was known with an accuracy of 5%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The given uncertainties in the production
           cross sections reflect the errors in the half-life fits
           to the data.  They vary between 1% and 20% (comment  by
           the compiler of KACHAPAG).  Further information about
           the errors are missing.
           2. The errors in beam energy were +-5 MeV, including
           a possible energy shift of +-4 MeV and corrections
           for energy loss in the Al-layer and energy defect
           in the surface-barrier detector.
           The corrections to the beam energy consisted in
           adding 1.0 to 1.5 MeV to the measured energies
           which was less than the uncertainty in
           the beam energy.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)The identification and assignment of a nuclide
           was based on agreement of the energy, half-life and
           relative abundance of the observed gamma-rays.
           In order to calculate independent yields from the
           measured partial cumulative ones it was concluded from
           the two-peaked isotopic distributions that the neutron
           excessive fission products originate from quasi-elastic
           transfer induced fission of uranium, while the neutron
           deficient and shielded products near the stability line
           are due to complete fusion followed by fission of the
           compound nucleus. Basing on this interpretation the
           independent yield distribution was calculated by an
           iterative procedure.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for recoil losses from
           the surface of the target corresponding to fission
           fragments moving backward in the laboratory reference
           frame. The recoil losses were calculated from
           theoretical distributions of the products for the
           different mechanisms involved and were then integrated
           over the effective target thickness, taking also into
           account the decreasing bombarding energies.
ADD-RES    (THEO)
           the thresholds for production of iodine isotopes
           either by complete fusion reactions or by
           QUASIELASTIC transfer reactions are determined and
           compared with theoretical predictions.
