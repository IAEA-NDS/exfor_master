ADD-RES    Saturation Production Rates in Microcurie/Microampere
           Were Calculated on the Basis of the Cross Sections
           Given.
FLAG       (1.) The Thick Target Yield Given is Too High Compared
           With the Saturation Production Rate of 3493 Microcurie/
           Microampere at 11.7 MeV Calculated by the Authors. The
           Correct Thick Target Yield Should be Lower Than this
           Value. The Discrepancy to the Value Given is Due to the
           Fact That a Formula was Used Which is Valid Only For
           Irradiation Times Short in Respect to the Half-Life
            (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG)
           (2.)This Value Supersedes Data Published Earlier by
           The Authors (ISOTOPENPRAXIS,5,247,1969, SEE ALSO ENTRY
           B0084). The Difference to the Former Value is Probably
           Due to a Less Accurate Beam Current Determination.
