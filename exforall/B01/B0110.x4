ERR-ANALYS The Errors Shown in the Thesis For One Point of Each
           Curve Only are 15-30%. They Include Mainly
           Uncertainties of the Activity Measurement, Beam
           Measurement (ABOUT 2%), and Target (ABOUT 3%). No
           Detailed Information is Given.

METHOD    1(EXTB,SITA,REC,EDEG,BCINT)
           For the Direct Determination of Absolute Cross Sections
           At 104.5, 111, 116, and 121.5+-3 MeV Different Stacks
           Containing Al-Foils For Energy Degradation, the Target,
           And Al-Catcher Foils were Irradiated in a Faraday Cup.
           The Full Beam Energy was 140+-3 MeV. The Energy  at the
           Middle of the Target was  Calculated According to
           Northcliffe and Schilling, Nucl.Data Tables A7,233,70,
           Corrected As Described by R.Bimbot,Et Al., Nucl.Instr.
           And Meth.153,161,78. After Each Irradiation the Recoils
           In the Catcher Foils were Measured in an Alpha
           Ionization Chamber, and the Different Isotopes
           Identified by Their Half-Lives.

           Relative Cross Sections were Measured by the Hejet
           Technique and Normalized to Absolute Values by Means
           Of the Cross Sections Measured Directly. The Full Beam
           Energy Used was 140+-3 MeV. The Energy
           Degradation by Ni-Absorbers was Calculated According to

METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,HEJET,EDEG,BCINT)
           Relative Cross Sections were Measured by the Hejet
           Technique. The Normalization to Absolute Values was
           Performed on the Basis of the Data For Po-198,

           For Which Both Relative and Absolute Cross Sections
           Were Measured.
           The Full Beam Energy Used was  180+-4 MeV. The Energy

METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,HEJET,EDEG,BCINT)
           Relative Cross Sections were Measured by the Hejet
           Technique and Normalized to Absolute Values by Means
           Of the Factors Obtained from the Comparison of
           Absolute and Relative Cross Sections of Po-199-M and
           Po-198 (SEE SUBENTRIES B0110009 AND 10). The Full Beam
           Energies Used were  280+-6 and 250+-5 MeV. The Energy
           Degradation by Ni-Absorbers was Calculated According to
           Northcliffe and Schilling, Nucl.Data Tables A7,233,70,
           Corrected As Described by R.Bimbot Et Al., Nucl.Instr.
           And Meth. 153,161,78. The Beam Current During the
           Irradiation was Measured by a Tungsten-Grid Which was
           Calibrated by Measurements with a Faraday Cup Before
           And After Each Irradiation.
CORRECTION In Addition the Beam Energy Scale was Refixed at
           Four Energies at 212, 233, 240, and 245+-1.5 MeV by
           Means of the Proton Recoil Method As Described by
           R.Bimbot Et Al., Rev.Phys.Appl.13,393,1978.
