FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM)
SAMPLE     Natural Carbon, Thickness 228 +- 16 Microgram/Cm**2.
           The Thickness was Determined by Weighing. The
           Uniformity was Found to be Typically +- 5%.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST)
           Two Detector Telescopes were Used. The Thicknesses of
           The Delta-E Detector and the E-Detector were
           50 Micrometer and 2 mm, Respectively.
           In a Later Experiment a 3-Element Telescope was Used
            (8.4 AND 36 MICROMETER, AND 1 MM).
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDE,BCINT)
           Reaction Products were Recorded Simultaneously at Two
           Angles by Two Independent Semiconductor Telescopes.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED)
ERR-ANALYS The Error of the Absolute Differential Cross Sections
           Is +- 10 % Arising from Uncertainties in the Target
           Thickness, the Beam Current Integration and Detector
           Solid Angle.
ADD-RES    (ANGD,COMP,THEO)
           Statistical Model Calculations are Compared with the
           Experimental Data in Order to Determine the Reaction
           Mechanism For the Particle Production.
           The Most Likely Production Mechanism For Li and be at
           Higher Incident Energies Seems to be the Decay of a
           Projectile-Like Fragment Excited in a Peripheral
           Collision.
