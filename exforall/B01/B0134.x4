DETECTOR   (NAICR)
           The Targets were Placed Between Two Summed Na-I(TL)
           Detectors.
SAMPLE     Targets of Li-6 Fluoride, Ranging in Thickness
           Between 650 and 800 Microgram/Cm**2. Li-6 Fluoride,
           Of 99.32% Li-6 Enrichment, was Evaporated onto
           Aluminium Disks.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,BCINT)
           Irradiations were Carried Out with a 6.0 MeV
           Li-6 Ion Beam. Lower Energies were Obtained by
           Al-Degrader Foils. Range and Stopping-Power Data
           For Li-6 in Al were Taken from Northcliffe and
           Schilling, Nucl.Data Tables A7,233(1970).
           Similar Data For Li-6 in Li-Fluoride by
           P.G.Steward, Report Ucrl-18127(BERKELY,1968).
           The be-7 Activity was Compared with a be-7
           Reference Standard, Calibrated on a Geli-Detector
           With Known Efficiency.
CORRECTION The Measured be-7 Activities of the Foils were
           Corrected Back to the Time of Irradiation.
           A Production of be-7 Due to Reactions with
           Li-7, F-19 and Al-27 was Negligible. Corrections in
           The Energy Scale Due to the Energy Loss of Li-6 in the
           Target Result in an Energy Shift of the Experimental
           Points.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Errors of the Cross Sections are 5-10%.
           The Main Contributions to the Standard Error are
           Uncertainties in the Calibration of the Reference
           Standard (+-3%), in the Beam Charge Collected (+-1%),
           In the Target Thicknesses (+- 1%), and Statistical
           Errors in the Target Activities (+-1%).
ANALYSIS   The Given Cross Sections are Weighted-Average
           Values Obtained from an Error-Weighted Average of
           Two Determinations at Each Incident Energy.
