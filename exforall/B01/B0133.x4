DETECTOR   (SOLST). 4 Silicon Surface Barrier Detectors Mounted
           In Pairs on Two Independently Movable Arms.
SAMPLE     B-11 Target, Enrichment 98.55%, Thickness 10.4 +- 0.4
           Microgram/Cm**2.  Boron Powder was Evaporated onto a 30
           Microgram/Cm**2 Gold Backing.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           Absolute Differential Cross Sections were Measured
           At Angles from 10 to 150 Degrees in the Laboratory
           System in Steps of 10 Degrees.
           The Solid Angles of the Detectors were Determined
           By Both the Detector Geometry and Counting a Standard
           Alpha-Source.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
           The Angular Distributions were Fitted with Legendre
           Polynomials by the Method of Least Squares. The Total
           Cross Section was Extracted from the Zero Order
           Coefficients of these Fits.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Absolute Error in the Measured Total Cross
           Sections is About 13%.  Included are the Statistical
           Error (< 3%), the Uncertainty in Target Thickness
            (ABOUT 10%), the Error in Solid Angle Measurement (3%)
           And the Error in Faraday Cup Efficiency (7%).
HISTORY    (19800415C)Nekw
           (19940719A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19981205A) Converted to Lower Case.
           (20011010U) Last checking has been done.
