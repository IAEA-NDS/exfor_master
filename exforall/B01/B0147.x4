           Au-197 with intermediate-energy pions and protons.

SAMPLE     Au-197 foils, thickness 250 micrometer. Significant
           impurities were 30 ppm Si, 10 ppm Fe and 100 ppm Ag.
ANALYSIS   The given cross sections represent a weighted average
           of two or three determinations at each energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The given errors are the larger of the
           standard deviation and the estimated uncertainty of the
           individual determinations.  Included is an 50%
           uncertainty of the corrections to the cross sections
           due to target impurities.  Further INFORMATIONS about
           the errors are missing.
           (MONIT-ERR). Any information is absent.
CORRECTION The contribution to the measured cross section
           from light element impurities was taken into account,
           and  found to decrease from approximately 8% at 200 MeV
           to 0.6% at 400 MeV.  The only important contributing
           impurity was Si.

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,MOSEP,CHSEP)
           the target stack consisted of one or two sample-foils,
           surrounded by 25 micrometer thick gold guard foils
           preceded on the upstream side by three 25 micrometer
           thick Al beam monitor foils.
           (ACTIV)  The duration of the bombardment ranged from 10
           to 30 minutes with a beam intensity of about 1
           microampere.

COMMENT    - by authors - the cross sections were found to be
           independent of target thickness indicating that
           secondary production is negligible.
