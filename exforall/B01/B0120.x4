TITLE      Excitation Functions of 191+193-Ir, 197-Au(6-LI,XN+YP)
           Compound Nuclear Reactions at E(LI)= 48-156 MeV

           The Energy Resolution was 2.1 KeV, the Relative
           Efficiency 15% For the 1332 KeV Gamma-Rays of Co-60.
COMMENT    As Stated in a Private Communication, the Authors
           Assume an Error in the Normalization As Suggested by
           More Recent Experiments. Consequently, the Absolute
           Cross Sections have to be Multiplied by a Constant
           Factor (GREATER THAN 1), Though the Relative Heights of
           The Excitation Functions are Believed to be Correct.
METHOD     (EXTB,EDEG,SITA,MOMIX)
           (GSPEC) In Beam Spectrometry.
           The Primary Li-6 Beam Energy of 156 MeV was
           Degraded by be-Absorber Foils in Steps of About
           10 MeV Down to E(LI)=48 MeV. Since the Energy Loss
           In Beryllium is Known Only For Li-7 Ions Up to an
           Energy of 80 MeV, the Energy Loss of Li-7 was
           Converted Into That of Li-6 and Extrapolated For
           Li-6 Ions of Higher Energies.
           To Calculate Absolute Cross Sections the Gamma-Ray
           Yields were Normalized to the X-Ray
           Intensities Produced by the Projectile-Target
           Interaction and Measured Simultaneously with the
           Gamma-Rays of the Residual Nuclei.
ANALYSIS   In-Beam Gamma-Ray Spectra have Been Measured and
           Neutron Deficient Isotopes of Au, Hg, Tl and Pb
           Have Been Identified from at Least 2 Known
           Gamma-Rays.
           For the Analysis of the Gamma-Spectra Mostly the
           Transitions Feeding the Ground State or an Isomeric
           State have Been Used. These Transitions in General
           Represent 100% Production Intensity.
ERR-ANALYS For the Measured Cross Sections a Total Error
           Of 20-25% is Estimated.  Included are Uncertainties
           From the Normalization Procedure (17% ), Errors in
           Gamma Intensity Determination (5-15%) Including
           Statistics  and Uncertainties of Peak Area Analysis, in
           Detector Efficiency and Conversion Coefficients (5%
           EACH), and in the Gamma-Ray Angular Distribution (<10%)
           The Total Energy Uncertainty Varies Between 3 and
           5 MeV For Beam Energies from 156 MeV to 48 MeV,
           Respectively.
CORRECTION In the Energy Scale of the Excitation Functions
           Corrections were Necessary According to the Energy
           Losses of the Li-6 Ions in the Targets. The Energy
           Losses were Estimated and Converted Into an Energy
           Shift of the Experimental Points Considered.
           Furthermore, Corrections were Applied For Angular
           Distribution and For Internal Conversion.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Experimental Excitation Functions are
           Discussed on the Basis of Predictions of Blann'S
           Preequilibrium (HYBRID) Model.
STATUS     (TABLE) The Numerical Values were Obtained from the
           Authors.
