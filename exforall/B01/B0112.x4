TITLE      Independent Yields of Indium and Gallium in the Proton
           Induced Fission of Natural Uranium
AUTHOR     (K.C.CHAN, B.P.PATHAK, L.NIKKINEN, L.LESSARD,
           I.S.GRANT)
INSTITUTE  (1CANMCG) Foster Radiation Laboratory
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,39,1915,1977)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,ASEP)
           (OLMS,ACTIV)
           The Incident Proton Beam (100 MEV, 50 NANOAMP.) Was
           Degraded by be-Absorbers. The Used Energy-Range
           Relation is not Quoted.
           The Fission Product Yields were Measured on-Line with
           A Mass Spectrometer, the Mass-Discrimination Efficiency
           Of Which was Calibrated with the Isotopes of Natural
           Ba and Sn. The Mass-Separated Ions were Counted by
           Means of an Electron Multiplier.
           The Identification of the Separated in-Isotopes was
           Confirmed by Measuring Their Radioactive Decay, That
           Of the Ga-Isotopes was Based on the Chemical Similarity
           Of Ga and in.
           No Information is Given  Whether and How the Proton
           Flux was Determined and Accounted For. It was Possibly
           Regarded by the Normalization Procedure Applied (SEE
           COMMENT UNDER REACTION) And Therefore not Measured
            (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG)
SAMPLE     Natural U-Oxide  Deposited in Layers of About 5.4
           Mg/Cm**2 on 28.6 Mg/Cm**2 Thick Graphite Disks of 12.7
           Mm Diameter. A Total of 23 Disks were Assembled As
           Target Within the Oven of the on-Line Mass-Separator.
CORRECTION The Measured Relative Independent Yields were Corrected
           For Diffusion Times in the Target Assembly, Decay of
           The Radioactive Isotopes, and the Mass-Discrimination
           Of the Separator. No Corrections were Applied For the
           Cumulative Yields. Their Contributions were Believed to
           Be Small Due to the Fact That Yields were Measured
           During and Between Prompt Beam Pulses (PULSE DURATION-
           0.2 SEC, PULSE DISTANCE- 2 SEC) And That by
           Subtracting the Off-Beam Yield Cumulative Events and
           Background Should Mostly be Cancelled. Furthermore, the
           Precursors Should have Much Longer Diffusion Times.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The Given Errors Represent Only the Relative
           Errors Due to Statistics.  Not Included are Errors
           Resulting from the Normalization Procedure.
           Systematic Errors Due to the Energy Loss of the Protons
           In the Target, Especially at Lower Beam Energies,
           Resulting in a Widening of the Isotopic Distribution,
           Are Also Disregarded.

           No Correction was Applied For Cumulative Yield, Which
           Was, However, Assumed to be Small.
COMMENT    - By Compiler of Kachapag - The Compiler Assumes the
           Data to be Absolute Cross Sections, Though this Becomes
           Not Quite Clear from the Paper.
           The Normalization, Based on Both Experimental Data and
           Theoretical  Extrapolations, May, However, Lead to
           Relatively Large Uncertainties.
           - By Compiler of CAJAD - Production of Indium Isotopes
           With a>124 Due to Decay of Precursors is not Excluded.
