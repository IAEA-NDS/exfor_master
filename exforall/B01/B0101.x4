COMMENT    One Purpose of this Work was to Demonstrate the Effect
           Of Energy Degraders Placed Close to the Targets and
           Resulting in Apparently Higher Cross Sections Due to
           Secondary Charged Particles Emerging from the Degrader.
           A Correction Factor was Determined For the Different
           Projectiles and Absorbers Used and Applied to All Data
           Measured with Absorbers in Front of the Target. Such
           Measurements, Referred to As 'Poor Geometry', are
           Marked with a Flag. All Other (UNFLAGGED) Data were
           Measured Without Absorbers or with the Absorber Placed
           Far Off the Target, Both Separated by a Steering Magnet
           And a Collimating System ('GOOD GEOMETRY').
ERR-ANALYS 1. The Following Errors were Specified-
           Self-Absorption (+-3%), Condenser and Electrometer
           Calibration (LESS THAN +-1%), Counter Efficiency (+1%),
           Foil Thickness, Determined by Weighing (ABOUT 0.1%),
           Secondary Particle Effect (+-2%), Knock-On Electrons
           Influencing the Beam Current Measurement (+-1 TO +-4%),
           Beam Spatial Distribution (+1.25%), Neutron
           Contamination (-1.25%), Half-Life Uncertainty (LESS
           THAN +-1%). The Accuracy of the Measurements is
           Estimated to be +5 and -4 % For 350 MeV Protons
           And 190 MeV Deuterons.
           Error Values Given in the Data Tables are Standard
           Errors of a Single Measurement, Which
           Do not Include Estimated Uncertainties Due to
           Possible Systematic Effects.
           The Beams Used were Monoenergetic to Within 1%.
CORRECTION Corrections For Self-Absorption in the Activated Foils,
           Detector Efficiencies and Secondary Electrons Affecting
           The Faraday Cup Readings were Empirically Determined.
           The Influence of a 1.25 % Portion of the Beam
           Collected in the Faraday Cup But Missing the Target
           Foils was Almost Precisely Compensated by Reactions
           Induced by Secondary Neutrons. Both Effects were not
           Corrected For. Correction Factors For All Data Measured
           In 'Poor Geometry' were Also Applied.
HISTORY    (19790322C)Lakw
           (19940712A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,BCINT,EDEG)
           The Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           W.A.Aron Et Al.,Aecu-663(1949).
           Since the Faraday Cup Measured Only the Current Passing
           The Last Foil of the Stack, a Further Determination of
           The Current was done Using an Ionisation Chamber in
           Front of the Stack. The Same Absorbers As Used in the
           Experiment were in Turn Inserted Between the Chamber
           And the Fc, and the Fraction of the Current Passing the
           Respective Foils was Determined. Thus the Flux Measured
           For the Individual Foils was Assumed to be of an
           Accuracy Comparable to That of the Directly Measured
           Incident Beam.
           As an Additional Check of the Beam Monitoring Technique
           The Cross Section For 340 MeV Protons For the Reaction
           C-12(P,PN)C-11 was Determined by Bombarding a Plastic
           Scintillator of 0.75 Inch Thickness in an Uniform
           Proton Flux. Photographic Emulsions were Placed on Each
           Side of the Scintillator and Proton Tracks were Counted
           To Determine the Particle Flux. C-11 was Counted by
           Placing the Scintillator in Contact with a
           Photomultiplier Tube. The Counting Efficiency was
           Determined by the Beta-Gamma Coincidence Technique
            (SEE B0101002).

           The Incident Particle Beam was Measured by an

           Was Determined from Charge-Attenuation Curves Measured
           With a Faraday Cup.

           Between Guard Foils and Inserted at Various Depths
           In Uranium Absorbers. Near the End of the Range the
           Carbon Foils were Inserted Consecutively.

DECAY-DATA (11-NA-24-G,15.1HR,B-)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           As an Additional Check of the Beam Monitoring Technique
           The Cross Section For 340 MeV Protons For the Reaction
           C-12(P,PN)C-11 was Determined by Bombarding a Plastic
           Scintillator of 0.75 Inch Thickness in an Uniform
           Proton Flux. Photographic Emulsions were Placed on Each
           Side of the Scintillator and Proton Tracks were Counted
           To Determine the Particle Flux. C-11 was Counted by
           Placing the Scintillator in Contact with a
           Photomultiplier Tube. The Counting Efficiency was
           Determined by the Beta-Gamma Coincidence Technique
            (SEE B0101002).
SAMPLE     Al-Foils, Thickness 5 and 10 Mils.
DETECTOR   (PROPC). 4Pi-Counter
           Calibrated Against a Similar Counter of the National
           Bureau of Standards and Against a Beta-Gamma
           Coincidence Counter.

           The Data were Normalized on the Basis of the
           C-12(D,2N+P) Data (SEE SUBENTRY B0101003), Since Both
           Curves were Measured Under the Same Experimental
           Conditions. No Further Details are Given.
RAD-DET    (6-C-11,B+)
DECAY-DATA (6-C-11,20.4MIN,B+)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,BCINT,EDEG)
           The Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           W.A.Aron Et Al.,Aecu-663(1949).
           The Incident Particle Beam was Measured by an
           Ionization Chamber and the Current Through Each Foil
           Was Determined from Charge Attenuation Curves Measured
           With a Faraday Cup.
SAMPLE     Graphite Foils 1/8 and 1/16 Inch Thick were Placed
           Between Guard Foils and Inserted at Various Depths
           In Uranium Absorbers. Near the End of the Range the
           Carbon Foils were Inserted Consecutively.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
           No Activity Other Than C-11 was Observed.
ERR-ANALYS (+DATA-ERR) Large Unsymmetrical Errors were Adopted Due
           To  a Possibly Incorrect Correction (SEE UNDER 'FLAG').
           The Shape of the Excitation Function May be Incorrect.
           (-DATA-ERR). See Above.
           (EN-ERR). Any Information is Absent.
FLAG       (1.) Cross Section Obtained from a Bombardment in
           'Poor Geometry'. A Correction Factor of 1/1.08 was
           Applied For Energies Less Than the Maximum. This
           Correction, However, was Felt to be Incorrect For He-3
           Particles, Since Those Secondaries, Which have
           Undergone a Stripping Reaction in the Absorber, have
           Ranges Greater Than the Residual Range of the He-3.
