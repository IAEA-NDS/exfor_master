TITLE      Excitation Function For the Ni-60(A,2N)Zn-62 Reaction
           And Production of Zn-62 Bleomycin.

SAMPLE     Natural Nickel. Targets were Prepared by Rolling
           A 0.026 mm Thick Ni Foil to Various Thicknesses.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (STTA) Stacks of 8 Ni Foils, 25 X 25 mm were Used.
           (ACTIV) Beam Currents were About 1 Microampere.  The
           Degradation in Each Foil was Calculated According to
           The Tables of C.F.Williamson+,Cea-R 3042(1966)
           (BCINT)
           (EXTB)
ADD-RES    The Production of Zn-62 was Investigated For the
           Medical Purpose of Labelling Zn-62 Bleomycin.
ERR-ANALYS No Error Analysis is Given.
STATUS     (CURVE) By Kachapag.
           Cross Sections and Thick Target Yields were Taken at
           Arbitrary Points of the Smooth Curves Given in the
           Publication (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG).

ANALYSIS  2To Calculate the Thick Target Yield the
           Activities Induced in Each Foil were Added Up.
COMMENT    Since Natural Nickel was Used As Target Material,
           Zn-62 can be Produced by the Ni-61(A,3N) Reaction, T00.
           It was Assumed by the Author, That this Contribution
           Is Very Low, Due to the Small Natural Abundance of
           Ni-61 (1.19%) And the Relatively High Threshold of 26.5
           MeV For the (A,3N) Reaction.
