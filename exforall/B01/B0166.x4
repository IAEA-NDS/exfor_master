TITLE      The (P,N) Reaction on Bi-209 and Pre-Compound Process.
AUTHOR     (K.MIYANO, T.ANDO, H.KUDO, M.YANOKURA, H.NAKAHARA)

           (J,JPJ,35,953,1973) Previous Data
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNTOK) 52 MeV Proton Beam.
           (ISOCY,2JPNOSA) 65 MeV Proton Beam.
SAMPLE     Metallic Bi-209, Thickness About 1.5 Mg/Cm**2, Purity
           99.99%, Evaporated onto Al Backing. Pairs of a Target
           And a Catcher Foil were Stacked Together with Al
           Degrader Foils.
METHOD     (INTB,MOSEP,ACTIV)
           (STTA) Two Stacks were Irradiated, One of these with  a
           52 MeV Proton Beam For 90 Min and Another with a 65 MeV
           Proton Beam For 70 Min.  Proton Energies at Each Target
           Foil  were  Calculated  Using the Range-Energy Curve of
           J.B.Marion and  F.C.Young,  Nuclear  Reaction  Analysis
            (NORTH HOLLAND, AMSTERDAM,1968).
           (CHSEP) After Gamma-Ray Measurements For
           Beam-Monitoring, the Targets were Dissolved and Po-Ions
           Were Deposited on Silver Foils by Spontaneous
           Electrodeposition.
           (BCINT) Beam Intensities Obtained from Current
           Integration and from the Two Monitor Reactions Agreed
           To Within 5%.
DETECTOR   (SOLST). Surface Barrier Type, For Alpha-Spectroscopy.
           (GELI). For Gammas from Target and Catcher Foils.

ADD-RES    (THEO,RANGE)
           Cross Sections were Analysed Both by the Hybrid Model
           And by the Geometry Dependent Hybrid Model.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Given Error Bars are Standard Deviations
           Including Errors Due to Counting Efficiencies (9%),
           Beam Intensities (5%), Target Weighing (3%), and
           Counting Statistics.
STATUS     (CURVE) By Kachapag.
           In Cases were No Errors are Given the Error Bars Read
           With the Data Point Reader were Smaller Than the Size
           Of the Symbol; Comment by the Compiler of Kachapag.
