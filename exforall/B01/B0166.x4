TITLE      The (p,n) reaction on Bi-209 and pre-compound process.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNTOK) 52 MeV Proton Beam.
           (ISOCY,2JPNOSA) 65 MeV Proton Beam.
SAMPLE     Metallic Bi-209, Thickness About 1.5 Mg/Cm**2, Purity
           99.99%, Evaporated onto Al Backing. Pairs of a Target
           And a Catcher Foil were Stacked Together with Al
           Degrader Foils.
METHOD     (INTB,MOSEP,ACTIV)
           (STTA) Two Stacks were irradiated, one of these with  a
           52 MeV proton beam for 90 Min and another with a 65 MeV
           proton beam for 70 Min.  Proton energies at each target
           foil  were  calculated  using the range-energy curve of
           J.B.Marion and  F.C.Young,  Nuclear  Reaction  Analysis
            (NORTH HOLLAND, AMSTERDAM,1968).
           (CHSEP) After gamma-ray measurements for
           beam-monitoring, the targets were dissolved and Po-ions
           were deposited on silver foils by spontaneous
           electrodeposition.
           (BCINT) Beam intensities obtained from current
           integration and from the two monitor reactions agreed
           to within 5%.

ADD-RES    (THEO,RANGE)
           Cross Sections were Analysed Both by the Hybrid Model
           And by the Geometry Dependent Hybrid Model.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The given error bars are standard deviations
           including errors due to-
           (ERR-1).Error in the counting efficiencies -9%
           (ERR-2).Error in the beam intensities -5%
           (ERR-3).Error in the target weighing 3% and
           counting statistics.
STATUS     (CURVE).By Kachapag.
           In Cases were No Errors are Given the Error Bars Read
           With the Data Point Reader were Smaller Than the Size
           Of the Symbol; Comment by the Compiler of Kachapag.
