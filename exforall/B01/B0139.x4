TITLE      Fission-evaporation competition in Pu isotopes of
           mass 235-239

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USASTB) For alpha particles having energies
           of maximal 27 MeV.
           (ISOCY,1USABNL) For alpha particles having energies
           of 32.5 - 46 MeV.
           (ISOCY,2FR GRE) For alpha particles having energies
           of 20 - 46 MeV.
METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,MOSEP,STTA,EDEG) Integrated beam
           intensities were determined by a Faraday cup and by
           measuring a monitor reaction. The beam energy at each
           target was calculated from the initial beam energy
           and the energy loss program of T.W.Armstrong Et
           Al.,Nucl.Instr.Meth.113,313(1973) and Ornl-4869(1973) .
           (CHSEP) Chemical Separation was Performed on Both
           Target and Catcher Foils. The Chemical Yield was
           Determined by Adding Pu-239 Tracer to All Initial
           Solutions.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error given is the standard deviation of
           the determination mainly due to counting statistics
           of the sample and of the Pu-239 tracer. An additional
           error of about 15% is estimated for beam monitoring,
           target thickness etc.

SAMPLE     The sample consisted of a stack of target and catcher
           foils. Each target foil was prepared by
           electrodeposition of 0.2 to 0.8 mg/cm2 of separated
           99.3% U-233 onto a 10 Micrometer Ni-backing. Target
           thickness and homogeneity were verified by
           measurements of the alpha and/or gamma radiation
           emitted from a known area.
