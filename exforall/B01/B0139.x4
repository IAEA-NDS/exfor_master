TITLE      Fission-Evaporation Competition in Pu Isotopes of
           Mass 235 - 239

           Of Maximal 27 MeV.

METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,MOSEP,STTA,EDEG)
           Integrated Beam Intensities were Determined by a
           Faraday Cup and by Measuring a Montior Reaction.
           The Beam Energy at Each Target was Calculated from the
           Initial Beam Energy and the Energy Loss Program of
           T.W.Armstrong Et Al.,Nucl.Instr.Meth.113,313(1973) And
           Ornl-4869(1973).
           (CHSEP)  Chemical  Separation  was  Performed  on  Both
           Target and Catcher Foils.
           The Chemical Yield was Determined by Adding Pu-239
           Tracer to All Initial Solutions.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The Error Given is the Standard Deviation of
           The Determination Mainly Due to Counting Statistics of
           The Sample and of the Pu-239 Tracer.  An Additional
           Error of About 15% is Estimated For Beam Monitoring,
           Target Thickness Etc.
