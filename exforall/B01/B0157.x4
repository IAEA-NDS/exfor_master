TITLE      The Reactions 0-16(P,A), Ne-20(P,A), and Mg-24(P,A).
AUTHOR     (W.GRUHLE, B.KOBER)
COMMENT    - By Authors - The Very Small Isotopic Fractions of
           21-Ne, 25-Mg and 26-Mg in the Targets did not Allow the
           Observation of the Reactions Ne-21(P,N), Mg-25(P,G) And
           Mg-26(P,N), Respectively.
INSTITUTE  (2GERKLN)
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,286,523,1977)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKLN)   Fn Tandem.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR)
           Detectors were Mounted Perpendicular to the Beam
           Direction.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT,COINC)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The Positron Activity of the Residual Nucleus
           Was Followed During Several Half-Lives.
           Absolute Cross Sections were Obtained by Integrating
           Over Angles and Final States.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Relative Statistical Error of the
           Excitation Functions is About +-2% at High Energies
           Increasing to About +-15% at the Lowest Energy.
           The Absolute Calibration was done with a Na-22 Standard
           Source with an Error of +-9% For the Gas Targets and
           About +-11% For the Mg-24 Target.
           Further Informations About Errors are Missing.

           C.M.-Projectile Energies As Given by the Authors. The
           Lab-Energies were Calculated by the Compiler of
           Kachapag.
ADD-RES    Astrophysical Reaction Rates are Deduced from the
           Measured Cross Sections.
STATUS     (CURVE)  By Kachapag.
