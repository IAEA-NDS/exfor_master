           No Information is Given Which Range-Energy Relation
           Was Used. The Incident Beam-Energy was (25+-0.3)MeV.
           The Stack was Irradiated For 220 Min at 1.5 Microamp.

REACTION   (26-FE-0(A,X)28-NI-59,IND,SIG,,,EXP)
RAD-DET    (28-NI-59,XR). X-Ray Energy is 6.9 KeV.
DECAY-DATA (28-NI-59,,XR,6.9)
SAMPLE     Foils of Natural Iron, Thickness 7.7+-0.1 Mg/Cm**2,
           Purity 99.8%, Impurities (IN %%) C (0.01), S (0.11),
           Si (0.011), Mn (0.09).
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Intrinsic Germanium Detector Installed in a
           Massive Shield For Low-Level Counting.
           Since the Ni-59 Half-Life is not Accurately Known,
           The Absolute Number of Ni-59 Atoms was Determined by
           Comparison with a Standard Source, For Which this
           Number had Been Measured Using the Isotopic Dilution
           Method with Ni-60 by Means of a Mass-Spectrometer.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The Uncertainty in Energy at 6 MeV was
           Estimated to be Less Than 1 MeV.
           En-Err Value Calculated by the Compiler of Kachapag
           Using the Tabulated Energy Interval. In Agreement with
           The Figures Given in the Publication the Center of the
           Interval was Regarded As Energy Value and the Half of
           The Interval As the Energy Error.
           (DATA-ERR) Overall Uncertainty in the Cross Section
           Including the Following Errors (IN %%) Recoil
           Loss (2), Chemical Yield (5), Absolute Determination
           Of Ni-59 (4.3), Counting Statistics (6 TO 45).
           The Uncertainty of the Beam Integration was Estimated
           To be Less 8%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Data Compared to Results of a Monte-Carlo Code.
           Results Applied to an Estimation of Ni-59 Production
           In Cosmic Dust.
