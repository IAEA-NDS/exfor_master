TITLE      Alpha Particle Bombardments of Natural Nickel Target
           For the Production of Cu-61
AUTHOR     (H.MURAMATSU, E.SHIRAI, H.NAKAHARA, Y.MURAKAMI)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOK) Department of Chemistry
REFERENCE  (J,ARI,29,611,1978)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOK). Institute of Physical and Chemical
           Research Cyclotron. Alpha Particles of 40 MeV and
           0.5 to 1 Microampere were Used.
SAMPLE     Self-Supporting Foils of Natural Nickel, Thickness
           13 - 25 Mg/Cm**2, Prepared by Electroplating on
           Cu-Foils. 10 to 13 Foils were Stacked Together Without
           Any Other Energy Degrader Being Inserted.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (STTA,EDEG,BCINT,CHSEP)
           Energy Degradation was Calculated According to
           C.F.Williamson Et Al., Cea-R3042(1966).
ERR-ANALYS Information About the Error of the Cross Sections is
           Missing. It was Solely Stated That the Uniformity of
           The Ni-Foils was Better Than 3% and That the Accuracy
           Of the Energy May be not Better Than +-0.5% For
           Energies Below 15 MeV.
STATUS     (CURVE) By Kachapag.

           Thick Target Yields were Obtained by Summing the
           Observed Activities in Each Target Foil.
           Since No Formation Cross Section For Zn-61 Could be
           Measured Due to Its Short Half-Life, Its Contribution
           Was Estimated to be Less Than 1% Using Data of
           J.B.Cumming, Phys.Rev.114,1600(1959).
