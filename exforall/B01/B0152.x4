METHOD     (STTA,EDEG,MOSEP,BCINT,EXTB)
           A Highly Defocussed, Diffused and Collimated Beam was
           Used. The Typical Irradiation Condition was
           1 Microampere For 300 Sec. Energy Degradation was
           Calculated According to C.F.Williamson Et Al.,
           Cea-3042(1966).
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Counting Error at the 95.5% Confidence
           Level was Less Than 3%. The Greatest Errors Arise from
           The Uncertainties in the Irradiation Parameters
           Resulting from any Lack of Uniformity in the Germanium
           Thickness (< 2%), and Specifically from Heterogeneous
           Distribution, If any.
           Impurities Present in the Target Other Than Ge were
           Smaller Than 1%.
           Recoil Losses from the Polystyrene Matrix were Very
           Small and were Neglected in Computing the Cross
           Sections. Overall Errors are Typically of the Order of
           14%.  The Uncertainty in the Incident Particle Beam
           Energy was Estimated As 1%.
ADD-RES    The Production of Se-73 For Radiotracer Studies was
           Investigated with He-3 and He-4 Activation. An Optimum
           Thick Target Production Rate of 933 Micro-Ci/Micro-Ahr
            (RADIONUCLIDIC PURITY > 99.99%) Was Found Using the
           Ge-72(HE-3,2N)Se-73 Reaction on Isotopically Enriched
           Ge-72 with He-3 Degraded from 37 MeV to 18 MeV on a 151
           Mg/Cm**2 Target of Ge-Dioxide.  Thin Target Production
           Yields of Radionuclidic Impurities (AS-71,72,74,76 AND
           SE-75) Produced by He-3 and He-4 Reactions were Given
           In Figures.
