TITLE      Transfer of Li-6 Break-Up Fragments at Li-6 Projectile
           Energies Far Above the Coulomb Barrier

FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two Si Surface Barrier Detectors were Mounted
           In a Sandwich Arrangement with a Total Acceptance of
           25% of 4 Pi.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Errors of the Cross Sections Result
           Mainly from the Statistical Uncertainties in the
           Activity Measurements(15%), the Target Thickness (5%)
           And the Beam Flux Determination (10%).  Additionally,
           The Errors were Taken Into Consideration Attributed to
           A Correction of the Cross Sections For the Recoil
           Catching Efficiency and Activity Build-Up from Cycles
           Before.  The Informations About the Errors were
           Obtained Essentially by the Author.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The Main Goal of the Work was the Investigation of
           Different Reaction Mechanisms by Determining the Recoil
           Energies. This was Achieved by Measuring the Range
           Of Recoils in Carbon Catcher Foils. Additionally the
           Recoil Energies were Determined by Measuring the
           Energy Loss of the Alpha-Particles Emitted by the
           Decaying Residues Due to Self-Absorption in the
           Catcher Foil.

           The Cross Sections are Strongly Connected to the
           Break-Up of the Li-6 Projectile Followed by Capture
           Of the Beam-Veclocity Alpha-Particle - "Internal
           Break-Up Reaction".  At 156 MeV the Internal Break-Up
           Contribution was Experimentally Separated from That
           Part of the Cross Section Due to Compound/Precompound
           Reactions. This Part is Less Than 10%
           For Lower Energies It was Assumed That this Part
           Plays a Minor Role, Too.

           In Addition to the Decay Energy the Alpha-Peaks were
           Identified in a Separate Run Via the Half-Life by
           Measuring in a Multispectrum Scaling Procedure.

           Of at-211 and Rn-215 Radioactive Decay.
SAMPLE     Pb-208, Thickness 0.15 Mg/Cm**2, Evaporated onto
           20 Micro G/Cm**2 C-Foil. The Thickness was Determined
           By Measuring the Energy Loss of Am-241 Alpha-Particles.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDEG,BCINT,REC)
           The Initial Projectile Energy of 156 MeV was Stepwise
           Degraded by be-Sheets. The Energy Loss of Li-6 was
           Calculated Using Extrapolations of the Energy Loss
           Relation of L.C.Northcliffe and R.F.Schilling, Nucl.
           Data Tables A7 (1970).
           The Recoils have Been Catched in Carbon Foils of
           Various Thicknesses. The Catcher Foils were Mounted on
           A Pneumatic Driven Slider Transporting the Activity
           Out of the Beam to the Measuring Position.
           Each Measuring Cycle Consisted of
           The Irradiating Period, the Recording Period and the
           Transport Period, Forth and Back.
           The Beam Current was 15 Nanoampere, Typically.
STATUS     The Numerical Values of the Data were Obtained by
           The Author.
FLAG       (1.)This Value was Erroneously Quoted As 85 Mb
           Instead of 85 Microbarn in the Publication.
