           Each Target or Monitor Foil was Couted Periodically
           Over Several Half-Lives. Energy Degradation in the
           Stack was Calculated According to W.H.Barkas Et Al.,
           Publ.1133,Nat.Acad.Sci.Washington D.C.,P.103(1964).
SAMPLE     Stack of Targets, Each Target Consisted of a Few
           Modules Combining Compressed K-Iodide Powder, Thickness
           0.33 G/Cm**2 and Polyethylene Monitor Foils of 0.09
           G/Cm**2 Thickness.

           As Experimentally Confirmed Losses of C-11 from the
           Monitor Foils were Very Small.
CORRECTION Corrections were Made For Losses of Recoil Ions, For
           The Finite Counting Times, For Gamma Ray Absorption,
           For Dead Time Losses, For the Solid Angle and
           Efficiency Function. Loss of Xe-Products from the
           Target was Calculated to be Negligible.
ADD-RES    From the Measured Excitation Functions Predictions were
           Made of Thick Target Yields and Isotopic Purity of
           I-123 Produced by Proton Reactions on Iodine. Yields
           Of Order 10 Millicurie/Microampere*Hour with Impurities
           Less Than 0.2% were Found to be Achievable Through the
           I-127(P,5N) Reaction.
STATUS     (CURVE) By Kachapag.
HISTORY    (19800710C)Lane
           (19940720A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
