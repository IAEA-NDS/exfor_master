METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP)
           Due to the high proton energy the target foils arranged
           in a stack have to be considered each as a single foil
           irradiated at 25 GeV (comment by the compiler of
           Kachapag).
           Tritium was set free from the irradiated foils by
           melting and pumping off the gases produced.
           These were separated from each other by a Pd-valve
           and were counted inside of Gm-counters.
SAMPLE     Foil stack consisting of 2*0.2 mm antimagnetic 18/20
           steel, 3*0.04 mm Al-monitor, 2*0.2 mm Al, 1*0.5 mm Al,
           3*0.04 mm Al-monitor and 3*0.4 mm Cu. The purity of
           the Al-foils was 99.99% that of Cu 99.96%
           the beam entered the stack at the steel-foils and left
           it at the Cu-foils.  Stack referred to as Ps1.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
           A cross section of 10.0 Mb at 25 GeV was assumed using
           extrapolations of cross sections measured at lower
           energies.
           Na-24-g was determined by beta-gamma coincidence
           counting of several monitor foils about 15 hours after
           the end of irradiation with an accuracy of about 2%.
           The decay of Na-24 was followed over about 5
           half-lives.
           Na-24 produced by secondary neutrons via Al-27(n,a)
           reaction and by secondary protons was accounted for
           by using foils from the beginning of the stack.

METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP)
           Due to the high proton energy the target foils arranged
           in a stack have to be considered each as a single foil
           irradiated at 25 GeV (comment by the compiler of
           Kachapag).
           Tritium was set free from the irradiated foils by
           melting and pumping off the gases produced.
           These were separated from each other by a Pd-valve
           and were counted inside of Gm-counters.
SAMPLE    1Foil stack consisting of 2x0.2 mm Antimagnetic 18/20
           steel, 3x0.04 mm Al-monitor, 2*0.2 mm Al, 1*0.5 mm Al,
           3*0.04 mm Al-monitor and 3*0.4 mm Cu. The purity of
           the Al-foils was 99.99% that of Cu 99.96%.
           the beam entered the stack at the steel-foils and left
           it at the Cu-foils.  Stack referred to as Ps1.
          2Foil stack consisting of 2*0.4 mm Cu, 10*0.05 mm Cu,
           20*0.005 mm Al, 6*0.2 mm Antimagnetic 18/20 steel,
           1*0.4 mm Cu and 1*1.0 mm Cu. The purity of the Al-foils
           was 99.99% that of Cu 99.96%.  The beam entered the
           stack at the 0.4 mm Cu-foils and left it at the 1.0  mm
           Cu-foil.  Stack referred to as Ps2.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
            A cross section of 10.0 Mb at 25 GeV was assumed using
           extrapolations of cross sections measured at lower
           energies.
           Na-24-g was determined by beta-gamma coincidence
           counting of several monitor foils about 15 hours after
           the end of irradiation with an accuracy of about 2%.
           The decay of Na-24 was followed over about 5
           half-lives.
           Na-24 produced by secondary neutrons via Al-27(n,a)
           reaction and by secondary protons was accounted for
           by using foils from the beginning of the stack.
           The proton flux for the irradiation of target Ps2 was
           determined by comparing the Ar-37 cross section for Cu
           and Fe to that obtained with target Ps1, both measured
           with the Gm-counter. These monitors were used rather
           than Al-27(p,3pn)Na-24 directly, due to the long
           irradiation time of about 35 hours. They are,however,
           related to the 10 mb cross section of Al-27(p,3pn).

           Degassing of the target foils may lead to a  systematic
           loss of less than 5%.
           For target ps2 an additional error in the beam current
           determination is introduced by the flux determination
           via Ar-37 resulting in a total error for the proton
           flux of 15 to 20%.

COMMENT     For most of the products two cross section values

ERR-ANALYS The error of the cross sections is about 20%.
           The beam intensity was determined to within 15-20% due
           to the fact that the cross sections for Ar-37 were
           accurate to about 15% and that of the determination of
           Ar had an error of about 10%.
           Determination of rare gases with the mass separator

           He-isotopes and about 10% for Ne and Ar isotopes.
