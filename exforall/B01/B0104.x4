METHOD    1(BCINT,EXTB,SITA,ASEP,EDEG)
           The Energy Degradation was Determined Using the
           Range-Energy Relation Given by H.Bichsel Et Al.,
           Phys.Rev.105,1788(1957).
           Separation of the Products was Performed by Means of
           The on-Line Mass Separator 'Isol' at the Institute For
           Nuclear Study, Tokyo University.
           Zn-Isotopes Produced were Evaporated from the Target
           Foil by Heating Up to About 1000 Centigrades. They were
           Then Ionized, Magnetically Separated, Collected on a
           Movable Tape and Measured. Time Between Production and
           Measurement was About 1 Minute. The Yield of the Mass
           Separation was Determined by Measuring the Ion Current
           Of One of the Stable Cu-Isopes.
          2(BCINT,EXTB,STTA,CHSEP,EDEG)
           The Energy Degradation was Determined Using the
           Range-Energy Relation Given by H.Bichsel Et Al.,
           Phys.Rev.105,1788(1957).
           After Bombardment of 1 Minute the Target was
           Transferred from the Bombarding Position to a
           Radiochemical Laboratory by a Pneumatic System in
           15 Seconds. Chemical Separation was Performed Using
           Zn-65 Spike As a Yield Monitor.
SAMPLE    1Foil of Natrual Cu, Thickness 10 Micrometer. Al-Foils
           In Front of It Served As Energy Degraders.
          2Stack Containing Foils of Natural Cu of 5 Micrometer
           Thickness Which were Mounted on Metal Frames. Al-Foils
           In Front of the Stack were Used to Degrade the
           Incident Proton Energy of 52 MeV to the Desired Value.

CORRECTION2The Cross Sections were Calculated from the Measured
           Gamma-Intensities by Correcting For Decay, Gamma-Ray
           Abundance, Chemical Yield (91 TO 100%) And the Beam
           Current (FLUCTUATION ABOUT 10%).
COMMENT   1Zn-61 was Well Separated from Zn-63. Zn-62 Could not
           Be Measured Because Its Half-Life (9.15 HOURS) Is Much
           Longer Than the Collection Time of 1 Minute.
STATUS    1(DEP,B0104003)
           Zn-61 Cross Sections were Deduced from the Zn-61/Zn-63
           Ratio Measured with 'Isol' and from the Zn-63 Cross
           Section Obtained from the Stacked Foil Irradiation.
           The Latter are not Explicitly Given, But can be Deduced
           From the Ratio from the Stacked Foil (SEE SUBENTRY
           B0104003) And the Zn-61 Data from the Stacked Foil
           Given in B0104002.
