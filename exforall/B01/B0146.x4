SAMPLE     Ni-58 Target, Enrichment 99.9%, Thickness About 300
           Microgram/Cm**2.  Lead-Backing of a Few Mg/Cm**2 to
           Stop the Recoiling Product Nuclei of the Reaction.
DETECTOR   (GELI).The Detector was at 90 Degrees to the Beam
           Direction.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           Measured in-Beam Gamma-Ray Spectra.
ANALYSIS   Absolute Cross Sections are Determined by Normalizing
           The (2P) Cross Section Determined by the 862 KeV Yield,
           See Subent 146.005, at 44 MeV to the Corresponding
           Activation  Cross Section Measured by R.L.Robinson,
           Phys.Rev.C9,1402,1974. The Normalizing Constant
           Determined from this has Been Used For All Given
           Cross Sections. It was Assumed That the Ground-State
           Cross Section Relative to the Total Cross Section in a
           Channel Remains Constant Over the Region of Bombarding
           Energy.
ERR-ANALYS No Error Analysis is Given.

COMMENT    - By the Authors -
           The Identification of As-69 by the Observed 854 KeV
           Transition is Very Uncertain Because of the
           Non-Observation of Possible Low-Energy Transitions
           In this Nucleus.
ERR-ANALYS (+DATA-ERR)  The Quoted Errors are Due to a Discrepancy
           In Relative Intensities of the 862 and 854 KeV
           Gamma-Ray of As-69 Between the Present Work and the
           Data of Nolte Et Al.  Zp,268,267(74)
           (-DATA-ERR). See Above.
PART-DET   (G) It was Observed the Transition from the 2160 KeV
           To the 1306 KeV Level.

           The Cross Section Includes About 72% of the (P,N) Cross
           Section.
PART-DET  1(G) 4+ to 2+ Transition in Se-72, E(GAMMA)=775 KeV.
          2(G) 2+ to 0+ Transition in Se-72, E(GAMMA)=862 KeV.
CORRECTION1The Given Cross Section was Calculated with an
           Estimated Increase of 40% Because of Sidefeeding to the
           2+ State.
          2The Cross Section was Corrected For the Contribution of
           An Interfering Gamma-Ray of 863 KeV from the (AP)
           Channel. This Contribution was Estimated by Measuring
           The 854 KeV Gamma-Line from the Same (AP) Channel and
           Regarding the 863 KeV Intensity Relative to That of the
           854 KeV Line.  The Uncertainty Introduced by this
           Correction is Quoted Under Err-Analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).
          1The Quoted Errors are Due to a Discrepancy in Relative
           Intensities of the 862 and 854 KeV Gamma-Rays of As-69
           Between the Present Work and the Data of Nolte Et Al.
           Zp,268,267(74)
          2The Quoted Errors are Caused by the Uncertainty in
           Subtracting the Contribution of the Interfering Gamma
           Ray at 863 KeV from the (A+P)-Reaction.
