TITLE      Cross Section and Stellar Reaction Rates For the
           Ca-42(P,GAMMA) Reaction.

FACILITY   (VDG,1CANMCM)
SAMPLE     Ca-Oxide Targets, Enrichment in Ca-42 94.42%,
           Thicknesses 100, 250 and 500 Microgram/Cm**2. Calcium
           Carbonate was Evaporated onto 0.5 mm Tantalum Backings.
           A 20 Microgram/Cm**2 Layer of Gold was Deposited on
           Each Target to Protect It from Exposure to Air.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR)
           For Counting a 0.5 mm Thick Tantalum Square was Placed
           Over the Target to Stop All Emitted Positrons.
           The Efficiency of the Detector System was Determined
           By Comparison with a Calibrated Ge-68 Source in Equal
           Geometry.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           The Targets were Irradiated For 100 Min and Counted
           For 200-300 Min. The Proton Beam Current was
           50 Nanoampere, Typically.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) For Each Irradiation a Decay Curve was
           Measured, from Which the 3.89 Hr Sc-43 Activity Could
           Be Extracted by a Least Squares Fitting Procedure.
           Thus, Contaminating Activities Like N-13 from C-13(P,N)
            (HALF-LIFE 10 MIN) And F-18 from 0-18(P,N) (HALF-LIFE
           110 MIN) Could be Distinguished.  The Latter Activity
           Was the More Serious Because of Its Relatively Long
           Half-Life, Low Q-Value, and the Oxide Nature of the
           Target.
CORRECTION Due to Ca-44 (0.56 +- 0.05%) And Ca-43 (0.06%)
           Impurities in the Target the Measured Cross Section
           Values were Corrected Above 3 MeV and 4.5 MeV For
           Contributions from Ca-43(P,N), Ca-44(P,N) Reactions.
           For this Measured Cross Section Values have Been  Used.
           Furthermore a Correction was Applied to Account For the
           Loss of Annihilation Coincidences Due to Summing of an
           Annihilation Quantum with a True Coincident Gamma-Ray,
           If Beta-Decay Feeds Excited States.  This Correction
           Was 2.1% For Sc-43 Produced by Ca-42(P,GAMMA) And
           Ca-43(P,N), and 8.6% For Sc-44 Produced by the
           Ca-44(P,N) Reaction.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainties in the Cross Sections are Due
           Predominantly to a Target Thickness Uncertainty of
           20%. The Overall Error For Energies Below 3 MeV is 21%
           Rising to 24% at the Highest Energies Due to
           Subtraction of Background Activities.
ADD-RES    (COMP)
           Stellar Reaction Rates were Calculated from the
           Measured Cross Sections and Compared to Theoretical
           Predictions.
FLAG       (1.)The Magnitude of this Cross Section is Somewhat
           Uncertain Due to Contributions to the Observed Yield
           From the Ca-44(P,N) Reaction (SEE 'CORRECTION').
STATUS     (CURVE)
HISTORY    (19800502C)Nekw
           (19940720A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
