CRITIQUE   M0920006 contains evaluated cross-section of
            65Cu[(g,n)+(g,np)] reaction, not 65Cu(g,n)64Cu
            one.
ANALYSIS   The areas of the photopeaks of the corresponding
            gamma-lines of the radioisotopes under
            consideration obtained as a result of gamma-
            spectroscopic measurements were used to extract
            their yield Y, which in this work is defined as
            the number of radioisotope nuclei formed in the
            target per second of its irradiation with
            bremsstrahlung photons. The Y were obtained
            using the formula (1) of the article.
           The final estimate for Y was taken as the average
            value over multiple measurements, Y-exp which
            is presented as formula (2) of the article.
           The weighted and averaged over the
            bremsstrahlung photon spectrum cross sections
            obtained using formula (3) of the article are
            presented.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors given.

COMMENT    For the first time, at intermediate photon
            energies (below the GeV energy region), inclusive
            photodisintegration reactions of manganese
            55Mn(g,X)46Sc, 55Mn(g,X)47Sc and 55Mn(g,X)48Sc
            were studied.
           The experimental results are an integral value
            expressed as a convolution of two functions:
            the cross-section and the photon distribution
            function. The experimental data are presented as a
            flux-weighted average cross sections.
HISTORY    (20250614C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU
            SINP CDFE by V.Varlamov.
