SAMPLE     Uranium carbide, the content of 238U was 13.2 mg.
ERR-ANALYS No information on sources of uncertainties.
COMMENT    The reaction 238U(g,f) has been studied in view of
            producing beams of neutron-rich radioactive nuclei
            132Sn and 143Xe.
           The yields of isotopes 123,127,128Sn were determined
            by direct measurements, those of the isotopes
            129,130,131,132Sn - by the daughter isotopes.
           Yields of xenon were determined by daughter isotopes.
ANALYSIS   Determination of yields od Sn and Xe isotopes was
            carried out using vacuum thermochromatography of
            uranium fission fragments in the presence of CCl4.
HISTORY    (20210408C) Data were compiled  at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
