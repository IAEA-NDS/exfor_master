            Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics.
SAMPLE     Internal tensor polarized deuterium  target. The jet
            of tensor polarized deuterons from the polarized
            atomic source was held in the storage cell installed
            in the vacuum chamber of storage ring. The vector
            polarization of the jet was maintained close to zero
            (Pz < 0.02), whereas the tensor polarisation of the
            jet's atoms was close to the extreme values (Pz
            equal near +1 or -2). The sign of tensor polarization
            of the deuterium target was changed every 30 sec
            during the acquisition of the data.

METHOD     (COINC) The deuterons were detected by the upper
            arm of the detecting system, whereas the g-quanta
            from the PI0 meson decay were detected by the
            lower arm of the system.
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SCIN) The upper (deuteron) arm of the detecting
            system consists of drift chambers and three
            layers of plastic scintillators having thickness of
            2, 12, and 20 cm, respectively.
           (SCIN) The lower (g-quanta) arm of the detecting
            system consists of a calorimeter that consisted of
            NaI and  CsI scintillators. The size of the CsI
            crystals was 60x60x150 mm, whereas the size of NaI
            crystals was 55x115x300 mm.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total measurement error is given for each
            experimental point and takes into account the
            statistical and systematic uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) The systematic uncertainty takes into account
            the measurement uncertainty of the target tensor
            polarization (3.5%).
           (ERR-2,5.,7.) During the identification of the channel
            for the gd -> dpi0 reaction, it was impossible to
            remove the background, which was estimated to range
            from 5% to 7% depending on the photon energy.
           (ERR-3,,5.) The error induced by the neglect of the
            contribution of longitudinal virtual photons to the
            reaction amplitude at small electron scattering
            angles, does not exceed 5%.
COMMENT    The events of the reaction gd ->dpi0 were extracted
            from the experimental data collected at VEPP-3
            storage ring in 2013.
HISTORY    (20201101C) Data were compiled  at  Russia  MSU  SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
