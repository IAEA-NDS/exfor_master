INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
SAMPLE     Samples of silver and indium with dimensions of
            0.7 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm and 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm,
            respectively.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector.
           The absolute efficiency of the HPGe detector was
            measured using standard gamma-ray sources at
            the same distances from the detector at which
            the silver and indium samples were examined.
           The set of gamma-ray sources consisted of 54Mn,
            57Co, 60Co, 88Y, 109Cd, 113Sn, 133Ba, 139Ce,
            152Eu, 228Th, and 241Am.
ANALYSIS   The gamma-ray spectra were processed using the
            DEIMOS32 program.
           The yields of photonuclear reactions in the
            samples were determined using the formula (1) of
            the article.
           The reaction yields for all the identified gamma
            rays of radionuclides were calculated using
            formula (1) of the article. Subsequently, when
            a radionuclide was identified with more than one
            gamma line, their reaction yield values were
            averaged.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
COMMENT    The yield (atom*-1 x electron*-1) of reaction
            determined as in the formula (1) of the article.
HISTORY    (20240810C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
