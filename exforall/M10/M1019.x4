COMMENT    The weighted-average reaction cross sections were
            obtained using weight-average fluxes of
            bremsstrahlung gamma-rays since those are
            continuously distributed from the boundary energy
            EN-MAX and therefore only integrated cross sections
            are in fact measured in experiments.
HISTORY    (20201106C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
