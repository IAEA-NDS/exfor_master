METHOD     (ACTIV)
SAMPLE     Natural mixture of mercury isotopes.
            A polystyrene container with an 8 mm radius and a
            2.8 mm thickness was used as a target.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium GC3019 (CANBERRA)
            detector with energy resolutions of 0.8 keV at 150
            keV and of 1.9 keV at 1332 keV.

MONIT-REF  (M0920006,V.Varlamov+,J,BAS,80,317,2016)
CRITIQUE   M0920006 contains evaluated cross section of
            65Cu[(g,n)+(g,np)] reaction, not of 65Cu(g,n) one.
ANALYSIS   To analyse the spectra of residual activity and
            calculate the intensities of gamma quanta, an
            automatic system was used that provides data
            visualization, separation of overlapping maxima and
            their approximation by Gaussian curves using the
            least squares method with standard algorithms.
           Experimental cross sections per equivalent photon in
            photoproton and photoneutron reactions were
            obtained.
           Since a target of natural isotopic composition was
            used, all possible reactions were taken into account
            in the cross section per equivalent photon using
            formula (7) of the article.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
