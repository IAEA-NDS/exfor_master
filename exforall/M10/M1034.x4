COMMENT     Natural copper consists of two 63Cu (69.17%) and 65Cu
            (30.83%) isotopes. The reaction 65Cu(g,n)64Cu was
            used as a monitor reaction in reallity because the
            64Cu isotope is produced only from the 65Cu isotope
            by (g,n) reaction. The photon flux was determined by

ANALYSIS   The direct measurement of ICR (isomeric cross section
            ratio) for 186m,gRe isomeric pairs is impossible due
            to the long half-life of the 186mRe isomeric state
            (2.0 x 10**5 y). The half-life of the 186gRe ground
            state is short (3.72 d), therefore the experimental
            average cross section measurement is possible.
            In order to evaluate the ICR for 186m,gRe isomeric
            semi-empirical method was used which consits of the
            combination of theoretical and experimental data. In
            order to obtain the theoretically calculated cross
            section for the formation of 186Re, the TALYS 1.9 and
            EMPIRE 3.2 nuclear codes were applied.
