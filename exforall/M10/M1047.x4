METHOD     (ACTIV)
SAMPLE     The sample of extra-pure natural (six stable isotopes,
            74Se (086%), 76Se (9.23%), 77Se (7.60%),
            78Se (23.69%), 80Se (49.80%), 82Se (8.82%)) selenium
            powder with mass 1.2665 g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Canberra GC3019 high purity germanium detector
            with energy resolution 0.8 keV at Eg = 150 keV and
            1.9 keV at Eg 1332 keV.
ANALYSIS   The gamma-ray spectra were processed, the
            radionuclides produced were identified based on their
            characteristic g-ray energies and half-lines.
           The experimental reaction yields determined using
            equations (3) and (4) of th article were normalized
            to one electron of accelerator beam.
           The cross sections per equivalent photon were
            determined using equations (6) and (7) of the
            article.
CRITIQUE   Data presented are the dublicates of data published in
            J,NIM/A,1054,168428,2023 (M1045) with the exception
            of ones for reaction Se-0(G,X)Se-79-m.
           There are several differences (typos?) in the data
            duplicated:
