            Description of the facilities used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced beta-delayed g-activity measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectrometers based on the Canderra and
            Ortec HPGe-detectors (100-200 cm**3) with energy
            resolution of 1.2 keV at the 343 keV line of 175Hf
            and 1.8-2.0 keV at 1173 and 1332 keV lines of 60Co.

ANALYSIS   Gamma-quanta energy spectrum lines data.
           For adaptation of the experimental spectra the
            Winspectrum program was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
COMMENT    For the first time the flux-weighted average yields
            of 180Hf-m in (g,p) reaction were measured by
            activation and off-line g-ray spectrometric
            technique at the bremsstrahlung end-point energies
            of 20, 40 and 55 MeV.
           Using weighted-average fluxes of bremsstrahlung
            gamma-rays the weighted-average reaction cross
            sections could be obtained and therefore only
            integrated cross sections are in fact measured in
            experiments.
HISTORY    (20211007C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
