INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung with end-point energies 40, 50
            and 60 MeV.
SAMPLE     Natural bismuth targets (diameter 1 sm, mass 1.10 g)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector (GEM15P4-70),Ortec, p-type,
            relative efficiency 30%.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   Flux-averaged cross sections were expressed in
            accordance with equation (2) of the article and the
            slightly simplified approach was used in accordance
            with equation (3) of the articles for 197Au target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The experimental uncertaintie mostly
            originate from the cross section uncertainty for the
            197Au(g,n)196Au reaction. Gold foils and reaction
            197Au(g,n)196Au were used in order to normalize
            intensity of the photon beam. The measured saturation
            activity of gold was used in accordance with equation
            (3) of the article.
CRITIQUE   The information on the source of the data for reaction
            197Au(g,n)196Au is absent.
HISTORY    (20250325C) Data compiled at the Russia MSU SINP CDFE
            by V.Varlamov.
