COMMENT    In the present study the experimental statistics
            for the reaction d(g,PI0pn) accumulated at VEPP-3
            in 2013 was used. Unlike the previous measurements,
            the main goal of the last experiment was to study
            the coherent PI0 photoproduction on a
            tenzor-polarized deuterium target using an
            unpolarized photon beam. In contrast to the
            experiment of 2003, in which only two final nucleons
            were detected, in the present case the proton and two
            g-quanta from the PI0 decay were detected in
            coincidence.

            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
