METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced beta-delayed g-activity measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectrometers developed on the basis of
            ultra-pure  semiconductor detectors from Canberra and
            Ortec  with  detection  efficiencies  of    15-40%
            compared to a NaI(Tl) detector 3'x 3' size. The
            energy resolution of spectrometers was 1.2 keV on
            the 343 keV g-line of 175Hf and 1.8-2.0 keV on the
            1173-keV and 1332 keV g-lines of 60Co.
ANALYSIS   Gamma-quanta energy spectrum lines data.

COMMENT    The weighted-average reaction cross sections were
            obtained using weighted-average fluxes of
            bremsstrahlung gamma-rays since those are
            continuously distributed from the boundary energy
            EN-MAX and therefore only integrated cross sections
            are in fact measured in experiments.
