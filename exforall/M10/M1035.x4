FACILITY   (LINAC,4ARMJER) The linear electron accelerator LUE-75
            at the AANL, Yerevan, Armenia.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung with  end-point energies  30 and
            40 MeV.
SAMPLE     Natural Ti target (purity - 99.9%) pressed in a tablet
            and wrapped in a thin (15 micron) aluminium foil with
            thickness 4.8 mm and 2.5 mm for the irradiations at 30
            and 40 MeV, respectively:
               46Ti      47Ti     48Ti     49Ti     50Ti
               8.0%      7.3%     73.8%    5.5%     5.4%
METHOD     (ACTIV) Identification  of  the  residual  nuclei  was
            performed  by  their  half-lives  and the energies of
            characteristic g-lines.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity   germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector
            GEM15P4-70  with energy resolution  1.8 keV at 1332.5
            keV g-ray peak of standard  60Co  g-source  and  0.82
            keV at the 122 keV g-peak of standard 57Co g-source.
COMMENT    The   flux-weighted    average   cross   sections   of
            several   natTi(g,x)  reactions   with  formation  of
            43,44m,44g,46,47,48Sc  isotopes  were  obtained using
            bremsstrahlung gamma-rays.
