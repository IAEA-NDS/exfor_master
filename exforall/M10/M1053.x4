TITLE      Measurement of flux-weighted average
            cross-section in the photo-neutron reactions of Nb

INSTITUTE  (4ARMJER)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4ARMJER) Electron linear accelerator LUE-75 at
            the A.I.Alikhanian National Science Laboratory
            (AANL), Yerevan, Armenia.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung with end-point energies 20 and
            67 MeV.
SAMPLE     (41-NB-93,NAT=0.999) 150 micron thick niobium target
            with 2.3 cm x 2.4 cm dimensions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The ORTEC high-purity germanium detector
            detector.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   The MAESTRO soft ware package was used for measured
            spectra processing.
           The flux-weighted average reaction cross sections
            were obtained using equation (1) of the article.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)
            The total errors of the experimental data are the
             quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic
             errors:
           (ERR-S) statistical errors are associated with the
             measurement of the activity of the irradiated
             material (about 7 %)
           (ERR-1) systematic errors, photon flux (about 7 %)
           (ERR-2) systematic errors, irradiation time (2 %)
           (ERR-3) systematic errors, determination of the
            detector efficiency (about 2 %).
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(G,N)29-CU-64,,SIG)
           The monitor reaction was used to measure the
            bremsstrahlung flux.
           The flux-weighted average cross section for
            65Cu(g,n)64Cu monitor reaction was obtained using
            formulas (2) and (3) of the article.
           Two possible gamma lines are available for monitor
            reaction are 511 keV and 1345.77 keV.
CRITIQUE   Gamma line energies of monitor reaction should be
            presented in keV as in Table 1 of article, not in
            MeV as in the text on page 2 (left column, 11-12
            lines from the top).
HISTORY    (20250113C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
