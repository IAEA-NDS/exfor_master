INC-SOURCE 1597 keV gamma quanta emitted during the decay of
            La140 (T1/2 = 40.3 hr) -> Ce140.
           The source was used in solid (lanthanum oxide) and
            liquid (solution of LaCl3 in hydrochloride acid).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A NaI(Tl) crystal.
ANALYSIS   The solid and liquid sources were used and the average
            cross section were obtained.
HISTORY    (20200114C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
