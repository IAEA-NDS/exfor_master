MONIT-REF  (M0920006,V.Varlamov+,J,BAS,80,317,2016)
CRITIQUE   M0920006 contains evaluated cross section of
            65Cu[(g,n)+(g,np)] reaction, not of 65Cu(g,n) one.
ANALYSIS   The areas of the photopeaks of the corresponding
            g-lines of the radioisotopes under consideration
            obtained as a result of g-spectroscopic measurements
            were used to extract their yield Y, which in this
            work is defined as the number of radioisotope nuclei
            formed in the target per second of its irradiation
            with bremsstrahlung photons: formula (1) of the
            article.
            The flux-weighted average cross sections obtained
            using formula (3) of the article are presented.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors given.
COMMENT    The experimental result is an integral value
            expressed as a convolution of the excitation
            function SIG(Eg) of a given reaction with the
            spectrum W(Eg,Ee) of bremsstrahlung photons
            incident on the corresponding target.
           The experimental data are represented as a
            flux-weighted average cross sections.
