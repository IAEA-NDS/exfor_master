ANALYSIS   Gamma-quanta energy spectrum lines data.
           For adaptation of the experimental spectra the
            Winspectrum program was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors.
COMMENT    For the first time the flux-weighted average yields
            of 180Hf-m in (g,p) reaction were measured by
            activation and off-line g-ray spectrometric
            technique at the bremsstrahlung end-point energies
            of 20, 40 and 55 MeV.
           Using weighted-average fluxes of bremsstrahlung
            gamma-rays the weighted-average reaction cross
            sections could be obtained and therefore only
            integrated cross sections are in fact measured in
            experiments.
HISTORY    (20211011C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
