FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Reactor IBR-2.
            Spectrometric setup consist of two rotor-type
            mechanical neutron choppers with dc motors,
            an electronic system for stabilizing the rotation of
            rotors and phasing the moment of opening slits along
            a neutron beam with a neutron pulse,collimators, and
            neutron detectors.
            The angular rotational velocity of rotors changes from
            0 to 6000 rpm, their synchronization with the neutron
            pulse is provided with accuracy of 10 microsec  at
            minimum time of opening slits along the neutron beam
            of 20 microsec.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) IBR-2 Reactor. Neutron beam collimated by mirror
                  neutron guide.
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-Of-Flight, Flight path 32.6m
DETECTOR   (PROPC) SNM-18 counter placed at 1.6m distance from
                  chopper.
SAMPLE     Metallic sample of natural tungsten of thickness
           0.00184 atom/b.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are not specified.
