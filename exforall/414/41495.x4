FACILITY   (VDG)    Cascade Generator KG-2.5
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)He-4 for monoenergetic neutrons from 14.23
                 to 17.98 MeV.
           (P-T) T(p,n)He-3 for monoenergetic neutrons from 0.37
                 to 1.1 MeV.
           (D-D) D(d,n)He-3 for monoenergetic neutrons from 3.25
                 to 4.72 MeV.
           Polyethylene cube near target - for epithermal neutrons
            of 2.85 eV.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Two fission (with Np-237 or Pu-239 oxide layers
            of 100 microg/cm**2 thickness on alumnium backing of
            0.2 mm thickness and 20 mm diameter, filled by mixture
            of CO2 - 10% and Ar - 90%) chambers near sample for
            neutron beam monitoring. Average efficiency of fission
            fragments registration - 98%.
           (LONGC) Long counter made on the base of boron counter
            SNM-P  was used for neutron beam stability control.
           (SIBAR)Surface barrier detectors for alpha registration
            to define mass of fissionable layers of Np-237 and
            Pu-239.
           (D4PI) For delayed neutron registration, thrity SNM-11
            boron counters in polyethylene
            cylinder of 400 mm diameter and 300 mm hight.
            Counters were places as tree rings of 53, 80, 110 mm
            diameters.
            Boron Carbide powder, borated polyethylene, cadmium
            sheets - for detector protection.
            Dead time of neutron registration - 2.3+-0.2 microsec.
            Absolute efficiency of neutron detector was measured:
            1) by source of monoenergetic neutrons from reaction
            V-51(p,n)Cr-51,
            2) by Cf-252 spontaneous fission neutrons energy
              distribution.
SAMPLE      Mass of fissionable sample near 1g.
            Placed in stainless steel ampule, then in titanium
            container.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cyclic radiation in neutron beam of fixed
           energy, moving the sample in neutron detector by
           pneumatic system, and measuring the time-dependence of
           delayed neutron intensity.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Error of detector efficiency measured by
                   1st method,
           (ERR-2) Error of detector efficiency measured by
                   2nd method.
           (ERR-T) Total error - 5%.
