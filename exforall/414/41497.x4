FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI) Pulsed neutron generator KG-0.3.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Short  (2.5ns) pulse of neutrons was generated
           through T(d,n) reaction. Bombarding of solid titanium-
           tritium target(11.mm diameter,0.8mm thickness,on coper
           backing,thin still tube of 0.55 thick as holder) with
           pulsed beam of 280.keV deutrons.
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight Base  215 cm.
           Measurement of background due to neutron scattering by
           walls and apparatus in experimental room was made
           without the sample.
SAMPLE     Uranium sample as hollow cylinder of 4.52cm external
           and 3.98cm internal diameters, 4.87cm height.
           Sample from depleted U-238(U-235 content 0.2%), 326.8g
           weight, placed at 14cm distance from Ti-T target at
           78 degrees angle to deutron beam direction.
PART-DET   (N)  Neutrons
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE-218 liquid scintillator in a glass vial of
            10cm diameter, 5cm thickness, viewed by XP-2041
            photomultiplier. Time resolution 3 ns, neutron
            detection threshold about 0.3 MeV, gamma-ray
            suppression factor about 5.
            Detector was placed in lead shielding of 10 cm
            thickness inside massive shield from mixture of
            paraffin and lithium hydride, and in front - iron and
            copper cones. All assembly was moved at angles from
            30 to 150 degrees in step 30 degrees.
            Detector efficiency was determined by two exp.methods:
             1.Neutron spectrum of spontaneous Cf-252 fission was
            measured, known for 0.1-10.MeV energy range with 3%
            accuracy (REL-REF).
           (IOCH) Fast-response fission ionization chamber with
            layer of Cf-252 was used.
             2. Second method - relative to cross-section for
            neutron scattering by hydrogen, known with accuracy
            less 1.% (MONIT-REF).
            Stilbene crystal of 10mm diameter and 40mm high was
            used as scatterer, was mounted on photocathode of
            FEU-30 photomultiplier.
           (LONGC) Long counter was used to monitor neutron flux
                   from target.

MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,SCT)1-H-1,,SIG) For absolute normalization of
            neutron energy spectra.
CORRECTION  Correction for multiple scattering and neutron
            attenuation in the sample was calculated by Monte
            Carlo method, involving detailed modelling of
            experiment: energy-angular distribution of source
            neutrons, the dimensions and position of scatterer and
            neutron detector, using MCNP-4B code with ENDF-B6 and
            ENDL-85 evaluated data libraries.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,3.,30.) Statistical error (3-30%).
           (ERR-1,5.,10.) Uncertainty of detector efficiency
                   determination (5-10%).
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of absolute normalization of
                   cross-sections (5%).
           (ERR-3) Inaccuracy in calculation of corrections for
                   multiple neutron interactions with sample (2%).
           (ERR-T,8.,30.) Total Error from 8% to 30% depending of
                energy and angle of scattered neutrons.
