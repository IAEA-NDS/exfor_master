INC-SPECT  .Average Thermal Neutron Energy is 0.0273 eV
ANALYSIS   .Cross-Section For 0.0253 eV Energy was Obtained from
            The Measured One Using 1/V Energy Dependence Law

SAMPLE     .Disk of Protactinium-231 Placed in a Titanium Foil
            5.E-5 Meter Thick. Two Samples were Prepared, One
            Containing N1=(0,478+-0.004)E-4 Gram, Another -
            N2=(0.563+-0.003)E-4 Gram of 231Pa.
           .Pa-232 Sample was Obtained by Building Up During
            Pa-231 Sample Irradiation in the Reactor and Deter-
            Mined Using Seven Gamma-Lines Accompanying Pa-232
            Beta Decay. Number of Pa-232 Atoms is N1(PA-232)=
            (3.360+-0.085)E+13.
           .Pa-233 Build-Up Quantity was Defined by a 312.2-KeV
            Gamma-Line Accompanying Pa-233 Beta Decay. Numbers of
            Pa-233 Atoms are - N1(PA-233)=(2.39+-0.22)E+10,
            N2(PA-233)=(0.117+-0.032)E+10
