           filled with water. One sample was irradiated inside Cd
           cover. Cooling time 5 days, measuring time 35 days.

ANALYSIS   Weighted average value of two methods:
           - by amount of Pa233 atoms built up during irradiation:
             518+-126 barn ;
           - by ratio of built-up quantities of Pa233 and Pa232
            (o.639=-0.068)*10**-3 : 653+-91 barn.

           Pa233.
SAMPLE     .Disk of protactinium-231 placed in a titanium foil
            5.E-5 meter thick. Two samples were prepared, one
            containing N1=(0,478+-0.004)E-4 gram, another -
            N2=(0.563+-0.003)E-4 gram of 231Pa.
           .Pa-232 sample was obtained by building up during
            Pa-231 sample irradiation in the reactor and deter-
            mined using seven gamma-lines accompanying Pa-232
            beta decay. Number of Pa-232 atoms is N1(PA-232)=
            (3.360+-0.085)E+13.
           .Pa-233 build-up quantity was defined by a 312.2-keV
            gamma-line accompanying Pa-233 beta decay. Numbers of
            Pa-233 atoms are - N1(PA-233)=(2.39+-0.22)E+10,
            N2(PA-233)=(0.117+-0.032)E+10
