FACILITY   (SYNCY,4RUSLIN) 1 GeV Proton Synchrocyclotron,
                Neutron Time-Of-Flight Spectrometer 'GNEIS'
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Water-cooled lead target as pulsed spallation
                neutron source 0f intensity 3E14 n/s.
METHOD     (TOF) 48.5 m flight path.
                 Iron,brass and lead collimators.
                 Sweeping magnet.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Two fast parallel plate ionization chambers
              filled with methane(94-100%) and CF4(6-0%) mixture.
              First one- with actinide targets, second- with lead
              or bismuth targets.
SAMPLE      Pb or Bi 10 foils of material .260-.520 mg/cm**2
                thickness and 1 or 2 foils of 99.992% enriched
                235-U of .150-.260 mg/cm**2 thickness and
                180 mm diameter, deposited on one side of
                0.05-mm-thick aluminum  backings.
                Pb and Bi Targets from high purity metal using
                evaporation in vacuum.
             For U-235 Targets the painting technique was used.
