FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Reactor IBR-30
INC-SOURCE (REAC) IBR-30 pulsed neutron source consists of
            subcritical reactor and 40-MeV electron linear
            accelerator. Mean power of 10 kW. Neutron pulse width
            of 4 microsec. Pulse repetition rate 100 Hz.
            Water moderator to modify neutron spectrum.
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-of-flight, flight path 124 m.
           Gamma rays spectra and neutron time-of-flight spectra
            were measured.
           (GSPEC) Multiplicity spectrometry
           (COINC) Gamma time-of-flight spectra were obtained for
                the coincidence multiplicities from 1 to 16.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 proportional counter -for neutron flux
                 monitoring. Placed in the beam.
             Battery of tree boron proportional counters SNM-13 of
             0.5cm diameter and 6 cm length placed in 124-m flight
             path to measure the neutron time-of-flight spectrum.
             Polyethylene moderator of 10 cm diameter and 1.5 cm
             thickness, placed in front of boron counters.
           (STANK)  16-section liquid scintillation detector
                    consisting of 86% toluol(C6H5CH3) and,
            enriched to 94% in B-10,14% trimethilborate(B(OCH3)3).
            Liquid scintillator was contained in two 40-liter
            cylindrical tanks, each consisted of eight sections,
            separated by 2 mm aluminum. Each section was viewed
            by FEU-100 photomultiplier.
            Total gamma detection efficiency about 30%.
           (HPGE) High-purity germanium detector of efficiency
            about 7-8%, inside the 10cm-thick lead shielding of
            scintillation detector, at 20 cm from capture sample.
            Used to measure the gamma-ray amplitude of capture
            samples.
