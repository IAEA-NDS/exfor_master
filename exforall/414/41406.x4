DETECTOR   (GELI) Energy resolution 2.7 keV and peak efficiency
                  7.9% at 1332.5 keV gamma ray energy
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
           (GSPEC)
            Gamma-spectrometer efficiency was determined by
            standard gamma-sources, which activity was known with
            error 1.5-2.0%. During measurement the efficiency
            value was constant +- 5% for gamma-ray energy range
            200-3000 keV.
