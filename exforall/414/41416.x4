DETECTOR   (D4PI) Distributed in Polyethilene Moderator Along
                 Three Concentric Circles with Diameters of 106,
                 160 and 220 mm Assemblage of 30 Boron Counters
                 Snm-11 was Used For Neutron Detection. Energy
                 Dependence of Detector Absolute Efficiency was
                 Determined by Two Different Methods:
               1 Activation Method Based on the 51-V(P,N) Reaction
               2 Method Based on the Measurements of the Average
                 Number of Prompt Neutrons from 252-Cf Source
                 Spontaneous Fission
                 The Relative Efficiency of Neutron Detector
                 Was Determined by Monte-Carlo Calculations
