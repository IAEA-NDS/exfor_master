FACILITY   (VDG)    Electrostatic accelerator KG-2.5
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Distributed in polyethilene moderator along
                 three concentric circles with diameters of 106,
                 160 and 220 mm assemblage of 30 boron counters
                 snm-11 was used for neutron detection. Energy
                 Dependence of detector absolute efficiency was
                 determined by two different methods:
               1 Activation method based on the 51-V(P,N) reaction
               2 Method based on the measurements of the average
                 number of prompt neutrons from 252-Cf source
                 spontaneous fission.
                 The relative efficiency of neutron detector
                 was determined by monte-carlo calculations
