FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)    Electrostatic accelerator CG-2.5
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Distributed in polyethylene moderator along
                 three concentric circles with diameters of 106,
                 160 and 220 mm assemblage of 30 boron counters
                 SNM-11 was used for neutron detection. Energy
                 Dependence of detector absolute efficiency was
                 determined by two different methods:
               1 Activation method based on the 51-V(P,N) reaction
               2 Method based on the measurements of the average
                 number of prompt neutrons from 252-Cf source
                 spontaneous fission.
                 The relative efficiency of neutron detector
                 was determined by Monte-Carlo calculations

                    Cf-252 fission events detection

                    events detection
           (HE3SP)  He-3 counter for neutron flux monitoring
