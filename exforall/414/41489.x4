FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Reactor IBR-30
INC-SOURCE (REAC) IBR-30 pulsed neutron source.
            Energy and average power of electron beam - 40 MeV and
            10 kW. Pulse width amounted to 4 microsec.
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-of-flight, flight path 122 m
           (GSPEC) Multiplicity spectrometry
           (COINC) Gamma time-of-flight spectra were obtained for
                the coincidence multiplicities from 1 to 16.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 proportional counter - for neutron flux
                 monitoring. Placed in the beam.
            Battery of three boron proportional counters of 0.5cm
            diameter and 6 cm length at the end of flight path -
            to measure the neutron time-of-flight spectrum.
           (STANK)  16-section liquid scintillation detector
                    consisting of 86% toluol(C6H5CH3) and,
            enriched to 94% in B-10,14% trimethilborate(B(OCH3)3).
            Liquid scintillator was contained in two 40 liter
            cylindrical tanks, each consisted of eight sections,
            separated by 2 mm aluminum. Each section was viewed
            by FEU-100 photomultiplier.
            Total gamma detection efficiency - about 30%.
SAMPLE     5.0 g thorium plate of size 4.5 cm *4.5 cm, 0.023 cm
           thickness (6.42E-4 atoms/barn).
           13.24 g natural uranium disc of 6.0 cm diameter,
           0.025 cm thickness (1.19E-3 atoms/barn).
ANALYSIS   (AREA) After subtraction of background, the areas of
            resonances in gamma- time-of-flight spectrum were
            determined for each coincidence multiplicity.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,0),,EN) Resonances at 20.84, 66.02, 116.94
                               and 189.89 eV.
