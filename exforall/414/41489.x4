FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Reactor IBR-30
INC-SOURCE (REAC)IBR-30 pulsed neutron source.
            Energy and Average Power of electron beam - 40 MeV and
            10 kW. Pulse Width amounted to 4 Microsec.
METHOD     (TOF)  Time-Of-Flight, Flight path 122 m
           (GSPEC) Multiplicity Spectrometry
           (COINC) Gamma time-of-flight spectra were obtained for
                the coincidence multiplicities from 1 to 16.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 proportional counter -for neutron flux
                 monitoring. Placed in the beam.
             Battery of three boron proportional counters of 0.5cm
             diameter and 6 cm length at the end of flight path -
              to measure the neutron time-of-flight spectrum.
           (STANK)  16-Section Liquid Scintillation Detector
                    Consisting of 86% Tholuol(C6H5CH3) and,
            Enriched to 94% in B-10,14% Trimethilborate(B(OCH3)3).
            Liquid scintillator was contained in two 40 Liter
            cylindrical tanks, each consisted of eight sections,
            separated by 2 mm Aluminium. Each section was viewed
            by FEU-100 photomultiplier.
            Total gamma detection efficiency - about 30%.
SAMPLE     5.0 g thorium plate of size 4.5cm*4.5cm, 0.023cm
           thickness (6.42E-4 atoms/barn).
           13.24 g natural uranium disc of 6.0 cm diameter,
           0.025cm thickness (1.19E-3 atoms/barn).
ANALYSIS   (AREA) After subtraction of background, the areas of
            resonances in gamma- time-of-flight spectrum were
            determined for each coincidence multiplicity.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,0),,EN) Resonances at 20.84, 66.02, 116.94
                               and 189.89 eV.
