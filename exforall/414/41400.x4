FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB) Reactor IBR-30 in pulse mode
           (LINAC,4ZZZDUB)
METHOD     (TOF) Resolution 0.06 microsec/m
           . Cd ( 0.5 mm thickness) and Al (10 cm , at fist run)
           filters.
           . Mn filter at additional measurement to determine
           corrections and to protect ionization chamber against
           scattered neutrons.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)  Gridded two-section ionization chamber
                   filled with argon + 3% C-O2 at 0.8 and
                   0.35 Atm pressure.
            Chamber was placed at 85 m distance from the reactor.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)
            Alpha particles of 2.05 MeV energy were used for
           calibration.
SAMPLE     .Chlorine samples were Na-Cl salt obtained by
           sedimentation,
           thicknesses are 1.75 and 0.128 milligram/cm2
           .Lithium sample is Li-F, thickness 23 microgram/cm2
CORRECTION For contribution from scattered neutrons for Li target.

ANALYSIS    For 398 keV resonance -
            total width = 0.823+- 0.008,
            SIG0*GAMMAgamma = (155+-13)*10**-24 cm2*eV ( corrected
           for new value of SIGgamma for thermal neutrons),
           were used. GAMMAgamma was revised to be 0.53+-0.07 eV.
            For 4249 eV resonance -
             GAMMAgamma =~ 0.5 eV,
            g*Gammatot = 0.25+-0.0025 eV
            were used.
