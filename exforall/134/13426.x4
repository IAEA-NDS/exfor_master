           the double-chamber fission counting apparatus.
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Brookhaven pile.
INC-SPECT  2x10**11 n/cm**2/sec, the flux was constant to +- 2%
           after reaching its full value.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) Two gas proportional counters with
           silver cathodes, 2 cm dia. and 30 cm long. The
           krypton pressure was about 300 mm and methane was
           added to bring the total pressure to 1 atm.
SAMPLE     The fission foils, which consist of 0.01 microg of
           235U or 239Pu deposited on a Pt disk 0.002 inch thick
           and 1 inch in diameter.
METHOD     (CHSEP,FISCT) Absolute radiochemical methods, fission
           yields to half life (Y/T). Foils were mounted on
           platinum in each of the two chambers of fission
           counting apparatus. The entire assembly was then
           irradiated in the brookhaven graphite reactor for
           6-12 hr, and the fission counting rates of the foils
           were recorded continuously. After irradiation the
           85Kr was radiochemically separated from the slug,
           purified, and its activity measured by internal gas
           phase proportional counting. From these values of the
           85Kr activity and the measured number of fissions the
           fission yield was calculated.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The standard deviation is 1.59% of Y/T. As
           concern for possible systematic errors. We feel that
           is unlikely that measured Y/T values differ from true
           more than 3%. Which we adopt as our accuracy estimate.
           (ERR-1) 1% per slug fissions.
           (ERR-2) 2% for 85Kr activity.
