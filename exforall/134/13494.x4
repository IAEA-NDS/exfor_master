INSTITUTE  (1CANCRC)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) Heavy-water pile.
INC-SPECT  The fluxes of thermal neutrons were obtained by
           experiment as far as possible; the maximum used was
           2.0*10**13 neutrons/cm2/sec.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Counter had a mica end-window of mass 2.8 mg
           per cm2. The counter efficiency was found to be 7.5%
           using a standard Co60 source.
SAMPLE     Barium carbonate (138Ba was 71.66% of natural barium
           in 1949 catalogs).
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) It is preferable to produce the Ba139
           by neutron capture in stable Ba138 than to separate
           it from mixed fission products. Barium carbonate
            (analytical reagent grade) was irradiated in high flux
            positions in the heavy water pile. To free the barium
           from lanthanum after irradiation, the procedure was
           in each case to dissolve the sample in dilute
           hydrochloric acid, and take an aliquot from which the
           barium content was determined as barium sulfate. The
           La140 samples were mounted on aluminum trays, 7.1 cm2
           area, and the activity measured with a previously
           calibrated Geiger-Muller counter. The decay curve of
           a lanthanum sample was followed for some time.

CORRECTION Corrected for:
           - residual background due to barium contamination of
             separated 140La
           - self-absorption of betas in sample (about 5%)
           - external absorption Be air gap and counter window
             (about 3%)
           - backscattering by Al tray (about 20%)
           - counter efficiency
           - percentage chemical recovery

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimated probable error. Authors feel
           that 1.2 barns is sufficient for the probable error
           in our measured value of 4.7 barns because of 20%
           probable errors for Ba138 and La139 cross sections.
