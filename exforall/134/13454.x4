           (C,73ROCH,2,19,1973) A review of the previous
           measurements where the J,PR/C,5,1725,1972 values were
           slightly changed, it also contains new nubar results
           that compiled separately.

METHOD     (CHSEP,BSPEC) The 2.62-h 256Fm sources used for this
           study were prepared by 3-h irradiations of 10- to
           100- microg 253Es targets with 40-MeV 4He ions at the
           Argonne National Laboratory cyclotron to produce the
           1.25-h 256Md parent. The 256Md was then purified by a
           rigorous chemical-separation procedure designed to
           provide the required decontamination (>10**10) from
           target materials and fission products produced in the
           cyclotron irradiation. After removal of small
           aliquots for fission counting, the purified sources
           of 256Md were allowed to stand overnight, decaying as
           follows to the spontaneously fissioning 256Fm: 256Md
            (92% EC) 256Fm (92% SF) fission products. Each source
           yielded about 10**7 total spontaneous-fission events.
           The specific fission products of interest were then
           isolated, and thick samples (10 mg/cm2) were mounted
           for beta counting.
