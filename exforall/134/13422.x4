TITLE      Fission Products: 25-Minute Samarium 155

FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Water boiler, homogeneous pile.
METHOD     (CHSEP) For the Sm(n,gamma) samples commercial
           samarium was purified by two Na analgem separations.
           No attempt was to remove Eu, but the various neutron
           radiations of Eu2O3 revealed the absence of any
           short-lived Eu isotopes with half-lives less than the
           reported 9.2 h. Counting through various absorbers
           was begun immediately after the end of the irradiation.
