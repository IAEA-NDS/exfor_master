FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD) XTU Tandem accelerator of the
           Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro of INFN.
SAMPLE     (20-CA-48,ENR=0.918) The targets were (Ca-48)F2
           (50 microg/cm**2) evaporations on carbon 10 microg/cm2
           thick. Predominant 7.7% impurity of Ca-40. The
           impurity of Ca-46 is <0.01%
DETECTOR   (MCPLT,SIBAR,TELES) Two microchannel plate detectors
            (MCP1 and MCP2) and a 450 mm**2 silicon detector
           giving the energy (E) and the start signal used for
           the time-of-flights TOF1, TOF2, and triggering the
           data acquisition. The total length of the telescope
           was 40 cm with a geometrical solid angle of 0.076
           msr. The efficiency of the MCP detectors for
           evaporation residues has been determined to be >98%
METHOD     (TOF)Evaporation residues (ER) were detected by two
           microchannel plate detectors (MCP1 and MCP2), and
           finally stopped in the silicon detector giving the
           energy (E) and the start signal used for the time-of-
           flights TOF1, TOF2, and triggering the data
           acquisition. The E-TOF1 spectrum alone was sufficient
           to identify the ER. The complementary E-TOF2 spectrum
           was used as an independent condition to get rid of
           spurious events in E-TOF1 at lower energies.
PART-DET   (ER) An electrostatic deflector separated the
           recoiling evaporation  residues (ER) from the
           transmitted beam and beam-like particles at 0 degree
           and at small angles.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) ER angular distributions were measured at
           E(lab) = 101.0, 76.7, 72.2 MeV in the range -7 degree
           to +6 degree with steps of 1 degree.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied for:
               The beam energy losses in the targets.
               The calcium isotopic enrichment.
               The transmission of the electrostatic deflector
               T = 0.73 +/- 0.03
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-SYS) The absolute cross section scale is accurate
           within +/- 7 %, with  contributions arising from the
           geometrical solid angles (measured by placing an
           alpha-source at the target position), from the fits
           and integrations of the angular distributions, and
           from the transmission of the electrostatic  deflector.
