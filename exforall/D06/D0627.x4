TITLE       Tritium production in iron by protons at energies
            between 50 and 177 MeV

INSTITUTE  (2ZZZCER)
REFERENCE  (R,CERN-58-2,1958)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP) Uppsala Synchro-cyclotron
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) To count beta activity of 3H and 24Na
METHOD     (INTB,ACTIV,BSPEC) Irradiated for 20 to 25 min
CORRECTION - 24Na beta counting rates were corrected for self-
             absorption and geometric factor;
           - Tritium counting rates at the end of irradiation
             were corrected for the counting efficiency of the
             GM counters.

COMMENT     By author:
             Because of the steep rise of the Al-Na cross-section
             in the energy region of 50 MeV, the production rate
             of tritium at 50 MeV was not very well defined.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) - Mean error of measured proton intensity
                        lies between 5% and 8%.
                      - For all monitoring targets, the maximum
                        difference between the beta-activities of
                        the different foils of the target is 12%.
