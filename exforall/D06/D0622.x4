           reaction on gold

SAMPLE     High purity gold foils of purity (99.999%) and
           thickness 10 mu-m
METHOD     (STTA)  stacked-foil technique was used. The stack
           contained an array of several gold target samples in
           addition to  aluminum and copper foils as beam energy
           degrader and  monitors. Due to the energy loss of the
           bombarding proton beam,  each foil was irradiated at
           different beam energies, so several  experimental
           points of the reaction cross-section can be obtained
           for only one irradiation.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3EGYCAI) MGC-20 cyclotron  in Inshas, Egypt
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectrometer consists of a HPGe-
           detector of  145 cm3 active volume, Canberra 3106D
           high voltage power  supply, Canberra 2026 spectroscopy
           amplifier coupled to either a  PCA-II or (TRUMP-8192)
           multi-channel analyzers. The  absolute efficiency
           curves of the detector were determined  by the
           standard 133Ba, 60Co, 152Eu, 154Eu and 155Eu gamma-
           sources  at different source to detector distances
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the measured
           cross-sections were obtained by taking the square root
           of the sum of the squares of all the considerable
           uncertainties:
           (ERR-1,1.,3.) Target mass 1-3%
           (ERR-2,3.,7.) Target homogeneity 3-7%
           (ERR-3,0.5,1.) Target area 0.5-1%
           (ERR-4,2.,5.) Detector efficiency 2-5%
           (ERR-S,3.,8.) Peak area and counting statistics 3-8%
           (ERR-5,2.,3.) Irradiation time 2-3%
           (ERR-6,10.,22.) Beam current 10-22%

           The time of measurements was adjusted to obtain a good
           counting statistics for the 191.4 keV gamma-ray line
           and it was used for calculating the reaction
           cross-sections to avoid utilization of complicated
            77 keV line
