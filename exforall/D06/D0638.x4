INC-SOURCE The deuteron beam was extracted from a 'MC-SNICS' ion
           source, provided with a solid titanium deuteride
           cathode.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) The products of each reaction were momentum
           analysed by the Enge split-pole spectrograph and
           detected in nuclear emulsion plates, positioned on
           the focal plane of the spectrograph.
MONITOR    The total number of projectiles corresponding to each
           spectrum was obtained with the help of a calibrated
           current integrator connected to an aligned Faraday cup
           with electron suppression. The beam direction was
           continuously monitored. The relative normalization of
           the spectra was thus obtained, while the absolute
           normalization of the cross sections was referred to
           optical model predictions for the elastic scattering
           of deuterons on the same target, measured under
           similar conditions. The elastic spectra were measured
           at laboratory scattering angles in the range of 30. to
           78. degr.)
