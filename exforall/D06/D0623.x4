FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP) Scanditronix variable energy
           cyclotron (real K=38, beam emittance ~20 mmmrad) of
           JRC-Ispra at different nominal incident energies
METHOD     (BCINT,STTA,ACTIV,CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) series of 8 HPGe detectors (15-40%  relative
           efficiency, 1.9-2.3 keV FWHM for 60Co and peak to
           Compton ratio 30:1 at 1.33 MeV, SAs mod. 572 and 672,
           MCAs  919E, EG&G Ortec), calibrated in the same
           geometric configuration  of the targets, by 3 certified
           multigammapoint sources of: 226Ra (at secular
           equilibrium) with overall uncertainty of 1.5%, 152Eu
           and 133Ba  with uncertainties of 2.0% and 3.0%,
            respectively.
ANALYSIS   Several hundreds raw spectra were collected and
           analyzed for  each target by GAMMAVISION s/w
            (EG&G,Ortec); nonetheless, each  single peak was
           manually identified and statistically  analyzed, to
           avoid any s/w error in case of double peaks
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall uncertainty on yield
           measurements results from the summation of several
           uncertainties(ISO errors of type A),i.e.:
           (ERR-S,,0.1) statistical error on the net peak
                                               counts (< 0.1%),
           (ERR-1,1.,2.) integrated beam charge (< 1-2%),
           (ERR-2) calibration 226Ra source uncertainty (1.5%)
           (ERR-3) calibration 152Eu source uncertainty (2.0%)
           (ERR-4) calibration 133 Ba source uncertainty (3.0%)
           (ERR-5,,1.) fitting of the detector efficiency
                                            curves (< 1%),
             with a typical overall relative type A error of 4.5%.
             ** The systematic errors(ISO type B)were not taking
                into account, i.e.:
              * decay half-life,
              * gamma emission intensity,
              * decay branching
           that are all referred to Firestone et al.,1998, (Table
           of Isotopes 8th Ed.John Wiley & Sons, New York,USA
           1998 Update on CD-ROM), because
           they can be easily traced and renormalized by other
           authors accordingly to the DB adopted (Taylor, et al.

           Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results-NIST-TN-1297.

           hydraulic crystallography press in between two
           accurately measured high purity Al foils 10 mm of
