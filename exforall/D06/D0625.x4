FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP) 8UD Pelletron accelerator
INC-SOURCE The secondary radioactive  ion beam 8Li was produced
           with the RIBRAS(Radioactive Ion Beams in Brazil) system
           The 8Li radioactive ion beam was (7Li, 8Li). The
           thickness of the primary target 9Be is of 12mg/cm2,
            which is mounted in an ISO chamber just before the
           first solenoid. The average intensity of the secondary
           beam 8Li at the scattering chamber was around
           5 x 10**4 pps, which is calculated by assuming pure
           Rutherford scattering of the 8Li on the gold target.
SAMPLE     The targets  were mounted at the center of the
           scattering chamber.  The secondary targets used were
           self-supporting, pure  9Be, 51V targets of thickness
           1.4 mg/cm2 and 5 mg/cm2,  respectively. A gold target
           of thickness 300 mu-g/cm2 was  also used.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(3-LI-8,EL)79-AU-197,,DA)
            The elastic scattering of 8Li on the gold target
           was measured in all runs at different angles and used
           to obtain the overall normalization.
METHOD     (EDE,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) The elastic scattered reaction
           products with 8Li  particles  were detected by an
           array of four Si surface barrier  dE-E telescopes in
           an angular range of 15-35 degrees  in the laboratory
           system, in 5 degree steps mounted on  the rotating
           plate of the chamber. The thickness of dE  and E
           detectors was 25 mu-m and 1mm, respectively, both
           having an area of 300mm2.
