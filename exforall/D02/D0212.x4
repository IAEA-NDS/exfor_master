FACILITY   (CYCLO)
SAMPLE     The target thickness was 0.16 g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) The polarimeter is used in detection.
           The scattered protons were analysed in energy by the
           magnetic spectrometer.
           The beam was monitored by a scintillator telescope
           directed towards the target.
METHOD     (DSCAT,LRASY) Left and right scattering from the
            5 g/cm2 thick carbon scatterer was detected in double
            coincidence telescopes divided into an inner and an
            outer angular channel and consisting of the
            scintillators.
