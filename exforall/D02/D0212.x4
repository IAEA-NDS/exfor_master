TITLE      Measurements of the polarization and
           DWIA - calculations for the inelastic scattering
           of 185 MeV Protons from 12C

FACILITY   (CYCLO)
SAMPLE     The target thickness was 0.16 g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) The polarimeter is used in detection.
           Left and right scattering from the 5 g/cm2 thick carbon
           scatterer was detected in double coincidence telescopes
           divided into an inner and an outer angular channel and
           consisting of the scintillators.
           The scattered protons were analysed in energy by the
           magnetic spectrometer.
           The beam was monitored by a scintillator telescope
           directed towards the target.
ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-SYS) Due to errors in the calibration of the
           polarimeter
           (ERR-S) The statistical errors.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the tabl.1 from the main ref.
