SAMPLE     The target was a 75 mu-g/cm2 thickness self-supported
           evaporated 27Al foil.
METHOD     The total fusion cross section has been measured  at
           energies close and above the Coulomb barrier.
           Different processes following the breakup should be
           considered: elastic breakup (EBU), when neither of the
           breakup fragments is captured by the target;
           incomplete fusion reaction (ICF), when one of the
           fragments is captured by the target; and complete
           fusion following breakup (CFBU), when all breakup
           fragments are captured by the target.
           The sum of complete fusion (including two body
           fusion and complete fusion following breakup) and
           incomplete fusion is called total fusion.

REACTION   (13-AL-27(4-BE-9,FUS),,SIG)
FACILITY   (VDGT,3ARGCNE) The 20UD TANDAR laboratory.
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Has been used as the start detector.
           (SIBAR) Passivated implanted planar silicon detector
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error. The normalization of the fusion
           cross sections was obtained by counting elastic
           scattering events in the spectra, when the experimental
           conditions were such that the scattering was purely
           Rutherford. Otherwise, it was obtained using the
           integrated beam current in the Faraday cup and the
           nominal target thickness. In the first case, the
           associated uncertainty was around 2%, whereas in the
           latter it was the sum of three contributions:
           around 2% from the integrated beam current, 10% from
           the target thickness, and 1% from the solid angle
           detection system determination.

REACTION   (13-AL-27(4-BE-9,NON),,SIG,,,DERIV) Reaction cross
           sections were obtained from elastic scattering data.
SAMPLE     The 64Zn target had a thickness of 60 mu-g/cm2.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP) The Sao Paulo 8UD pelletron accelerator.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The elastic scattering cross sections were
           measured with a set of nine silicon surface barrier
           detectors, placed at 40-cm from the target. The angular
           separation between two adjacent detectors was 5 degree.
           An additional surface barrier detector used as monitor
           was placed at 20. degr, relative to the beam direction,
           for normalization purposes.
