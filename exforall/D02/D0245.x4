INC-SOURCE The secondary beam was produced by fragmentation of a
           75 MeV/nucleon 13C beam delivered by the GANIL
           accelerator on a 1155 mg/cm 2 carbon production target,
           located between the two superconducting solenoids of
           the SISSI device. The secondary beam was analyzed by
           the alpha spectrometer with a magnetic rigidity set at
           2.82 Tm which corresponds to an average energy of
           41.6 MeV/nucleon for the 6He ions.
SAMPLE     The reaction target was a 100 mu-m thick polypropylene
           foil, (CH2)3.
DETECTOR   (PSSCN) All the scattered particles were unambiguously
           identified in the focal plane of the spectromerer
           with an ionisation chamber and a plastic scintillator.
           The momentum and scattering angle were measured
           with two position sensitive drift chambers placed 70 cm
           apart and located near the focal plane
           of the spectrometer.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Normalization uncertainty.
           The absolute normalization for the elastic scattering
           data on the protons in the (CH2)3 target was obtained
           from the elastic scattering on 12C which was measured
           simultaneously.
