METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV,EDE)
SAMPLE     The targets were mounted in aluminium frames with 25mm
           diam. apertures. These frames were mounted onto
           an aluminium ladder that  fits into a target drive
           mechanism at the center of the scattering  chamber.
           Targets of 93Nb with different thicknesses (2.65mg/cm2
           and 1.72 mg/cm2) were used in the measurements at,
           respectively,  400 and 300 MeV incident energy. The
           thickness of the 59Co target  was 1.00 mg/cm2. The
           target thicknesses were confirmed by means of  the
           energy loss of a particles from a 2ZSTh source, to an
           accuracy of  better than 5%.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,NAICR) Two complementary detector
           assemblies were employed. These were conventional
           charged-particle telescopes, each consisting of a stack
           of two Si surface-barrier detectors and a NaI stopping
           detector. This arrangement gives two AE-E combinations
           for particle identification in each telescope,
           corresponding to lower and higher energy regions. In
           one of the telescopes the Si detectors had thicknesses
           of 30 mu-m and 500 mu-m, while different thicknesses of
           100mu-m and 2000mu-m were used in the second telescope.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall systematic uncertainty
           of the absolute cross section values is estimated to
           be less than 10%.
STATUS     Authors didn't send data for double diff.cr. sections
