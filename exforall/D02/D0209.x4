METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV)
SAMPLE     Nine 208 mu-g/cm2 targets with aluminium degrades
           in two different groups were irradiated.
           Targets were of Os natural composition (184Os -0.02%,
           186Os -1.58%, 187Os -1.6%, 188Os -13.3%,
           189Os -16.1%, 190Os -26.4%, 192Os -41.0%)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-spectrometry was carried out by
           50 cm3 HpGe detectors connected to multichannel
           analysers.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The decays of the different radionuclides have
           been followed for not less than three half-lives and
           the lenght of measurements were chosen for each
           radionuclide so that the counting statistical error on
           the photopeak areas was always of the order of less
           than 1%. The cumulative statistical error on each thin
           target yield data, due to errors on photopeak areas,
           decay constant, integrated charge and detector
           efficiency, was in total less than a few percent.
           (ERR-SYS) uncertainty in the detector efficiency.
           (EN-ERR) Mean value between the incident beam energy
           and the outgoing beam energy (calculated using range
           and stopping-power TRIM 91 code.
CORRECTION Systematic errors related to the stoppingpower
           calculations and the gamma-emission abundances were
           not taken into account.
           Radioactive growth-up was taken into account,
           adopting the proper correction equations of the
           radioactive chains (i.e., 188Pt/188Ir).

           These values are calculated taking into account the
           parent/daughter equilibrium between 188Ir and 188Pt.
