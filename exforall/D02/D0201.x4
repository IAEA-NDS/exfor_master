METHOD     (TRN)
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen targets (35 and 70 mg/cm2 thick).
INC-SOURCE The 6He beam was produced by fragmentation of
           a 60 MeV/nucleon 48Ca primary beam delivered by
           the GANIL accelerator complex, and incident on a Be
           production target, backed by Ta. The secondary ions
           were subsequently selected using the spectrometer LISE
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SILI) The transmitted ions were identified
           using a large area (50 x 50 mm2) telescope. The
           telescope was composed of a thin (500 mu-m) position
           sensitive Si detector, a Si(Li) detector (3500 mu-m)
           and a thick stopping CsI scintillator (4.5 cm)
