           3.74 MeV in 40Ca by 185 MeV Protons

FACILITY   (CYCLO)
SAMPLE     Two different targets were used with thicknesses of
           50 and 320 mg/cm2, respectively. The target material
           was calcium of natural composition, i.e. 97 % of 40Ca.
           The targets were strip-shaped, 3 mm wide, i.e. of the
           same width as the beam spot, to get better localised
           scattering.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) The polarimeter is used in detection.
           Left and right scattering from the 5 g/cm2 thick carbon
           scatterer was detected in double coincidence telescopes
           divided into an inner and an outer angular channel and
           consisting of the scintillators.
           The beam was monitored by a scintillator telescope
           directed towards the target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors.
           (DATA-ERR) the percentage contribution to the cross
           section from the 2+ level at 3.90 MeV
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the table 1 from the main ref.
