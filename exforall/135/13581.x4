FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMTR) MTR crystal spectrometer.
INC-SPECT  Irradiations were made in the VG-23 facility of the
           Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) where the thermal
           flux is 2*10**10 n/cm2 sec and the cadmium ratio for
           indium is 800.
SAMPLE     Two U3O8 samples, isotopic composition. Thermal
           irradiations done on 233U as uranyl nitrate.

METHOD     (CHSEP) Two irradiations were made on the crystal
           spectrometer with neutrons of 0.0253 ev energy, in
           order to compare the fission product yields with
           those obtained for thermal irradiations made in the
           VG-23 graphite facility. No significant differences
           were observed in the mass yield ratios obtained from
           these two kinds of irradiations. In addition to the
           spectrometer irradiations, a number of in-pile
           irradiations were made in positions in the reactor
           having appreciable epi-cadmium neutron fluxes.
           Samples for these irradiations consisted of 0.08 mg
           of uranium, evaporated on aluminum foil as in the
           thermal neutron irradiations. However, they were
           inserted in 1/8-in. i.d. cadmium tubing having a wall
           thickness of 20 mils. In these irradiations, the
           fission yields give the effect of all epi-cadmium
           resonances, integrated over the flux distribution at
           the position of irradiation. The fission products
           Mo99, Ag111, Ag113 and Cd115 were separated from the
           irradiated U233 to determine the ratio of asymmetric to
            symmetric fission at the various neutron energies.
