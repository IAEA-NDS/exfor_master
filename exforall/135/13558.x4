TITLE      Measurements of the Thermal Neutron Cross Section of
            90Sr(n,gamma) Reaction
FACILITY   (REAC) NRU D2O moderated reactor
INC-SOURCE Hydraulic Capsule Facility
INC-SPECT  Cd ratio for cobalt about 30
SAMPLE     1 mCi purified 90Sr sealed in quartz.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP) Y chemically separated from Sr before
            irradiation and after irradiation but prior to
            counting 91Sr activity.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) High resolution Ge spectrometer.
           Detector efficiency determined using set of calibrated
            137Cs, 134Cs, 133Ba, 88Y, 60Co, and 54Mn sources.
           Amount of 90Sr in sample deterined from beta activity
            of 90Y using end-window proportional counter.

                           DG,1024.,0.33)
            Branching ratios taken from Browne and Firestone,
            'Table of Radioactive Isotopes' (1986)
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG,,MXW)
            Co/Al alloy flux monitor.
ANALYSIS   Value given average of data for three runs and for
            three gammas measured.  Averages for three gammas:
            9.2mb (555keV), 10.3mb (749keV), 9.6mb (1024keV).
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . decay during counting period
           . secular equilibrium of the 556 kev transition from
             49.7 min 91Y.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total rms uncertainty.
           Includes uncertainties due to:
           .contamination of the 90Sr by fissionable material
           .weighing uncertainties
           .volumetric uncertainties
           .gamma measurement and gamma calibration uncertainties
           .gamma branching ratio uncertainties
           .beta- calibrations and measurements
