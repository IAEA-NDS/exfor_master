INC-SPECT  Energy stability of the ion beam is better than 250 eV
           at 2 MeV. The energy spread for 2MeV He+ is about
           200 eV.
SAMPLE     Series of Si<100> samples, having CVD-grown oxide
           layers on the front surface, was used. The oxygen
           densities of these layers were measured with RBS at
           2 MeV. Samples were mounted on a three-axis goniometer,
           allowing channeling experiments.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Surface barrier detector has an energy
           resolution of 20 keV and a solid angle about 5 msr.
           The scattering angle could be varied from 100 to
           173 degrees.

SAMPLE     Thickness of target was 177angstroem, areal density was
            (8.14+-0.31)*10**16 at/cm2.
METHOD     Scattering angle in these measurements was fixed at 164
           degrees.
ANALYSIS   Rutherford background was substracted. In the
           calculation of resonance energy the energy loss over
           the oxide layer was taken into account.

FLAG       (1.) Thickness of target was 261 angstroem, areal
           density was (1.2+-0.03)*10**17 at/cm2, energy loss was
           5.3  keV, energy straggling was 1.27 keV.
           (2.) Thickness of target was 177 angstroem, areal
           density was (8.14+-0.31)*10**16, energy loss was 3.6
           keV, energy straggling was 1.02 keV.
           (3.) Thickness of target was 90 angstroem, areal
           density was (4.15+-0.14)*10**16, energy loss was 1.8
           keV, energy straggling was 0.76 keV.
ANALYSIS   Nuclear resonance cross section is averaged over the
           thickness analysed. This averaged cross section was
           measured by comparing the 16O(a,a0)16 yield at the
           resonance energy with that at 2MeV,i.e. for  Rutherford
           backscattering using the standard samples.
