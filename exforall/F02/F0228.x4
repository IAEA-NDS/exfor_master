SAMPLE     Both tungsten - backed and foil boron targets (175+-52
           mu-g/cm2 thick) were made by bombarding a pellet of
           compressed 99% isotopically pure 11B powder with
           electrons from a Varian e-gun.
FACILITY   (VDGT) Neutral 3He beams (0.5MeV) from J-type Van de
           Graaf accelerator were injected into the A.N.U. tandem
           accelerator to provide 3He2+ beams of energies 5-12MeV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2.5 by 2.5 cm cylindrical stilbene crystal
           mounted on a Philips 56AVP photomultiplier tube.
