MONITOR    (6-C-12(P,G)7-N-13,PAR,DA,,,EXP) the efficiency of
           detector system was determined
SAMPLE     The targets used in the TUNL measurements were prepared
           by evaporating 98.05% enriched 11B to provide
           self-supporting foils, thickness of 480+-30 mu-g/cm**2.
           The 11B target used in the BNL measurements (98.6%
           isotopically enriched) was evaporated onto a Ta backing
           and its thickness was 716+-30 mu-g/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Employed a 25.4 * 25.4 cm ,having a plastic
           anticoincidence shield at TUNL measurements.
           The measurements performed at BNL employed a
           23.8x25.4 cm NaI detector (BNL-MARK II).
