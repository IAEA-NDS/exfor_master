METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA) bombarding energy at each foil of stacked
           targets was determined from range energy table
           (BCINT) an individual foil was bombarded and used as
           standard to calculate absolute reaction cross section
           of the stacked foils
           (EXTB) the projectile energy of deuteron 15.7 +- 0.2
           MeV was determined in scattering method
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100. Cm-Cu. Coax1Al Ge(l1) detector
           the absolute detection efficiency of the spectrometer
           was calibrated
           Calibration error is better than 4.% between 60.
           and 3500. keV energy
           The energy resolution fothe system is 2.1 keV for 1332.
           keV gamma-rays
SAMPLE     Natural stacked targets
           Al foil purity better than 99.% and thickness
           6.3 mg/cm-sq.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The following uncertainties have been taken
           into account:
           -determination of the detection efficiency
           -statistics for account and ERR-1 + ERR-2
           (ERR-1) the charge quantities by beam integrator
           (ERR-2) decay during bombardment
