METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA) The incident deuteron energy at each of the
            stacked target foils was determined from the energy
            range table.
           (BCINT) An individual foil was bombarded and used as
            standard to calculate absolute reaction cross section
            of the stacked foils.
           (EXTB) The projectile energy of deuteron 15.7+/-0.2 MeV
            was determined in scattering method.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100 cm3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector.
           The absolute detection efficiency of the spectrometer
            was calibrated.
           Calibration error is better than 4% between 60 and
            3500 keV energy.
           The energy resolution for the system is 2.1 keV for
            1332 keV gamma-rays.
SAMPLE     Natural stacked targets.
            Al foil, purity >99%, thickness 6.3 mg/cm2.
DECAY-DATA (11-NA-24,15.02HR,DG,1368.53,1.)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The following uncertainties have been taken
            into account:
            - determination of the detection efficiency
            - counting statistics and
           (ERR-1) charge quantities by beam integrator (5%)
           (ERR-2) decay during bombardment             (4%)
