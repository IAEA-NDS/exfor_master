METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA) BOMBARDING ENERGY AT EACH FOIL OF STACKED
           TARGETS WAS DETERMINED FROM RANGE ENERGY TABLE
           (BCINT) AN INDIVIDUAL FOIL WAS BOMBARDED AND USED AS
           STANDARD TO CALCULATE ABSOLUTE REACTION CROSS SECTION
           OF THE STACKED FOILS
           (EXTB) THE PROJECTILE ENERGY OF DEUTERON 15.7 +- 0.2
           MEV WAS DETERMINED IN SCATTERING METHOD
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100. CM-CU. COAX1AL GE(L1) DETECTOR
           THE ABSOLUTE DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF THE SPECTROMETER
           WAS CALIBRATED
           CALIBRATION ERROR IS BETTER THAN 4. PERCENT BETWEEN 60.
           AND 3500. KEV ENERGY
           THE ENERGY RESOLUTION FOTHE SYSTEM IS 2.1 KEV FOR 1332.

           -THE CHARGE QUANTITIES BY BEAM INTEGRATOR +- 5. PERCENT
           -DETERMINATION OF THE DETECTION EFFICIENCY
           -DECAY DURING BOMBARDMENT +- 4. PERCENT
