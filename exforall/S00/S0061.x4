           (J,NP/A,834,661c,2010) The same data given
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP)The reactions were measured at the HI-
           13 tandem accelerator at CIAE.
INC-SOURCE The 6He ions were produced via the 2H(7Li, 6He)3He
           reaction. A 37.6MeV  secondary 6He beam was delivered
           and then collimated with a 7-5mm collimator  complex.
SAMPLE     A (CD2)n foil and a carbon foil, both with thickness
           of 1.7mg/cm2, were used as the targets to measure
           the 2H(6He,7Li)n reaction and background.
DETECTOR   (SI)A 300 microns thick multi-ring semiconductor
           detector (MRSD) with center hole and a 300 microns
           thick center silicon detector (CSD).
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)The uncertainties of differential cross-
           sections mainly arose from the statistics and the
           assignment of 7Li kinematics regions.
           (ANG-ERR)The angular error was given by the Monte
           Carlo simulation.
COMMENT    The measured angular distribution includes the
           contributions of the ground and first excited states
           in 7Li populated by the 2H(6He,7Li)n reaction. The
           energy difference of the two states is only 0.48 MeV
           which is less than the energy spread (0.62 MeV) of
           6He beam.
