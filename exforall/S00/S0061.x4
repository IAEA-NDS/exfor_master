            12C(7Li,6He)13N reaction data given
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 tandem accelerator at CIAE
INC-SOURCE The 6He ions were produced via the 2H(7Li, 6He)3He
            reaction.
           A 37.6 MeV secondary 6He beam was delivered and then
            collimated with a 7-5 mm collimator complex.
SAMPLE     A (CD2)n foil and a carbon foil, both with thickness
            of 1.7 mg/cm2, were used as the targets to measure
            the 2H(6He,7Li)n reaction and background.
DETECTOR   (SI) A 300 microns thick multi-ring semiconductor
            detector (MRSD) with center hole and a 300 microns
            thick center silicon detector (CSD).
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of differential cross
            sections is mainly arose from the statistics and the
            assignment of 7Li kinematics regions.
           (ANG-ERR) angular error by the Monte Carlo simulation
COMMENT    The measured angular distribution includes the
            contributions of the ground and first excited states
            in 7Li populated by the 2H(6He,7Li)n reaction.
           The energy difference of the two states is only 0.48
            MeV which is less than the energy spread (0.62 MeV)
            of 6He beam.
