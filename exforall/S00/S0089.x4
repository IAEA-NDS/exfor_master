INC-SOURCE The 3He+ beam was produced and selected by a 90 deg
           bending magnet, and then passed through a rectangular
           aperture, which defined a beam spot area of 2 mm x 5
           mm at normal incidence.
SAMPLE     The deuterium target is a thin layer of amorphous
           deuterated hydrocarbon (a-C:D) deposited on top of
           optically flat Si<111> plate prepared by radio
           frequency discharge from CD4 at Max-Planck-Insitut
           fur Plasmaphysik (IPP Garching). The amount of D was
           determined by nuclear reaction analysis at the
           Garching tandem accelerator. D density of this sample
           is 1.4E18 D/cm2 with a D/C ratio of 0.64 and the
           uncertainty is about 5%.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Au-Si surface barrier detectors
           positioned in the cylindrical experimental chamber
           for detecting projectile protons and Rutherford
           backscattering (RBS) 3He particles, the vacuum in
           chamber was kept in 1.0E-3 Pa. Protons were detected
           at a laboratory angle of 135 deg, the depletion depth
           of the detector is 2000 um for completely stopping
           high energy protons. RBS 3He ions were detected at an
           angle of 153 deg. Both the solid angles of two
           detectors were determined based on the mechanical
           distances. The solid angle of the nuclear reaction
           analysis detector is 8.5E-3 sr with an uncertainty of
           2.7% and the solid angle of the RBS detector is
           5.0E-3 sr with an uncertainty of 2.0%.
METHOD     The samples were mounted in a rotatable octahedral
           copper target and the distances between target center
           and two detectors both were 77.1 mm. In order to
           limit the solid angle and reduce the geometry
           straggling, a parabolic slit with a width of 3 mm and
           height of 17 mm was put in front of the detector. A
           50 um thick mylar foil was also used to prevent
           backscattering 3He and 4He produced by nuclear
           reaction from entering the window. To reduce the
           effect of dead time and pile-up on backscattering
           signal, a 3 mm x 10 mm parabolic slit was mounted
           ahead of the RBS detector.
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH) Rutherford backscattering and nuclear
           reaction signals were registered on two multi-channel
           analyzers simultaneously. A program named SIMNRA was
           used to analyze and simulate recorded spectra. Since
           backscattering of 3He from Si is Rutherford until
           3.875 MeV, incident 3He dose was determined by
           simulating the height of the front edge of Si signal
           in RBS spectrum.
