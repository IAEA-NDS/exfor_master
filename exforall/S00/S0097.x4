FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou (HIRFL).
           (PRJFS,3CPRIMP) The Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL).
INC-SOURCE The 36Ar primary beam was accelerated by HIRFL, the
           beam energy was 69 MeV/u. The radioactive ion beam
           was produced by bombarding the primary target Ni(92.3
           mg/cm2).
SAMPLE     The secondary target was 12C (109.7 mg/cm2).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillation detectors were used
           to measure the time of flight (TOF).
           (SIBAR) DE detector was a Au-Si surface barrier
           semiconductor detector before the target. After the
           target, there were 5 Au-Si surface barrier
           semiconductor detectors, the thickness of 5 detectors
           were 150, 150, 700, 700 and 2000 um, the resolution
           less than 1.8%.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,TRN) The particles were identified by the
           TOF and dE before target. After target, the outgoing
           particles were identified by the dE-E method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
ANALYSIS   The beam energies of 17F, 18F, 19F, 20F and 21F at
           the centre of the 12C target are ranged from 16 to 33
           MeV/u. The measured cross sections were transformed
           into the values at 30 MeV/u by Shen's
           parameterization. The change due to this
           transformation is within 5%.
