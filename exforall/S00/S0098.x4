FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Radioactive Ion Beam Line at the
           Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou(HIRFL-RIBLL).
INC-SOURCE A 29 MeV/nucleon 12Be secondary beam with an
           intensity of about 3E+3 pps and a purity of about 70%
           was produced from a 18O primary beam at 70 MeV/nucleon.
DETECTOR   (PPAC)Two parallel plate avalanche chambers with
           position resolutions of about 1 mm(FWHM) in both the
           X and Y directions of the 12Be beam.
           (TELES,SISD,CSICR)A downstream zero-degree telescope
           consisting of a double-sided silicon strip detector
           and a 4*4 CsI(Tl) scintillator array. The angular
           coverage of the telescope is about 0-12degree. The
           DSSD has a thickness of 300 um and an active area of
           64*64 mm2 with its front and back faces each divided
           into 32 strips. Each CsI(Tl) scintillator unit has a
           size of 2.5*2.5*3.0 cm3 and is backed by a photodiode
           readout.
SAMPLE     A 100 mg/cm2 carbon target
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainty.
