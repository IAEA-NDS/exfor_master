INC-SOURCE He-6 Beam intensity remained at about is 2.5E+5PPS.
SAMPLE     The target had a thickness of 100 micron and tilted at
           45 angle degree with respect to the beam direction
METHOD     (TOF)
FACILITY   (PRJFS,2JPNIPC) 70MeV/u C-13 primary beam used at
                           RIKEN Projectile Fragment Separator
                           (RIPS)
DETECTOR   (PPAC) The total number of incident He-6 ion recorded
            by parallel plate avalanche counter
           (TELES) The reaction products were measured by a set
                   of  six telescope
           (PSSCN)Energy resolution is 2% for Am-241 Alpha
                  particles
           (SIBAR)Energy resolution is 0.5% for Am-241 Alpha
                  particles
           (CSICR) Energy resolution is 8.6% for Am-241 Alpha
                  particles
           (SCIN) identify isotopes with lower energies at larger
                  angle
CORRECTION The total number of incident He-6 ion recorded by
           parallel plate avalanche counter and  corrected by
           efficiency factors.
