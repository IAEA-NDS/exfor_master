FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) Exotic nuclear (EN) beam line in the
            Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka
            University
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 11Be was produced from a primary
            beam of 13C bombarding on a 456 mg/cm2 Be target.
            Beam intensity and purity of 11Be were up to 10000
            particles per second (pps) and 95%, respectively.
SAMPLE     A polythene (CH2)n target with thickness of 4.0+-0.05
            mg/cm2, while a 12.58+-0.10 mg/cm2 thick carbon
            target was employed to subtract the background from
            carbon atoms in the (CH2)n target.
DETECTOR   (PPAC,SCIN) Two parallel plate avalanche counters
            with a tracking efficiency of about 90% were
            installed upstream of a plastic scintillator, to
            provide energy loss and time-of-flight (TOF)
            information to identify the incoming particles.
           (TELES,SISD,SI) The telescope TELE0, to detect 10Be
            from 11Be(p,d)10Be transfer reaction, comprised of a
            double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with
            thickness of 1000 um and two large surface silicon
            detectors (SSDs) with thickness of 1500 um, was
            centered at the beam line with a distance of 200 mm
            away from the target and covered an angular scope of
            0-10 deg in the laboratory frame.
           (TELES,SISD,SI,CSICR) The telescope TELE2, to detect
            d from 11Be(p,d)10Be transfer reaction, was placed
            235 mm away from the target with central angle of 25
            deg relative to the beam line, composed of a
            65-um-thick SSD, a 300-um-thick DSSD, a 1500-um-thick
            SSD and a layer of four CsI(Tl) crystals. Each
            crystal has an active area of 4.0x4.0 cm2 and a
            length of 4.1 cm.
           All the SSDs and DSSDs have an active area of
            62.5x62.5 mm2. The width of each DSSD strip is 2 mm,
            bringing in an angular resolution of less than 0.6 deg
            for the detection of 10Be and deuterons. The energy
            resolution for all the silicon detectors was less
            than 1% for the 5.486 MeV alpha particle.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) To identify the incoming particles.
           (EDE) The Beryllium isotopes from different reaction
            channels were identified based on a basic Delta E-E
            method.
           (COINC) The (p,d) transfer reaction was performed in
            inverse kinematics, in which the projectile-like
            fragments 10Be emitting at forward angles were
            measured in coincidence with the recoil deuterons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic error is less than 10%
           (ERR-1) The detection efficiency determination 5%
           (ERR-2) The (CH2)n target thickness 1%
           (ERR-3) The cuts on the PID spectrum 2%
           (ERR-4) The Q-value spectrum 1%
