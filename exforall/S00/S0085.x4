SAMPLE     The natural Pb target is a self supporting foil with
           a thickness of 4.2 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Two PPACs provided the position and timing of
           the incoming beams with a position resolution of 1
           mm. Each PPAC has 80 gold-plated tungsten wires in
           both X and Y directions and a sensitive area of 80x80
           mm2. The position information was then given by the
           time difference between the signals from both ends.
           The distances of PPAC1 and PPAC2 from the target were
           500 mm and 100 mm, respectively.
           (TELES,SISD,SISD) Two dE-E silicon-detector
           telescopes were used. Each telescope consisted of one
           dE double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with a
           thickness of 150 um and an area of 48x48 mm2, and one
           single silicon detector with a thickness of 1500 um
           and an area of 50x50 mm2. The distances from the
           target center to the center of the DSSDs were 250 and
           120 mm, respectively.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The secondary beam was produced by
           the fragmentation of a 54.2 MeV/nucleon 12C primary
           beam, delivered by the Heavy Ion Research Facility of
           Lanzhou (HIRFL), on a 2615 um Be target. The average
           primary beam intensity during the measurements was
           about 300 enA with a 12C charge state, producing 8B
           and 7Be beams of 500 and 5000 particles per second,
           respectively.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) Two dE-E silicon-detector telescopes,
           covering the polar angles 4- 21 degree and 13-38
           degree in the laboratory frame, respectively, were
           used to measure the energy and angle of elastically
           scattered particles. Secondary beam particle
           identification was made using a combination of the
           measured time of flight (TOF) and the magnetic
           rigidity value.
