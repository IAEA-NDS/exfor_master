FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP) Use Radioactive Ion Beam Line to
           produce secondary unstable nuclear beam.
           (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) And the primary beam were accelerated
           by Heavy Ion Research Facility.
SAMPLE     4.2 mg/cm2 thick enriched 208Pb
METHOD     (TOF) Two fast scintillator detectors were placed at
           the two focal planes of the RIBLL a distance of 17 m.
           (EDE) The scattered particles were detected after the
           secondary target with two silicon-detector dE-E
           telescopes.
INC-SOURCE A 54.2 MeV/A 12C primary beam was delivered to a 2615
           um thick Be primary target to produce secondary beam
           8B. The intensity of secondary beam was a few hundred
           particles per second with a primary beam intensity of
           ~300 enA, while 7Be beam was ~5000 particles per
           second.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two fast scintillator detectors were combined
           with dE detector and the magnetic rigidity setting to
           identify the secondary particles.
           (PPAC) The position and direction of the incident
           particles on the target were determined by two PPAC
           detectors with active area 80*80 mm2 and position
           resolution about 1 mm in both X and Y directions.
           (TELES,SISD,SI) Each telescope consisted of a 150 um
           thick double-sided silicon strip detector with an
           active area of 48x48 mm2 as a dE detector and a 1500
           um thick silicon detector as E detector. The silicon
           strip detectors were perpendicularly segmented into
           48 strips on both sides and the position resolution
           was 1 mm in both the vertical and horizontal
           directions.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical uncertainty is mainly source,
           and have no more information on uncertainty.
