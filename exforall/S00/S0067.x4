            Another measurement of 14-SI-0(7-N-12,NON).
FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP)
           The 14N(7+) primary beam was accelerated by the Heavy
           Ion Research Facility of Lanzhou(HIRFL).
SAMPLE     A silicon detector (1000 um in thickness), which
           serves as a reaction sample and a dE detector.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Two PPACs (100 x 100 mm2 effective area);
           (SCIN) One plastic scintillator with 50 um in
           thickness;
           (SI,CSICR,SIBAR) The telescope detector consists
           of 2 silicon semiconductor detectors and one CsI(Tl)
           stopping detector with 325 um and 10 mm in thickness,
            45x45 mm and 70x70 mm in effective area,
           respectively.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,TRN)
           The same particle upstream and downstream of the
           reaction target can be counted, and the reaction cross
           section is obtained by the transmission method.
INC-SOURCE The typical 14N primary beam intensity was about 20 nA
           on the production target of Be with 3123 um in
           thickness which was installed at the entrance of
           RIBLL. 12N and 12B were produced by the projectile
           fragmentation process.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include systematic errors,
           statistical errors and errors from the way to select
           the outgoing particles.
STATUS     (TABLE)Data were taken from Table 1 at page 454 of
           J,CPC,34,(4),452,2010.
