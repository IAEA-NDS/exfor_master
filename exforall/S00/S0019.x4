TITLE      The measurement of the ratio gamma-F/gamma-n and the
           fission barrier height for p+Bi-209
FACILITY   (LINAC) for protons at the institute of high energy
           physics, beijing.
INC-SOURCE the energy range of protons was 20-35 MeV,
           their energy spread was about 0.6 MeV. The peak
           current of proton beam about 30 mA.
SAMPLE     The sample was made from ultrapure metal bismuth
           powder of 99.9995% Purity by means of vacuum evapo-
           ration. As a result, the content of U and Th of the
           targets were very low and were 2.2(1+-3%)*10-3 Ppm
           and 3.5(1+-10%)*10-3 Ppm, respectively.
