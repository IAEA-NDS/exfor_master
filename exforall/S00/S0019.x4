TITLE      THE MEASUREMENT OF THE RATIO GAMMA-F/GAMMA-N AND THE
           FISSION BARRIER HEIGHT FOR P+BI-209
FACILITY   (LINAC) FOR PROTONS AT THE INSTITUTE OF HIGH ENERGY
           PHYSICS, BEIJING.
INC-SOURCE THE ENERGY RANGE OF PROTONS WAS 20-35 MEV,
           THEIR ENERGY SPREAD WAS ABOUT 0.6 MEV. THE PEAK
           CURRENT OF PROTON BEAM ABOUT 30 MA.
SAMPLE     THE SAMPLE WAS MADE FROM ULTRAPURE METAL BISMUTH
           POWDER OF 99.9995% PURITY BY MEANS OF VACUUM EVAPO-
           RATION. AS A RESULT, THE CONTENT OF U AND TH OF THE
           TARGETS WERE VERY LOW AND WERE 2.2(1+-3%)*10-3 PPM
           AND 3.5(1+-10%)*10-3 PPM, RESPECTIVELY.
