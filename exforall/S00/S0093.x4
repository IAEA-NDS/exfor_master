INC-SOURCE The minimum energy of a single charge ion beam is 700
           keV. The beam intensity was hundreds of nA.
SAMPLE     Be target was 10 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Absolute yield and yield angular distribution
           were measured by BF3 long counter. A set of BF3 long
           counter was located at 20 deg with D beam to monitor
           the deuteron beam stability.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty of BF3 long counter (3%) and
           neutron spectra was 4%
