INC-SOURCE The minimum energy of a single charge ion beam is
            700 keV.
           The beam intensity was hundreds of nA.
SAMPLE     Be target was 10 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Absolute yield and yield angular distribution
            were measured by BF3 long counter.
           A set of BF3 long counter was located at 20 deg with D
            beam to monitor the deuteron beam stability.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) BF3 long counter efficiency (4%)
