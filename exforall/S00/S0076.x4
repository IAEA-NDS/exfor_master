FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP) Experiment was performed at the
           Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou(RIBLL).
           The typical intensity of the 7Be secondary beam was
           5E3 particles per second with a primary beam intensity
           of 300 enA. The secondary beams were identified by
           combining the measured TOF and magnetic rigidity value.
           The radioactive nuclear beams of 7Be, together with
           the contaminants of 9C, 8B and 6Li ions, were produced
           by the fragmentation of a 54.2 MeV/u 12C primary beam
           bombarding a 2615 um thick Be target located at the
           first focal point of RIBLL.
SAMPLE     The target used was a self supporting foil of natural
           Pb with a thickness of 4.2 mg/cm2. The target had the
           following isotopic composition: 208Pb 52.3%,
           207Pb 22.6%, 206Pb 23.6% and 204Pb 1.48%.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Each PPAC consists of two anodes and one
           cathode. The cathode plane in the middle of detector
           is a 2 um thick Mylar foil coated with a thin
           Au-layer on both sides. The two anode planes are
           located symmetrically on both side of the cathode and
           consisted of gold-plated tungsten wires. The wires,
           50 um in diameter, are spaced by 1 mm pitch. There are
           80 wires in both X and Y directions and therefore the
           sensitive area is 80*80 mm2.
           (SCIN) Two 50 mm thick plastic scintillation detectors
           were used to measure TOF.
           (TELES,SISD,SI)The scattered particles were detected
           by SI DeltaE-E telescopes (denoted as DeltaE-E1 and
           DeltaE-E2 in Fig.3). Each telescope consists of one
           double-sided silicon strip DE detector(DSSD) of 150
           mm in thickness and 48*48 mm2 in area, and one single
           silicon detector (SSD) of 1500 mm in thickness and
           50*50 mm2 in area.
           PPAC and scintillation detectors were used for
           detection of incident 7Be, while the TELES were used
           for detection of outgoing particle.
METHOD     (TOF) The secondary beams were identified by combining
                 the measured TOF and magnetic rigidity value.
           (EDE) The scattered particles were identified by EDE
                 telescopes.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainty is due to the scattering
           events on the windows of PPACs and energy dispersion
           of secondary beam.
           (ERR-S) The statistical uncertainties.
           (ANG-ERR) Uncertainty of outgoing angle.

           and provided by author.
