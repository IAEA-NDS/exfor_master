SAMPLE     Self-supporting natural Co target was prepared by the
           electroplate method. Al and C targets were made by
           vacuum evaporation. The thicknesses of targets were
           1-2mg/cm2 for Co and hundrueds of a micro-g/cm2 for
           Al and C.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,3CPRAEP) 1.2m diameter
INC-SPECT  Energy of beam current was 18.0 +- 0.3 MeV
PART-DET   (P) Proton
METHOD     (EDE,BCINT) Direct absolute determination.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SILI) Delta E is Au-Si surface barrier
           detector with 30 micrometers thickness, E is Si-Li
           detector with 5 millimeters thickness.
MONITOR    The currents were measured by Faraday cup.
