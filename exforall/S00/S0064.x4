FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP)
           The 14N(7+) primary beam was accelerated by the Heavy
           Ion Research Facility of Lanzhou(HIRFL).
SAMPLE     An silicon detector (1000 um in thickness), which
           serves as both  the reaction sample and the dE
           detector.
DETECTOR   (PPAC,SI,SCIN)
           Five PPACs (100 x 100 mm2 effective area);
           One plastic scintillator of 50 um in thickness;
           Two silicon detector (1000 um and 300 um in thickness);
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,TRN)
           The same particle upstream and downstream of the
           reaction target can be counted, and the reaction cross
           section will obtained by the transmission method.
INC-SOURCE The typical beam intensity was about 20 nA on the
           production target of Be with 3123 um in thickness
           which was installed at the entrance of RIBLL. 12N
           was produced by the projectile fragmentation process.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error includes the statistical error of
           the present measurement and systematical error from
           the transmission eiffciency.
