SAMPLE     Metallic vanadium foil of high purity was machined into
           the shape of 24 mm in diameter and about 10 mg/cm-2
           in thickness.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 13 Mv tandem, typical beam currents were
           about 400 na.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,STTA) Each stack consisted of between 1
           and 10 vanadium foils and aluminum foils, which serve
           as the energy degraders. An ORTEC model 439 digital
           current integrator was used to determine the beam
           currents.
MONITOR    The currents were monitored by Faraday cup.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ERR-ANALYS The total error in the cross section was estimated by
           combining all the individual error such as
             correction of recoiled particles (2%),
             efficiency of the Ge(li) detector (2%),
             beam current measurements (1.5%),
             weight of the foils (3%),
             absolute activities count (1.5%),
           the total error amounted to about 6%.
STATUS     Data taken from the authors.
