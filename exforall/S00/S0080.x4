FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNIPC)RIKEN Projectile Fragment Separator
            (RIPS) radioactive ion beam Line
METHOD     (COINC) The 1n and 2n transfer events were obtained
           from the coincidence of d+6He and t+4He, respectively.
INC-SOURCE A 115 MeV/nucleon 13C primary beam impinged on a 9Be
           target with a thickness of 12mm. Beam intensity is
           3E5 pps with a purity of 56% for 8He.
DETECTOR   (DRFTC)The beam was tracked by the gas detector BDC1
           and BDC2 placed before the physical target.
           (TELES,SISD,SI,CSICR)Out-going angles were detected
           by the gas detector MDC and silicon strip detector. D
           and T were measured by telescope D11 (Si Strips+SSD
           +CsI A+CsI B) and D12 (Si Strips+ SSD+CsI). 4He and
           6He were recorded by magnetic system and D2 (Si
           Strips+SSD+CsI).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty from the number of
           incident 8He, the number of coincident d(t) with
           6He(4He) and the background subtraction.
           (ERR-SYS) It is mainly resulted from the
           uncertainties of target thickness, selection of
           transfer event and simulation of the solid angle.
