FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Cooling Storage Ring on the Heavy Ion
           Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR).
SAMPLE     A cylindrical lead target with 10 cm diameter and 25
           cm length.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activity of the irradiated Au foils were
           measured by a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector.
           The relative efficiency and energy resolution of the
           detector were 65% and 1.90 keV at 1.33 MeV,
           respectively. The absolute efficiency was calibrated
           with the standard sources 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, and
           152Eu.
           (IOCH) An air ionization chamber was placed in front
           of the target to determine the beam intensity.
METHOD     Water-bath activation-foil method.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation continued for 22 h to obtain
           sufficient beam fluence. The average carbon beam
           intensity was 1.15E7 pps.
           (GSPEC) The activity for each Au foil was determined
           by measuring the peak intensities of the
           characteristic gamma ray with energy of 412 keV from
           198Au.
CORRECTION Gamma self-absorption and neutron self-shielding
           effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors concern the statistical error, the
           coincidence summing effect of gamma transition,
           inaccuracy of efficiency, and systematic errors, such
           as the inaccuracy of the beam intensity and direction.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from text of
