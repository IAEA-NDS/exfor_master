FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem Accelerator
SAMPLE     79.2 mg/cm2 (CH2)n target.
INC-SOURCE The 6He ions were produced via the 2H(7Li,6He)3He
            reaction with a 46 MeV 7Li beam bombarding a
            deuterium gas cell of 1.5 atm pressure.
           The front and rear windows of the gas cell are Havar
            foils with the thickness of 1.9 mg/cm2.
           The intensity of the secondary beam was approximately
            1000 particles/s, and the purity of 6He was better
            than 85%.
DETECTOR   (SI) The 6He secondary beam was identified and
            recorded with a 19.2 um thin ORTEC silicon detector.
           (TELES,SISD,SI) dE-E telescope consists of a 67 um
            double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSSD), and two
            multi-guard silicon quadrant (MSQ) detectors with
            thickness of 1001 um and 982 um. The DSSSD is
            comprised of 16 strips on the front side and 16
            similar orthogonal strips on the back, thus providing
            two-dimension position information in a resolution of
            3 mm*3 mm.
           Both MSQ detectors are 2*2 arrays of independent
            active area, separated by a 0.1 mm wide cross gap.
           dE-E detectors are all 50 mm*50 mm of active area.
           A 14*14 pixel array in the central part of DSSSD was
            used which covers the laboratory angular range from
            0 to 10 degree.
          Angular resolution (2.06 deg) is due to
           - beam spot size (0.3 deg)
           - 6He angular divergence (0.2 deg)
           - 6He angular straggling in DE detector (0.22 deg)
           - 6He angular straggling in (CH2)n target (0.97 deg)
METHOD     (EDE)
           (TTM) Thick-target inverse kinematic (TTIK) method.
           Only (6He,p) reaction at the effective thickness of
            6.6+/-0.5 mg/cm2 (Ecm=4.30+/-0.16 MeV) was used in
            the present analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Mainly from the statistics, and
           (ERR-1) - beam normalization         (3%)
           (ERR-2) - effective target thickness (8%)
