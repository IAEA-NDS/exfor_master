SAMPLE     The first five silicon detectors were serves as both
           the reaction sample and the dE detector.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,TRN)
           The same particle upstream and downstream of the
           reaction target can be counted, and the reaction cross
           section will obtained by the transmission method.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,CSICR) It is consist of 5 Si-Au and 1 CsI
           detector. The thickness of 5 Si-Au detectors are 150,
           150, 150, 2000 and 2000 um. The thickness of CsI is
           10 mm.
           (SCIN) Fast plastic scintilator detectors BC-400 were
           used to confirm the start and stop of TOF.
INC-SOURCE The 13C primary beam was accelerated to 75 MeV/u by
           HIRFL. The typical beam intensity was about 30 nA. It
           is bombarded with 9Be target of 2 mm in thickness,
           which produces secondary beams of 8B and 9C.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Including the statistical uncertainty and
           the uncertainty due to data analysis process in
           distinguish the reaction particles and un-reaction
           particles.
