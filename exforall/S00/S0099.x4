INSTITUTE  (3CPRIMP,3CPRAEP)
REFERENCE  (J,PHE,26,239,2002)
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE 19F(8+) ions, incident energies from 98MeV to 108MeV,
           with 250 keV energy step.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting thin metallic foils of the targets
           have 70 and 71 ug/cm2 in thickness.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,IOCH,PS) Three sets of dE/E telescopes were
           used. the dE detecors were gas ionization chamber, E
           detectors were position sensitive semiconductors. The
           Q3D was used in the angular distribution measurement.
ADD-RES    The reaction time of the dissipative products is
           extracted from the angular distribution.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) statistical uncertainty.
COMMENT    Compilers assume that the Y label of Fig.2 and Fig.3
           is dsigma/dOmega though it printed as dsigma/dOmega/dE.
