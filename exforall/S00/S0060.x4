FACILITY   (CYCLO) To obtain the incident deuteron beam
           at 13.04 MeV. And according to the relation between
           energy and range to obtain the deuteron energy at each
           foils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) To detect the gamma ray of residual nuclei.
           Using Co60 gamma source to do energy calibration
           before each measurements.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Using Faraday cup to collect incident deutron
           charge and measured by a integral electronics.
SAMPLE     There could contain 4 sample foils in target cell and
           exchange sample position. The sample foil was cooling
           by water. Natural Cu, Zn and Cr mixture were obtained
           by electrolysis process, and the thickness of sample
           foil was around 10mg/cm2, and the uncertainty of
           uniformity is around 5%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty of measurement is around
           5%, including the uncertainty of beam current
           measurement, the thickness of sample foil etc.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data were digitized from FIGURE 3~5 of J,ASI,
           22,(2),251,1966 by GDgraph-3.0 software.
