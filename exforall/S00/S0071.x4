FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) The NEC9SDH-2 2x3 MV tandem
           accelerator of Fudan University.
SAMPLE     The tritium-charged Pd/Ti/Al samples were prepared by
           a conventional hydrogenation method, but using an
           apparatus which enables tritium gas to be handled.
           For Ta/TiHEx/Al samples, a new preparation method
           called the magnetron sputtering, and a uniform and
           surprisingly high concentration (1.87E17 atoms/cm2
           He atoms in 5.3E17 atoms/cm2 Ti film)
           helium-titanium target was achieved.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The Au/Si surface barrier detector was placed
           at the appropriate laboratory backscattering angle
           and it subtended a solid angle of 1.12E-3 str by a
           defining slit of 3x4 mm. The angular and energy
           resolution of this detector system is about 1
           degree and about 12 keV, respectively.
MONITOR    (46-PD-0(P,EL)46-PD-0,,DA,,RTH) The elastic scattering
           cross sections can obtained from the calculated proton
           Rutherford scattering cross section and the formula is
           showed as equation (1) in J,NIM/B,268,3373,201008.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T,,7.3) total error associated with the cross
           sections is no larger than 7.3%.
           (ERR-S,2.,3.) The errors of AT and A(pd) result from
           statistical errors and background subtraction
           uncertainties in the T and Pd peak areas
           determination, and they are typically 2-3% in all
           cases less than 4%.
           (ERR-2,,1.) The error in Rutherford scattering cross
           section of Pd is less 1%.
           (ERR-3) The relative uncertainty of angle (1%)
           (ERR-4,,5.) The measuring errors of areal densities
            (Nt)Pd, (Nt)T (under 5%)
           (EN-ERR) The proton beam energy (6 keV)
