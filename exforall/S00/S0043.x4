SAMPLE     The high purity Al metal plate was rolled and machined
           into the shape of 24 mm in diameter and 4~6 mg/(cm2)
           in thickness. The stacks consisted of 6 to 12 pieces
           of Al samples and the energy degraders were also Al
           foils with different thickness.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 mV tandem was used to produce the
           deuteron beams with the energies from 11 to 22 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,STTA) The conventional stacked foil
           technique was used in this measurement. Five stacks of
           Al samples were irradiated in the past two years at
           the incident energies of 16, 19, 20 and 22 MeV,
           respectively. The measured energy range was from 11.5
           to 22 MeV. The beam current was measured with a Faraday
           cup and an ORTEC model 439 current integrator.
MONITOR    The currents were monitored by a Faraday cup.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The measured uncertainty is about 5 %,
                  which include:
           (ERR-1) 1.5 % for the detector efficiency,
           (ERR-2) 1.5 % for the activation determination,
           (ERR-3) 3.0 % for the weight and uniformity of samples,
           (ERR-4) 1.5 % for the absolute integration current of
           incident particle, etc.
