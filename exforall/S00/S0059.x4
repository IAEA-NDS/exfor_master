FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) To detect scattering particle at 0
            deg (T0).
           (TELES,SIBAR,SI,CSICR) To detect scattering particle
            (T1 to T8). Each of them consists of a silicon surface
            barrier detector, a position-sensitive silicon
            detector and an array of 4 CsI(Tl) scintillation
            detectors.
           (PPAC) A parallel-plane avalanche counter (PPAC) was
            used to monitor the beam position.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight
INC-SOURCE A 68.6 MeV/nucleon 18-O primary beam was accelerated
           by HIRFL, the secondary beam of 16C at 47.5
           MeV/nucleon was produced by the projectile
           fragmentation process at a 2.5 mm thick 9Be target
           installed at the entrance of RIBLL. The purity of 16C
           beam was enhanced to about 99% by using a
           wedge-shaped Al degrader.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measurement
           (ERR-SYS,,25.) Systematic errors include following
           contains:
            1)Isotope identification ability of telescopes (<10%);
            2)Inclusion of the tail events into elastic scattering
              process (a few percent);
            3)Exclusion of the strip separation space from the
              detection solid angle in the simulation calculation
              (<10%).
