ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Includes both the statistical and systematic
                   errors (Systematic uncertainties are mainly
                   caused by the errors in the correction
                   procedure)
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty (about 0.8%)

           Datum at 650 MeV obtained in this reference is plotted
           with present data.
