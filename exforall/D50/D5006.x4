DETECTOR   (HPGE)Spectrometer of the GG coincidences with two Ge
           detectors with efficiencies of the registration in 40
           and 30% as compared to NaJ(Tl)detector with size
           values 3" x 3"and energy resolution 2 keV for Co-60
           gamma rays.Detectors were placed under the angle of
           100 degrees from one to other.
FACILITY   (VDGT,4UKRIJD)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
SAMPLE     Target from natural In(In115-96%) with thickness
           from 30 to 40 mkm
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) An error is mainly conditioned with "thick"
           targets used in measurements.

FLAG       (1.)Data were taken only from the spectrum of gg
               coincidences.
           (2.)Data were taken from a single g spectrum only.
           (3.)Data were taken both from the spectrum of gg
               coincidences and single g spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS  Accuracy for data (1.) about 10-15%
            Accuracy for data (2.) and (3.) less than 5-7%.
