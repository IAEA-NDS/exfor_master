TITLE      A Study of the 22Ne(p,gamma)23Na Reaction in the Energy
           Region Ep = 1.1 to 2.0 MeV

           accelerators. The energy spread in the beams was of the
           order of 1 keV.
SAMPLE     For absolute resonance stregth measurements:
           The Ne tagets were prepared by driving 3 keV 22Ne ions
           into tantalum backings.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) An 80 cm**3 Ge(Li) at a distance of 1 to 5 cm
           from the target , at an angle of 55 degree wich respect
           to the proton beam was used to detect the gamma-rays.
           The detector resolution was 2.6 keV at 1.33 MeV and 10
           keV at 10 MeV.
           (NAICR)The excitation curve of the reaction was
           measured using a cylindrical 10x10 cm NaI detector set
           at an angle of 55 degree wich respect to the proton
           beam and at a distance of 4 cm from the target.
ANALYSIS   In REACTIONs FCT=1/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1),
           where is Jp = spin of incident projectile and
           Jt = spin of target nucleus.
           In the formula of resonance strength:
                     g*Gamma(i)Gamma(j)/Gamma(tot)
           instead of usual statistical weight:
             g=(2J+1)/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1), the authors used g=(2J+1)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error of 25% on the strengths is due to
           1) uncertainties in the areas of the resonance peaks,
           2) the relative efficiency of the NaI detector,
           3) the strength of the Ep=1280 keV resonance.
