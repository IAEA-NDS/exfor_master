           deuterons with energy of 37 MeV

REFERENCE  (C,2010KYIV,,239,2010)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4UKRIJD)Isochronous cyclotron U-240
SAMPLE     238U target with thickness of 200 mkg/cm2
DETECTOR   (GE)Registration and identification of gamma spectra of
           radioactive fission products was carried out on
           spectrometric complex SEG-50P. The energy resolution of
           the detector for the full width at half of maximum was
           2.8 keV for 1332 keV 60Co line. Calibration of the
           detector and the energy efficiency of detecting gamma
           rays in the energy range 50-1500 keV were carried out
           using a standard 152Eu source.
           (TFBC)CH4 foil-collector with thickness of 0.15 mm to
           collect fission fragments in a solid angle up to 2pi.
ERR-ANALYS No information
METHOD     (GSPEC,REC)To measure the yields of fission products
           was used identification of the fragments in energy
           gamma-rays of the radionuclides including of their
           half-life, half-lives of their predecessors in the
           isobaric chain, and the accumulation time of the
           fragments in the foil-collectors and the cooling
           time-exposure.
MONITOR    Faraday's cup located on the output of the reaction
           was used for beam monitoring.
