SAMPLE     The target was prepared by knocking in aluminum
           ions into a tantalum substrate directly in the
           electromagnetic separator. The target used has a
           thichess of 20 micro-g in cm2.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) One germanium- lithium detector is  used with
           an active volume of  60 cm**3 and a resolution of 4.0
           keV at Eg=1.33 MeV. The detector was located at a
           distance of 5 cm from target at an angle of 55 degrees.
           (NAICR)  NaI(Tl) detector was used for  excitation
           function measurements  and  as monitor of gamma
           radiation. The dimensions of the crystal  was
           diameter 15 x 10 cm. The detector was located at a
           distance of 5 cm from target at an angle of 55 degrees
           with respect to he proton beam.
