SAMPLE     The 36S target consisting of Ag2S(81.1% 36S) was
           deposited on tantalum backing. The 36S target thickness
           is 20 micro-g/cm-2.
DETECTOR   (GELI) One germanium- lithium detector is  used with
           an active volume of  60 cm**3 and a resolution of 4.0
           keV at Eg=1.33 MeV.The gamma-rays were detected  at
           angle of 55 degrees concerning proton beam direction.
           (NAICR)  NaI(Tl) detector was used for  excitation
           function measurements. To avoid errors,connected with
           anisotropy of gamma-quantum angle distribution, gamma-
           spectra of resonances were carried out at angle of 55
           degrees. The dimensions of the crystal  was diameter
           150 x 100 mm.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
COMMENT    The resonance strengthes were determined in comparison
           with intensity of gamma-line Eg=7118 keV, which
           corresponds to a transition from resonance level at
           Ep=1887keV onto state 3104 keV. The strength and decay
           scheme of this level is well known from
           P.M.Endt,J,NP/A,521,1,1990.
ANALYSIS   In REACTIONs FCT=1/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1),
           where is Jp = spin of incident projectile and
           Jt = spin of target nucleus.
           In the formula of resonance strength:
                     g*Gamma(i)Gamma(j)/Gamma(tot)
           instead of usual statistical weight:
             g=(2J+1)/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1), the authors used g=(2J+1)
