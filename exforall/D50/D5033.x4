FACILITY   (VDG,2SF HLS)2.5MV Van de Graaff accelerator. Proton
           currents near 4 micro-A with a beam energy resolution
           of  about 600 eV.
SAMPLE     Si targets were prepared in the isotope separator. A
           set of three targets was made by collecting 1 keV
           28Si+,29Si+and 30Si+ions in amounts of 0.6 micro-g/cm2
           on 0.4 mm thick tantalum backing.The target thicknesses
           were 4.6 micro-g/cm2, which corresponds to the
           thickness of 810 keV probed by 1 MeV protons. The
           accuracy of the thickness determination is 1%.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) The 110 cm**3 germanium-lithium detector with
           an energy resolution of 1.9 keV at Eg=1.33 MeV and 2.9
           keV at Eg=2.6 MeV and with an efficiency of 21.8% was
           used for gamma detection. The absolute efficiency of
           the detector was determined in with the calibrated IAEA
           standard sources and using gamma-rays  from reaction
           27Al(p,gamma)28Si at Ep=992 keV.
           (SIBAR)An annular silicon surface barrier detector with
           an active area of 50 mm2 was used for the Ne-C ratios
           of the targets using backscattering of alpha-particles.
           It was located at a distance of 8 cm from the target
           giving a mean scattering angle of 178 degrees. Its
           resolution was 14 keV at Ealpha=2.0 MeV.
           (GELI) The 66 cm**3 germanium-lithium detector placed
           at a fixed position at a distance of 10 cm from the
           target is  used for the angular distribution
           measurements at angles 0, 30, 45, 60, 90 degrees.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for:
           oxygen contamination - upper limit 1 at.% to Si atoms
           eccentricity and absorption -less than 2%.
ANALYSIS   In REACTIONs FCT=1/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1),
           where is Jp = spin of incident projectile and
           Jt = spin of target nucleus.
           In the formula of resonance strength:
                     g*Gamma(i)Gamma(j)/Gamma(tot)
           instead of usual statistical weight:
             g=(2J+1)/(2Jp+1)(2Jt+1), the authors used g=(2J+1)
