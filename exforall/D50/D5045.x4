METHOD     (SITA,EXTB)
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR) The spectra of gamma rays corresponding to
           primary transitions were measured by a pair
           spectrometer arranged at an angle of 55 degrees to the
           proton-beam direction. The yields of gamma rays
           corresponding to direct transitions to the ground
           states of 57Co and 59Co were also measured with the aid
           of a NaI(Tl) detector of dimensions 200x200 mm2.
SAMPLE     Targets were manufactured by electrolytically
           precipitating,onto a gold substrate, 56Fe (enrichment
           was 99.9%) in order to obtain 849 mg/cm2-and
           1.729 mg/cm2-thick samples or 58Fe (enrichment was
           90.7%) in order to obtain 849 mg/cm2 -thick samples.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Compared with the results of calculations that
           rely on the statistical approach and which take into
           account the temperature of the nucleus and its shell
           structure.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Any additional information is absent.
