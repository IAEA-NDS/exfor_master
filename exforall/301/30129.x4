TITLE      Neutron activation resonance integrals of Se-74,Se-78,
           Se-80,Br-81,I-127,Te-130,Ba-138,Ce-140 and Ce-142
EXP-YEAR   (1968)
FACILITY   (REAC,3ARGCNE) RA-1
INC-SOURCE (REAC)Central reflector and thermal column of react.RA1
           Flux in the reflector position was 2x10e12 n/cm2xs and
           in the thermal column 10e+11 n/cm2xs
SAMPLE     Solution containing standard and unknown in the desired
           proportions. Aliquots of 0.1 Ml were dried on small
           pieces of filter paper and sealed into plastic bags.
           Total diameter less than 1cm.
METHOD     Pairs of samples containing the same proportions of
           unknown element and standard, in order to give approxi-
           mately equal unknown and standard gamma-ray intensities
           in the gamma-ray spectrum, were irradiated bare and Cd
           covered(cadmium ratio method) or in two neutron spectra
           with widely different resonance neutron fractions (two
           spectrum method).The gamma-ray spectra of the two
           samples were then measured and the relative number of
           counts in the photopeaks calculated. Both methods give
           the relative ratio of resonance-to-thermal capture
           for unknown and standard. Only ratios of ratios were
           measured, except for measurement of the cadmium ratio
           to gold, to obtain epithermal spectral index of the
           neutron spectra. Measurements were made only on
           well-resolved and well separated peaks.
DETECTOR   (GELI)Encapsulated Li-Ge diode with an effective volume
           of 5 cm3 and a resolution of 2.5 keV FWHM  for the
           Gd-153 gamma rays at 96.7 and 103.4 keV.
ANALYSIS   Parameter measured was S0,equal to 2/sqrt(pi) times the
           ratio of the reduced resonance integral to the thermal
           absorption cross section. The S0 values were obtained
           through the cadmium ratios.
           Unknown cross sections assumed to be 1/v below cadmium
           cutoff. Transmission of cadmium for resonance neutrons
           calculated with the infinite slab approximation, using
           the absorption cross section as a transmission cross
           section
MONITOR    All S0 values were determined relative to gold, with an
           assumed value S0(Au)=17.7. For activities with shorter
           half-lives In-115 was used as a secondary standard with
           a value S0(In-115)=18.7+-0.1,which was determined by
           using gold as standard. Resonance-integral value
           deduced from ratio of resonance-to-thermal capture
           by multiplying by the thermal absorption cross section
           taken from Hughes and Schwarz (BNL-325,2Nd ed. 1958)
