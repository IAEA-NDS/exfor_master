TITLE      Cross-section of Na-23(n,gamma)Na-24m reaction for
           fast neutrons
FACILITY   (CYCLO) Cyclotron
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)   Pulsed proton beam (width 10 ms, repetition
           time 1 s) on Li-7 target
METHOD     Pulsed neutrons on a NaI(Tl) detector used as
           sample and shielded against the 477 keV gamma line from
           the decay of Be-7 by a copper absorber.
           (ACTIV) Activation method
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal spectrometer (diameter=40 mm,
           length=50 mm). The photopeak efficiency was evaluated
           to be 0.32+-0.06 For the 472 keV gammas.
MONITOR    The neutron flux was determined by measuring the 477keV
           gamma activity induced in Be-7 by Li-7(p,n)Be-7 taking
           into account the angular distribution of the neutrons.
           No numerical value was given

           proof-copy was sent to author (1973/09)
CORRECTION Correction was performed for background arising from
           scattered neutrons. The influence of the Cu absorber
           was taken into account.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) most of the error is due to uncertainty in
           the correction and in the detector S efficiency
