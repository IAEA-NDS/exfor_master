TITLE       CROSS-SECTION OF NA-23(N,GAMMA)NA-24M REACTION FOR
           FAST NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (CYCLO) CYCLOTRON
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)   PULSED PROTON BEAM (WIDTH 10 MS, REPETITION
           TIME 1 S) ON LI-7 TARGET
METHOD     PULSED NEUTRONS ON A NAI(TL) DETECTOR USED AS
           SAMPLE AND SHIELDED AGAINST THE 477 KEV GAMMA LINE FROM
           THE DECAY OF BE-7 BY A COPPER ABSORBER.
           (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NAI(TL) CRYSTAL SPECTROMETER (DIAMETER=40 MM,
           LENGTH=50 MM). THE PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY WAS EVALUATED
           TO BE 0.32+-0.06 FOR THE 472 KEV GAMMAS.
MONITOR    THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE 477KEV
           GAMMA ACTIVITY INDUCED IN BE-7 BY LI-7(P,N)BE-7 TAKING
           INTO ACCOUNT THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEUTRONS.
           NO NUMERICAL VALUE WAS GIVEN

HISTORY    (720817C) CA.
CORRECTION CORRECTION WAS PERFORMED FOR BACKGROUND ARISING FROM
           SCATTERED NEUTRONS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE CU ABSORBER
           WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) MOST OF THE ERROR IS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN
           THE CORRECTION AND IN THE DETECTOR S EFFICIENCY
