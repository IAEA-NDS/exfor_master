           14.7 - 16.9 MEV NEUTRONS
INC-SOURCE   (D-T)
SAMPLE     NATURAL BORON TARGET
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           TARGET WAS IRRADIATED FOR 100 SEC.DURING THE
           IRRADIATION THE FLUX VARIATION WAS LOWER THAN 2 PERCENT
           THE MEASUREMENTS OF ACTIVITY STARTED 11 SEC AFTER THE
           END OF IRRADIATION.
