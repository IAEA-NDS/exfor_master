TITLE      TOTAL CROSS-SECTION OF RB AND CS FOR 14 MEV NEUTRONS
FACILITY   NEUTRON GENERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T)   T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION
METHOD             TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS IN  GOOD GEOMETRY
DETECTOR   (SCIN) ANTHRACENE CRYSTALS (1.2 CM LONG, 3.8 CM IN
           DIAMETER) WERE USED AS DETECTOR AND MONITOR PERFORMING
           PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAMMA-RAY BACKGROUND
           TRITIUM TARGET-DETECTOR DISTANCE = 60 CM, THE SAMPLE
           WAS PLACED MIDWAY BETWEEN THEM.
PART-DET   (N) NEUTRONS
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY ANGELI (72/10/24)
