TITLE      Total cross-section of Rb and Cs for 14 MeV neutrons
FACILITY   Neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)   T(d,n)He-4 reaction
METHOD     (TRN)  Transmission measurements in  good geometry
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Anthracene crystals (1.2 cm long, 3.8 cm in
           diameter) were used as detector and monitor performing
           pulse-shape discrimination against gamma-ray background
           Tritium target-detector distance = 60 cm, the sample
           was placed midway between them.
PART-DET   (N) neutrons
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by Angeli (1972/10/24)
HISTORY    (19720721C) CA.

CORRECTION The detected neutron intensity was corrected =
            .For background due to scattered neutrons, by
             amplitude discrimination
            .For in-scattering using =
                SigEl(0 deg)/SigTot  = 1.00+-0.30 1/ster for Cs
                SigEl(0 deg)/SigTot  = 0.70+-0.17 1/ster for Cl
                SigEl(0 deg)/SigTot  = 0.75+-0.20 1/ster for Rb
              where SigEl(0 deg) is the differential elastic
              scattering cross-section at 0 degree and SigTot the
              total cross-section.
            .For total cross-section of Cl whose value was taken
             from Howerton's  tabulated neutron cross-sections
             0.001-14.5 MeV  (1958)and yielded 1.99+-0.04 barn.

           but also contributions from uncertainties in sample
