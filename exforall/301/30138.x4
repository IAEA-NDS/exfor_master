FACILITY   (VDG) VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(D,N)ALPHA REACTION
METHOD     (ACTIV)THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTIONS WERE EVALUATED FROM
           THE GAMMA-ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) SCINTILLATION SPECTROMETER
ANALYSIS   THE REACTION FINAL PRODUCTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY
           THEIR CHARACTERISTIC GAMMA-RAY TRANSITIONS AND THE
           LEAST SQUARE ANALYSIS OF THEIR DECAY CURVES

           REACTION ON DEUTERONS GATHERED IN THE TRITIUM TARGET
           DURING THE DEUTERON BOMBARDMENT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
