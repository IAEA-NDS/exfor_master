TITLE       (n,2n) cross section measurements for 14.5 MeV
           neutrons
INC-SOURCE (D-T) No information on neutron energy. Compiler
           assumes this value to be 14.5 MeV
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidences between the 2 neutrons and the
           alpha particle
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  2 plast. scint. 50mm by 230mm for the neutrons.
           1 plast. scint. 50mm by 0.1Mm for the recoil alpha
PART-DET   (N,A) neutrons and alphas
STATUS     (TABLE) Data as taken from NP 49
HISTORY    (19711014C)
           (20080208A) BIB section updated
CORRECTION Corrections for random coincidences,for systematic
           coincidences. Correction for double scattering useless
ERR-ANALYS Error estimated from the deviation of the mean.
           This error includes the uncertainty in detector
           efficiency

REACTION   (82-PB-0(N,2N),CN,SIG)
            The measured cross section is
           considered as the upper limit of the uncorrelated
           events (i.e. via compound nucleus)
SAMPLE     Various sizes were used
