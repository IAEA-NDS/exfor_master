TITLE       (N,2N) CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENTS FOR 14.5 MEV
           NEUTRONS
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NO INFORMATION NEUTRON ENERGY. COMPILER ASSUMES
           THIS VALUE TO BE 14.5 MEV
METHOD     (COINC) COINCIDENCES BETWEEN THE 2 NEUTRONS AND THE
           ALPHA PARTICLE
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  2 PLAST. SCINT. 50MM BY 230MM FOR THE NEUTRONS
           1 PLAST. SCINT. 50MM BY 0.1MM FOR THE RECOIL ALPHA
PART-DET   (N,A) NEUTRONS AND ALPHAS
STATUS            DATA AS TAKEN FROM NP 49
HISTORY    (711014C)
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS FOR RANDOM COINCIDENCES,FOR SYSTEMATIC
           COINCIDENCES. CORRECTION FOR DOUBLE SCATTERING USELESS
ERR-ANALYS ERROR ESTIMATED FROM THE DEVIATION OF THE MEAN.
           THIS ERROR INCLUDES THE UNCERTAINTY IN DETECTOR
