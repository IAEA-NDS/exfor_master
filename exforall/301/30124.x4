TITLE      INELASTIC SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS TO THE 59 KEV LEVEL
           OF I-127
FACILITY   (VDG)   5.5 MV PULSED VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)   LI-7(P,N)BE-7 REACTION, NEUTRON ENERGY
           CALCULATED FROM PROTON ENERGY ASSUMING Q = -1.6433 MEV
SAMPLE         NA-I CRYSTAL, 3.8 CM DIAM. AND 0.16 CM THICK
METHOD     (TOF)    PULSED-BEAM TIME OF FLIGHT TECHNIQUE WAS USED
           TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BACKGROUND, PARTICULARLY GAMMA
           RAYS ORIGINATING IN THE LI TARGET. 33 CM FLIGHT PATH
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  NA-I CRYSTAL
           (LONGC)  A LONG COUNTER AND A LI-6 LOADED GLASS
           SCINTILLATOR USED AS NEUTRON MONITORS
           THE TWO SCINTILLATORS WERE PLACED SYMMETRICALLY AT
           10 DEG ABOUT THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION (0 DEG).
           THE LONG COUNTER PLACED AT 0 DEG AT 1 METER DISTANCE
           A 2.2 MM THICK LEAD SHEET WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE TARGET
           AND THE SCINTILLATORS.

             VALUES FROM BNL-325 (1958)
PART-DET   (G,N)  GAMMAS, NEUTRONS,  TIME RESOLUTION 10 NS (FWHM)

HISTORY    (721204T)  CONVERSION OF DASTAR-1023
CORRECTION FOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEUTRON RADIATIVE CAPTURE
           EVENTS TO THE NEUTRON PEAK RECORDED BY THE NA-I
           DETECTOR. CORRECTION ABOUT 25 PERC FOR 70 KEV NEUTRONS,
           10 PERC FOR 90 KEV NEUTRONS AND LESS THAN 5 PERC FOR
           NEUTRONS OF ENERGY EXCEEDING 120 KEV.
           CORRECTION FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN LI-GLASS.

COMMENT    THE CROSS SECTION BELOW 203 KEV CORRESPONDS
           UNAMBIGUOUSLY TO THE CROSS SECTION FOR INELASTIC
           NEUTRON SCATTERING TO THE 59 KEV LEVEL. THE CROSS
           SECTION ABOVE 203 KEV MAY BE PARTLY DUE TO INELASTIC
           SCATTERING TO THE 203 KEV LEVEL WITH DE-EXCITATION
           BY CASCADE THROUGH THE 59 KEV LEVEL. HOWEVER THE
           BRANCHING PROBABILITY FOR TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE
           203 KEV AND 59 KEV LEVELS IS ONLY 7.5 PERCENT.
           THE 375 KEV LEVEL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE SPIN 1/2 AND IS
           UNLIKELY TO DECAY VIA THE 59 KEV LEVEL (J = 7/2).
           THE CROSS-SECTION DATA OBTAINED AT NEUTRON ENERGIES UP
           TO AT LEAST 417 KEV ARE THEREFORE EXPECTED TO BE THOSE
           FOR INELASTIC SCATTERING TO THE 59 KEV LEVEL.
