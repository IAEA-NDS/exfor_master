EXP-YEAR   (72)
INC-SOURCE (D-D)   D(D,N)HE-3 REACTION
METHOD     TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENT. A SECOND SAMPLE IS USED TO
           DETERMINE DEVIATIONS FROM AN EXPONENTIAL ABSORPTION
           WHICH ARE DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS OF THE EXCITATION
           FUNCTION OVER THE NEUTRON ENERGY RESOLUTION
DETECTOR   (SCIN) THRESHOLD SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH (N,GAMMA)
           DISCRIMINATION
STATUS     DATA FROM ZFK-243(1972)30.
           (APRVD) APPROVED BY SEIDEL (11 FEB 74)
HISTORY    (730924C) CA.
           (740716U) CA.  - STATUS 'APRVD' ADDED
                          - ERROR-ANALYSIS ADDED
CORRECTION MEASUREMENTS WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND, SIMPLE AND
           MULTIPLE IN-SCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERROR OF ABOUT 2.5 PER-CENT IS THE SUM
            OF THE STATISTICAL ERROR FROM EFFECT AS WELL AS
            BACKGROUND MEASUREMENT (2.1 PER-CENT) AND OF THE
            UNCERTAINTY OF THE IN-SCATTERING CORRECTION (0.4 PER-
            CENT)
