TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF ISOMERIC CROSS-SECTION RATIO FOR THE
           CE-133(N,G) REACTION WITH THERMAL NEUTRONS
REACTION   ((55-CS-133(N,G)55-CS-134-M,,SIG,,SPA)/
           (55-CS-133(N,G)55-CS-134-G,,SIG,,SPA))
FACILITY   (REAC) REACTOR
INC-SPECT  NEUTRONS FROM THE THERMAL REACTOR
SAMPLE     SALT-   0.25 GRAM OF SPECTROSCOPIC PURE CSCL
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.5CM*7.5CM NAI(TL)PHOSPHOR + EMI 6711 TYPE,
           10 CM CATHODE DIAMETER MULTIPLIER. THE DETECTOR IS
           PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF A 1X1X1 M LEAD HOUSE WITH 10 CM
           THICK WALLS.
           55-CS-134-M1 RESIDUAL NUCLEUS LEFT IN ITS 137 KEV
           ISOMERIC STATE WHOSE HALF-LIFE IS 2.895+-0.005 HOURS.
ANALYSIS   THE FOLLOWING INTERNAL CONVERSION COEFFICIENTS OF THE
           127 KEV GAMMA LINE (FROM ISOMERIC STATE) WERE USED=
            .ALPHA(K) = 2.6+-0.04 (KEISCH,J.INORG.NUCL.CHEM.17,183
                                                             1961)
            .RELATIVE INTENSITY OF PARTIAL CONVERSION COEFFICIENTS
               K/L/M = 23/34/6 (CALDWELL,PHYS.REV.78,407(1950))
           THE 797 KEV AND 802 KEV GAMMA TRANSITIONS OF BA-134
           WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE GROUND STATE ACTIVITY OF
           CS-134. THEY WERE FOUND TO REPRESENT RESPECTIVELY
           72.5 AND 10.5 PER CENT OF THIS ACTIVITY. ACCORDING TO
           KEISTER (PHYS.REV.97,451(1955)), ALPHA(K) IS LESS THAN
           0.003 FOR BOTH TRANSITIONS, THUS NEGLIGIBLE FOR THE
           EXPERIMENT ACCURACY.
