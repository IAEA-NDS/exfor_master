TITLE      Measurement of isomeric cross-section ratio for the
           Ce-133(n,g) reaction with thermal neutrons
FACILITY   (REAC) reactor
INC-SPECT  Neutrons from the thermal reactor
SAMPLE     Salt-   0.25 gram of spectroscopic pure CsCl
METHOD     (ACTIV) activation method
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.5cm*7.5cm NaI(Tl)phosphor + EMI 6711 type,
           10 cm cathode diameter multiplier. The detector is
           placed in the middle of a 1x1x1 m lead house with 10 cm
           thick walls.
           55-Cs-134-M1 residual nucleus left in its 137 keV
           isomeric state whose half-life is 2.895+-0.005 Hours.
ANALYSIS   The following internal conversion coefficients of the
           127 keV gamma line (from isomeric state) were used:
            .Alpha(K) = 2.6+-0.04 (Keisch,J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem.17,
                                                         183,1961)
            .Relative intensity of partial conversion coefficients
               K/l/m = 23/34/6 (Caldwell,Phys.Rev.78,407(1950))
           The 797 keV and 802 keV gamma transitions of Ba-134
           were used to determine the ground state activity of
           Cs-134. They were found to represent respectively
           72.5 and 10.5% of this activity. According to
           Keister (Phys.Rev.97,451(1955)), Alpha(K) is less than
           0.003 for both transitions, thus negligible for the
           experiment accuracy.
