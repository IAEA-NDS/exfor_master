MONITOR    RATIOS OF REDUCED CAPTURE RESONANCE INTEGRAL TO THERMAL
           CROSS SECTION DETERMINED RELATIVE TO GOLD,WITH A GOLD-
           CADMIUM RATIO OF 1.674+-0.003 AND A VALUE OF THE RATIO

METHOD     THE CADMIUM RATIO TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE
           THE RATIO OF THE REDUCED RESONANCE INTEGRAL,I,TO THE
           THERMAL CAPTURE CROSS SECTION.
DETECTOR   LI-DRIFTED GE GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETER
ANALYSIS   THE INFINITE-DILUTION RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS OBTAINED
           BY EXTRAPOLATING THE EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF IXG(R) TO
           ZERO THICKNESS USING THE CALCULATED RESONANCE SELF-
           SHIELDING CORRECTION FACTOR, G(R),AS A PARAMETER
CORRECTION SELF-SHIELDING CORRECTION,G(R),WAS CALCULATED FOR EVERY
           RESONANCE USING THE PARAMETERS OF MALETZKI ET AL.(ENERG
           AT 24 80 1968) AND THE NARROW RESONANCE APPROXIMATION.
           EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF RESONANCE SELF-SHIELDING
           WAS MADE BY MEASURING THE CADMIUM RATIO FOR TWO
           DIFFERENT SAMPLE THICKNESSES
ERR-ANALYS SYSTEMATIC ERROR ONE PER-CENT IN THE CASE WHERE
           THERE IS SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN CALCULATED AND
           EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF SELF-SHIELDING.

           VALUE TAKEN FROM GOLDBERG ET AL. (BNL-325 2ND ED.
           SUPPL. 2. 1966)
METHOD     THE 190 KEV GAMMA RAY OF GE-75 (82 MIN) WAS MEASURED
           ABOUT 1 HOUR AFTER IRRADIATION TO ALLOW FOR DECAYING
           THE 48 SEC ISOMER.
COMMENT    THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL VALUE IS ABOUT THREE TIMES
           LARGER THAN THE CALCULATED ONE. IF ONE ASSUMES THAT
           THIS DISCREPANCY IS DUE TO A NONSHIELDED CONTRIBUTION
           TO THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL A BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE
           EXPERIMENTAL VALUE IS OBTAINED.
           ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE INFLUENCE OF S-,P- AND D-WAVE
           NEUTRON RESONANCES ON THE CALCULATED RESONANCE INTEGRAL
           VALUE.
