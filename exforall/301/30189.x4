SAMPLE     Foils of metallic germanium 406 millig/cm2 thick and
           thin foils of 25 millig/cm2 or 40 millig/cm2 of
           germanium oxide deposited in plastic paper
MONITOR    Ratios of reduced capture resonance integral to thermal
           cross section determined relative to gold,with a gold-
           cadmium ratio of 1.674+-0.003 and a value of the ratio
           of resonance integral to thermal cross section of gold
           of 15.69
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE Central graphite reflector of reactor RA-1
METHOD     The cadmium ratio technique was applied to determine
           the ratio of the reduced resonance integral (I),to the
           thermal capture cross section.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Li-drifted Ge gamma ray spectrometer
ANALYSIS   The infinite-dilution resonance integral was obtained
           by extrapolating the experimental values of IXG(R) to
           zero thickness using the calculated resonance self-
           shielding correction factor, G(R),as a parameter
CORRECTION Self-shielding correction,G(R),was calculated for every
           resonance using the parameters of Maletzki et al.(Energ
           AT 24 80 1968) and the narrow resonance approximation.
           Experimental determination of resonance self-shielding
           was made by measuring the cadmium ratio for two
           different sample thicknesses
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic error 1% in the case where
           there is serious disagreement between calculated and
           experimental values of self-shielding.

MONITOR   2(32-GE-74(N,G)32-GE-75,,SIG) At energy Eo=0.025 eV
           value taken from Goldberg et al. (BNL-325 2nd ed.
           suppl. 2. 1966)
METHOD     The 190 keV gamma ray of Ge-75 (82 min) was measured
           about 1 hour after irradiation to allow for decaying
           the 48 sec isomer.
COMMENT    The resonance integral value is about three times
           larger than the calculated one. If one assumes that
           this discrepancy is due to a nonshielded contribution
           to the resonance integral a better agreement with the
           experimental value is obtained.
           Analysis is made of the influence of s-,p- and d-wave
           neutron resonances on the calculated resonance integral
           value.

           value obtained from the thermal cross-section for the
           isomeric state of Ge-77-ms(54sec) recommended by
           Goldberg et al. BNL-324 2nd ed. Suppl. 2. 1966 and the
           thermal isomeric yield ratio of Mannhart and Vonach,
            Z. Phys. 210 13 1968
METHOD     Since the metastable isomer Ge-77-ms (54 sec) produced
           by neutron capture decays partially (24%) to the
           ground state Ge-77 and 76% of it to  As-77,the
           cadmium ratio was deduced from the activities of these
           two isotopes,by measuring the 210,215,and 263 keV
           photopeaks of Ge-77 (11.3 H) and the 239 keV gamma ray
           of As-77 (38.7 H)
COMMENT    Calculated and experimental values disagree seriously.
