TITLE      Observation and cross-section of the reaction
           Zn-64(n,t)Cu-62
FACILITY   (CCW)  300 keV neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) H-3(d,n)He-4 reaction
SAMPLE     Natural zinc acetate in 12% aqueous solution in
           polyethylene container,inside coated with paraffin
METHOD     (ACTIV) activation, rapid radiochemical separation of
           Cu from Zn was followed by gamma coincidence counting
           of the 0.51MeV gammas produced by positron annihilation
DETECTOR   (NAICR) two NaI(Tl) scintillation crystals (5x3 cm) in
           coincidence, Cu foils were used as n-flux monitors
STATUS     (TABLE)Data taken from Acta Phys Hung 24, 199, 196802
           (APRVD) approved by Peto (5/9/1972)
