FACILITY   (REAC) RA-1
SAMPLE     Solution containing standard and unknown in the desired
           proportions.Aliquots of 0.1 ml were dried on small
           pieces of filter paper and sealed into plastic bags.
           Total diameter less than 1cm.
MONITOR    All S0 values were determined relative to S0=17.7 for
           gold,but for activities with half-lives of about an
           hour or less In-115 was used as a secondary standard
           with S0=18.7+-0.1 determined relative to gold.
           For activities with half-lives longer than 10 days the
           isotopes Zn-64 and Se-74 were selected as secondary
           standard,which by neutron capture produce Zn-65(245 d)
           and Se-75 (120 days). Cadmium ratios of Se-74 and Zn-64
           measured relative to gold
INC-SOURCE (REAC)Central reflector and thermal column of react.RA1
           Flux in the reflector position was 2x10**12 n/cm2xs
           and in the thermal column 10**11 n/cm2xs
METHOD     Pairs of samples containing the same proportions of
           unknown element and standard,in order to give approxi-
           mately equal unknown and standard gamma-ray intensities
           in the gamma-ray spectrum,were irradiated bare and Cd
           covered(cadmium ratio method) or in two neutron spectra
           with widely different resonance neutron fractions (two
           spectrum method).The gamma-ray spectra of the two
           samples were then measured and the relative number of
           counts in the photopeaks calculated.Both methods give
           the relative ratio of resonance-to-thermal capture
           for unknown and standard. Only ratios of ratios were
           measured,except for measurement of the cadmium ratio to
           gold,to obtain epithermal spectral index of the neutron
           spectra. Measurements were made only on well-resolved
           and well separated peaks.
           Gold-cadmium ratio measurement at the irradiation site
           was r(Au)=1.674+-0.003,which gave an epithermal index
           of 0.0805+-0.0002.
DETECTOR   (GELI)Encapsulated Li-Ge diode with an effective volume
           of 5 cm3 and a resolution of 2.5 keV FWHM  for the
           Gd-153 gamma rays at 96.7 and 103.4 keV.
ANALYSIS   Parameter measured was S0,equal to 2/sqrt(Pi) times the
           ratio of the reduced resonance integral to the thermal
           capture cross section. The S0 values were obtained
           through the cadmium ratios.
           Unknown cross sections assumed to be 1/V below cadmium
           cutoff. Transmission of cadmium for resonance neutrons
           calculated with the infinite slab approximation,using
           the absorption cross section as a transmission cross
           section
CORRECTION Experimental results were corrected for neutron
           epithermal self-shielding,for transmission of cadmium
           for resonance neutrons and for the deviation of the
           detector activation in a Maxwellian flux to that of a
           1/V detector having the same thermal absorption cross
           section
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors assigned take into account the
           standard error of the average value of the ratio of
           cadmium ratios of the standard and unknown obtained
           from several irradiations the systematic error
           introduced by resonance parameters of the standard
           is not included
