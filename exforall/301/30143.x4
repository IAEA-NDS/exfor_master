TITLE      FISSION SPECTRUM AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS OF THRESHOLD
           REACTIONS (PART I).
INC-SOURCE (REAC) MOATA RECTOR OF UTR10 TYPE WITH NEUTRON
           CONVERTER, SEE 'INC-SPEC'.
           .SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED AT CENTER OF A NEUTRON
           CONVERTER CONSISTING OF AN AIR-COOLED HOLLOW CYLINDER
           OF ENRICHED U-AL ALLOY,2.5 CM DIA.,10 CM LONG,CONTAIN-
           ING 10 GRAM OF U-235 (DRAWING AND ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS IN
           JNE A/B 18,417(1964)), LOCATED IN THE INTERNAL GRAPHITE
           REFLECTOR BETWEEN THE TWO CORE TANKS OF THE REACTOR
INC-SPECT  SPECTRUM AT THE CENTER OF NEUTRON CONVERTER CONFORMED
           CLOSELY TO THE U-235 FISSION SPECTRUM. FAST FLUX WAS
           4.14E10 N/CM2/SEC. DAILY VARIATION WAS MONITORED BY THE
           AL-27(N,ALPHA)NA-24 REACTION. FAST FLUX FROM FUEL ELE-
           MENTS WAS 1.E9 N/CM2/SEC, LESS THAN 2.5 PERCENT OF FAST
           FLUX INSIDE THE CONVERTER. MEASUREMENTS OF FAST FLUX BY
           5 MONITOR REACTIONS AGREED WITHIN CROSS SECTION ERRORS
           AND WITH CALCULATED FLUX. IRRADIATION TIMES WERE 3-6 HR
SAMPLE     SPECTROGRAPHICALLY PURE METALS OR OXIDES.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) INCLUDES ERROR FROM THE ABSOLUTE COUNTING
           TECHNIQUE PLUS 2-PERCENT ERROR IN FLUX DETERMINATION
           FROM STANDARD CROSS SECTION. DEVIATION FROM FISSION
           SPECTRUM SHAPE ASSUMED NEGLIGIBLE.
