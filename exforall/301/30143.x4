TITLE      Fission spectrum averaged cross sections of threshold
           reactions (part I).
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Moata reactor of UTR10 type with neutron
           converter, see 'INC-SPEC'.
           .Samples were irradiated at center of a neutron
           converter consisting of an air-cooled hollow cylinder
           of enriched U-Al alloy,2.5 cm dia.,10 cm long,contain-
           ing 10 gram of U-235 (drawing and isotopic analysis in
           JNE A/B 18,417(1964)), located in the internal graphite
           reflector between the two core tanks of the reactor
INC-SPECT  Spectrum at the center of neutron converter conformed
           closely to the U-235 fission spectrum. Fast flux was
           4.14x10**10 n/cm2/sec. Daily variation was monitored by
           the Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24 reaction. Fast flux from fuel
           elements was 10**9 n/cm2/sec, less than 2.5% of fast
           flux inside the converter. Measurements of fast flux by
           5 monitor reactions agreed within cross section errors
           and with calculated flux. Irradiation times were 3-6 hr
SAMPLE     Spectrographically pure metals or oxides.

            Data given is total (n,p) cross
           section for production of Co-58 because Co-58m decays
           entirely to Co-58 ground state.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)The absolute activities of samples were measured
           with one or more of 4 Na-I(Tl) crystal spectrometers
           by comparison with an absolutely calibrated standard of
           the same isotope. Details and estimated accuracy in
