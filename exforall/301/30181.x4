TITLE      Reactions O-17(n,p)N-17 and O-18(n,d)N-17 with reactor
           neutrons
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Israel swimming pool reactor at Soreq
INC-SPECT  The fast spectrum at the end of the pneumatic transfer
           tube at the core face of the reactor was 1.21*10**12
           n/cm2*sec.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
           The fission neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections
           were measured by counting the delayed neutron emission
           of irradiated water samples enriched with oxygen-17 and
           -18. Nitrogen-17, the delayed-neutron precursor, decays
           by beta- emission to excited states of oxygen-17 which
           desintegrate instantaneously into oxygen-16 and a
           neutron. It was assumed that nitrogen-17 decays
           entirely through neutron emission and that the
           neutrons belong to two energy groups = 1.22 MeV(61.5%
           and 0.426 MeV(38.5%).
DETECTOR   (PROPC) the neutron emission was measured in a 4Pi
           geometry counting assembly consisting of 6 BF3
           proportional neutron counters. The counting efficiency
           was determined with calibrated radioactive neutron
           sources over the range of 0.2 To 4.5 MeV.
ANALYSIS   The results obtained from the five samples were
           analysed using the following equation=
                 n = m(17)*Y(17) + m(18)*y(18) where
               - n is the net neutron count of the sample
               - m(17) and m(18) are the respective contents of
                  O-17 and O-18 in the sample in gram atoms.
               - y(17) and y(18) are the yields of delayed
                  neutrons per gram atom from O-17(n,p) and
                  O-18(n,d) respectively.
           Least squares fit analysis was used to determine the
           two yields y(17) and y(18)
