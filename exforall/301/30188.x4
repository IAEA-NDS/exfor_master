           integral of Zr-94 and Zr-96
EXP-YEAR   (1970)
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE Internal graphite reflector of the reactor RA-1.
SAMPLE     Mixed samples prepared from a very dilute solution
           containing Zr and standard used for S0 determinations,
           metallic Zr foils for resonance integral measurements.
METHOD     Ratios of reduced  capture  integral to the thermal
           capture    cross section were measured using the
           cadmium ratio technique.
           Absorption resonance integrals were determined by
           measuring the ratio of effective absorption cross
           section of zirconium to Mn-55. Calibrated gamma sources
           were used to determine the absolute activities.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge-Li gamma-ray spectrometer
MONITOR    (25-MN-55(N,G)25-MN-56,,SIG)
            Used in the determination of absorption
           resonance integrals. Value taken from Goldberg et al.,
           BNL-325,2nd ed.,Suppl.2. 1966.
           The S0 values (Westcott formalism) were determined
           relative to S0=17.7 for gold.
