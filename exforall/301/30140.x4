TITLE      Absolute determination of U-235 fission cross-section
           for 2200 m/sec neutrons
EXP-YEAR   (1971)
FACILITY   (REAC) VVR-S reactor at Bucharest
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Horizontal channel with thermal neutron chopper
METHOD     (TOF) 2200 m/sec neutrons selected by time of flight.
           Absolute measurement was performed by determining:
            .The neutron flux which was measured by using a thick
               B-10 target, the neutron being detected through the
               477.4 keV gamma rays of Li-7 counted with a NaI
               spectrometr (calibrated with the gold 412 keV line)
            .The detection efficiency of fission fragments, using
               2 U-235 targets (a thin and a thick one) in 2
               ionization chambers. Density ratio of the targets
               and efficiency of 1 ionization chamber(100%
               for the thin target) were known.
            .The density of nuclei in the target from alpha
               activity.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,NAICR,D4PI)Ionization chambers
           Na-I spectrometer
           4*pi beta-gamma counter
MONITOR    Absolute measurement, but depending on U-234
           half-life, B-10(n,alpha) branching ratio and difference
           between gamma-energies of Li-7* and activated gold
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
SAMPLE     93.8% U-235, 5.3% U-238, .93% U234 electrospraying
           of U-acetate on a 20-micron Al-foil, density of U-235
           nuclei = 1.805 10**16 atoms/cm2 +-0.82%, assuming
           U-234 half-life as 2.47 10**5 Y.
ANALYSIS   The result of the experiment is
           sigma =(1915.06+-1.32%) * eta * (1.E5 yrs)/hl *
                  * (1 - 0.002982 dge/keV) barns
           where 1915.06 corresponds to the result reported in
                      IFA-NR-47, but increased by 0.3% for
                      losses due to threshold fission detection
                      (priv.Com. Petrascu 1971/5/17)
                 eta is the B-10(n,alfa) branching ratio
                 hl is the U-234 alfa-decay half-life
                 dge is the difference between the gamma-energies
                      of Li-7* and activated gold.
           assuming
                 eta = 0.93692+-0.00006 from Deruytter+Pelfer
                      (J.Nucl.En. Ab 21,833,1967)
                 hl=2.446+-.0024 E5 yrs from De Bievre (Chemical
                      Nucl.Data,Canterbury 1971,page 221)
                 dge = 67.3+-1.5 keV from Elliot+Bell (Phys.Rev.
                      74,1869,1948)
           yields sigma = 586.3 +- 7.8 barns
           Note= this result follows from correspondence between
                 A.J.Deruytter,H.D.Lemmel and M.Petrascu.
CORRECTION Following correction-factors were applied
           1) attenuation of neutron-beam due to chamber-walls
               = 1/1.027 +- 0.25%
           2) attenuation of the beam in air between fission-
               chamber and boron-target = 1/1.025
           3) a fotopeak-correction for the Li-7 gamma-line
               = 1.05 +- 0.01% (varying in different runs)
           4) losses due to threshold fission detection
               = 1.003 (Analog to Pu-239 in entry 30089.)
           5) an area correction = Pu/B target area ratio
               = 1/1.020 +- 0.2%
           plus other corrections smaller than 0.1%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error given is the total error which
                   includes:
               0.89% combined error of counting-rates
               0.82% U density and uniformity of target
               0.4% efficiency of Na-I spectrometer(412keV
               0.2% efficiency ratio 477.4keV/412.keV
           plus the errors of the corrections given above.
