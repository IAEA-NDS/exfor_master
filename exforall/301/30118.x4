TITLE      ACTIVATION CROSS-SECTIONS FOR NA-23 AND AL-27 WITH
           14. MEV NEUTRONS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) D-T REACTION
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION
           FOILS WERE MOVED PNEUMATICALLY BETWEEN SITES OF ACTIV-
           ATION AND MEASUREMENT. MEASUREMENT STARTED 0.5 SEC
           AFTER IRRADIATION.
DETECTOR   (LONGC,GEMUC)
           NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED ABSOLUTELY WITH A LONG
           COUNTER CALIBRATED WITH A KNOWN PO-BE SOURCE.
           BETA-ACTIVITY OF THE FOILS WAS MEASURED WITH A MICA END
           WINDOW GEIGER-MUELLER COUNTER.
ANALYSIS   DECAY-CURVES ANALYZED BY METHOD OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
PART-DET   (B-) BETA-ACTIVITY
COMMENT    THE RESULTS IN NUCL.PHYS.46,141 ARE ROUNDED OFF.
STATUS            DATA FROM ATOMKI KOZL. 4,137, TABLE 1
           (APRVD) APPROVED BY PETO (5/9/72)
HISTORY    (710222C) HDL
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE DONE FOR
           * DIFFERENCE IN BETA-SPECTRA
           * FLUX FLUCTUATION
           * ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF DETECTION SENSITIVITY WHEN
             CALIBRATING THE LONG COUNTER
