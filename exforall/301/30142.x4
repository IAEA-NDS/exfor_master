TITLE      Fission of Ra-223 by reactor neutrons
FACILITY   (REAC) Apsara reactor
INC-SPECT  Pile and epicadmium neutrons. Flux density about
           10.**12 n/cm2/sec. Irradiation time,10 hours.
SAMPLE     0.03 mu-gram of Ra-223 as nitrate was dried on
           cellulose nitrate cups, wrapped in polyethylene, sealed
           in a quartz tube which was sealed in an aluminum can.
           A blank sample was prepared under identical conditions.
           Cellulose nitrate gave no Sr-91 activation product.
METHOD     Following irradiation and chemical isolation of Sr-91,
           the fission cross section was estimated from Sr-91
           activity compared with the Sr-91 activity produced in a
           known amount of simultaneously irradiated uranium.Sr-91
           fission yield was assumed identical for Ra-223 and
           uranium.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Gas flow proportional counter
MONITOR            Relative to fission yield of Sr-91 from uranium
PART-DET   (FF,B-,DG) decay beta- and gammas from Sr-91
           fission fragment yield
STATUS     (TABLE) Datum from JIN 29(1967) p 269.
HISTORY    (19711126C) Compiled into Exfor
           (20080208A) BIB section updated
CORRECTION Background correction for unreacted Ra-223 unnecessary
           because of successful chemical removal.

ERR-ANALYS (+DATA-ERR) Datum is lower limit only. If fission yield
           of Sr-91 is lower than 6%, fission cross section
           would be higher.
           Authors estimate by a factor of 4 or 5 at most.
