TITLE      FISSION OF RA-223 BY REACTOR NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (REAC) APSARA REACTOR
INC-SPECT  PILE AND EPICADMIUM NEUTRONS. FLUX DENSITY ABOUT
           10.E12 N/CM2/SEC. IRRADIATION TIME,10 HOURS.
SAMPLE     0.03 MU-GRAM OF RA-223 AS NITRATE WAS DRIED ON
           CELLULOSE NITRATE CUPS, WRAPPED IN POLYETHYLENE, SEALED
           IN A QUARTZ TUBE WHICH WAS SEALED IN AN ALUMINUM CAN.
           A BLANK SAMPLE WAS PREPARED UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS.
           CELLULOSE NITRATE GAVE NO SR-91 ACTIVATION PRODUCT.
METHOD     FOLLOWING IRRADIATION AND CHEMICAL ISOLATION OF SR-91,
           THE FISSION CROSS SECTION WAS ESTIMATED FROM SR-91
           ACTIVITY COMPARED WITH THE SR-91 ACTIVITY PRODUCED IN A
           KNOWN AMOUNT OF SIMULTANEOUSLY IRRADIATED URANIUM.SR-91
           FISSION YIELD WAS ASSUMED IDENTICAL FOR RA-223 AND
           URANIUM.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) GAS FLOW PROPORTIONAL COUNTER
MONITOR            RELATIVE TO FISSION YIELD OF SR-91 FROM URANIUM

STATUS            DATUM FROM JIN 29(1967) P 269.
HISTORY    (711126C) COMPILED INTO EXFOR
CORRECTION BACKGROUND CORRECTION FOR UNREACTED RA-223 UNNECESSARY
           BECAUSE OF SUCCESSFUL CHEMICAL REMOVAL.

ERR-ANALYS DATUM IS LOWER LIMIT ONLY. IF FISSION YIELD OF SR-91 IS
           LOWER THAN 6 PERCENT, FISSION CROSS SECTION WOULD BE
           HIGHER. AUTHORS ESTIMATE BY A FACTOR OF 4 OR 5 AT MOST.
