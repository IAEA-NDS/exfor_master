FACILITY   (CYCLO,4UKRUKR) The 11-MeV medical cyclotron Eclipse RD
           in Clinical Hospital 'Feofaniya', Kyiv, Ukraine
SAMPLE     The molybdenum powder with 92.2% enrichment in 100Mo
           isotope was used for the solid sample preparation.
           This powder was pressed with 150 kN/cm2 pressure into
           the solid pellet. The pellet was formed with diameter
           15 mm x 3 mm dimensions.

METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,HPGE) Scintillation with diameter 40 x 40 mm
           NaI(Tl) and semiconductor HPGe spectrometers. The
           energy calibration of the detectors was performed
           using 137Cs and 60Co standard sources.
CORRECTION Self-absorption corrections.

ANALYSIS   The total contribution to the produced 99mTc activity
           from reactions 98Mo(p,gamma)99mTc and 100Mo(p,pn)99Mo->
           99mTc is less than 0.3% relative to the (p,2n) reaction
           product and can be considered as negligible.
           The total activity of impurities does not exceed 0.1%
           of produced activity of 99mTc.
