FACILITY   (VDG) IAE Van Der Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a deuterium
           gas cell ( 4.3 atm.) with a 7.4 MeV pulsed deuteron
           beam.
SAMPLE     Natural Uranium electro-deposited on both sides of 0.2
           mm thick plates of stainless steel with deposition
           thickness of about 0.5 mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) Fission fragments were detected by a
           paralell-plate ionization chamber which operated in
           multi-segment mode and was filled with pure methane at
           a pressure of 4.3 atm. Fission neutrons were detected
           by two liquid scintillators both placed at 100 degrees
           with respect to the incident neutron beam and at 2.3 m
           from the ionization chamber.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,PSD)  The incident-neutron TOF spectrum was
           obtained from the fission-fragment event signals with
           the pulsed-beam TOF method. A liquid scintillator,
           located at 0 deg. and 3.1 m down stream of the gas
           cell served as monitor of the incident-neutron TOF
           spectrum. Fission neutrons were selected by requiring
           coincidence between neutron detector-  and fission-
           fragment detector events which also provided the
           fission-neutron TOF spectra. Events induced by the
           10.17 and 12.12 MeV incident neutrons were software
           selected by gating the TOF spectrum of secundary neu-
           trons with the 10.17 and 12.12 MeV peaks of the in-
           cident-neutron spectra. Pulse-shape discrimination was
           applied to eliminate gamma-ray background.
ANALYSIS   The measured spectrum was fitted by a Maxwellian
           distribution.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error refers to the uncertainties due to
           counting statistics and determination of detector
           efficiency.
