            Experimental technique
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuterium gas cell (4.3 atm) with a 7.4 MeV
            pulsed deuteron beam
SAMPLE     Natural uranium electrodeposited on both sides of
            0.2 mm thick plates of stainless steel with
            deposition thickness of ~0.5 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) Fission fragments detected by a
            paralell-plate ionization chamber operated in
            multisegment mode and filled with pure methane at
            4.3 atm.
           (SCIN) Fission neutrons detected by two liquid
            scintillators both placed at 100 deg with respect to
            neutron beam and at 2.3 m from the ionization chamber
           (SCIN) Liquid scintillator at 0 deg and 3.1 m
            downstream of the gas cell served as monitor of the
            incident-neutron TOf spectrum.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC) Fission neutrons selected by requiring
            coincidence between neutron and fission fragment
            detector events which also provided the
            fission-neutron TOF spectra
           (PSD) to eliminate gamma-ray background
ANALYSIS   Measured spectrum fitted by Maxwellian distribution
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Counting statistics and detector efficiency
