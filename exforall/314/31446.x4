SAMPLE     Metal disk of 99.9% Ni-58, 4.0+-0.1 cm in diameter
           and 1.047 mg/cm**2 in thickness. The sample was
           backed on the cathode of the ionization chamber.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at
           Institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.

MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The neutron fluence was determi-
           ned with a fission chamber of U-238. During the expe-
           riment solid angles subtended for the neutron source
           by the ni-58 target and the U-238 sample remained
           unchanged. The recommended data of ENDF/B-6 for
           U-238(n,f) were used for deriving the total cross
           section.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Grid ionization chamber, made at NLJINR, Dubna.
