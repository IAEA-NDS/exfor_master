TITLE      Measurement of angular distribution at 6.0 MeV and 7.0
           MeV for Ni-58(n,alpha)Fe-55 and Fe-54(n,alpha)Cr-51.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at
           Institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
SAMPLE     Metal disk of 99.9% Ni-58, 4.0+-0.1 cm in diameter
           and 1.047 mg/cm**2 in thickness. The sample was
           backed on the cathode of the ionization chamber.
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Grid ionization chamber.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The neutron fluence was determi-
           ned with a fission chamber of U-238. During the expe-
           riment solid angles subtended for the neutron source
           by the targets of Ni-58, Fe-54 and the U-238 sample,
           about 8 degrees, remained unchanged. The recommended
           data of ENDF/B-6 for U-238(n,f) were used for deriving
           the total cross section.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty in the neutron energy includes the
           uncertainty in the accelerator voltage ( about 100
           keV) and the uncertainty of the deuteron energy loss
           in the D-Ti target ( about 200 keV).
           (ERR-T) Uncertainty of the cross sections consists lar-
           gely of the uncertainty due to deduct the background
           from the measured spectra and error in the neutron
           fluence.
STATUS     (PRELM) Data were taken from the text of Comm.Nucl.Data
           Progr. 17 (1997-06), pp. 1-8.
