TITLE      Measurement of angular distribution at 6.0 MeV and 7.0
           MeV for Ni-58(n,alpha)Fe-55 and Fe-54(n,alpha)Cr-51.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at
           Institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
SAMPLE     Metal disk of 99.9% Ni-58, 4.0+-0.1 cm in diameter
           and 1.047 mg/cm**2 in thickness. The sample was
           backed on the cathode of the ionization chamber.
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Grid ionization chamber.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The neutron fluence was determi-
           ned with a fission chamber of U-238. During the expe-
           riment solid angles subtended for the neutron source
           by the targets of Ni-58, Fe-54 and the U-238 sample,
           about 8 degrees, remained unchanged. The recommended
           data of ENDF/B-6 for U-238(n,f) were used for deriving
           the total cross section.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty in the neutron energy includes the
           uncertainty in the accelerator voltage ( about 100
           keV) and the uncertainty of the deuteron energy loss
           in the D-Ti target ( about 200 keV).
           (ERR-T) Uncertainty of the cross sections consists lar-
           gely of the uncertainty due to deduct the background
           from the measured spectra and error in the neutron
           fluence.
