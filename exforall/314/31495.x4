TITLE      Excitation functions of some (n,p) and (n,alpha)
            reactions from threshold to 16 MeV

SAMPLE     High-purity (Goodfellow) natural metal samples, disk-
            shaped (19 mm diam.) with thickness between 0.25 and
            1 mm, and rectangular (10x15 mm) shaped.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE) Absolute activity measurements.

DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,14.659HR,DG,1368.598,1.)
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the following effects:
           - true coincidence
           - gamma-ray self-absorption
           - dead time
           - contribution of low-energy breakup neutrons to the
             activation. Therefore the spectral shape of the
             neutrons produced in the H-2(d,n)He-3 reaction was
             determined by activation and pulse-height unfolding
             methods.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors are from the following sources:
           - counting statistics
           - sample mass
           - energy and fluence uncertainties
           - decay constants
           - effect of low-energy neutrons
           - reference cross sections
           - detector efficiency
