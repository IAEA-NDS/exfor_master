TITLE      Burn-up Cross-Section of 188-W
FACILITY   (REAC,3AULWUC) High Flux Australian Reactor,
           Australian Nucl. Sc. and Technology Organization
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were performed in the pneumatic
           rabbit facility of the High Flux Australian Reactor.
           In this facility, the radioactive target could be
           sent-to or received-from reactor within 30 sec.
           Neutron flux was at 5*10E+13 n/(sec*cm2).
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum, no details given
SAMPLE     Prior to irradiation, >95% of Re-188 was chemically
           removed from the target.
           W-188 content of target was 52.6 MBq.
           Irradiation time was 10 min.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Based on a knowlege of the W-188 content of
           target, neutron flux density, irradiation time and
           with the assumption of 100% intensity for 260.1 and
           420.5 KeV gamma rays, cross-section was calculated
           for burn-up of W-188.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-spectorscopy was performed using
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector coupled to a PC-based
           multichannel analyzer EG&G Ortec. Samples were placed
           at 10-20 cm from the detector with dead times of
           up to 20%.
