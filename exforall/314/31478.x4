TITLE      Cross sections of the O-16(n,alpha gamma) reaction at
           14.7 MeV.
FACILITY   (CCW) Neutron generator of the Institute of Physics
           of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 150 keV d+ ions on T-Ti target.
SAMPLE     147 g. of Chromium oxide in powder form, filled in
           a polyethylene flask with dimensions 46*60 mm.
METHOD     (GSPEC,ASSOP,COINC) Coincidence was required of the
           gamma rays with the associated alpha's from the (d,t)
           reaction.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,SCIN) The HPGe gamma detector was placed at an
           angle of 125 degree with respect to the neutron beam.
           Associated alpha particles were detected by a plastic
           scintillator detector.
MONITOR    (24-CR-52(N,INL)24-CR-52,PAR,SIG,G) The monitor cross
           section has been corrected for the Cr-53(n,2n)
           contribution to the 1434 keV transition.
MONIT-REF  (,A.PAVLIK,B,PH-DAT,13,(6),,91)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for gamma ray self absorp-
           tion and secondary neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty in the relative full peak efficiency was
           estimated to be 5 percent. The uncertainty in total
           correction was estimated to be 3 percent.
STATUS     Data are from table 3 of INDC(SLK)-002.
