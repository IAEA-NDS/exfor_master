TITLE      Independent isomeric yield ratios of Sb-132 in
           Pu-241(n-th,f) and U-238(alpha,f).

SAMPLE     Nothing said about target
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Pneumatic tube of the cirius reactor.
METHOD     (RCHEM) The method of distillation of antimony hydride
           was used. The antimony was separated from bulk fission
           products and target at varying time intervals as to
           evaluate the precursor contribution in the yield of
           Sb-132g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Separation time activities for Sb-132-m and
           Sb-132-g were evaluated from least square fitting of
           the time dependent activity profile of the common
           697 keV gamma line and were correlated to the
           corresponding independent isomeric yields and the
           fractional cumulative yield of Sn-132.
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No error analysis given
