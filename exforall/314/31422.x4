REFERENCE  (P,BARC-92/P/2,12,92)
SAMPLE     ENCAPSULATED SOLUTIONS CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 10
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) PNEUMATIC TUBE OF THE CIRIUS REACTOR.
METHOD     (RCHEM) THE METHOD OF DISTILLATION OF ANTIMONY HYDRIDE
           WAS USED. THE ANTIMONY WAS SEPARATED FROM BULK FISSION
           PRODUCTS AND TARGET AT VARYING TIME INTERVALS AS TO
           EVALUATE THE PRECURSOR CONTRIBUTION IN THE YIELD OF
           SB-132G.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) SEPARATION TIME ACTIVITIES FOR SB-132-M AND
           SB-132-G WERE EVALUATED FROM LEAST SQUARE FITTING OF
           THE TIME DEPENDENT ACTIVITY PROFILE OF THE COMMON 697
           KEV GAMMA LINE AND WERE CORRELATED TO THE
           CORRESPONDING INDEPENDENT ISOMERIC YIELDS AND THE
           FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE YIELD OF SN-132.
