SAMPLE     Natural lead foils, 0.04 or 0.25 mm thick and 20 mm
           in diameter, sandwiched with two aluminium foils.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP) IAE Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a
           0.7 mg/cm**2 thick T-Ti target with 200 keV deuterons.
           Sample foils were placed at 45 degrees with respect to
           the deuteron beam.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,ASSOP) Absolute measurement at En = 14.58 MeV,
           neutron fluence rate was determined by associated
           alpha particle counting.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the fluence rate
           fluctuation, gamma ray self-absorption in the sample,
           the finite active area of the sample, effect of sum
           peak, neutron scattering in the target assembly. Also
           corrections were made for the standard cross section,
           mean neutron energy and decay data.
