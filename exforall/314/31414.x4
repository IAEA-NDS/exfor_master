TITLE      Investigation of the Ni-58(n,p) reaction mechanism
           at 18.5 MeV.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron energy spread, due to the deuteron
           energy loss in the T-Ti target and the geometrical
           conditions, was about 150 keV.
           The average flux was about 2 x 10**5 n/cm2/s
SAMPLE     (28-NI-58,ENR=0.997)
           A 20 mg/cm**2 thick Ni-58 target ( enriched to 99.7%)
           deposited electrolytically on 1mm tantalum backing.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA/DE) Protons were counted
           recoiling at 10 degrees from a polyethylene target
           in a CsI(Tl) scintillator.

METHOD     (EDE,COINC)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,PROPC,SIBAR) Operation is based on the
           triple coincidence of two proportional counters as
           dE/dx-detectors and one tandem surface-barrier Si
           detector as E-detector.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) The experimental (n,p) and (n,np) proton
           spectra were obtained in a fitting procedure of the
           sum of the calculated spectra to the angle-integrated
           experimental spectrum at proton energies > 5 MeV. The
            (n,p) and (n,np) cross sections were obtained by
           integrating these spectra over the whole energy range.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated error arises mainly from the
           uncertainty in the determination of the ratio of the
           compound (n,p) and (n,np) cross sections.

           The error is twice that for sig(n,p) because a
           relative small number of protons are in the
           measurement region ( 5. - 18.5 MeV)
