TITLE      INVESTIGATION OF THE NI-58(N,P) REACTION MECHANISM
           AT 18.5 MEV.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD, DUE TO THE DEUTERON
           ENERGY LOSS IN THE T-TI TARGET AND THE GEOMETRICAL
           CONDITIONS, WAS ABOUT 150 KEV.
SAMPLE     A 20 MG/CM**2 THICK NI-58 TARGET ( ENRICHED TO 99.7%)
           DEPOSITED ELECTROLYTICALLY ON 1MM TANTALUM BACKING.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA/DE) PROTONS WERE COUNTED
           RECOILING AT 10 DEGREES FROM A POLYETHYLENE TARGET
           IN A CSI(TL) SCINTILLATOR.
MONIT-REF  (,S.J.BAME JR+,J,RSI,28,997,57)
DETECTOR   (TELES)
           (COIN,PROPC,PROPC,SOLST) OPERATION IS BASED ON THE
           TRIPLE COINCIDENCE OF TWO PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AS
           DE/DX-DETECTORS AND ONE TANDEM SURFACE-BARRIER SI DE-
           TECTOR AS E-DETECTOR.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) THE EXPERIMENTAL (N,P) AND (N,NP) PROTON
           SPECTRA WERE OBTAINED IN A FITTING PROCEDURE OF THE
           SUM OF THE CALCULATED SPECTRA TO THE ANGLE-INTEGRATED
           EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRUM AT PROTON ENERGIES > 5 MEV. THE
            (N,P) AND (N,NP) CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED BY
           INTEGRATING THESE SPECTRA OVER THE WHOLE ENERGY RANGE.
ERR-ANALYS THE ESTIMATED ERROR ARISES MAINLY FROM THE UNCERTAINTY
           IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RATIO OF THE COMPOUND
            (N,P) AND (N,NP) CROSS SECTIONS.

ERR-ANALYS THE ERROR IS TWICE THAT FOR SIG(N,P) BECAUSE A
           RELATIVE SMALL NUMBER OF PROTONS ARE IN THE
           MEASUREMENT REGION ( 5. - 18.5 MEV)
