TITLE      Neutron-Induced Reaction Cross Sections between 9
           and 14 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLIEN) CV-28 cyclotron
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) 30 mm long 12 mm diameter cylindrical chamber
           filled with 2 atm of deuterium gas was bombarded with
           deutron beams of app. 2 mcA extracted from CV-28
           cyclotron. Neutron flux was on the order of 10E+7
           n/sec*cm2.
SAMPLE     Natural nickel, cobalt and vanadium targets of 10 mm
           diameter and 0.1 mm thickness, stacked with aluminium
           foils of the same dimension, were placed 2 cm away
           from the neutron source. Stacks were irradiated for
           approximatly 5 h.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activity induced by the continous spectrum D-D
           break up neutrons (0 - 6 MeV) was subtracted by an
           unfolding technique using the aluminium monitor.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma ray activity was determined by high-purity
           detector shielded with 5 cm of lead with energy
           resolution of 1.75 KeV at 1.33 MeV.

ERR-ANALYS Data errors include uncertainty of:
           deuteron beam energy 2%
           gamma ray detector efficiency 3%
           monitor reaction cross section 2%
           cross section used in the determination of the
             activity induced by the break up neutrons 3 to 4%
           statistical error in the determination of the
             gamma rays activity induced by monoenergetic and
             break up neutrons 1 to 3%
           contribution of break up neutrons to the activity
             induced in the aluminium target at 13.3 and 13.8 MeV
             were 0.7% and 2.7% respectively.
