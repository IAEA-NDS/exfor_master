TITLE      Measurement of Li-7(n,n'gamma)Li-7-*(478keV) inelastic
           angular distribution derived via the shape analysis
           of the Doppler shifted gamma-ray spectrum (DSM) at
           14.9 MeV.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 400 keV neutron generator of the
            Institute of Low Energy Nuclear Physics.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Metallic lithium sample, 36.8 mm in diameter and
           28.6 mm in height, enriched to 99.98% in Li-7.
           The sample was positioned at 0 degree with respect
           to the deuteron beam axis and at 13.4 cm from the Ti
           target.
METHOD     Doppler-broadened gamma spectra were measured at 5
           lab angles. From shape and position analysis of these
           the angular distributions of Li-7 recoils and thereby
           the angular distributions of the inelastic scattered
           neutrons were determined.
           (TOF) Time-of-flight techniques were applied in order
           to suppress the background from neutrons in the gamma
           spectra.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,HPGE) A plastic scintillator Ne211 was used as
           a monitor of the TOF system.
ANALYSIS   Monte Carlo simulations of the gamma-ray spectra
           were done which included several corrections.
           These simulations, expanded in Legendre polynomials,
           were fitted to the experimental data with the Least
           Squares Fitting method.
CORRECTION Several corrections were taken into account, i.e.
             -  The primary neutron energy spread.
             -  The solid angle correction for the sample to
                neutron target.
             -  The speed reducing effect of recoil Li* before
                emitting the gamma-ray.
             -  Gamma detector resolution.
            These corrections were calculated in the Monte-
            Carlo simulations mentioned above.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in the fitting of the data.
