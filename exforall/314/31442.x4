TITLE      Measurement of Li-7(n,n'g)Li-7-*(478keV) inelastic
           angular distribution derived via the shape analysis
           of the doppler shifted gamma-ray spectrum (DSM) at
           14.9 MeV.
FACILITY   (VDG) 400 keV neutron generator of the Istitute of
           Low Energy Nuclear Physics.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Metallic Lithium sample, 36.8 mm in diameter and
           28.6 mm in hight, enriched to 99.98% in Li-7.
           The sample was positioned at 0 degree with respect
           to the deuteron beam axis and at 13.4 cm from the Ti
           target.
METHOD     Doppler-broadened gamma spectra were measured at 5
           lab angles. From shape and position analysis of these
           the angular distributions of Li-7 recoils and thereby
           the angular distributions of the inelastic scattered
           neutrons were determined.
           (TOF) Time-of-flight techniques were applied in order
           to suppress the background from neutrons in the gamma
           spectra.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,HPGE) A plastic scintillator NE211 was used as
           a monitor of the TOF system.
ANALYSIS   Monte Carlo simulations of the gamma-ray spectra were
           done which included several corrections. These simu-
           lations, expanded in Legendre polynomials, were
           fitted to the experimental data with the least squa-
           res fitting method.
CORRECTION Several corrections were taken into account, i.e.
             -  The primary neutron energy spread.
             -  The solid angle correction for the sample to
                neutron target.
             -  The speed reducing effect of recoil Li* before
                emitting the gamma-ray.
             -  Gamma detector resolution.
            These corrections were calculated in the Monte-
            Carlo simulations mentioned above.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in the fitting of the data.
STATUS     Data corresponding to fig. 1 of main ref. is from
           private communication with author.
