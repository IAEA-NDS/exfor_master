TITLE      Activation cross section of Cu-63(n,alpha)Co-60
           reaction.
AUTHOR     (Lu Hanlin,Zhao Wenrong,Yu Weixiang,Yuan Xialin)
INSTITUTE  (3CPRAEP)
REFERENCE  (J,CNP,12,(4),373,1990) Experimental details, monitor
           data and (preliminary) cross section data.
           (R,INDC(CPR)-16,1989) Only (preliminary) cross section
           data.
           (W,Lu Hanlin,199210) Final cross-section data
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP) CIAE Van der Graaff accelerator and
           (CCW,3CPRAEP) Cockroft Walton accelerator.
SAMPLE     Disks of 0.2 mm in thickness and 20 mm in diameter
           sandwiched between two thin ( 0.2 mm) aluminium foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The samples were placed at various angles rela-
           tive to the incident deuteron beam. Distance between
           sample and neutron source was 3-6 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           Evaluated author's data. Taken from prev. evaluation.
           Compiler: no ane ref. on the source of data.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption in
           Na-24 and Co-60, losses of these isotopes due to
           forward recoils during the irradiation, fluctuation of
           neutron fluence rate during irradiation and for the
           finite area of the samples.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The principal sources of uncertainties
                       resulted from:
            * the reference cross section, efficiency of Ge(Li)
                                                    detector,
            * counting statistics,
            * sample geometry,
            * some corrections and the mean neutron-energy
               determination.
STATUS     (TABLE,APRVD) Final cross section data are from private
           communication with author.
