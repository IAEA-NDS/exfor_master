           (W,LU HANLIN,9210) FINAL CROSS-SECTION DATA
FACILITY   (VDG,CCW) CIAE VAN DER GRAAFF ACCELERATOR AND COCKROFT
           WALTON ACCELERATOR.
SAMPLE     DISKS OF 0.2 MM IN THICKNESS AND 20 MM IN DIAMETER
           SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO THIN ( 0.2 MM) ALUMINIUM FOILS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED AT VARIOUS ANGLES RELA-
           TIVE TO THE INCIDENT DEUTERON BEAM. DISTANCE BETWEEN
           SAMPLE AND NEUTRON SOURCE WAS 3-6 CM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR GAMMA-RAY SELF-ABSORPTION IN
           NA-24 AND CO-60, LOSSES OF THESE ISOTOPES DUE TO
           FORWARD RECOILS DURING THE IRRADIATION, FLUCTUATION OF
           NEUTRON FLUENCE RATE DURING IRRADIATION AND FOR THE
           FINITE AREA OF THE SAMPLES.
ERR-ANALYS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTIES RESULTED FROM
           THE REFERENCE CROSS SECTION, EFFICIENCY OF GE(LI)
           DETECTOR, COUNTING STATISTICS, SAMPLE GEOMETRY, SOME
           CORRECTIONS AND THE MEAN NEUTRON-ENERGY DETERMINATION.
STATUS     (APRVD) FINAL CROSS SECTION DATA ARE FROM PRIVATE
           COMMUNICATION WITH AUTHOR.
