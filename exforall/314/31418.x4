TITLE      INTEGRAL FISSION CROSS SECTION RATIOS OF TH-232, U-236
           AND U-238 RELATIVE TO U-235 IN THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM
           PRODUCED BY 23.2 MEV DEUTERONS INCIDENT ON A THICK BE
           METAL TARGET.
AUTHOR     (M.BOVISIO DE RICABARRA,L.COHEN DE PORTO,D.WAISMAN,

           (R,INDC(ARG)-011,9303) NO. 4, ONLY SUMMARY.
FACILITY   (VDGT)
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) DEUTERON ENERGY WAS 23.2 MEV.
DETECTOR   (TRD) SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTOR (SSNTD)
           PACKETS, CONSISTING OF ELECTROPLATED FISSION DEPOSITS
            ( SAMPLES) PLUS MICA TRACK DETECTORS FOR FISSION
           FRAGMENT COUNTING, WERE PLACED AT 41 MM FROM THE BEAM
           SPOT IN THE BE TARGET AT APPROX. 0 DEGREE.
METHOD     (FISCT) THE MICA SSNTD DETECTORS WERE ETCHED AND THE
           FISSION TRACKS WERE COUNTED AFTER IRRADIATION TO
           DETERMINE THE FISSION RATIOS. A CADMIUM SHIELD BEHIND
           THE IRRADIATED STACK WAS USED TO ELIMINATE LOW-ENERGY
           NEUTRONS BACK SCATTERED BY THE ROOM WALLS.
           MASS ASSAY WAS BASED ON 2*PI ALPHA COUNTING FOR
           URANIUM DEPOSITS AND COUNTING OF PA-233 PRODUCED BY
           THERMAL NEUTRONS IN TH-232 FOR THORIUM DEPOSITS.
PART-DET   (FF)
INC-SPECT  THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS DETERMINED WITH THE UNFOLDING
           CODE SAND-II USING A SET OF 11 MEASURED ACTIVITIES,
           THE MEAN NEUTRON ENERGY FOR 0.3 - 23 MEV BEING 7.5 MEV
            ( FROM M.A.LONE ET AL, NUCL. INSTR. METH., 143, 331-
           334 (1977)).
ANALYSIS   FISSIONS PER ATOM WERE DETERMINED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
           DEPOSITS MASS AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FISSION FRAGMENT
           ABSORPTION IN THE DEPOSITS, FOR BEAM CURRENT
           FLUCTUATIONS, FOR SMALL FLUX DIFFERENCES DUE TO
           POSITION IN THE STACK  AND TO DIFFERENT FOIL DIAMETER,
           AND FOR ALPHA BACKSCATTERING IN THE FOIL BACKING.
ERR-ANALYS THE MAIN TWO ELEMENTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE ERROR
           ESTIMATION ARE MASS ASSAY AND FISSION-TRACK COUNTING.
           THE ERROR IN MASS ASSAY IS DETERMINED BY THE UNCER-
           TAINTIES IN (%):
           U-235 ALPHA DECAY HALF LIFE                       .07
           U-236 ALPHA DECAY HALF LIFE                       .06
           U-238 ALPHA DECAY HALF LIFE                       .05
           CORRECTION FOR ALPHA BACKSCATTERING IN THE        0.1
           FOIL BACKING
           THORIUM WEIGHT                                    0.1
           ALPHA DESINTEGRATION RATIO FOR NATURAL URANIUM:

           ALPHA COUNTING AND CORRECTIONS FOR ALPHA SELF-
           ABSORPTION ( VALUES NOT GIVEN EXPLICITELY IN PAPER).
           THE ERROR IN FISSION TRACK COUNTING IS DETERMINED BY:
           ERROR IN COUNTING STATISTICS ( NO EXPLICITE VALUE
           GIVEN IN ORIGINAL PAPER) AND
           SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARISING FROM FISSION RATES
           CORRECTIONS, WHICH ARE:
           POSITION IN STACK                               2 - 5
           STACK TO SOURCE DISTANCE                          1.0
           FISSION FRAGMENT RANGE IN URANIUMOXIDE            10.
           FISSION FRAGMENT RANGE IN THORIUMOXIDE            30.
           CORRECTION FOR FISSIONS FROM OTHER ISOTOPES,
           WHICH DEPENDS ON UNCERTAINTIES IN:
             ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION ( SEE UNDER 'SAMPLE'
             IN SUBENTS 003 - 008)
             (CALCULATED) INTEGRAL FISSION CROSS SECTION      5.
