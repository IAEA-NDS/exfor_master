FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD, DUE TO THE DEUTERON
           ENERGY LOSS IN THE T-TI TARGET AND THE GEOMETRICAL
           CONDITIONS, WAS ABOUT 150 KEV.
SAMPLE     A 20 MG/CM**2 THICK NI-58 TARGET ( ENRICHED TO 99.7%)
           DEPOSITED ELECTROLYTICALLY ON 1MM TANTALUM BACKING.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA/DE) PROTONS WERE COUNTED
           RECOILING AT 10 DEGREES FROM A POLYETHYLENE TARGET
           IN A CSI(TL) SCINTILLATOR.

DETECTOR   (TELES)
           (COIN,PROPC,PROPC,SOLST) OPERATION IS BASED ON THE
           TRIPLE COINCIDENCE OF TWO PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AS
           DE/DX-DETECTORS AND ONE TANDEM SURFACE-BARRIER SI DE-
           TECTOR AS E-DETECTOR.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) FOR PROTON ENERGIES LOWER THAN 5 MEV
           CALCULATED VALUES WERE USED, THE CALCULATED SPECTRUM
           BEING NORMALIZED TO THE MEASURED ANGLE-INTEGRATED
           SPECTRUM AT HIGHER ENERGIES.

REACTION   (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) THE EXPERIMENTAL (N,P) PROTON SPECTRUM
           WAS OBTAINED IN A FITTING PROCEDURE OF THE SUM OF THE
           CALCULATED (N,P) AND (N,NP) SPECTRA TO THE ANGLE-
           INTEGRATED EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRUM AT PROTON ENERGIES >
           5 MEV. THE (N,P) CROSS SECTION WAS OBTAINED BY
           INTEGRATING THIS (N,P) SPECTRUM OVER THE WHOLE
           ENERGY RANGE.
