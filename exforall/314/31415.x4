TITLE      An interpretation of proton spectra from the
           58Ni(n,p)58Co reaction at neutron energy
           close to 20 MeV

FACILITY   (VDG,3POLIPJ)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron energy spread, due to the deuteron
           energy loss in the T-Ti target and the geometrical
           conditions, was about 150 keV.
SAMPLE     (28-NI-58,ENR=0.997)
           A 20 mg/cm**2 thick Ni-58 target ( enriched to 99.7%)
           deposited electrolytically on 1mm tantalum backing.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA/DE) Protons were counted
           recoiling at 10 degrees from a polyethylene target
           in a CsI(Tl) scintillator.

METHOD     (EDE,COINC)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,PROPC,SIBAR) Operation is based on the
           triple coincidence of two proportional counters as
           dE/dx-detectors and one tandem surface-barrier Si
           detector as E-detector.

REACTION   (28-NI-58(N,X)1-H-1,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) For proton energies lower than 5 MeV
           calculated values were used, the calculated spectrum
           being normalized to the measured angle-integrated
           spectrum at higher energies.

REACTION   (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) The experimental (n,p) proton spectrum
           was obtained in a fitting procedure of the sum of the
           calculated (n,p) and (n,np) spectra to the angle-
           integrated experimental spectrum at proton energies >
           5 MeV. The (n,p) cross section was obtained by
           integrating this (n,p) spectrum over the whole
           energy range.
