TITLE      An associated particle time-of-flight facility for
           neutron cross section measurement.
FACILITY   (VDGT)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a deuterated
           polyethylene target with 3.0 - 8.0 MeV deuterons.
METHOD     (ASSOP) The transmission was determined with the
           sample in - sample out method.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SOLST) NE-102A plastic neutron detectors. The
           associated He-3 particles were detected by a totally
           depleted solid state surface barrier detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The statistical counting uncertainty  was
            < 1.2%. An uncertainty of 0.5% - 1.6% was due to
           polyethylene target detoriation, scintillator
           bias instability and uncertainty in sample thickness.
STATUS     Data were taken from table 1 of Nucl. Instr. and Meth.
           Vol. A346(1994), pp. 230 - 236.
