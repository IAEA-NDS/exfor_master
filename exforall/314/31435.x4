TITLE       (N,n') production of Tc-99m by Cf-252 fission neu-
           trons.

REFERENCE  (J,JRN/L,176,(4),296,9310)
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Encapsulated Cf 252 neutron sources with inten-
           sity of 5.5*10**5 neutron/sec.
INC-SPECT  Cf-252 spontaneous-fission neutrons spectrum.
SAMPLE     Technetium dioxide powder packaged into a small cylin-
           drical aluminium container of 20 mm internal diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 0.55cm**3 Ortec high-purity germanium planar
           detector with a resolution of 0.54 keV at 140.5 keV
           gamma-ray energy.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for self attenuation and
           self-absorption.
