FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 156 and 330 keV neutrons were produced by a
           proton beam bombarding a solid LiF target of
           90 microgram/cm**2 in thickness.
           (P-T) The 540-1150 keV neutrons were produced by a
           proton beam bombarding a solid Ti-T target of 1.2
           mg/cm**2 in thickness.
SAMPLE     Natural metallic zinc discs, about 20 mm in diameter
           and 0.45 mm in thickness, with purity > than 99.9%.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE,BF3) The Au-198 activity was measured with
           a HPGe detector while a Ge(Li) detector was used for
           other products. The fluctuation of the neutron fluence
           rate was monitored by a BF3 long counter.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) Cross sections were
           taken from ENDF/B-VI.

CORRECTION Corrections have been made for detector efficiency,
           gamma-intensity, fluctuation of neutron fluence rate,
           gamma self absorption in the samples.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The principal sources of error were:
