TITLE      Measurement of Neutron Capture Cross Section for
           Hf-180.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at
           Institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Monoenergetic neutrons, with energies of 0.52,
           1.10 and 1.60 MeV, were produced via the T(p,n)He-3
           reaction on a solid T-Ti target of 1.48 mg/cm**2 in
           thickness. The energies of the proton beam were 1.45,
           2.0, 2.5 MeV respectively.
SAMPLE     Natural metallic Hafnium powder with purity 88.398%
           pressed into disks of 10 mm in diamater and 1.0 mm in
           thickness. Each sample was sandwiched between gold
           disks. The samples were placed at zero degree's rela-
           tive to the incident proton beam at about 1.4 cm from
           the T-Ti target.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The cross sections were
           taken from ENDF/B-6. The fluctuation of the neutron
           fluence rate was monitored with a BF3 long counter.
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198-G,64.704HR,DG,411.8,.9557)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for detector efficiency,
           cascade effect, gamma intensity, fluctuation of
           neutron fluence rate and gamma-ray self absorption
           in the samples.
ERR-ANALYS The principal sources of errors are as follows:
