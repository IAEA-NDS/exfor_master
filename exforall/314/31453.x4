INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutron production target consisted of a gas
           cell. The deuteron beam was chopped and bunched to
           produce 1 ns bursts at a frequency of 4 MHz.
SAMPLE     Two cylindrical samples of natural iron, with dimen-
           sions 3.0*2.8 cm and 2.0*2.8 cm. The first one was
           used at 90 degree, the other at 55 and 125 degree
           with respect tot the deuteron beam.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two plastic-NaI anticoincidence shielded
           spectrometers.
METHOD     (TOF) The time-of-flight method was used to discrimi-
           nate the neutrons and gamma-rays and to eliminate
           events not associated with prompt gamma-rays. The
           background spectrum was obtained from the NaI spec-
           trum gated by a window equivalent in width to the
           gamma-ray peak window, at constant background in the
           TOF spectrum.
CORRECTION The gamma spectrum was corrected for background.
           also corrections were made, by a Monte Carlo code,
           for finite geometry, gamma-ray attenuation, neutron
           attenuation and multiple scattering in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS No error analysis given.
