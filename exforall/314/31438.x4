SAMPLE     ENRICHED Ni-58 powder (99.66%) or Ni-foil (0.1 mm
           thick, 99.99% pure) each weighing 25 to 100 mg, was
           sealed in a quartz ampoule, studded with neutron flux
           monitor foils  and then placed in an NRX type irradia-
           tion capsule.

           The fast neutron flux densities, effective at the am-
           poules, were determined using the first three monitor
           threshold reactions. The thermal flux density was de-
           termined via the last two reactions.

INC-SPECT  From measurement of the fast/thermal -neutron flux
           ratio for monitor reactions having different threshold
           it was concluded that the neutron spectrum used was
           approximately a fission spectrum.

CORRECTION In converting the count rates to decay rates correc-
           tions were applied for radiochemical yields, g-ray
           intensities, detector efficiencies, counting geometry,
           absorption, self-absorption, pile-up effects and
           coincidence losses.
ERR-ANALYS Main sources of errors associated in cross-section
           measurements were those associated with determination
           of fast neutron flux densities (5%) and absolute decay
           rates (4 to 10%).Other sources of error were small and
           were due to uncertainties in the number of target nuc-
           lei < 1% and in radiation and cooling times ( 1%). The
           overall error for each cross section was obtained by
           summing the indiviual errors in quadrature.
