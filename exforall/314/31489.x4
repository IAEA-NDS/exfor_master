ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) the uncertainty of the average intensity,
           was calculated from the uncertainty of each individual
           value (of the set to be averaged) by error propagation
           and including the systematic error of 1.0% of the
            sample preparation (see ERR-1).
