TITLE      Thermal neutron activation cross sections for the
           isomeric states in odd Indium isotopes and the J
           selection rule.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation cross sections for the two isomeric
           states were measured using a 2pi flow counter for the
           long-lived and the pulsed activation method for the
           shortlived isomer.
ERR-ANALYS No error analysis given.

           indium layer evaporated on thin aluminum foils.
MONITOR    Gold calibration standards (0.14mg/cm**2) prepared in
           same way as sample.
DECAY-DATA (49-IN-114-M,49.D,B)
CORRECTION Corrections for beta absorptions were made.

REACTION   (49-IN-113(N,G)49-IN-114,PAR,SIG,,MXW)
FACILITY   (REAC,CHOPS) Rossendorf research reactor.
SAMPLE     The in2-03 target used contained 71mg/cm**2 Indium
           enriched to seventy percent In-113.
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR) Germanium-Lithium and Sodium Iodide.
ANALYSIS   Value given is weighted average of values obtained
            relative to Na(3.5+-0.3b) and In115(2.4+-0.3b)
            standards.

EN-SEC     (E-EXC,49-IN-114) Half-live of excited state is
           .042 sec.
ERR-ANALYS The large limits of error are caused by a systematic
           deviation of the two methods used.
