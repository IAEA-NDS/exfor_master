INC-SOURCE (D-T) TiT target, 0.478 mg/cm**2 thick, was bombarded
           with 127.5 keV deuterons. The sample was placed at
           45 degrees with respect to the deuteron beam axis and
           at distances of 50, 80 and 100 mm from the end of the
           tit target.
METHOD     (ASSOP) the neutron flux was determined with
           the associated alpha particle method.
SAMPLE     Disc-shaped iron samples, 15 mm in diameter and
           0.2 mg/cm**2 thick. Chemical purity was 99.999%.
CORRECTION Corrections have been applied for geometry, self-
           absorption, energetic beta particles, dead time,
           true-coincidence losses, detector background and
           decay during counting-time intervals.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main factors determining the total
           experimental error of 3% were:
           (ERR-1) the experimental error for the determination of
                the fast neutron flux with the associated particle
                method (1.5%)
           (ERR-2) the experimental error in the measurement of
                   the target-iron foil distance (1.5%).
           (ERR-3) the experimental error in the determination of
                the induced gamma activity of the iron samples
                (1.6%).

           Cockroft-Walton: tit target, 0.478 mg/cm**2 thick,
           was bombarded with 146 keV deuterons. Neutron energy
           was selected by the angular position of the sample
           with respect to the direction of the incident deuteron
           beam.
           Van de Graaff: TiT target 1.90 mg/cm*82 thick was
           irradiated with 1., 1.5 and 2 MeV deuterons.
           in both cases the neutron flux was measured by a
           Si(n,alpha) detector.
SAMPLE     Stainless steel samples, 20 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm
           thick.
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG) at En = 14.616 MeV.
MONIT-REF  (31479002,F.Fuga,J,NIM/A,309,(3),500,199111)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The experimental error of 5% for the deter-
           mination of the excitation function was mainly due to:
           (MONIT-ERR) the error in the determination of the
                monitor cross section (3%).
           (ERR-1) the experimental error for the geometry of the
                experiment (1.1%)
           (ERR-2) the experimental error in the determination of
                the fast neutron flux (3.5%).
