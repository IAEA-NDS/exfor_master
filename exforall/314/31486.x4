TITLE      Measurement of differential elastic and inelastic
           scattering cross sections of C-12.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRBNU) 400 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Circle slab, 20 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The neutron detector consisted of an ST-451
           liquid scintillator with an XP-2041 photomultiplier.
           The associated alpha particles were recorded by a
           plastic scintillator at 135 deg. with respect to the
           deuteron beam direction.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for the anisotropy of the
           incident neutron fluence, fluence attenuation, multiple
           scattering, finite geometry and dead time.
ERR-ANALYS The the total error (4.0%-6.5%) of the data includes
           the statistical error and the efficiency calibration
           error.
STATUS     Data were taken from the text of Chin. Journ. of Nucl.
           Phys., Vol. 17. No. 2, 1995, pp. 171-173.
