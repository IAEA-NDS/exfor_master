INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutron production target consisted of a gas
           cell. The deuteron beam was chopped and bunched to
           produce 1 ns bursts at a frequency of 4 MHz.
SAMPLE     100 g natural distilled water contained in a right-
           circular cylinder aluminium container with symmetry
           axis perpendicular to the reaction plane.
METHOD     (TOF) The time-of-flight method was used to discrimi-
           nate the neutrons and gamma-rays and to eliminate
           events not associated with prompt gamma-rays. The
           back ground spectrum was obtained from the NaI spec-
           trum gated by a window equivalent in width to the
           gamma-ray peak window, at constant background in the
           TOF spectrum.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two plastic-NaI anticoincidence shielded
           spectrometers.

CORRECTION The gamma spectrum was corrected for background.
           Also corrections were made, by a Monte Carlo code,
           for finite geometry, gamma-ray attenuation, neutron
           attenuation and multiple scattering in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No error analysis given.
