TITLE      THE MEASUREMENT OF THE O-16(N,GAMMA)O-17 REACTION AT
           THE PYGMY RESONANCE REGION.
FACILITY   (VDGT) HI-13 TANDEM ACCELERATOR, CIAE.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) NEUTRON PRODUCTION TARGET CONSISTED OF A GAS
           CELL. THE DEUTERON BEAM WAS CHOPPED AND BUNCHED TO
           PRODUCE 1 NS BURSTS AT A FREQUENCY OF 4 MHZ.
SAMPLE     100 G NATURAL DISTILLED WATER CONTAINED IN A RIGHT-
           CIRCULAR CYLINDER ALUMINIUM CONTAINER WITH SYMMETRY
           AXIS PERPENDICULAR TO THE REACTION PLANE.
METHOD     (TOF) THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHOD WAS USED TO DISCRIMI-
           NATE THE NEUTRONS AND GAMMA-RAYS AND TO ELIMINATE
           EVENTS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PROMPT GAMMA-RAYS. THE
           BACK GROUND SPECTRUM WAS OBTAINED FROM THE NAI SPEC-
           TRUM GATED BY A WINDOW EQUIVALENT IN WIDTH TO THE
           GAMMA-RAY PEAK WINDOW, AT CONSTANT BACKGROUND IN THE
           TOF SPECTRUM.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) TWO PLASTIC-NAI ANTICOINCIDENCE SHIELDED
           SPECTROMETERS.
CORRECTION THE GAMMA SPECTRUM WAS CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND.
           ALSO CORRECTIONS WERE MADE, BY A MONTE CARLO CODE,
           FOR FINITE GEOMETRY, GAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION, NEUTRON
           ATTENUATION AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN THE SAMPLE.
ERR-ANALYS NO ERROR ANALYSIS GIVEN.
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM AUTHOR (PRIVATE COMMUNICATION).
