TITLE      Recent progress on 14 MeV neutron activation cross
           section measurements.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense neutron generator
PART-DET   (DG)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T-Ti target with thickness = 0.9mg/cm**2
           Average deuteron energy = 125 keV
           Beam current intensity = 20 mA
           neutron yield: about (1-3)x 10**12 neutrons/sec;
           neutron flux monitored by a uranium fission chamber;
           neutron energies at sample positions were determined
           by cross section ratios of the Zr-90(n,2n)Zr-89-m+g
           and Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92-m reactions.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  CH8403 coaxial high purity Ge(Li) detector
           Relative efficiency was 20 %
           Energy resolution was about 3 keV (1.33 MeV)
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the effect of neutron fluence
           fluctuation, gamma-ray self absorption in the sample,
           coincidence sum effect in the investigated nuclide,
           counting geometry.
