SAMPLE     Sandwichlike sample of Au and P, arranged in the form
           P-Au-P-Au-P. Each foil had a thickness of 14 mu-m and
           a transmission ratio of 99%.
           There are four samples: a NaCl sample, a mixing sample
           of NaCl and P and sandwichlike sample described above.
           The NaCl sample was used for efficiency calibration.
           The mixing sample of NaCl and P was used for energy
           calibration.
FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) AEP heavy-water reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Thermal-neutron spectrum. The neutron fluence rate at
           the sample position was 2. x 10**6 n/cm2/s and the
           Cd ratio was 200.

METHOD     (STTA,GSPEC) Gamma-spectra were measured
DETECTOR   (HPGE,NAICR,GELI)
           1) a 'three crystal pair spectrometer' consisting
              of a HPGe as central detector and two cylindrical
              NaI(Tl) as outside detectors.
           2) A GeLi detector
           3) a HPGe detector
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error includes:
             * errors of the peak areas,
             * errors of the absolute intensities of the
                                                   Au gamma-rays,
             * the capture cross section error of Au and
             * error in the absolute intensity of the
                                   6786.38 keV gamma-ray of P-31.

ANALYSIS   The absolute partial cross section of the 6786.35 keV
           gamma-ray transition from the 7936 to the 1149 level
           was deduced from the Au-197(n,g) monitor cross section
           and four neighbouring gamma peaks of Au.
