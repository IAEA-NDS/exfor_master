FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD, DUE TO THE DEUTERON
           ENERGY LOSS IN THE T-TI TARGET AND THE GEOMETRICAL
           CONDITIONS, WAS ABOUT 150 KEV.
SAMPLE     NO INFORMATION
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA/DE) PROTONS WERE COUNTED RECOI-
           LING AT 10 DEGREES FROM A POLYETHYLENE TARGET IN A
           CSI(TL) SCINTILLATOR.
MONIT-REF  (,S.J.BAME JR+,J,RSI,28,997,57)
DETECTOR   (TELES)
           (COIN,PROPC,PROPC,SOLST) OPERATION IS BASED ON THE
           TRIPLE COINCIDENCE OF TWO PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AS
           DE/DX-DETECTORS AND ONE TANDEM SURFACE-BARRIER SI DE-
           TECTOR AS E-DETECTOR.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD,INTED) FOR PROTON ENERGIES LOWER THAN 3-4 MEV
           CALCULATED VALUES WERE USED, THE CALCULATED SPECTRUM
           BEING NORMALIZED TO THE MEASURED ANGLE-INTEGRATED
           SPECTRUM AT HIGHER ENERGIES.
