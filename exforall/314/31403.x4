INC-SOURCE (D-D) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A DEUTERIUM
           GAS CELL ( 4.3 ATM.) WITH A 7.4 MEV PULSED DEUTERON
           BEAM.
SAMPLE     NATURAL URANIUM ELECTRO-DEPOSITED ON BOTH SIDES OF 0.2
           MM THICK PLATES OF STAINLESS STEEL WITH DEPOSITION
           THICKNESS OF ABOUT 0.5 MG/CM**2.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE DETECTED BY A
           PARALLEL-PLATE IONIZATION CHAMBER WHICH OPERATED IN
           MULTI-SEGMENT MODE AND WAS FILLED WITH PURE METHANE AT
           A PRESSURE OF 4.3 ATM. FISSION NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED
           BY TWO LIQUID SCINTILLATORS BOTH PLACED AT 100 DEGREES
           WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT NEUTRON BEAM AND AT 2.3 M
           FROM THE IONIZATION CHAMBER.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,PSD)  THE INCIDENT-NEUTRON TOF SPECTRUM WAS
           OBTAINED FROM THE FISSION-FRAGMENT EVENT SIGNALS WITH
           THE PULSED-BEAM TOF METHOD. A LIQUID SCINTILLATOR,
           LOCATED AT 0 DEG AND 3.1 M DOWN STREAM OF THE GAS CELL
           SERVED AS MONITOR OF THE INCIDENT-NEUTRON TOF SPECTRUM.
           FISSION NEUTRONS WERE SELECTED BY REQUIRING COINCIDENCE
           BETWEEN NEUTRON DETECTOR-  AND FISSION-FRAGMENT DETEC-
           TOR EVENTS, WHICH ALSO PROVIDED THE FISSION-NEUTRON TOF
           SPECTRA. EVENTS INDUCED BY 10 MEV INCIDENT NEUTRONS
           WERE SOFTWARE SELECTED BY GATING THE TOF SPECTRUM OF
           SECUNDARY NEUTRONS WITH THE 10 MEV PEAK OF THE INCIDENT
           NEUTRON SPECTRUM. PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION WAS
           APPLIED TO ELIMINATE GAMMA-RAY BACKGROUND.
ANALYSIS   THE MEASURED SPECTRUM WAS FITTED BY A MAXWELLIAN
           DISTRIBUTION.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERROR REFERS TO THE UNCERTAINTIES DUE TO COUNTING
           STATISTICS AND DETERMINATION OF DETECTOR EFFICIENCY.
