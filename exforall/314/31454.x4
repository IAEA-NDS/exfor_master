           (J,CST,29,294,1995) Preliminary results of Eu-151 data
             in Fig.6.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP) CIAE tandem accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The gas target had a length of 3.5 cm and a
           pressure of 0.75-0.80 MPa. Appr. monoenergetic
           neutrons of 9.5 and 9.9 MeV were produced. The
           target-sample distances were resp. 0.8 and 1.2 cm.
SAMPLE     The samples ( 2 cm in diameter) were arranged in the
           following order: Au(0.1 mm, 1.5 g), Ag(0.5 mm, 1.5 g),
           Au, HfO2(5.1 mm, 8.2 g), Au, TbO3(2.0 mm, 2.58 g), Au,
           Eu2O3(2.45 mm, 1.5 g), Au, Ni(0.2 mm, 0.5 g),
           Al(0.4 mm, 0.34 g), Au, Ni, Re(0.1 mm, 0.6 g), Ni,
           Zn(0.45 mm, 1.0 g), Ni. The powder of Eu2O3, Tb2O3 and
           HfO2 was pressed into tablets and packed by nylon film.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196,,SIG) Using this monitor
           reaction, which is nearly the same in threshold and of
           very similar shape in excitation function with the
           reactions investigated, the effect of low energy
           neutrons could be reduced strongly.
