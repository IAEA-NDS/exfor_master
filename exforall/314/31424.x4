SAMPLE     A known weight of thorium nitrate was first dissolved
           in 10 cm**3 distilled water and 0.25 cm**3 of this
           solution was deposited on some Lexan plastics and
           dried with an infrared lamp.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) Uranyl nitrate samples were
           prepared in the same way and under the same conditions
           as the thorium nitrate samples.
MONIT-REF  (,P.H.White+,J,JNE,21,671,1967)
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDBHU)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron flux 3. x 10**6 n/cm3/sec
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Pieces of Lexan plastic, 200 micrometer thick
           and with an area of 1 cm**2. After irradiation the
           plastic pieces were etched in 6.25 N NaOH solution.
           In each plastic foil an equal area was scanned.
ANALYSIS   From the average ratio of track densities on both
           U-238 and Th-232 coated plastics, which were irradia-
           ted for different lengths of time, the ratio of
           neutron-induced fission cross sections of Th-232 to
           U-238 was determined.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No error analysis given.
