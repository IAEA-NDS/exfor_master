SAMPLE     A KNOWN WEIGHT OF THORIUM NITRATE WAS FIRST DISSOLVED
           IN 10 CM**3 DISTILLED WATER AND 0.25 CM**3 OF THIS
           SOLUTION WAS DEPOSITED ON SOME LEXAN PLASTICS AND
           DRIED WITH AN INFRARED LAMP.
MONITOR    (92-U-232(N,F),,SIG) URANYL NITRATE SAMPLES WERE
           PREPARED IN THE SAME WAY AND UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS
           AS THE THORIUM NITRATE SAMPLES.

METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) PIECES OF LEXAN PLASTIC, 200 MICROMETER THICK
           AND WITH AN AREA OF 1 CM**2. AFTER IRRADIATION THE
           PLASTIC PIECES WERE ETCHED IN 6.25 N NAOH SOLUTION.
           IN EACH PLASTIC FOIL AN EQUAL AREA WAS SCANNED.
ANALYSIS   FROM THE AVERAGE RATIO OF TRACK DENSITIES ON BOTH
           U-232 AND TH-232 COATED PLASTICS, WHICH WERE IRRADIA-
           TED FOR DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TIME, THE RATIO OF
           NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF TH-232 TO
           U-232 WAS DETERMINED.
ERR-ANALYS NO ERROR ANALYSIS GIVEN.
