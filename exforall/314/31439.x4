CORRECTION Corrections have been made for coincidence summing
           and ranged between 2 and 48%. The coincidence summing
           correction factors for the lines of interest were ob-
           tained from the known decay schemes and the total
           efficiency of the detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Reported uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of the detector efficiency - 6%
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are from table 1 of Z. Phys. A, vol. 345,

COMMENT    By authors in the publication: The presented values
           of the 152Sm(n,p)152gPm and 152Sm(n,p)152m1Pm cross
           sections might differ from the true values, since
           the existence of an unobserved strongly converted
           isomeric transition is not excluded.
