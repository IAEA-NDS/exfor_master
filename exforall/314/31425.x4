TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE FISSION CROSS SECTION RATIO FOR
           NP-237/U-235 AROUND 14 MEV NEUTRON ENERGIES.

SAMPLE     481 MICROGRAM U-235 AND 418 MICROGRAM NP-237, AS
           TETRAFLUORIDES, WERE DEPOSITED ONTO AL HOLDERS.
           THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION FOR URANIUM WAS (%):
           ------------------------------------------------
           U-234              U-235              U-236
           .0010              99.9955            .0035
           AND FOR NEPTUNIUM:
           ------------------------------------------------
           NP-237             PU-239             AM-241
           99.9917            .0078              .0005
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) FAST NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY 180 KEV
           DEUTERONS. NEUTRON ENERGY WAS SELECTED BY PLACING
           THE CHAMBER AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH RESPECT
           TO THE DEUTERON BEAM.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) LOW-MASS, DOUBLE IONIZATION CHAMBER, PLACED
           AT A DISTANCE OF 7 CM FROM THE BEAM SPOT ON THE
           TRITIUM TARGET. THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED BACK TO BACK
           IN THE CHAMBER. AT EACH NEUTRON ENERGY MEASUREMENTS
           WERE DONE WITH TWO ORIENTATIONS: NP-237 SAMPLE FACING
           THE NEUTRON SOURCE AND THE SAME FOR THE NP-237
           SAMPLE AS TO AVERAGE OUT THE EFFECTS OF GEOMETRY,
           NEUTRON SCATTERING IN THE SUPPORT PLATES BETWEEN THE
           DEPOSITS AND THE MOMENTUM TRANSFER.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FISSION FRAGMENT LOSS
           IN THE SAMPLES (1.8%), FOR LOSS OF THE PULSES UNDER
           THE BASE LINE BY EXTRAPOLATION OF THE FRAGMENT
           PULSE-HEIGHT SPECTRUM TO ZERO ENERGY (2-4%) AND FOR
           THERMAL AND EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS (1%).
ERR-ANALYS THE ERROR ( 4.3-4.4%) IN THE RATIOS OF FISSION CROSS
           SECTIONS INCLUDES THE STATISTICAL ERROR (.6-.8%),
           THE ERROR IN THE CORRECTION FOR LOSS OF PULSES UNDER
           THE BASELINE (.4-.8%) AND THE ERROR IN THE CORRECTION
           FOR FISSION FRAGMENT LOSS IN SAMPLE DEPOSITS (.18%).
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM TABLE 3 IN ACTA PHYSICA HUNGARIA,
           VOL. 65 (2-3), PP. 271-275 (1989).
