           Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
           (P-T)
           During irradiation the samples were mounted on the
           surface of a Al-ring with the neutron source at its
           center and at different angles with respect to the
           proton beam for neutron energy selection.
SAMPLE     The samples were made by pressing oxide of natural
           Samarium into tablets of 20 mm in diameter and 2 mm
           in thickness.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  105 cm**3 HPGe detector.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The fluctuation of
           neutron fluence during irradiation was recorded by a
           long counter placed at an angle of 0 deg with a dis-
           tance of 220 mm from the target.

CORRECTION Corrections have been made for gamma-ray self absorp-
           tion in the samples and gold foils, neutron fluence
           fluctuations, variation of g-ray efficiency caused by
           the variation of sample-to-detector distance, neutron
           scattering background, and the coincidence sum effect
           for Sm-153.
ERR-ANALYS The main uncertainties of the cross sections include:
           - error of efficiency of g-ray full energy peak  2.5%
           - error in counting statistics             0.8 - 1.7%
           - error in decay schemes                           2%
           - error in correction of g-ray self-absorption     1%
           - error in neutron scattering background         0.5%
           - error in weight and purity of the samples      0.5%
           - error in correction of coincidence-sum effect  0.5%
           - error in standard cross sections           3 - 4.5%
STATUS     Data were taken from table 2 of Chin. Journ. of Nucl.
           Phys., Vol. 16. No. 3, 1994, pp. 275-277.
