TITLE      Measurement of neutron capture cross section
           for Sm-152.

FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBNU) 4.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at
           Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  target LiF 0.2 mg/cm2 thick
           (P-T)    target T-Ti 1.5 mg/cm2 thick
           During irradiation the samples were mounted on the
           surface of a Al-ring with the neutron source at its
           center and at different angles with respect to the
           proton beam for neutron energy selection.
SAMPLE     The samples were made by pressing oxide of natural
           samarium into tablets of 20 mm in diameter and 2 mm
           in thickness.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  105 cm**3 HPGe detector.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The fluctuation of
           neutron fluence during irradiation was recorded by a
           long counter placed at an angle of 0 deg with a dis-
           tance of 220 mm from the target.

CORRECTION Corrections have been made for:
             * gamma-ray self absorption in the samples and
                                                     gold foils,
             * neutron fluence fluctuations,
             * variation of gamma-ray efficiency caused by
           the variation of sample-to-detector distance,
             * neutron scattering background, and
             * the coincidence sum effect for Sm-153.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main uncertainties of the cross sections
                    include:
           (ERR-1) error of efficiency of gamma-ray full
                                            energy peak  2.5%
           (ERR-S,0.8,1.7) error in counting statistics 0.8 - 1.7%
           (ERR-2) error in decay schemes                      2%
           (ERR-3) error in correction of gamma-ray
                                           self-absorption     1%
           (ERR-4) error in neutron scattering background    0.5%
           (ERR-5) error in weight and purity of the samples 0.5%
           (ERR-6) error in correction of coincidence-sum
                                                     effect  0.5%
           (ERR-7,3.,4.5) error in standard cross sections
                                                        3 - 4.5%
