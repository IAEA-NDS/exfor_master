TITLE      STUDY OF PROMPT NEUTRON SPECTRUM IN LOW ENERGY PORTION
           FOR CF-252 AND CM-248 SPONTANEOUS FISSION.

INSTITUTE  (3CPRBJG)
REFERENCE  (C,89WASH,2,951,8904) NUMERICAL DATA, AFTER SOME
           CORRECTIONS STILL PRELIMINARY.
           (C,88MITO,,755,8805) PRELIMINARY, GRAPH ONLY.
           (C,91BEIJIN,,73,9109) SAME AS 89WASH, GRAPH ONLY.
SAMPLE     THE CF-252 SOURCE WAS MADE BY MEANS OF TRANSFUSION IN
           VACUUM ON A HIGHLY POLISHED STAINLESS STEEL DISC AND
           HAD AN INTENSITY OF 3.8 * 10**3 F/S.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) THE FISSION FRAGMENT DETECTOR IS A MINI-
           ION CHAMBER, THE NEUTRON DETECTOR A NE912 GLASS
           DETECTOR MATCHED WITH A RCA8850 PHOTOTUBE. THE NEUTRON
           DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO
           CODE. THE RESULT WAS COMPARED WITH RELATIVELY MEASURED
           DATA FOR A DETECTOR WITH THE SAME SIZE.
METHOD     (TOF) FLIGHT PATH WAS 30 CM.
CORRECTION THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE CONSIDERED:
            - SCATTERING ON PREAMPLIFIER ( MEASURED  1%).
            - THE SCATTERING ON AIR COLUMN BETWEEN THE TWO
              DETECTORS ( 0.5% AS ESTIMATED BY A MONTE-CARLO
              CALCULATION).
            - THE SCATTERING ON THE CF-252 SOURCE BACKING
              ( MEASURED  <1%).
            - THE SCATTERING IN THE ENVIRONMNT ( MEASURED USING
              A SHADOW BAR).
            - THE CORRECTION FOR DELAYED GAMMA-RAYS WAS
              CALCULATED IN THE TIME RANGE 30 - 100 NS.
HISTORY    (921019C)  HW
STATUS     (PRELM) DATA ARE TAKEN FROM ' 50 YEARS NUCL. FISSION
            CONF.', WASHINGTON D.C.,1989,P.951.TABLE 1 (RATIO'S)
