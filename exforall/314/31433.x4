FACILITY   (CCW) INTENSE NEUTRON GENERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A T-TI
           TARGET WITH 125 KEV DEUTERONS. THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS
           DETERMINED BY THE METHOD OF CROSS-SECTION RATIOS FOR
           ZR AND NB.
SAMPLE     THE CADMIUM SAMPLE WAS 30 MM IN DIAMETER, 99.99% IN
           CHEMICAL PURITY AND 0.8 MM THICK.IT WAS SANDWICHED BE-
           TWEEN TWO NIOBIUM FOILS OF THE SAME DIAMETER.
