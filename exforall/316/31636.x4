TITLE      Measurement of differential and angle-integrated
           cross sections of the 64Zn(n,alpha)61Ni reaction at
           5.0 and 6.0 MeV

FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the
           institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.
SAMPLE     The two 64zn samples were set back-to-back, it
           a11ows to registrate the forward (0. to 90.degr.)
           and backward (90. to 180.degr.) a1pha events at the
           same time. The thickness of the Zn targets was
           266.3 mu-g/cm2 and the mass was 4.05 +- 0.05 mg for
           each sample. The abudance of 64Zn was 99.4%. Each
           sample was evaporated on a tantalum backing 4.8 cm in
           diameter and 50 mu -m in thickness. For background
           measurement, there were two tanta1um films back-to
           -back were used. A 238U fission foil was placed at
           the backward. The purity of the sample was 99.999%.
           The mass and the diameter of the sample were
           7.85 +- 0.10 mg.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The twin grid ionization chamber was
           constructed at Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics,
           Dubna Russia.
           (BF3) A relatively calibrated BF3 long counter was
           used as a neutron flux monitor. The absolute neutron
           flux for 5.0 MeV was determined by counting the 238U
           fission fragments. The 238U(n,f) cross section was
           taken from the ENDF/B-VI library.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Approximate to monoenergetic neutrons were
           produced through the D(d,n) 3He reaction with a
           deuterium gas target 2.0 cm in length and 3.2-3.5 atm
           in pressure.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The scale errors come from:
            * the uncertainty of neutron flux determination
            * the error of the 64Zn atom number (1.2%).
           The uncertainty of neutron flux determination at
            5.0 MeV is 3.6%. and at 6.0 MeV 4.2%, respectively
            (including the uncertainty of the fission counts 2.2%,
            the error of the reference cross section at
            5.0 MeV 2.6%, the 238U atom number error l.3%,
           and the BF3 relative efficiency shape error
           in 5-6 MeV range 2.0%).
