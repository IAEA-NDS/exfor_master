FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the
           institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Approximate to monoenergetic neutrons were
            produced through the D(d,n)3He reaction with a
            deuterium gas target 2.0 cm in length and 3.2-3.5 atm
            in pressure.
SAMPLE     The two 64Zn samples were set back-to-back, it allows
            to registrate the forward (0. to 90.deg.) and
             backward (90. to 180.deg.) alpha events at the same
             time.
           The thickness of the Zn targets was 266.3 ug/cm2 and
            the mass was 4.05 +- 0.05 mg for each sample.
           The abundance of 64Zn was 99.4%. Each sample was
            evaporated on a tantalum backing 4.8 cm in diameter
            and 50 um in thickness.
           For background measurement, there were two tantalum
            films back-to -back were used.
           A 238U fission foil was placed at the backward.
           The purity of the sample was 99.999%.
           The mass and the diameter of the sample were 7.85 +/-
            0.10 mg.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The twin grid ionization chamber was
            constructed at Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics,
            Dubna Russia.
           (BF3) A relatively calibrated BF3 long counter was
            used as a neutron flux monitor.
           The absolute neutron flux for 5.0 MeV was determined
            by counting the 238U fission fragments.
           The 238U(n,f) cross section was taken from the
            ENDF/B-VI library.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The scale errors come from:
           (ERR-1)  - number of the atoms in 64Zn (1.2%)
                    - neutron flux determination
                      3.6% (5.0 MeV) and 4.2% (6.0 MeV)
                      (including the uncertainty of the fission
                      counts 2.2%, the error of the reference
                      cross section at 5.0 MeV 2.6%, the 238U
                      atom number error l.3%, and the BF3
                      relative efficiency shape error in 5-6 MeV
                      range 2.0%).
