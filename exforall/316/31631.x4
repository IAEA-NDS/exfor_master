TITLE      Measurement of thermal neutron cross sections of the

SAMPLE     About 4-10 Bq of 126Sn carried by PbS precipitate
           was used as target, because PbS does not produce any
           gamma-emitting nuclide on irradiation, and can
           co-precipitate 126Sn completely. The PbS (126Sn) was
           deposited on the bottom of the polyethylene box as a
           thin layer. The polyethylene box was sealed and
           housed in an Al can together with the neutron flux
           monitors 197Au and 55Mn.
           The number of the 126Sn atoms in the samples were
           determined by the activities of the 126Sn beta-decay
           product Sb-126m and Sb-126g. The sample was aged for 75
           days to reach secular equilibrium.
INC-SOURCE The thermal neutron fluxes of three irradiation runs
           were found to be 2.09x10**13 n/cm2/s, 1.77x10**13
           n/cm2/s and 2.02x10**13 n/cm2/s, respectively, by
           using the neutron activation equation.
