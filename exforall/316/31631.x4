SAMPLE     About 4-10 Bq of 126Sn carried by PbS precipitate
           was used as target, because PbS does not produce any
           gamma-emitting nuclide on irradiation, and can
           co-precipitate 126Sn completely. The PbS (126Sn) was
           deposited on the bottom of the polyethylene box as a
           thin layer. The polyethylene box was sealed and
           housed in an Al can together with the neutron flux
           monitors 197Au and 55Mn.
INC-SOURCE The thermal neutron fluxes of three irradiation runs
           were found to be 2.09x10**13 n/cm2/s, 1.77x10**13
           n/cm2/s and 2.02x10**13 n/cm2/s, respectively, by
           using the neutron activation equation.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty consists of the average
           deviation of cross sections from three targets, the
           error of hal-flife of 126Sn, the error of the thermal
           neutron flux, etc.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The largest uncertainty of 26.2% comes from
           11.9% in the average deviation in two targets, 2.8%
           from the error in 127Sb radioactivitiy, 4.7% from
           the uncertainty in the thermal neutron flux, etc.
