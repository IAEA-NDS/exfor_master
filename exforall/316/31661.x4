FACILITY   (LINAC,3CPRNPC) the K-400 Neutron Generator at
           Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) and
           lasted 2 to 3 h with a yield ~4 to 5 x 10**10 n/s.
SAMPLE     About 6 g of Os powder of natural isotopic
           composition (99.95% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter,
           was obtained. Two such pellets were prepared.
           Monitor foils of Nb (99.99% pure, 0.2 mm thick) of
           the same diameter as the pellets were then attached
           in the front and at the back of each sample.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He reaction
           with an effective deuteron beam energy of 134 keV and
           beam current of 230 mu-A. The tritium-titanium (T-Ti)
           target used in the generator was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
           The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections could be made for small
           variations in the yield.
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG) Cross sections for
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reaction were selected as monitors to
           measure the reaction cross section on several Os
           isotopes.
           The neutron energies in these measurements were
           determined by cross section ratios for the
           90Zr(n,2n)89m+gZr and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reactions
           (40-ZR-90(N,2N)40-ZR-89,,SIG)

MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) - cross sections for
                                  normalization.
           (,V.E.Lewis,J,NIM,174,141,1980) The neutron energies
           were determined.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (ORTEC,
           model GEM 60P, Crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, Crystal
           length: 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of ~68 %
           and an energy  resolution of 1.69 keV at1332 keV for
           60Co. The efficiency of the detector was pre-calibrated
           using various standard gamma-sources.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main error sources are:
           (ERR-1) standard cross sections uncertainties (2%),
           (ERR-2) weight of samples (0.1%),
           (ERR-3) self-absorption of gamma-ray (0.5%),
            * counting statistics (0.1-15%),
            * detector efficiency (2-3%),
            * the coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays
             (0.0-5%), the uncertainties of irradiation,
            * cooling and measuring times (0.1-1%), etc.
           Some other minor error contribution from the parameters
           of the measured and standard nuclei, such as,
           uncertainties of the branching ratio of the
           characteristic gamma rays, uncertainties of the half
           life of the radioactive product nuclei and so on,
           have also been considered.
