FACILITY   (LINAC,3ARGCAB) at the Bariloche electron linear
                           accelerator facility.
SAMPLE     The sample consisted of a square foil of natural
           isotopic composition indium, 99.99% purity, 10 cm
           side and 0.95 mm thick, placed in the neutron beam,
           726 cm from the neutron source.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The gamma emissions were detected with a 30 cm3
            Canberra coaxial Ge(Li) detector placed 14.3 cm
           below the sample position, out of the neutron beam.
           A 10 cm lead shadow placed on an iron table provided
           reduction of prompt and activation gammas from the
           surroundings.
METHOD     (TOF,EXTB)
MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,G)49-IN-116,,SPC,,MXW)

           Intensity per 1000 neutron captures employing as
           reference the peak area of the 273 keV gamma-ray
           reported in Rabenstein et al.(1972).
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) the bremsstrahlung photons produce fast
           neutrons by photonuclear effect when the 25 MeV
           electron pulse impinges on a lead target.
INC-SPECT   Thermal capture gamma spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Author's comment:
              The energy uncertainties are dominated by
             the energy resolution of the employed detector.
             The reported uncertainties were calculated as the
             FWHM of the observed peaks. These uncertainties are
             conservative because are greater than the errors of
             the energy calibration. The energy uncertainties are
             not afected by the statistics of the spectra. On the
             other side, the peak intensities uncertainties are
            dominated by the statistics of the spectra.

FLAG       (1.) The lines correspond to emissions reported as
           multiplets in the references for thermal neutrons,not
           resolved in this work. In these cases it was reported
           total intensity observed for the unresolved multiplets.
