TITLE      Measurements of the thermal neutron cross-sections
           and resonance integrals for 186W(n,gamma)187W  and
           98Mo(n,gamma)99Mo reactions

INC-SOURCE 2200 m/s neutrons
SAMPLE     Natural W, Mo, and Zr metallic foils of the purity
           99.99%;  and 0.23 mm, 0.15 mm and 125 mu-m in
           thickness altogether  with Au samples which are
           diluted in Al (0.1%) were  wrapped with aluminum
           foils and irradiated without Cd  shield in two
           different positions at the ETRR-2. The irradiation
           time varied from 2 to 3 h.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The  gamma ray spectra were collected using a
           p-type coaxial  EG&G Ortec HPGe detector, with 29.4%
           relative efficiency  and 1.66 keV FWHM at 1332.5 keV
           of 60Co.
ANALYSIS   The  neutron spectrum parameters characterizing the
           irradiation  positions f and alpha were determined
           using the activated sets  198Au, 97Zr/97Nb and
           95Zr/95Nb.
METHOD     The thermal neutron cross-sections and resonance
           integrals  of the 186W(n,gamma)187W and
           98Mo(n,gamma)99Mo reactions were  determined via
           neutron irradiation without Cd shield in two
           different neutron irradiation positions instead of
           the traditional  method of irradiation with and
           without Cd shield in  one neutron irradiation position.
CORRECTION Neutron self shielding and the deviation from the
           1/E law corrections were taken into account.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty for  thermal cross-
           sections and resonance integrals are found  less than
           13% of the determined values.
