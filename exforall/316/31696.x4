INC-SOURCE (AM-BE) The Am/Be neutron source from the Department
           of Applied Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the
           Rajshahi University. The active  component (A)
           consists of the alpha-emitting radionuclide 241Am
            (activity 111 GBq in 1977) alloyed with Be,and sealed
           in a  cylindrical metal capsule which was then
           covered by a graphite  layer to avoid any leak of the
           activity
           Considering the distance and the solid angle subtended
           by a sample at two positions, the flux density at that
           position was estimated to be 1.5 x 10**5 n/cm2/s.
SAMPLE     High-purity foils of several metals were cut in
           circular discs (dia. 2 cm) and irradiated either
           individually or together in a stack.  The choice of a
           foil depended on the nuclear reaction induced in it.
            The foils covered three energy regions of the neutron
           spectrum, viz. thermal, low-energy(<1.5 MeV)and high
           energy (>1.5 MeV).  Several stacks of Fe, Co, Ni and Mo
           foils were prepared and irradiated in various positions
           The duration of each irradiation was about 300h.
            Au and In foils, on the other hand, were irradiated
           individually, each for about 24h, without placing the
           active component in the paraffin shielding.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium(HPGe) gamma-ray
           detector associated  with a digital gamma
           spectrometry system (ORTECDSPEC TM)  and Maestro data
           acquisition software was used to measure radioactivity.
           Radioactivity of the  115mIn and 198Au were measured
           nondestructively at the Institute of Nuclear  Science
           and Technology(INST), Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
            The radioactivities of the relatively long-lived
           radionuclides  54Mn, 59Fe, 58Co, 92mNb and 114mIn were
           measured using a low  level HPGe  gamma-ray detector
           at the Institute fur Nuklearchemie, Forschungszentrum
           Julich, Germany.
           The efficiency versus  energy curve of the HPGe
           gamma-ray detector was determined  using the standard
           point sources 22Na, 57Co, 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs,  152Eu
           and 226Ra.
