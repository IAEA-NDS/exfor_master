TITLE      Measurement of Neutron Capture Resonance Integrals
           on Bromine Isotopes

REFERENCE  (J,NSE,159,199,2008)
FACILITY   (REAC,3ARGCAB) The RA-6 is a light water-cooled and
           moderated material test reactor-type pool reactor.
           Its maximum thermal power is 500 kW.
SAMPLE     Bromine in the form of KBr with ~99.5% purity was
           diluted. The resulting salt concentration was
            (1.2605 +- 0.0010) mg/g. Whatmann ashless filter
           papers were impregnated with the KBr
           solution. Filter papers were dried at room
           temperature. Later, each filter was rolled along
           with another nonimpregnated one and pressed inside a
           matrix, which gave it the final form of a pellet
           ~2.5 mm thick and 13 mm in diameter.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)Activity measurements were performed with a
           63-cm3 ORTEC intrinsic N-type germanium coaxial
           detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC)
           Seven irradiations were performed. Irradiation times
           ranged from ~5 to ~ 6min. Every sample and a
            (0.1003+-0.0012) wt% gold-aluminum flux monitor were
           placed inside a 1-mm-thick Cd cover.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty due to resonance integral of gold
                   used as a flux monitor
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty due to gold-aluminum concentration
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were received from Dr. E.Dorval
