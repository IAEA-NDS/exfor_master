MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG) Cross sections for
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reaction were selected as monitors to
           measure the reaction cross section on several Os
           isotopes.
           The neutron energies in these measurements were
           determined by cross section ratios for the
           90Zr(n,2n)89m+gZr and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reactions

MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) - cross sections for
                                  normalization.
           (,V.E.Lewis,J,NIM,174,141,1980) The neutron energies
           were determined.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray activity of 183mOs, 183gOs,
           190mRe, 190gRe, and 92mNb were determined by a
           high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (ORTEC,
           model GEM 60P, Crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, Crystal
           length: 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of ~68 %
           and an energy  resolution of 1.69 keV at1332 keV for
           60Co. The efficiency of the detector was pre-calibrated
           using various standard gamma-sources.
           (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities of 85mSr, 85gSr and
           92mNb were determined by a CH8403 coaxial high-purity
           germanium detector (sensitive volume 110 cm3) (made
           in the People's Republic of China) with a relative
           efficiency of 20% and an energy resolution of 3 keV at
           1.33 MeV. The efficiency of the detector was
           precalibrated using various standard gamma-sources.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main error sources are:
             * counting statistics,
             * standard cross section,
             * detector efficiency,
             * weight of samples,
             * self-absorption of gamma-rays and the coincidence
               sum effect of cascade gamma-rays,
             * measurement geometry.
           The total uncertainty in each cross section was
           obtained by combining the individual uncertainties
           in quadrature.
