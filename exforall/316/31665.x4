TITLE      Measurements of activation cross-sections for
           165Ho(n,2n)164gHo and 180W(n,2n)179gW reactions

FACILITY   (FNS,3CPRNPC) K-400 Intense Neutron Generator at the
           Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry, China
INC-SOURCE (D-T) a flux rate yield of about 3 x 10**10 -
           4x10**10 n/s. The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target
           used in the generator was about 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
SAMPLE     All the samples (holmium powder of 99.9% purity,
           tungsten powder of 99.8% purity) and columbium
           (monitor 99.99%) were made into round disks with a
           diameter of 2.0 cm, the thickness of samples was 1.5
           mm and 1.7 mm, the thickness of columbium was
           0.3-0.5 mm. Each of samples was sandwiched between
           two Nb foils.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activated samples were studied for their
           gamma-activities by a low background, high efficiency
           gamma-ray spectrometry, using a well calibrated GEM-60P
           coaxial high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (crystal
           diam.: 70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm) with a
           relative  efficiency of ~68% and an energy resolution
           of ~1.7 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainties consist:
            * mainly from statistic uncertainty (4% for tungsten),
           (ERR-1) the error of detector's efficiency (2.5%),
           (ERR-2) the errors from correction
           factors of self-absorption (3.5%)
             * the errors transmitted from the corresponding
           excited states,
             * the errors transmitted from every element,
               in formula of cross-section calculation.
           However, errors caused by the uncertainties
           of the abundance of target isotope and half-live of
           products were not calculated.
