FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRAEP) Irradiation of the samples was
           carried out at the K-400 Neutron Generator at the
           Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) and
           lasted for 128 min with a yield ~4 to 5 10**10 n/s.
SAMPLE     About 5 g of Ag of natural isotopic composition
            (99.99% pure) was made into a pellet of 0.2 cm thick
           and 2.0 cm in diameter. Three such pellets were
           prepared. Monitor foils of Al (99.999% pure, 0.04 mm
           thick) of the same diameter as the pellets were then
           attached in the front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a HPGe detector (ORTEC, model GEM - 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1mm, crystal length: 72.3mm)
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 at 1332 keV for 60Co. The
           efficiency of the detector was precalibrated using
           various standard gamma sources.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           134 keV and beam current of 230 mA. The tritium-
           titanium (T-Ti) target used in the generator was
           2.18 mg/cm2 thick. The neutron flux was monitored by
           a uranium fission chamber so that corrections could be
           made for small variations in the yield.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main error sources in our work result
           from:
            * counting statistics (0.1-13%),
            * detector efficiency (2-4%),
            * the coincidence sum effect of cascade
                                               gamma-rays (0-5%),
            * the uncertainties of irradiation, cooling and
                                        measuring times (0.1-1%),
            * the uncertainties in coincidence sum effect of
                                   cascade gamma-rays 0-5%
           (ERR-1) uncertainties due to standard cross-sections,
           (ERR-2) uncertainties in the weight of samples
           (ERR-3) uncertainties in the self-absorption of
                                                       gamma-ray
           (ERR-4) uncertainties in isotopic abundance
           etc. also, some other errors' contribution from the
           parameters of the measured nuclei and standard
           nuclei, such as uncertainties of the branching ratio
           of the characteristic gamma rays, uncertainties of
           the half-life of the radioactive product nuclei and so
           on, are all considered.
