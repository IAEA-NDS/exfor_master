SAMPLE     About 5 g of Ag of natural isotopic composition
            (99.99% pure) was made into a pellet of 0.2 cm thick
           and 2.0 cm in diameter. Three such pellets were
           prepared. Monitor foils of Al (99.999% pure, 0.04 mm
           thick) of the same diameter as the pellets were then
           attached in the front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a HPGe detector (ORTEC, model GEM - 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1mm, crystal length: 72.3mm)
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 at 1332 keV for 60Co. The
           efficiency of the detector was precalibrated using
           various standard gamma sources.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation lasted for 128 min with a yield
            ~4 to 5 10**10 n/s.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           134 keV and beam current of 230 mA. The tritium-
           titanium (T-Ti) target used in the generator was
           2.18 mg/cm2 thick. The neutron flux was monitored by
           a uranium fission chamber so that corrections could be
           made for small variations in the yield.
