FACILITY   (REAC,3BANSAV) TRIGA Mark-II research reactor at the
           Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (INST)
           of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Savar,
           Dhaka, Bangladesh. The TRIGA reactor has four
           external neutron beam tubes, namely tangential,
           radial piercing, radial-1 and radial-2 beam ports.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) monochromatic neutrons come from  Triple Axis
           Spectrometer (TAS). The neutron bean intensities
           6.9 x 10**4 +-1792 and 4.5 x 10**4 +-1170 n/cm2/sec
           were found at entrance and exit of the target,
                                                   respectively.
METHOD     (GSPEC) high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The neutron beam
           intensities at entrance and exit of the target were
           determined using Au-monitor foil

           Standart cross section for En=0.0536 eV was evaluated
           by authors using data from these references.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           detector associated with digital gamma spectrometry
           system and Maestro data acquisition software. The
           gamma-ray spectrum was analysed by GammaVision
           software. The spectrum was also analysed using the
           program Hypermet PC 5.12 and compared with that of
           GammaVision.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-S,1.,2.) Statistical uncertainty of gamma-ray
                         counting - 1-2%
           (ERR-1,1.,2.) uncertainty in decay branching
                                               ratio - 1-2%
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in efficiency calibration - 3%
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in sample mass - 0.01%
           (ERR-4) uncertainty in self-shielding factor - 0.01%
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in cross section of the
                                    monitor reaction - 2.5%
