           Academy of Engineering Physic (CAEP)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T (d,n) 4He
           reaction with a 220 KeV deuteron beam and the
           average beam current is 350 mu-A. The solid
           tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used was 2.18 mg/cm2
           in thickness.
           Irradiations were lasted from 0.5 to 1 h with a yield
           of about 3-4 x 10**10 n/s.
           The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that small variations in the yield could be
           corrected after the irradiations.
SAMPLE     High-purity NaBr (99.9%) of natural Bromine isotopes
           compositions was pressed into 20 mm diameter and
           4.78-10.78 mm thickness slices. Each NaBr sample was
           sandwiched between two Nb foils (the thickness of
           each Nb foil: less than 0.20 mm), and the purity of
           the Nb foils was better than 99.99%. One Nb foil and
           one Zr foil had been put together as a group and
           used to determine the neutron energy in the
           experiment, which were placed in front of the sample
           to be irradiated first. The Zr foils has the purity
           of 99.99% as well. The thicknesses of the samples were
           as follow: the sample placed at 0.degr. to the deuteron
           beam was 4.78 mm, 90.degr. was 5.02 mm,
           and 135.degr. was 10.78 mm.
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
           The neutron fluence in front and at the
           back of each sample was determined via the monitor
           reaction 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb, but the averaged value
           between them was adopted.
           ((40-ZR-90(N,2N)40-ZR-89,,SIG)/
           (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG))
           The neutron energies at each sample position were
           determined by the ratios of 90Zr(n,2n) 89m+gZr to
           93Nb n,2n)92mNb reaction cross sections.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) coaxial HPGe detector low background gamma-ray
           spectroscopy (ORTEC,model GEM 60P, diam.:70.1 mm,
           length:72.3 mm) with a elative efficiency of ~68% and
           an energy resolution of ~1.69 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV for
           60Co. The detection efficiency was calibrated
           beforehand using various standard c sources, which were
           Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152,
           Pb-210, Am-241 and Ra-226. The uncertainty in the
           absolute efficiency curve at 9.5 cm was estimated to
           be ~2%, and the uncertainty of the activity of the
           standard sources was ~1%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl. 2 from the ref.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main uncertainties result from:
           (ERR-S,1.,9.) the counting statistics (1.0-9.0%),
           (ERR-1) detection efficiency ( 2.0%),
           (ERR-2) standard cross section uncertainties (1.0%),
           (ERR-3) weight of samples ( 0.1%),
           (ERR-4) neutron energy ( 2.5%),
           (ERR-5,0.5,2.) self-absorption of gamma-rays (0.5-2.0%)
           (ERR-6,0.,5.) the coincidence sum effect of cascade
                                     gamma-rays (0-5%),
           (ERR-7,0.1,1.) the irradiation, cooling, and measuring
                                          times (0.1-1.0%).
           Furthermore, the uncertainties from the branching ratio
           of the characteristic gamma-rays and the half-life of
           the radioactive product nuclei were taken into account.
