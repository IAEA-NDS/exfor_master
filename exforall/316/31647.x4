FACILITY   (REAC,3BANSAV) TRIGA Mark-II research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) a monoenergetic (0.0536 eV) collimated (1.6 x
           5 cm2) neutron beam of 1.85 x 10**5 n/cm2/s for 2
           hrs at the outer end position of the last collimator.
SAMPLE     The Sm2O3 powder was pressed with a pressure of 5 tons
           per cm2 using a hydraulic press to prepare a pellet of
           0.82 g with a diameter of 1.2 cm and thickness 0.16 cm.
           The pellet was sandwiched with two pure gold foils
            (25 mu-m thick and 8 mm diameter) for irradiation.
           Two gold foils of approximately same size and weight
           were attached at the front and back of the pellet to
           determine the neutron beam attenuation along the target
           The isotopes and their natural occurrences are
           144Sm (3.1%), 147Sm (15%), 148Sm (11%), 149Sm (14%),
           150Sm (7.4%), 152Sm (27%) and 154Sm (23%).
DETECTOR   (HPGE) using high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           spectroscopy (Canberra, 15% relative efficiency,
            1.8 keV resolution at 1332.5 keV of 60Co) coupled
           with a digital gamma spectrometry system and Maestro
           data acquisition software.
METHOD     (EXTB,GSPEC)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) Value for monitor was
           evaluated from the trend line of experimental data
           reported by Yamamoto, Pavlenko, Haddad and evaluated
           cross sections reported in the ENDF/B-VII and
           JENDL-3.3 libraries (see MONIT-REF).
