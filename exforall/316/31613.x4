TITLE      Measurement of neutron capture cross sections for
           141Pr from 0.5 to 1.6 MeV

INC-SOURCE (P-T) The monoenergetic neutrons with energies of 0.54,
           1.09 and 1.59 MeV were produced via the T(p,n)3He
           reaction on a solid T-Ti target of 1.7 mg/cm2 in
           thickness.
SAMPLE     The samples were made from Pr6O11 powder (99.9% pure)
           by pressing into disks of 20 mm in diam. and about
           1.5mm in thickness (about 388.9, 396.4 and 441.1mg/cm2,
           respectively). The mass of the samples was determined
           by weighing. Each sample was sandwiched between two
           gold disks with the same diameter. The purity 99.9%
           gold disks each of 0.1 mm in thickness were used to
           measure the neutron flux on the sample.
           The sample groups were wrapped with cadmium foils of
           0.5mm in thickness.
METHOD     (STTA,GSPEC,ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe gamma-detector (105 cm3). The efficiency
           of the detector was calibrated by using a set of
           standard gamma-ray sources in the energy range of
           0.1-1.5MeV and the efficiency curve was fitted with
           the least-square method. The gamma-detection efficiency
           for 198Au was obtained from this efficiency curve. For
           the decay of 142Pr, the dominant gamma-ray is
           1575.83 keV.
           (BF3) The neutrons flux was monitored by a BF3 long
           counter placed at 0 degr.
