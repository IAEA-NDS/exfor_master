TITLE      Excitation of isomeric states in (n,gamma) reactions
AUTHOR     (Hr.Hristov,A.Mihov,M.Mitrikov,N.Balabanov,A.Antonov)
INSTITUTE  (3BULPLV)
REFERENCE  ((S,ISINN-8,82,2000)=(S,JINR-E3-2000-192,82,2000))
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) The activation was carried out by means of
           the the thermal neutrons flux of a Pu-Be source of
           strength ~ 34 Ci in water medium.
SAMPLE     Memtalic powders with chemical purity greater than
           99,9% and a natural isotope composition were used to
           prepare the targets. The powdered samples were put
           in thin plastic packets.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The activation method and the absolute -
           gamma-counting technique were used to determine the
           isomeric cross-section ratios.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe-detector (ORTEC GEM 20190) with volume
           100 cm3 and energy resolulion 1.8 keV for the line
           Egamma - 1332 keV of 60Co
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Nothing said about errors
CORRECTION The errors associated with neutron fluxes and the
           geometry of exposures and measurements were eliminated
           in determining isomeric ratios, because the isomeric
           and ground states were obtained in the same exposure
           run and the required quantities (yields or cross-
           sections) were measured for them under identical
           conditions.
