INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) The photo-neutron target was composed of ten
           Ta plates with a diameter of 4.9 cm and an effective
           thickness of 7.4 cm. There was a 0.15 cm water gap
           between Ta plates in order to cool the target
           effectively. The housing of the target was made of
           titanium.
SAMPLE     A high-purity (>99.99%) Mo foil with a natural isotopic
           composition (92Mo 14.84%, 94Mo 9.25%, 95Mo 15.92%,
           96Mo 16.68%, 97Mo 9.55%, 98Mo 24.13%, and 100Mo 9.63%)
           was used for measuring the thermal neutron cross-sect.
           and the resonance integral of the 98Mo(n,gamma)99Mo
           reaction.
           Natural Mo metallic foils were 12.7 mm in diameter and
           0.1 mm in thickness. The Au and In metallic foils were
           used as the comparator reactions and the neutron flux
           monitors, respectively.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectrometer was a p-type
           coaxial CANBERRA high-purity germanium (HPGe)-detector
           with a diameter of 59.2 mm and a thickness of 30 mm.
           The HPGe-detector was coupled to a computer- based
           multichannel analyzer with the associated electronics
            to determine the photopeak area of gamma-ray spectrum.
