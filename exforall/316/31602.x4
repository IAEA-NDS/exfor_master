METHOD     (ACTIV) the authors also used transmission method
           lower-level discriminator
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)  The target was composed, of 10 Ta plates with
           a diam. of 4.9 cm and an effective thickness of 7.4 cm
           There was a 0.15 cm water gap between Ta plates in
           order to cool the target effectively. The housing of
           the target was made of titanium. This target was set
           at the center of a cylindrical water moderator
           contained in an aluminum cylinder with thickness of
           0.5 cm, a diam. of 30 cm and height of 30 cm.
           The estimated neutron yield per kW of beam power for
           electron energies above 60 MeV at the Ta target
           is about 1.9 x 10**12 n/s
SAMPLE     Natural Hf metallic foils, 18 mm x 18 mm in area by
           0.02 mm in thickness, were used as the activation
           samples. The Au and In foils were used as the
           standard reactions and the neutron monitors.

DETECTOR   (SCIN) A 6Li-ZnS(Ag) scintillator BC702 with a diam.
           of 127 mm and a thickness of 6.35 mm mounted on an
           EMI-93090 photomultiplier was used as a detector for
           the neutron TOF spectrum measurement. Scintillator
           consists of a matrix of a lithium compound enriched to
           95% 6Li dispersed in a fine ZnS(Ag) phosphor powder.
