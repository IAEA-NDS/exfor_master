FACILITY   (ACCEL) Location of facility unknown
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 21.8 MeV neutrons via (d,t) reaction
                 with 5.25 MeV deuterons incident on a tritium
                 gas cell
SAMPLE     Positioned 12.0 cm from the center of tritium cell.
           It was in the form of a 15 mg/cm2 foil enriched to 97%
           90Zr with an effective surface area of 1.0*1.0 cm, and
           sandwiched between proportional counters A/C0 and PC1.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Three multiwire proportional counters
                   (A/C0, PC1, PC2) followed by scintillator,
                   act as an Delta-E detector
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator, act as an E detector
METHOD     (EDE)
EN-SEC     (E-LVL,39-Y-89) Excited energy of the residual Y-89
ADD-RES    (COMP) DWBA performed with the code DWUCK4.
                  See article for optical potential form and
                  the optical potential parameters used.
