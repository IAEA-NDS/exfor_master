FACILITY   (ACCEL,3BULBLA) the SAMES 150D neutron generator.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Two arrays of 3He proportional counters with
           diameters 125 and 190 mm respectively, are imbedded
           in a cylindrical polyethylene moderator 405 mm in
           diam. and 420 mm in length, h, around a centra] hole
           76 mm in diam.. The first array consists of six 10-atm
           counters of the LND type and the second one - of twelve
           SNM-18 3-atm counters. Each counter is served by its
           own preampiifier and discriminator.
           The detector efficicncy in registering neutrons for
           these two cases was 28.4+-0.6% and 34.2+-0.8%,
           rcspectively.
           (SIBAR) The flux of neutrons emitted by the Ti-T target
           of the neutron generator was measured by registering
           particles  with the Si-Au surface-bamer detector.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The flux of neutrons emitted by the Ti-T target
METHOD     (COINC) The experimental data on the number of double
           neutron-neutron coincidences were obtained in the form
           of spectra of time intervals between registration of
           the first and second neutrons in pair.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertaities
CORRECTION Corrections for self-shidding in the samples were
           determined from the total cross-section for neutron
           interactions with the sample material; for all samples
           they were far less than 1% and were not taken into
           account.
