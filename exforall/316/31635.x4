INC-SOURCE The neutron flux was determined individually for
           both of two Au-foils irradiated at the front and
           back of W-foil, and the obtained values are 1.423 x
           10**5 and 1.408 x 10**5 n/cm2/s, respectively.
SAMPLE     A foil of tungsten (1.2 cm diam. x 200mu-m thick;
           purity 99.99%) of natural isotopic composition:
           180W(0.127 0.01%), 182W(26.507 0.16%), 183W(14.317
           0.04%) 184W(30.647 0.02%), and 186W(28.427 0.19%) and
           thin goldfoils (1.2cm diam. x 25mmu-m thick; purity
           99.99%) Two gold foils of approximately same size and
           weight were attached at the front and back of the
           tungsten foil, respectively to check the difference in
           neutron beam intensity between entrance and exit of the
           target.To follow the effect of epithermal neutrons and
           fastneutrons, the cadmium-covered gold foil and bare
           aluminum foil were also irradiated.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           spectroscopy (Canberra, 15% relative efficiency,
           1.8 keV resolution at 1332.5 keV of 60Co) coupled with
           digital gamma spectrometry system and Maestro data
           acquisition software.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The neutron beam
           intensity was determined from the  measured activities
           induced in gold monitor foils using the
           197Au(n,gamma)198Au monitor reaction. The monitor
           foils were measured with the same detector and in a
           comparable geometry as the gallium oxide target.
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198,2.695D,DG,411.8,0.955)
MONIT-REF  The cross-section of the monitor reaction was evaluated
           from the trend line of experimental data reported by
           (22370001,Yamamoto+,J,NST,33,815,1996)

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty includes:
             * Statistical uncertainty of gamma-Ray counting 1-2%
             * Sample mass 0.01
             * Isotopic abundance 0.19
             * Half-life 0.06
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in cross section of the monitor
                    reaction
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in efficiency calibration
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in the decay branching ratio
