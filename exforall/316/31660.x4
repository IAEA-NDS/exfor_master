FACILITY   (REAC,3BZLUSP) 24A position in the core of the IEA-R1
           reactor (IPEN, Sao Paulo, Brazil) operated at a
           power of 3.5MW.
SAMPLE     The spectrographically pure holmium oxide (Ho2O3)
           powder was used to prepare the samples for reactor
           neutron irradiation. About 3-5 mg Ho2O3 was weighed
           on a Sartorius micro balance under controlled
           humidity conditions. The samples of cobalt [using
           wires of aluminum-cobalt (0.475%) alloy and pure
           cobalt], gold [Al-Au (0.1143%) alloy foil], zirconium
           foil and zinc were prepared for flux characterization
           of the irradiation position and to determine the
           1/E deviation parameter.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high resolution gamma-ray spectrometer used
           for the determination of induced activity in
           radioactive samples employed a high purity germanium
           detector, having a resolution of 1.90 keV at 1332.5 keV
           gamma-ray peak of 60Co. The detector was covered with a
           special shielding arrangement which contained lead,
           cadmium, copper and PVC layers to avoid the
           interference of potentially occurring lead X-ray in
           the vicinity of our peak of interest (80.6 keV).

REACTION   (67-HO-165(N,G)67-HO-166-G,,SIG,,MXW)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty. The major contributions were
           from the uncertainties:
           (ERR-1) in detector efficiency (deduced taking into
           account the parameter co-variance matrix),
           (ERR-2) the gamma-ray emission probability of 166Ho.
ANALYSIS   The thermal neutron cross section of the reaction
           was deduced from the ratio of the sub-cadmium
           reaction rates to the thermal neutron flux. The same
           was also determined from the ratio of subcadmium
           reaction rates of holmium to the same ratio of the
           co-irradiated cobalt monitor, subsequently
           multiplied with the thermal cross section of 59Co.

REACTION   (67-HO-165(N,G)67-HO-166-G,,RI)
ANALYSIS   The resonance integral of the reaction was measured
           by using the cadmium ratios. The weighted mean of
           the measured cadmium ratios of the selected gamma
           rays were taken.
