FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)Experiments were performed at the 4.5MV
           Van de Graaff accelerator of Peking University
DETECTOR   (IOCH)A gridded ionization chamber (GIC) was used as
           the charged particle detector. It has the advantages
           of high detection efficiency (close to 100%), large
           detection solid angle (almost 2Pi), the ability of
           particle energy and direction determination and the
           potential of discrimination of different particles.
           (BF3)A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
           monitor.
SAMPLE     A 10B sample and a 238U foil were set back-to-back
           at the common cathode. The 10B sample was evaporated
           on a tantalum backing 4.8 cm in diameter and 50 mm
           in thickness. The abundance of the 10B isotope was
           94.0%. The mass of the 10B sample was 514 mu-g, and
           the thickness was 34.7 mu-g/cm2. The mass and the
           diameter of the 238U sample were 7.85+-0.10 mg and
           4.50 cm, and the abundance of the 238U isotope was
           99.999%.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)Neutrons were produced through the D(d,n)3He
           reaction with a deuterium gas target. The length of
           the gas cell was 2.0 cm and the pressure of the
           deuterium gas was 3.0-2.87 atm with a molybdenum
           foil window 5 mm in thickness separated from the
           vacuum tube. The energies of the deuteron beam
           before enter the foil were 1.77 and 2.44 MeV, and
           the neutron energies were 4.0 and 5.0 MeV, with
           energy spreads 0.22 and 0.16 MeV, respectively. The
           estimated neutron fluxes on the sample were 2.1x10**5
           and 2.5x10**5 n/s/cm2 for the above-mentioned two
           neutron energy measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main sources of error of the cross-section
           value are:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in background subtraction
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in the 238U fission cross-section
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in the 238U fission count
           (ERR-4)uncertainty in the atom number of the 10B sample
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in the atom number of the
                                                      238U sample
           Total error is about 8%.
