FACILITY   (REAC,3BANSAV) 3 MW TRIGA Mark-II research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The neutron fluxes 1.85x10**5 +/- 5500 and
            1.60x10**5 +/- 4700 n/cm2/s were obtained
            individually from two Au-foils at front and back of
            gallium oxide pellet, respectively.
SAMPLE     The powder sample of gallium oxide (Ga2O3; 99.99%
            purity) used as gallium target of natural isotopic
            composition: 69Ga(60.108%) and 71Ga (39.892%) were
            sandwiched with two pure gold foils (25 mu-m thick
            and 8 mm diameter) for irradiation.
           The powder of Ga2O3 was in pressed with a pressure of
            5 tons/cm2 using a hydraulic press to prepare pellet.
           The pellet of 1.27 g has the diameter 1.2 cm and
            thickness 0.13 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
            spectroscopy (Canberra, 15% relative efficiency,
            1.8 keV resolution at 1332.5 keV of 60Co) coupled
            with digital gamma spectrometry system and Maestro
            data acquisition software were used to measure the
            radioactivity of the residual nuclei in the activated
            pellet and monitor foils without chemical separation.
METHOD     (CHRFL) Incident neutrons have been monochromatized
            by Bragg reflection from a Cu(200) monochromator
            using a suitable single crystal.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
           The neutron beam intensity was determined from the
            measured activities induced in gold monitor foils
            using the 197Au(n,gamma)198Au monitor reaction.
           The monitor foils were measured with the same detector
            and in a comparable geometry as the gallium oxide
            target.

MONIT-REF  The cross-section of the monitor reaction was evaluated
           from the trend line of experimental data reported by
