FACILITY   (REAC,3BANSAV) 3 MW TRIGA Mark-II research reactor
INC-SOURCE The neutron fluxes 1.85 x 10**5 +- 5500 and 1.60 x
           10**5 +- 4700 n/cm2/s were obtained individually
           from two Au-foils at front and back of gallium oxide
           pellet, respectively.
SAMPLE     The powder sample of gallium oxide (Ga2O3; 99.99%
           purity) used as gallium target of natural isotopic
           composition: 69Ga(60.108%) and 71Ga (39.892%) were
           sandwiched with two pure gold foils (25 mu-m thick and
           8 mm diameter) for irradiation. The powder of Ga2O3
           was in pressed with a pressure of 5 tons/cm2 using a
           hydraulic press to prepare pellet. The pellet of
           1.27 g has the diameter 1.2 cm and thickness 0.13 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           spectroscopy (Canberra, 15% relative efficiency,
           1.8 keV resolution at 1332.5 keV of 60Co) coupled with
           digital c spectrometry system and Maestro data
           acquisition software were used to measure the
           radioactivity of the residual nuclei in the activated
           pellet and monitor foils without chemical separation.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) The neutron beam
           intensity was determined from the  measured activities
           induced in gold monitor foils using the
           197Au(n,gamma)198Au monitor reaction. The monitor
           foils were measured with the same detector and in a
           comparable geometry as the gallium oxide target.
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198,2.695D,DG,411.8,0.955)
MONIT-REF  The cross-section of the monitor reaction was evaluated
           from the trend line of experimental data reported by
           (22370001,Yamamoto+,J,NST,33,815,1996)
           (40464001,Pavlenko+,C,75KIEV,3,171,197506)

             * Statistical uncertainty of gamma-Ray counting 1-2%
             * Decay branching ratio 0.5-0.7%
             * Sample mass 0.01
             * Half-life 0.01
             * Isotopic abundance 0.016
             * Self-shielding factor 0.01
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in neutron flux 3
