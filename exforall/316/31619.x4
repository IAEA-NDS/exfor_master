FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRAEP) Irradiation of the samples was
           carried out at the K-400 Neutron Generator at the
           Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) and
           lasted for 128 min with a yield 4 to 5 10**10 n/(4Pi s)
SAMPLE     About 7 g of Ru powder of natural isotopic composition
            (99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and a
           pellet, 0.2 thick and 2.0 cm in diameters was
           obtained. Three such pellets were prepared. Monitor
           foils of Nb (99.99% pure, 0.2mm thick) and Al
            (99.999% pure, 0.04mm thick) of the same diameter as
           the pellets were then attached in the front and at
           the back of each sample
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a HPGe detector (ORTEC, model GEM - 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1mm, crystal length: 72.3mm)
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 at 1332 keV for 60Co. The
           efficiency of the detector was precalibrated using
           various standard gamma sources.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           134 keV and beam current of 230 mA. The
           tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the generator
           was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main error sources in our work result
           from:
            * counting statistics (0.1-15%),
            * detector efficiency (2-3%),
            * the coincidence sum effect of cascade
                                               gamma-rays (0-5%),
            * the uncertainties of irradiation, cooling and
                                        measuring times (0.1-1%),
           (ERR-1) uncertainties due to standard cross-sections,
           (ERR-2) uncertainties in the weight of samples
           (ERR-3) uncertainties in the self-absorption of
                                                       gamma-ray
           etc. also, some other errors' contribution from the
           parameters of the measured nuclei and standard
           nuclei, such as uncertainties of the branching ratio
           of the characteristic gamma rays, uncertainties of
           the half-life of the radioactive product nuclei and so
           on, are all considered.
