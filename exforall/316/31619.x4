TITLE      Measurements of activation cross-sections for the

SAMPLE     About 7 g of Ru powder of natural isotopic composition
            (99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and a
           pellet, 0.2 thick and 2.0 cm in diameters was
           obtained. Three such pellets were prepared. Monitor
           foils of Nb (99.99% pure, 0.2mm thick) and Al
            (99.999% pure, 0.04mm thick) of the same diameter as
           the pellets were then attached in the front and at
           the back of each sample
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a HPGe detector (ORTEC, model GEM - 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1mm, crystal length: 72.3mm)
           with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 at 1332 keV for 60Co. The
           efficiency of the detector was precalibrated using
           various standard gamma sources.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation lasted for 128 min with a yield 4
            to 5 10**10 n/(4Pi s)

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           134 keV and beam current of 230 mA. The
           tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the generator
           was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
