FACILITY   (REAC,3HUNKFI) the PGAA facilities of II-HAS at the
           Budapest Research Reactor
SAMPLE     High-pressure gas-bottles filled with mixtures of
           enriched 22Ne and CH4 were used. Two samples were
           prepared. Sphere #1 contained 75.1 mg methane and
           352.41 mg 22Ne, while sphere #2 was filled with 19.7
           mg methane and 129.57 mg 22Ne. The masses of the
           2-cm- diameter stainless steel containers were about
           8600 mg. An additional larger aluminum sphere 80 mm
           in diameter with Ne was used for measuring the 22Ne
           capture gamma-rays by means of the invisible
           container concept.
INC-SOURCE cold neutron beam with an approximately Maxwellian
           energy distribution of 100 K. In the 80 mm-sphere
           experiment, the flux was 3xl0**7 n/s/cm2, while for
           the 2 cm containers  (sphere #1 and #2) it was
           7xl0**7 n/s/cm2 at the sample position.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The de-exciting gamma-rays were measured with
           a BGO shielded HPGe detector and the spectra were
           collected in a 16K MCA system.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   The cross section was determined by means of the
           comparator method, and an improved decay-scheme
           obtained in the work. The thermal equivalent cross
           section value is based on the assumption that both of
           the comparator (hydrogen) and 22Ne have 1/v cross
           sections for the whole beam energy range.
