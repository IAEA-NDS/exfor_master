FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD)  Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   reactor neutron beam is transmitted through neutron
            filter consisting of Cr-52 (thickness 177 gram/cm2),
            sulphur (thickness 110 gram/cm2), V-51(thickness
            18.5 gram/cm2) and B-10 (thickness 0.2 gram/cm2)
SAMPLE      .Metallic powder, mass 11.96 gram, diameter 28 mm,
           (76-OS-187,ENR=0.995) Os-187 content is 99.5 % .
METHOD     (FNB,REC)
DETECTOR    (PROPC) Proton-recoil counter CHM-38.
CORRECTION  For presence of oxygen in sample ~5%,
            for multiple processes ~6% for el., 15% for inel.;
            for resonance self-shielding ~5%.
ANALYSIS    Absolute values of scattering cs were defined by
           normalizing sum SIGel+SIGinel to the difference between
           total CS and capture CS.

           These values were estimated according to results from:
