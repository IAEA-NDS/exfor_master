FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Fast pulse reactor IBR-2
                      Setup "ISOMER".
           (CHOPS) Slow chopper at 30 m distance from reactor.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cyclic activation: activation time 10-50 msec,
            measurement time about 150 msec - each cycle.
           (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)  Battery of 12 prop.counters placed in
            polyethylene. Covered by Cd and borated polyethylene.
            Detector efficiency was calculated by MCNP code to be
            20% at 2 MeV and about 1.5 times less at 0.1 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Mirror neutron guide. Slow chopper at 30 m
           distance from reactor.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron beam at sample position
           2.E+5 /sec/cm**2.
CORRECTION  Background was measured by Cd filter, 12 for U-235,
            37 % for U-233.

ANALYSIS    Using ASSUM value of BETA-ef from REL-REF, the ratio
           of registration efficiencies of delayed to prompt
           neutron was determined to be EPS-DN/EPS-PN=1.36 +-0.06,
           what is in reasonable agreement with calculated.
           BETA-ef was determined using this exp. ratio 1.36+-0.6.
