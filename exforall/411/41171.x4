SAMPLE       Np-237 layers of 2 mg/cm2 thickness on both sides of
            aluminum  backing, 1.87 g in each of three sections.
            In 4th section of fission chamber - Np-237 layer on
            one side of backing with implanted Cf-252 nuclei.
CORRECTION  Correction was made for neutron angular correlation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error takes into account:
                  statistical error,

                  corrections errors,
                  systematic errors.
STATUS      Data are taken from YF .
