METHOD     (ACTIV)
           Ratio of intensities of transitions between the first
           excited level of Cd-112,114 and it's ground state was
           measured in the sample to be 0.018+-0.002.
ANALYSIS    It's assumed, that populations of the first excited
           state of Cd-114 ( 558 keV0 and Cd-112 (617 keV) is the
           same.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Error is not specified
           (ERR-1,,12.) Additional systematic error < 10-12% .,
           which could be due to different population of first
           excited states.
