INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Resonance neutrons of the reactor - with Cd filter ;
            total neutron spectrum  - without Cd filter.
ANALYSIS    Data are obtained by the difference method after
            measuring yields with and without cadmium filter.
           Yields measured at this experiment are averaged with
           the few previoius measurement results.
