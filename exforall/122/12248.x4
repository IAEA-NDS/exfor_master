SAMPLE     Radium used in early measurements was not purified
           and taken directly as radium chloride. Spectrographic
           analysis showed 0.4% of Ba, 0.2% of Ca, 0.04% of Mg,
           and 0.02% of Si. The second sample was prepared from
           20 mg of radium chloride that has been passed through
           10 crystallization cycles. Spectrographic analysis
           showed no significant impurities.
METHOD     Two samples, each weighing 100 microg were evaporated
           on platinum plates and tested for fission in the
           thermal column of heavy-water pile. One had 43
           fission per minute, and another one had 18 fission
           per minute over the background of 100 fission per
           minute. Comparison with fission standards indicated
           cross sections of 2.6x10-4 and 1.1x10-4 b. The lowest
           value was taken and assumed that that fission cross
           section is no more than 1.1x10-4 b.
