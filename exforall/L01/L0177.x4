FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL)Experiment performed at the Duke
           University electron storage ring using High-Intensity
           Gamma-ray Source (HIgS).
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Array of eight large-volume NaI(Tl) detectors
           placed at roughly equally spaced angles from 40deg to
           160deg.Each NaI(Tl) detector core measures
           approximately 25.4 cm in diameter and 30.5 cm long.
           Surrounding the core detector is a segmented NaI(Tl)
           annular detector that is 7.5 cm thick and 30.5 cm
           long and is designed as an anticoincidence shield.
           The detector-response line shapes from the core
           detectors had a full width at half maximum of approx.
           6% at 60 MeV
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight method was used to select prompt
           gamma ray events to reduce background
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Photons were produced via Compton
           backscattering of free-electron laser (FEL) photons
           from relativistic electrons in one of the two
           straight sections of electron storage ring.
