FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity gamma-ray Source (HIgS) at Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory, Durham
SAMPLE     Naturally composed CeO2 powder mixed with a
           well-defined amount of pure graphite powder. The
           mixture was pressed into thin disks, 20 mm in
           diameter, and masses between 780 and 940 mg each,
           corresponding to a mass of pure cerium dioxide
           between 660 and 740 mg.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector with 60% efficiency. The
           distance between target and detector was 3 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used to measure cross
                   sections

INC-SOURCE (LCS) At HIgS nearly monoenergetic gamma-rays were
           produced by Compton backscattering of photons on
           relativistic electrons in electron storage ring
