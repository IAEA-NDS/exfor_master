FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USADKE)Experiment performed at the Duke
           University electron storage ring using High-Intensity
           Gamma-ray Source (HIgS).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) High-pressure 3He-Xe gas scintillation
           detector with total pressure of 51 atm was used.
           Scintillator was filled in 5.5 cm inner diameter
           cylindrical stainless steel vessels of 0.1 cm wall
           thickness. Efficiency of noble gas scintillators for
           detecting charged particles is known to be 1.0. For
           a total pressure of about 50 atm a 4:1 ratio of 3He
           gas to Xe was optimal for 10 to 13 MeV photons. For
           photon energies above 13 MeV optimal ratio was 2:1.
           (HPGE,NAICR) HPGe and NaI(Tl) detectors were used to
           measure the incident photon energy and intensity.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Photons were produced via Compton
           backscattering of free-electron laser (FEL) photons
           from relativistic electrons in one of the two
           straight sections of electron storage ring. The
           electron energies were varied between 650 and 750 MeV
           and the FEL wavelength was changed between 350 and
           400 nm to cover the gamma ray energy range between
           22.0 and 29.5 MeV.
