SAMPLE     (60-ND-142,ENR=0.96) The target was 30 g of Nd2O3
           powder. It was encapsulated in an acrylic cylinder
           with an inner diameter of 2.54 cm and an inner length
           of 2.65 cm. The wall thickness was 0.3 cm.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monoenergetic gamma-rays were produced
           by Compton backscattering of photons on relativistic
           electrons in electron storage ring

STATUS     (TABLE) Data presented in fig. 2 of the reference

FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the HIgS
           facility at TUNL. Beams of 100% linearly polarized
           gamma rays with energies between 4.2 and 9.7 MeV
           were used with average energy spreads of 3%
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector
           array consisted of four clover detectors arranged
           perpendicular to the beam, with two in the horizontal
           plane and two in the vertical plane
ANALYSIS   The E1 sigma(tot) was determined from the sum of the
           E1 sigma(gamma0) and the transition cross sections
           from up to seven low-lying excited states (i.e.,
           first six 2+ states and the first 1- state, all at
           Ex < 3.5 MeV) to the ground state.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total average uncertainty
CORRECTION Data corrected for coherent atomic scattering
