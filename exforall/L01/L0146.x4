FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERZFK) Experiment was performed at the
           superconducting electron accelerator ELBE of the
           Research Center Dresden-Rossendorf
SAMPLE     693.9 mg of 26MgO enriched to 98.4% in 26Mg,
           combined with 455.5 mg of 11B. Diameter of the
           sample was about 20 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Scattered photons were measured with four high-
           purity germanium (HPGe) detectors of about 100%
           efficiency relative to a 3 x 3 in. NaI detector.
           Two HPGe detectors were placed vertically at 90deg
           relative to the photon-beam direction at a
           distance of 28 cm from the target resulting in opening
           angles of 16deg. The other two HPGe detectors were
           positioned in a horizontal plane at 127deg to the beam
           at a distance of 32 cm from the target with opening
           angles of 14deg.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
MONITOR    (5-B-11(G,INL)5-B-11,,SIG,,BRS)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung was produced by irradiating
           niobium foil with thickness of 7 mu-m (3.4mg/cm2)
           with electron beam of kinetic energy 13.0+-0.1 MeV
           A narrow photon beam was formed by an Al collimator
           with a length of 2.6 m and an opening angle of 5 mrad.
           An absorber made of a 10-cm-long Al cylinder between
           the radiator and the collimator attenuates the intense
           low-energy part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum.
