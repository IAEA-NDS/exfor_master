SAMPLE     1003.3 mg 80Se enriched to 99.95% encapsulated in a
           cylindrical aluminum container of 8-mm inner diameter.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Neutron detector consisted of triple rings
           of four (Ring 1), eight (Ring 2), and eight (Ring 3)
           3He proportional counters coaxially embedded in a
           polyethylene moderator at the distances of 3.8, 7.0
           and 10.0 cm from the beam axis, respectively.
           (NAICR)The gamma ray beam was monitored with a
           large volume NaI(Tl) detector (8-in. diameter x 12-
           in. length).
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Gamma rays were produced from laser Compton
           scattering  in head-on collision of laser
           photons with relativistic electrons in storage
           ring. The gamma rays were collimated into a fine beam
           of 2 mm diameter with a 20-cm-thick lead collimator
           placed at 5.5 m from the center of the interaction
           region of laser photons and electrons.
