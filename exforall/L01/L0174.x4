FACILITY   (SRING,1USATNL) Measurements were carried out at the
           High Intensity Gamma- Ray Source (HIgS) facility
           located on the campus of Duke University
SAMPLE     (36-KR-86,ENR=0.994) The target was 1012 mg of
           enriched Kr gas contained in a spherical stainless
           steel cell
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Emitted neutrons from the (g,n) reaction were
           detected using a 4Pi assembly of 3He proportional
           counters, fabricated into a single unit. The assembly
           consists of 18 individual counters, arranged in two
           concentric rings. Each counter was filled with 3He
           gas at 6 atm pressure. The space around the counters
           was stuffed with polyethelene that thermalizes the
           emitted neutrons before they are captured (detected)
           in the 3He counters.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The facility has a 0.24-1.2 GeV storage ring
           where quasi-monoenergetic gamma-beam is produced by
           the intracavity Compton back-scattering of the free
           electron laser photons from the electron bunches.
