FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USADKE) Experiment performed at the Duke
           University electron storage ring using High-Intensity
           Gamma-ray Source (HIgS).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Array of 18 liquid scintillation detectors
           filled with BC-501A scintillator was used to detect
           neutrons generated from photofission. Diameter of
           each detector was 12.7 cm and thickness was 5.1 cm.
           Twelve detectors were placed at theta = 55deg, 90deg
           and 125deg and at phi = 0deg, 90deg, 180deg and
           270deg. Six detectors were placed at theta = 72deg,
           107deg and 142deg and at phi = 0deg and 90deg.The
           target was positioned at the center of the array, and
           the flight path from the target to each detector was
           approximately 57 cm.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Time of flight was used to determine
           neutron energy. Pulse shape discrimination was used
           to discriminate against gamma rays.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Photons were produced via Compton
           backscattering of free-electron laser (FEL) photons
           from relativistic electrons in one of the two
           straight sections of electron storage ring. HIgS
           facility is a nearly-monoenergetic Compton gamma-ray
           source with a wide energy range and switchable
           linear and circular polarizations.For this experiment,
           the FEL wavelength was 540 nm and
           the electron beam energies were selected to produce
           gamma-ray beams between 5.6 and 7.3 MeV, with an
           energy spread (FWHM) of 3%. The gamma-ray beams were
           produced having either circular or linear
           polarizations. Because of the duty factor of the
           electron storage ring, the gamma-ray beam is pulsed
           with a period of 179 ns. The temporal structure of the
           gamma-ray beam made possible the use of a
           time-of-flight method to determine neutron energies.
