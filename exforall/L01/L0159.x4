FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL)Experiment was conducted using TUNL's
           High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIgS) at the Duke
           Free-Electron-Laser Laboratory
SAMPLE     232Th sample with purity of 99.9% and thickness of
           0.1 cm. Diameter of sample was larger than the beam
           diameter. Sample was inclined at 61.4 deg relative to
           the incident beam and located at 52.5 m from the
           collision point of electrons with FEL photons.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays from the target were measured with
           a HPGe detector array positioned about 4.8 m
           downstream from the collimator. The array consists
           of four HPGe detectors with 60% efficiency, positioned
           10 cm away from the center of the target and at an
           angle of 90 deg relative to the photon beam. Two
           detectors were located in the horizontal plane and two
           in the vertical plane.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Monoenergetic photons, with high
           polarization and selectable energy, were produced at
           the HIgS facility using intracavity backscattering of
           free-electron-laser (FEL) photons from electrons in
           the DFELL storage ring. Photon energy was changed
           from 2 MeV to 4 MeV with resolution of 5 %. The
           linear polarization of the beam was almost 100%.
