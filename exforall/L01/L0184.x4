SAMPLE     (7-N-15,ENR=0.998) A urea-form aldehyde (NH3CONH2)
           and 300 +- 2 mg/cm2 commercial CH2 targets were used
           in the experiment.
DETECTOR   (MWPC,CEREN,SCIN) Each of two telescopes consisted of
           two multi-wire proportional chambers, one Cherenkov
           detector, and 16 NE 102 plastic scintillators.

INC-SOURCE (BRST,TAGD)
METHOD     (EXTB,COINC) A tagged photon beam was obtained
           from an electron beam of energy 268 MeV. Only the
           photons coming with the proper secondary electrons in
           specified coincidence resolving time are tagged
           photons. Pions were produced by properly tagged
           photons. Particle identification was based on the
           comparison experimental energy loss with the Birk's
           formula calculations.
ANALYSIS   The differential cross section of a (gamma,pi)
           reaction in the lab system is dsigma/domega =
           Npi/(Ngamma*(Nt/cos (thetat))*DOmega), where Npi is
           the number of pions, Ngamma is the number of incident
           photons, Nt is the number of target nuclei, thetat=45
           degrees is the angle of the target to the beamline,
           and DOmega is the detector solid angle.
