FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL)Experiment performed at the Duke
           University electron storage ring using High-Intensity
           Gamma-ray Source (HIgS).
SAMPLE     High-pressure 4He-Xe gas scintillator filled with a
           mixture of 48.3 atm 4He and 2.7 atm of Xe was used as
           target and detector.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) High-pressure 4He-Xe gas scintillation
           detector with total pressure of 51 atm was used.
           Scintillator was filled in 5.1 cm diameter
           cylindrical stainless steel vessels of 0.1 cm wall
           thickness.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Photons were produced via Compton
           backscattering of free-electron laser (FEL) photons
           from relativistic electrons in one of the two
           straight sections of electron storage ring. The
           electron energies were varied between 616 and 627 MeV
           and the FEL wavelength was 244 nm.
