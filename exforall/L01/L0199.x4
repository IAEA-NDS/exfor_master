FACILITY   (LASER,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIGS) at Triangle
           University Nuclear Laboratory in Durham
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Scattered photons were measured with HPGe
           detectors placed perpendicular to the beam axis at
           azimuthal angles of 0deg, 90deg, 180deg, and 270deg;
           i.e., two were placed parallel and two perpendicular
           to the polarization plane, allowing the distinction
           between electric and magnetic character of the
           scattered radiation. Fifth detector was placed under
           a backward polar angle (125deg) in the plane
           perpendicular to the polarization axis.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Gamma-ray beams at the HIgS are produced by
           Compton backscattering of a high-intensity free-
           electron laser (FEL) beam from relativistic electrons
           circulating in the Duke storage ring. Presently, the
           energy of the backward scattered photons can be tuned
           over a wide energy range, from 1 to about 100 MeV, by
           changing the energy of the electron beam and the FEL
           wavelength the beams are quasimonoenergetic, with an
           energy spread of about 3% using a 30.5-cm-long lead
           collimator with a cylindrical hole of 1.9-cm diameter
           positioned 56 m downstream from the collision point
           of the electrons with the FEL photons. Photon
