METHOD     (FISCT) The Ilford emulsions loaded with bismuth were
           exposed to the beam of Illinois betatron. The plates
           were developed with the usual Occhialini temperature
           procedure, omitting however presoaking. The fissions
           were counted and recognized as such from the length
           of the track and from the density and aspect of the
           tracks.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford emulsions: Emulsion 200 micron thick
           of D1 type, contains 0.27 of a gram of bismuth per
           cm3 of emulsion, 1600 r of bremsstrahlung at the plate
            (measured with a Victorean trimble ionization
           chamber, behind a flat sheet of 1/8 inch Pb).
PART-DET   (FF)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details are given.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment, May 2012: Emulsion technique is
           very good for detecting fission events or photostars.
           Certain fission products like gamma-rays could escape
           detection, however, the fission fragments and their
           tracks are easily visible.

STATUS     (CURVE) Fig.2, page 574.
           (DEP,L0173002) Data determined using the experimental
           values of subentry 2 and the theoretical bremsstrahlung
           spectrum.
ANALYSIS   (PHDIF) The data was analyzed using the theoretical
           bremsstrahlung spectrum and the cross section for
           fission as a function of the photon energy was
           determined.
