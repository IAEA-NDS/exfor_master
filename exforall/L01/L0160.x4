FACILITY   (VDG,1USAMIT) Experiment was conducted at the High
           Voltage Research Laboratory at Massachusetts
           Institute of Technology.
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.998) Transmission detector sheet
           consisted of five depleted uranium (DU) sheets with
           dimensions of 20.32 cm x  20.32 cm and thickness of
           0.8 mm. Behind the DU plates, 82.3 +- 0.5 g of Mn and
           185.1 +- 0.8 g of 99.52% enriched 11B were also
           positioned in the beam to serve as auxiliary flux
           monitors. Total mass of DU plates was 3226.7 +- 28 g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two pairs of approximately 100% relative
           efficiency high-purity germanium detectors were
           positioned 27 cm from the intersection of the beam
           center and the transmission detection sheet, at an
           angle of 118deg relative to the centroid beam
           direction.
METHOD     (TRN,GSPEC) The assay target was used to down-scatter
           incident photon beam to the energy of resonance.
           The assay target consisting of combination of DU and Pb
           was located directly downstream of the  collimator
           opening. The areal densities of DU for different runs
           varied form 0 g/cm2 (background run) to 8.47g/cm2.
           The Pb densities varied from 79.85g/cm2 to 86.26g/cm2.
MONITOR    (4-BE-11(G,SCT),PAR,ARE)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremstrahlung produced by electrons
           accelerated to 2.60+-0.03 MeV in converter target
           consisting of a 102 mu-m thick Au layer on a 1
           cm-thick water-cooled Cu backing. The electron
           current incident upon the converter was approximately
           65 mu-A throughout the experiment.
ANALYSIS   The photon spectra that reached the transmission
           detection sheet after emission from each of the assay
           targets were calculated by Monte-Carlo method using
           code MCNPX.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Largest source of experimental errors are
           the uncertainties relating to counting statistics.
