           the two- body photodisintegration of 3He at

FACILITY   (MICRT,2SWDLND)The experiment was performed at the
           tagged-photon facility located at MAX-lab in Lund,
           Sweden.
SAMPLE     Gaseous 3He cell located in a stainless steel block
           with dimensions 70 x 70 x 100mm3 served as the
           target.The beam entrance and exit windows were 12.5
           mu-m thick.The cell was filled with 99.96% pure 3He
           gas to a nominal pressure of 2 bar.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR,SIBAR)Charged particles detected
           by four telescopes. Each telescope consisted of 3
           detectors in dE-dE-E configuration. dE1 detector was
           25 and 50 mu-m thick, dE2 was 150 mu-m thick and E
           detector had thickness of 1000 mu-m.
INC-SOURCE (BRST,TAGD) A 0.1% radiation-length Al radiator was
           used to generate a bremsstrahlung photon beam from
           the electron beam.Post-bremsstrahlung electrons were
           momentum analyzed using a magnetic spectrometer
           equipped with a 64-counter focal-plane scintillator
           array. Tagged photon-energy range was 14-31 MeV and
           the nominal photon energy resolution was 270 keV.
