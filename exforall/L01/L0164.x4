FACILITY   (LASER,1USATNL) The high-intensity gamma-ray source at
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory produced
           nearly monoenergetic gamma-ray beams by means of
           Compton backscattering of laser beam inside optical
                               cavity
           (SRING,1USATNL) Optical cavity is placed in a
           storage-ring-based free-electron laser.
SAMPLE     (20-CA-48,ENR=0.924) Metallic target with weight of
           2.72g 48Ca target with diameter of 1.27 cm and length
           of 1.19 cm. Metallic target was placed in a 2.54-cm
           diameter Plexiglas capsule filled with argon to
           protect the target against oxidation.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) The neutron detector consists of 18 3He
           proportional-counting tubes embedded in a polyethylene
           moderator. All of the tubes are filled with 6 atm of
           3He gas. The tubes are arranged into two concentric
           rings with nine tubes in each. The radius of the inner
           ring is 7.2 cm, and that of the outer ring is 10.6 cm.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(G,N)1-H-1,,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Energies of the gamma ray beams were measured
            using a high-purity germanium detector positioned
            in the beam.
CORRECTION  Corrected for the contribution of p(g,g') reaction
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty in relative detection
