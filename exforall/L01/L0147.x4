FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERZFK)Superconducting electron accelerator
           ELBE of the research center Dresden-Rossendorf
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Scattered photons were measured with four
           high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors of about 100%
           efficiency relative to a 3 x 3 in. NaI detector.
           Two HPGe detectors were placed at theta = 90 deg
           with respect to the incident photon beam, the other two
           were positioned at theta= 127 deg. Each HPGe
           detector was surrounded by an escape-suppression
           shield made of bismuthe-germanate (BGO)
           scintillation detectors.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma ray spectrometry
MONITOR    (5-B-11(G,INL)5-B-11,,SIG,,BRS) Each Mo target was
           combined with 340 mg of 11B enriched to 99.52%.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung was produced by irradiating
           niobium foils of 4 mu-m or 7 mu-m thickness with
           electron beam with energy of 13.2MeV
CORRECTION Data corrected for inelastic transitions and branching
           ratios
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Absorption cross sections were calculated using
           Monte Carlo procedure based on statistical model of
           nuclear reactions. Starting from the high-energy end
           of an experimental spectrum, which contains
           transitions to the ground state only, the simulated
           intensities of the transitions to the ground state
           were normalized to the experimental ones in the
           considered bin and the intensity distribution of the
           branching transitions was subtracted from the
           experimental spectrum. Dividing the intensities of the
           transitions to he ground state, which are proportional
           to the elastic-scattering cross sections by
           corresponding branching ratios, specially measured,
           photoabsorption  cross  section was determined.
