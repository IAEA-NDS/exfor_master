FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIGS) at Triangle
           University Nuclear Laboratory in Durham
SAMPLE     Al scattering target with thickness of 2.53 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Scattered photons were measured by four 60%
           HPGe detectors which were on average of 12 cm from
           the target, at a scattering angle of 120deg, with two
           in the horizontal plane, and two in the vertical
           plane. They were shielded with 2.5-cm Pb on the
           sides, and Pb (0.55 cm) and Cu (0.4 cm) filters were
           placed in front of the detectors to reduce the
           intensity of low energy photons hitting the detector.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) A circular polarized gamma-ray beam was produced
           by Compton backscattering of laser photons from
           relativistic electrons in a storage ring. The levels
           were simultaneously excited by NRF using the high-flux
           of 1E+8 photons/s circularly polarized
           quasimonoenergetic gamma-ray beam

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab. 1 of the reference
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Reducible systematic uncertainty due to beam
             profile ratio and subtraction of Compton scattering
             spectrum in monitor detector.
           (ERR-2) Irreducible statistical uncertainty, due to
             normalization to 2.982 MeV level and thick target
             correction.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(G,EL),,ARE)
CORRECTION Thick target correction was made.
