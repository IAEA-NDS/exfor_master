FACILITY   (LASER,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIGS) at Duke University
           in Durham
SAMPLE     Natural Li target cast in a protective Teflon cylinder.
           Contribution of 7.56% 6Li contained in natural Li
           was subtracted by separate measurement with enriched
           6Li sample
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons created by photodisintegration
           reactions were detected using the Blowfish Neutron
           Detector Array. Blowfish is a segmented fast neutron
           detector based on 88 scintillating cells. It has a
           radius of 40.6 cm and has an angular acceptance of
           approximately 1/4 of 4Pi sr. The cells are filled
           with the liquid scintillator BC505.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD)
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monochromatic polarized photon beam
           produced by Compton backscattering of laser beam on
           electrons, circulating in a synchrotron. The photon
           beam is macroscopically continuous but photons arrive
           in bunches 180 ns apart, since photons are scattered
           on internal bunched electrons beam. Photon rates of
           up to 10E+7 photons/s were used in these measurements.
ANALYSIS   Because of short flight path between the target and
           the neutron detector cells (406 mm), the TOF spectrum
           does not have sufficient resolution to unambiguously
           identify the (g,n0) neutrons. Therefore the light-
           output was used to eliminate neutrons from other
           reaction channels.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for contribution of 6Li in the
           natural Li sample
