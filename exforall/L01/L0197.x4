FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIGS) at Triangle
           University Nuclear Laboratiry in Durham
INC-SOURCE (LCS)A circular polarized gamma-ray beam was produced
           by Compton backscattering of laser photons from
           relativistic electrons in a storage ring. Electrons
           were accelerated by a 280-MeV linear accelerator and
           then further accelerated by a booster synchrotron to
           energies ranging from 498 to 548 MeV.
           A 1-cm-diameter lead collimator, positioned 3.5
           m upstream from the sample, was used to define the
           gamma-ray beam size which was incident on the sample.

           The primary sample consisted of 16.4185 g of magnesium-
           oxide (MgO) powder, enriched in 26Mg. The sample was
           contained in polycarbonate cylindrical container
           with 0.16-cm-thick walls and end caps,with an inner
           cavity 2.30 cm in diameter and 3.10 cm in length.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) The detector consisted of several 3He
           counters moderated by polyethylene and covered a
           solid angle of nearly 4Pi. The setup was positioned
           symmetrically along the beam axis. Samples were
           placed at the center of the detector with their
           cylindrical axis centered along the beam direction.
           To decrease the background, cadmium sheets and
           boron-loaded polyethylene blocks were placed as
           shielding upstream of the detector.
