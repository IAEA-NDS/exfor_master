DETECTOR   Time Projection Chamber with optical readout was used
           to detect alpha particles, produced in reactions
           with carbon nuclei in operating gas CO2. All outgoing
           particles from photodissociation are fully determined
           by their tracks recorded in three dimensions and all
           relevant kinematical variables are measured.
SAMPLE     CO2 operating gas in TPC chamber
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monoenergetic gamma ray beams were
            produced by means of Compton backscattering inside
            the optical cavity of a storage-ring-based
            free-electron laser. Circularly polarized photons
            were produced either with high ( dE/E = 0.9 - 1.6 %),
            or low  (dE/E = 1.9 - 2.3 %) energy resolution.
