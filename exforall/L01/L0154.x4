           electron linac
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene of dimensions 2.5 cm high x
           5.0 cm along the photon axis x 0.4 cm thick along
           the neutron axis.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) 2-m-long spin-precession solenoid was placed
           on a neutron flight path. Solenoid was able to
           precess a 3.26 MeV neutron through an angle of pi/2.
           At the end of the 9m flight path the neutrons were
           scattered from the natural C analyzing target.
           (SCIN) Neutron scattered from the C target up (+50
           deg) and down (-50 deg) with respect to (g,n)
           reaction plane were detected by plastic scintillator
           with dimensions 20 x 10 x 5 cm**3, located 35 cm
           from the C target
METHOD     (LRASY) The polarization of the photo-neutrons was
           determined by observing the asymmetry in their
           scattering from a C target placed at the end of a 9
           m flight path.
           (TOF) Photoneutron energy was determined by time-of-
           flight over flight path of 9 m.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Pulsed electron beam with energy of 19 MeV
           striked an air cooled graphite block. Peak beam
           current was 15 A with pulse duration of 4 ns and
           repetition rate of 800 Hz.
