INC-SPECT  The horizontal bar (given as EN-RSL-FW) is the full
           width at half-maximum of the least-structure
           resolution function at representative energies.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Data taken in 125-keV intervals: Oxygen
           samples were irradiated with bremsstrahlung photons
           from the Iowa State University 70-MeV synchrotron.
           The 16O(gamma,n)15O process was detected by counting
           the 0.51-MeV annihilation photons emitted in the
           subsequent 2-min positron decay of 15O. Samples were
           irradiated for 3 min, 1 min was allowed to elapse
           during which the sample was removed to the
           radioactivity counting system and then the
           annihilation photons from 15O were counted for 3 min.
ANALYSIS   (LEAST)  Least Structure analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The vertical bars represent the standard
           deviation for the solution at representative
           energies. However, as adjacent cross-section points
           are strongly correlated, the interpretation of this
           bar as a random error is erroneous.

           Continuous curves and the points for digitization
           were determined by the compiler.

METHOD     (ACTIV) Data taken in 250-keV intervals: Oxygen
           samples were irradiated with bremsstrahlung photons
           from the Iowa State University 70-MeV synchrotron.
           The 16O(gamma,n)15O process was detected by counting
           the 0.51-MeV annihilation photons emitted in the
           subsequent 2-min positron decay of 15O. Samples were
           irradiated for 3 min, 1 min was allowed to elapse
           during which the sample was removed to the
           radioactivity counting system and then the
           annihilation photons from 15O were counted for 3 min.
ANALYSIS   (LEAST)  Least Structure analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The vertical bars represent the standard
           deviation for the solution at representative
           energies. However, as adjacent cross-section points
           are strongly correlated, the interpretation of this
           bar as a random error is erroneous.
