FACILITY   (VDG,1USAMIT) Experiment performed at Van de Graaff
           electron accelerator at the High Voltage
           Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute
           of Technology. Bremsstrahlung photons were produced by
           impinging an electron beam onto a radiator consisting
           of 102-mum Au backed by 1-cm Cu
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Scattered gamma rays were measured with four
           HPGe detectors with 100% relative efficiency placed at
           120 deg backward angles. Two detectors were placed on
           each side in a 61 cm thick Pb shielding to shield the
           detectors from the intense bremsstrahlung source. An
           additional 18 cm of tungsten was placed between the
           radiator and detectors
SAMPLE     Two targets were used, both consisted of NpO2 powder
           doubly encapsulated in polyethylene vial. The larger
           sample (9 g NpO2) was placed upstream of the smaller
           one (2 g NpO2) at 80.0 and 83.3 cm from the radiator,
           respectively. Two targets were placed back to back
           in the beamline.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung photons were produced by
           electron beam impinging onto a radiator consisting
           of 102 mum Au backed by 1-cm Cu (used for cooling and
           electron cleanup).The bremsstrahlung photons
           immediately pass through a 20-cm long lead collimator
           with a 2.5 deg half angle conical opening. Average
           beam currents were of the order of 50 mu-A

ANALYSIS   Energy dependent incident photon flux was obtained by
           normalizing the Schiff formula for bremstrahlung
           production to a known line (2297 keV) in 181Ta.
