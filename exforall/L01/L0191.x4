FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANSAS) Experiment was conducted at the
               Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory (SAL) using
               62-channel SAL tagger
SAMPLE     Graphite block with of thickness of (8.22 +- 0.04)g/cm2
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Scattered photons were detected in BUNI
            (Boston University NaI) NaI(Tl) detector capable of
           high detection efficiency and excellent energy
           resolution. BUNI consists of 11 optically isolated
           scintillator elements: a cylindrical NaI core
           measuring 26.7 cm in diameter and 55.9 cm in length,
           four NaI quadrants that form a 10.8-cm-thick annulus
           of the same length, and six plastic scintillator
           segments that constitute an outer annulus with a
           length of 51.0 cm and a thickness of 12.7 cm. This
           was surrounded by 28 cm of lead and steel shielding
           to suppress the electromagnetic and neutron
           background. The sum of the energy deposited in the
           core and the quadrants was used to define the energy
           of a scattered photon event.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between photon detector and
                   tagger was required
INC-SOURCE (TAGD) High duty factor beams of electrons were
           incident on a thin aluminum radiator.
           Momentum-analyzed residual electrons were detected in
           a multi-element hodoscope of plastic scintillators.
           Coincidence between scattered photons and tagging.
           The SAL tagger covered photon energy range 60-108 MeV
