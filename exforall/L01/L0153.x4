           deuterium

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAYAL) Experiment performed at 65 MeV Yale
           University Electron Linear Accelerator.
SAMPLE     Two set of samples containing deuterium were used.
            1. Deuterated polyethylene (C-2H2), one with diameter
               of 12.7 cm and thickness of 2.06 cm, the second
               with diameter 7.18 cm and thickness of 4.57 mm.
            2. Heavy water (2H2-O) in a a thin plastic cylindrical
               bottle with 7.62 cm diameter and 12.70 cm high.
           For background measurement, targets with light water
           and standard polyethylene with identical dimensions
           as deuterated targets were used.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Solenoid with length of 1.2m, inside
           diameter of 7.5 cm and maximal field of 5000 Oersted
           was used for neutron spin precession. After a flight
           path of 26m, photoneutrons were scattered from
           a polarization analyser (liquid helium or graphite).
           (SCIN) Four Pilot B plastic scintillators each
           coupled to 12.7 cm diam phototubes are used as
           neutron detectors to observe left-right asymmetries
           of neutrons scattered from the helium polarization
           analyser. Most of the data are obtained using two
           pilot-B plastic scintillators (12.70 cm diam x 15.24 cm
           thick) each coupled to an RCA 7046 photo-multiplier
           tube placed in the reaction plane at lab angles of
           +-130 deg and at a distance of 27.6 cm from the centre
           of the helium analyser. Other two neutron detectors
           12.70 cm diam x 7.62 cm thick with pilot-B plastic
           scintillators each coupled to an Amperex 58 AVP
           photomultiplier tube were used either in an up-down
           geometry or in a left-right geometry at lab angles
           of +-70deg.
METHOD     (LRASY) The polarization of the photo-neutrons is
           determined by observing the asymmetry in their
           scattering from a liquid-helium cryostat or a
           graphite cylinder placed at the end of a 25 m flight
           path.
           (TOF) Photoneutron energy was determined by time-of-
           flight over flight path of 26 m.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Electrons with energy of 65 MeV striked a 250
           mu-m thick tungsten foil and produce bremsstrahlung
           photons with a maximum energy of 65 MeV. The
           electrons which pass through the foil were absorbed
           in a 10.80 cm thick x 6.35 cm diam electrically
           insulated aluminium cylinder. Maximum beam current
           was 2 A with pulse duration of 10 ns and repetition
           rate of 330 Hz.
ANALYSIS   Polarisation was determined from left-right asymetry
           after subtraction of background contribution determined
           in measurement with light water and non-deuterated
           polyethylene
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given. Given uncertainties
            are most probably statistical uncertainties
CORRECTION Corrected for target scattering effects, correction
           amounts to 10% at 15 MeV neutron energy and to 20%
           at the lowest energy.
