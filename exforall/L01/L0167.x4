FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USADKE)Experiment performed at the Duke
           University electron storage ring using High-Intensity
           Gamma-ray Source (HIgS).
SAMPLE     High-pressure 4He-Xe gas scintillators with total
           pressure of 51 atm was used both as target and the
           detector.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) High-pressure 4He-Xe gas scintillation
           detector with total pressure of 51 atm was used.
           Scintillator was filled in 5.1 cm diameter
           cylindrical stainless steel vessels of 0.1 cm wall
           thickness. Efficiency of noble gas scintillators for
           detecting charged particles is known to be 1.0.To
           limit the wall effects, the proton range was kept
           lower than 1.5 cm. The Xe concentration was therefore
           varied from 7% to 47% while keeping the total pressure
           at 51 atm.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Photons were produced via Compton
           backscattering of free-electron laser (FEL) photons
           from relativistic electrons in one of the two
           straight sections of electron storage ring. The
           electron energies were varied between 650 and 750 MeV
           and the FEL wavelength was changed between 350 and
           400 nm to cover the gamma ray energy range between
           22.0 and 29.5 MeV.
