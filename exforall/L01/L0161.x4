FACILITY   (LASER,1USATNL)Experiment was conducted using
           TUNL's High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIgS) at the
           Duke Free-Electron-Laser Laboratory
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.937)The 235U targets consisted of two
           or three 0.03-cm-thick square foils, each with a
           surface area of 2.54 x 2.54 cm2 and sealed with
           0.01-cm-thick plastic laminates.The targets were
           enriched to 93.7% in 235U with a total mass of 3.08 g
           or 4.62 g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays from the target were measured with
           a HPGe detector array positioned about 4.8 m
           downstream from the collimator. The array consists
           of four HPGe detectors with 60% efficiency, positioned
           10 cm away from the center of the target and at an
           angle of 90 deg relative to the photon beam. Two
           detectors were located in the horizontal plane and two
           in the vertical plane.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
MONITOR    (5-B-11(G,SCT),PAR,ARE)
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Monoenergetic photons, with high
           polarization and selectable energy, were produced at
           the HIgS facility using intracavity backscattering of
           free-electron-laser (FEL) photons from electrons in
           the DFELL storage ring. Photon energy was changed
           from 2 MeV to 4 MeV with resolution of 5 %. The
           linear polarization of the beam was almost 100%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given.
