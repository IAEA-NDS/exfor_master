TITLE      Photoneutron Cross Sections of Tb159 and O16
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH) Annihilation in flight of fast positrons
SAMPLE     Oxygen sample of 150g of H2O and terbium sample of
            320g of Tb4O7
DETECTOR   (BF3) 4 pi BF3-paraffin neutron detector
CORRECTION A very small correction was applied to the Tb4O7 data
            to account for the 16O(g,n) reaction
MONITOR    The photon intensity was monitored by a xenon
            transmission ion chamber, calibrated using a 5x6 in.
            NaI spectrometer
