TITLE      Proton and He-3 induced nuclear reactions in uranium
           and neptunium targets. Production of neptunium and
           plutonium tracers with a low-energy cyclotron.

FACILITY   (ISOCY,2SF ABA).The 103 cm AVF Cyclotron (MGC-20).
SAMPLE     Targets of uranium-oxide (U(3)O(8)) and neptunium-oxide
            (NPO(2)) were prepared by multiple thermal
           decomposition of uranium nitrate and neptunium nitrate
           painted on 0.1 mm and 6.03 mum thick aluminium
           backings, respectively. The transformation was
           ascertained using alpha-spectrometry and direct
           weighing.   The  average  thickness  of the 236-U-oxide
           layer was 100 mug/cm**2 and that  of  the  Np-237-oxide
           layer   110  mug/cm**2. The  thickness variations  were
           within 3%.  The average thicknesses were determined by
           weighing.

ADD-RES    (COMP) The calculations were performed with a modified
           version of the STAPRE.
           (TTY-C) The calculated thick-target yields of Np-234,
           Np-235,Pu-236,Pu-237 and Pu-238 were reported.
