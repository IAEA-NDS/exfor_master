ADD-RES    (COMP).Cascade Calculations.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
           (GELI).Four Ge(LI) Detectors.None of the Nuclides were
           Measured on Only a Nai-Detector and Most of the Results
           Are Determined with at Least Two Detectors.
           The Detectors were Coupled to Different Amplifier and
           Multichannel Analyzer Systems.

           The Target Cylinder is Kept in an Oven in Vacuum and at
           A Temperature of About 700 Centigrad. It is Connected
           Via a Steel Tube at Approximately Room Temperature to

           For the Production of Mercury Isotopes, the Target Also

           Can Then Choose What Mass Region to Study. In the
           Collector Chamber of the Isotope Separator, One May
           Collect the Isotoped Separated by Letting the Ion Beams
           Hit a Horizontal Aluminium Foil Strip Placed
           Perpendicularly to the Central Mass Beam.
           The Foils is Mounted in a Holder That May be
           Lowered from a Shielded Position Above the Plane of the
           Ion Beams, Such That the Ions May be Collected During
           A Chosen Time Interval. After Collection, the Strip is
           Switched Out of the Beam and Withdrawn from the
           Collector Tank Through an Air Lock.By Cutting the
           Aluminium Foil Between the Positions of the Masses,Each
           Isotope can be Counted by Mounting the Pieces in
           Standard Sample Holders.
