TITLE      Fission of lead induced by 600 MeV protons
AUTHOR     (E.Hageboe,T.Lund)
INSTITUTE  (2ZZZCER)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,37,1569,1975)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2ZZZCER)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) Four Ge(Li) detectors. Most of the
           results are determined with at least two detectors.
           The detectors were coupled to different amplifier and
           multichannel analyzer systems.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
ADD-RES    (COMP) Cascade calculations.

SAMPLE     The stack consisted of a target foil of Pb 99.999%

           monitor foils of 10 um Al and guard foils of 30 um

METHOD     (STTA,CHSEP) Rb was separated from the target solution

           series of hydroxide-,sulfide- and carbonate-scavenging
           to remove contamination.

           (CHSEP) Cd was separated using a procedure-several
           precipitations of CdS at pH approx.1.5 and scavengers
           with PdS and Sb(2)S(3) from 2N HCl are performed. The
           solution of Cd is placed on a Dowex 2 anion exchange
           column which is then washed through with 0.1N HCl
           without eluting Cd. Cd is then eluted with 1.5m
           H(2)SO(4). The final sample is CdS.

COMMENT    - by compiler - authors have beleived that Cd-115-m
           production is independent. But Cd-115-m could be
           produced due to ground state Ag-115 decay.

                              DG,1290.,0.009)
SAMPLE     The stack consisted of a target foil of Pb 99.999%
            0.5 mm thick with catcher foils of 30 um aluminium,
           monitor foils of 10 um Al and guard foils of 30 um
           aluminium on both sides.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (CHSEP) Cd was separated using a procedure-several
           precipitations of cds at ph approx.1.5 and scavengers
           with PdS and Sb(2)S(3) from 2N HCl are performed. The
           solution of Cd is placed on a Dowex 2 anion exchange
           column which is then washed through with 0.1N HCl
           without eluting Cd. Cd is then eluted with 1.5m
           H(2)SO(4). The final sample is CdS.
