           Steel- Type 302-Fe,66.8-75%,Cr-17-19%,Ni-8-10%,Mn-2%
           And Sum of Si,Cu,Mo,C,P and S Up to 2.2%- Foils were
           Bombarded in 12 Irradiations.
           The Stacks Consisted in Each Case of at Least Two
           Different Foil Types.

ERR-ANALYS The errors in the cross-section values were compounded
           by errors from three sources-the measured number of
           protons - monitoring, the target thickness and the
           measured number of product atoms. The Errors in the
           average number of protons are shown in Table 1. Errors
           in target thickness are -+3%. Errors in radioactive
           products were +-10%.
           The error in the number of atoms of stable products
           were compounded from standard deviations of multiple
           peak height measurements of the mass spectrometric
           analysis, corrections for procedural blanks and gas in
           unirradiated foils and calibration errors.
           The error propagation yielded a total error in the
           number of stable atoms which in most cases was well
           below +-10%. Large errors occurred when corrections for
           total background gas or Na-22 decay were relatively
           large. This was usually the case for foils irradiated
           with protons near the threshold energy.
           Additional errors were included for the Ne-22, Ne-22(T)
           and Ar-37 cross sections, arising from decay
           corrections for these nuclides.
COMMENT    *By Authors*.We have estimated tritium decay either
           by using the known 3-H cross section in Al or by
           assuming  equal cross sections for 3-H and 3-He when no
           cross  section  were  available. In  most  cases  the
           estimated  amount  of 3-He via 3-H decay, calculated by
           either method, was Less than 5% of the total, and in
           all  cases it was well within experimental errors of
           3-He measurements.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Because of the Relatively Low Abundances
           Of 29-Si and 30-Si We Suspect That the Main Reactions
           Leading to 20-Ne are 28-Si(P,P+2A) And 28-Si(P,N+2A).

           Si, V-48 in Natural Ti, and Cr-51, Mn-52 and Co-57 in
           Stainless Steel -Type 302- Were Determined by

           Gamma-Ray Spectrometry.
           Immediately After Each Irradiation the Mg, Al, and Si
           Foils were Individually Counted with a 3-Inch*3-Inch

REL-REF    (R,B0073001,I.R.WILLIAMS+,J,PR,162,1055,1967) Assumed
           Cross Section For 51-Cr and 52-Mn Production from Iron.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,26-FE-0(P,X)24-CR-51,CUM,SIG,,,EXP)
COMMENT    -By Authors- From the Cross-Section Values of 51-Cr and
           52-Mn in Type 302 Stainless Steel We have Deduced Cross
           Sections For 51-Cr and 52-Mn in Natural Cr. Significant
           Yields of 51-Cr in the Target are Expected Only from Cr
           -18-20 at.% and Fe -66-74 at% Because Production from
           Mn - 2 at%,Aprox. And Ni - 7.5-9.5 at% Involves Very
           Complex Reactions.
STATUS     (TABLE)
SAMPLE     Type 302 Stainless Steel was Used.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The Error is Reported by Authors.
           The Errors in the Mean Proton Energies were Compounded
           From Error in the Incident Proton Energy (1%),Errors in
           The De/Dx Values (-+1%),Errors in the Target Thickness
            (-+3%) And Errors Due to Proton Straggling (LESS OR
           EQUAL 1.5%).
           (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
