TITLE      -Elastic Scattering of 100 MeV Protons and Systematic
            Optical Model Analysis.
AUTHOR     (K.KWIATKOWSKI,N.S.WALL)
INSTITUTE  (1USAMRY)
FACILITY   (CYCLO) The University of Maryland Cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE .Protons from the University of Maryland Cyclotron.
INC-SPECT  .Monoenergetic 100.4 MeV Protons.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Drifted Ge-Li Detectors with Side Entry were
            Used to Detect the Scattered Protons. They were
            Mounted in a Thin Window Dewar Which was One of the
            Arms of a 75 Cm Radius Scattering Chamber. The Energy
            Resolution was in All Cases Better Than 300 KeV. The
            Scattering Angle was Determined to Within +/- 0.04
            Degrees. The Angular Resolution, As Determined by the
            Detector Apertures, Varied from 0.5 to 2.4 Degrees.
PART-DET   (P)
CORRECTION .Corrections were Made For Dead-Time and For a
           Significant Low-Energy Tail in One of the Detectors.
           The Data were Also Corrected For Nuclear Reactions in
           The Detector.
ERR-ANALYS  The Statistical Errors were Below 1% For
            Data Out to 50 Degrees, and did not Exceed 3%
            Below 80 Degrees.
           (ERR-1) The Relative Errors were in Total Less Than
            4 %.
           (ERR-2) The Total Systematic Error was Less Than 8%.
HISTORY    (941005C) N.O.
           (970211A) Some Corrections were Included by F. Chukreev
           (970522A) Data For 58-Ni,90-Zr and 120-Sn are Added by

STATUS     (CURVE) Data Scanned from Figure 2 of Main Ref. By N.O.
SAMPLE     .The Lead Target Thicknesses were in the Range 30 - 80
            Mg/Cm2, and the 208-Pb Isotopical Purity was Better
            Than 97.6 %. The Target Angle Error was Always
            Less Than 0.4 %.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An Estimated 5 Percent Error from the Scan
            Of the Figures.
COMMENT    .Since the Data was Extracted from the Figures, an
            Additional Error of About 5 Percent is Introduced.
