TITLE       Elastic scattering of 100 MeV protons and systematic
            optical model analysis

INC-SPECT   Monoenergetic 100.4 MeV protons.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Drifted Ge-Li detectors with side Entry were
           used to detect the scattered protons. They were
           mounted in a thin window dewar which was one of the
           arms of a 75 cm radius scattering chamber. The energy
           resolution was in all cases better than 300 keV. The
           scattering angle was determined to within +- 0.04 degr.
           The angular resolution, as determined by the
           detector apertures, varied from 0.5 to 2.4 degr.
CORRECTION  Corrections were made for dead-time and for a
           significant low-energy tail in one of the detectors.
           The data were also corrected for nuclear reactions in
           the detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,1.,3.) The statistical errors were below 1% for
           data out to 50 degr., and did not exceed 3%
           below 80 degr.
           (ERR-1,,4.) The relative errors were in total
                       less than 4%
           (ERR-2,,8.) The total systematic error was less than 8%

SAMPLE     The lead target thicknesses were in the range
            30 - 80 mg/cm2, and the 208-Pb isotopical purity was
            better than 97.6%. the target angle error was always
            less than 0.4 %.
COMMENT     Since the data was extracted from the figures, an
            additional error of about 5 percent is introduced.
