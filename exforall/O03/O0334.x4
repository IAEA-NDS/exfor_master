TITLE      Isomeric Yield Ratios and Fractional Chain Yields For
           Indium-117 and Cd-117 Produced by Proton-Induced
           Fission of Bi,Th and U.

HISTORY    (19970422C)
           (20000425A) Date is Corrected
           (20001116A) Subentries O0334004, 7,10 have Been
           Corrected According to O.Schwerer'S Remarks.
           (20001123U) Last checking has been done.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Statistical Level Density Theory.
           The Cumulative High Spin to Low Spin Isomeric Yield
           Ratio For the Pair Cd-117-M-Cd-117-G has Been Obtained
           And is Increasing with Increasing Proton Energy.
DETECTOR   (NAICR).A 3 in.*3 in. Nai(TL) Crystal Shielded in a
           Cubic Lead House with Inner Measurements of About 75 Cm
           And with 5 Cm Thick Walls.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP).The Targets were Irradiated For 10 Min
           In the Circulating Proton Beam of the Synchro-Cyclotron
           At the Gustaf Werner Institute.
METHOD     (SITA)
           (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP).The First Separation of in from Cd Took Place
           Typically from Four to Six Minutes After the End of the
           Irradiation,and the Counting of the First Sample was
           Started About 25 Min Later.The Second Separation was
           Completed 5-50 Mins After the First.
CORRECTION 117-Ag-G Decay Influence is Taken in Account.
           117-Ag-M Decay was Ignored.
COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Numbers of Irradiations Quoted are
           Only the Numbers Used For the Determination of the
           Independent Indium Isomer Ratio.
           /by Compiler/ the Difference of Used Decay Data from
           Today Data is Very Large.  The Influence of this
           Difference has not Been Investigated.
           Suitable Comments are Added by Compiler For   E
           Subentries.
ERR-ANALYS The Error Limits Quoted are Estimated Standard
           Deviations Based Mainly on the Spread Among the
           Parallel Determinations with Uranium Target,But
           Uncertainties in the Resolution of Decay Curves and
           Chemical Yield Determinations are Also Taken Into
           Account.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY).Decay Curves were Obtained Using the 161 KeV
           Transition at Indium-117 Decay.
