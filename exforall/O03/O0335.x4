TITLE      Measurements on Electromagnetically Separated
           Radioactive Isotopes of Iodine.
AUTHOR     (P.AAGAARD,G.ANDERSSON,J.O.BURGMAN,A.C.PAPPAS)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDUPP)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,5,105,57)
HISTORY    (970429C)
           (970505U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Targets of Uranium Trioxide were Used.
ADD-RES    (Z-DIS)
           (A-DIS)
           Spallation of Caesium Induced by 170 MeV Protons was
           Found to Produce Highly Neutron Deficient Iodine
           Isotopes in Quite Good Yields.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Counting Could Start 1.-1.5 Hour After the
           End of the Irradiation.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
COMMENT    /by Authors/.These Measurements are not Possible by
           Standard Methods Because a Chemically Isolated Iodine
           Sample Contains About Ten Radioactive Isotopes with
           Half-Lives Ranging from 25 Min to 60 Days.In the Search
           For a Technique Capable of Differentiating Between
           These Isotopes the Possibility of Using Electromagnetic
           Separation After the Chemical Procedure was Considered.

COMMENT    - By Compiler - I-131 Production has Been Assumed by
           Authors  As  Independent.   But I-131 Could be Produced
           Due to Radioactive Decay of 131-Te (HALF-LIFE 25. MIN).
           This Could be Repeated For I-134.
