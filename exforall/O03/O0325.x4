SAMPLE     The Experiment Consisted of a Series Target 'in' and
           Target 'Out' Measurement at Each Energy. Only Solid
           Target were Used. The Thickness of the Targets was
           Determined by Two Methods. First, the Targets was
           Measured by a Micrometer. Second, the Targets were
           Weighed,and  Since  Each  Target was Circular in Shape,
           The Diameters of the Disk  were  Measured.   The  Areal
           Density  was  Then Calculated.  In Order That the Areal
           Density  Determination  be  of  any  Significance,  the
           Uniformity of the Targets Must be Determined.
           The  Silicon  Target  was  Lapped,  Polished,  and Then
           Tested Optically, the Nonuniformity of this Target  was
           Less  Than  0.1%.   The  Uniformity  of  the Beryllium,
           Carbon and Aluminium Foils  was  Investigated  with  an
           Electronic  Height  Gauge Which is Capable of Detecting
           Variations of -+0.00003 Cm.  Each of  the  Three  Foils
           Varied  by Less Than 0.0001 Cm Over Its Entire Surface.
           The C(2)F(4) Target was Found to be Uniform  to  Within
           1%.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Cross Sections are Compared with Various
           Theoretical Predictions.
INC-SOURCE *En-Rsl-Fw*the Energy of Resolution.
DETECTOR   (SCIN).Plastic Scintillator Passing Detectors 1 and 2
           Along with Annular Detectors 3 and 4 Provide the
           Trigger Signal,Denoted I(0),For an Incident Proton
           Unscattered by the Passing Detectors.
           (TELES).The Stopping Detector Telescope,Composed of the
           Small Plastic Disk Detector 5 and the Csi(NA) Stopping
           Detector 6.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACLA)
METHOD     (SITA)
CORRECTION /by Authors/.The Total Number of Reaction Events For
           Both Target in and Target Out were Found.The
           Uncorrected Cross Sections were Then Calculated Using
           The Formula-Sigma(UN)=(I(0)-I)/Nxi(0)-(J(0)-J)/Nxj(0),
           Where (I(0)-I) Is the Number of Attenuation Events For
           I(0) Incident Protons with the Target 'in'. (J(0)-J) Is
           The Same As (I(0)-I) But For the Target 'Out', and Nx
           Is the Number of Nuclei Per Cm**2 in the Target.
           The Corrections For Elastic Scattering Events, Charged
           Particle Reactions Products, and Reactions in the
           Csi(NA) Scintillator were Then Applied to Sigma(UN) To
           Produce the Final Value of the Reaction Cross Section.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The Proton Energy Loss in the Targets.
           (ERR-1).The Error in the Areal Density Measurements.
           (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors For
           Corrected Cross Section. The Error Due to the
           Uncertainty in the Target Areal Density was Combined
           Quadratically with the Statistical Uncertainty in the
           Attenuation Effect and with the Uncertainties in the
           Various Corrections.
MISC-COL   (MISC).The Uncorrected Cross Section.
