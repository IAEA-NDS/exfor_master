TITLE      Formation of the mercure-197,195 and 194 by
           proton induced reactions on gold at 155 MeV

REFERENCE  (J,CR,248,3552,1959) in French
SAMPLE     Au-197 was used as target.Other information is absent.
ADD-RES    Calculated cross section for Hg-194 was defined as
            38 mb. Experimental observation was absent.

METHOD     (CHSEP) >95% of Mercury was extracted from target.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation times were changed from some
           minutes up to 2 hours.
           (STTA) The stack contains some foils of gold and
           aluminium. Foil thicknesses were 0.01 mm.
