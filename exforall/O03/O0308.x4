HISTORY    (960310C)
           (970311U) Last checking has been done.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Semi-Empirical Formula.
           The Ratio Cl/Fe in Cosmic Radiation has Been Calculated
           From Measured Cross Sections, Using the 'Leaky Box'
           Model, Leading to the Conclusion That Cl-36 Decay Does
           Occur.
DETECTOR   A Widebeta 2 Beckman Detector with a Back Ground of
           About 2 Cpm was Used.
RAD-DET    (17-CL-36,B-)
DECAY-DATA (17-CL-36,,B-,,0.981)
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,3N+3P)11-NA-22,CUM/UND,SIG)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR CSN).The 150 MeV Irradiations was Carried
           Out at the Orsay Synchrocyclotron.
           (SYNCY,2FR FR).The 1.05 GeV Irradiations was Carried
           Out at Saturne Facility.
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER).The 24 GeV Irradiations was Carried Out
           At the Cern Proton Synchrotron.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA)
           (RCHEM)
ERR-ANALYS The Total Error is Estimated to be from 20 to 25% and
           Takes Into Account the Activity Measurement-
           (ERR-1) The Error in the Backgrond Giving 8 to 10%.
           (ERR-2)  The  Error in the Detector Efficiency Giving 8
           To 10%.
           (ERR-3) The Error in the Statistical Factors  Giving  8
           To 10%.
           (ERR-4) The Error in the Chemical Separation Yield is 3
           To 5%.
           (ERR-5) The Error in the Flux Measurement is 5%.
           (ERR-6) The Error in the Half-Life is 3%.
           (ERR-7)   The   Error  in  the  Measurement  of  Target
           Thickness is 2%.
           (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
