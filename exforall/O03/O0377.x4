           This Information has Been Extracted by Compiler from
           A0580001.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Irradiation Time was 11 Minutes.
           (GSPEC). The Measurments were Began After 15 Minutes
           Of  End  of Irradiation, Approximately. 34 Measurements
           Have Been Executed During to 18 Hours.  Each Measurment
           Was from 10 to 60 Minutes.  Additional Measurement  has
           Been Executed After 1 Day, 25 Days and Half Year.
           (STTA)  The  Stack  has  Contained  Aluminium  and Lead
           Foils.  All Foils have Diameter 30 mm.  Thicknesse  was
           0.1  mm  of  Lead.   All  Targets  in  this  Stack were
           Surrounded by Additional  Identical  Foils  to  Exclude
           Activity Loss.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- Any Information About Energy
           Degradation in Used Stack is Absent.

COMMENT    * by Compiler * According to ENSDF Ground State of
           198-Bi has Half-Life 10.3 Minutes. 198-Bi has Two

           One has Half-Life 7.7 Seconds. Seconds Isomer State

           Interpretation May be Doubtful.
