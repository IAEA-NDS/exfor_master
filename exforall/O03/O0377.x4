ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,5.,7.) Uncertainty of absolute
           calibration of used spectrometer.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Irradiation time was 11 minutes.
           (GSPEC)  The measurements were began after 15 minutes
           of end of irradiation, approximately. 34 measurements
           have been executed during to 18 hours. Each measurement
           was from 10 to 60 minutes. Additional measurement has
           been executed after 1 day, 25 days and half year.
           (STTA) The stack has contained aluminum and lead
           foils. All foils have diameter 30 mm. Thickness was
           0.1 mm of lead. All targets in this stack were
           surrounded by additional identical foils to exclude
           activity loss.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- Any information about energy
           degradation in used stack is absent.

COMMENT    * by Compiler * According to ENSDF ground state of
           198-Bi has half-life 10.3 minutes. 198-Bi has two
           isomers. First one has half-life 11.6 minutes, second
           one has half-life 7.7 seconds. Second isomer state
           decays to first isomer. First isomer does not decay to
           ground state of 198-Bi. Therfore authors'
           interpretation maybe doubtful.
