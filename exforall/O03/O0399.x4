           Corrections For Secondary Particles.
HISTORY    (19980114C)
           (20020909A) Corrections For New Rules
           (20020909U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Standard Target Assemblies Consisted of a 25 Mum
            ( OR 50 MUM) Thick Target Foil Sandwiched Between Two
           Stacks of Three 25 Mum Aluminium Foils.
           For Vanadium, Silver and Indium Targets, Three Target
           Foils were Used, Only the Middle One Being Used For
           Chemical Processing and the Other Two Serving As Guard
           Foils.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Measured Results and Total Isobaric Yields
           Evaluated by Using a Nonlinear Least Squares Program.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL) The Brookhaven Cosmotron For 1, 2 and
           3 GeV.
           (SYNCH,1USABNL).The Brookhaven Alternating Gradient
           Synchrotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (CHSEP)
           (INTB) Irradiations were Performed in the Circulating
           Beams. The Lengths of Irradiations Ranged from Several
           Minutes to Two Hours.

CORRECTION For the Contributions of Secondary Particles to 24-Na
           Production in the Monitor Foils were Made Only For Pb
           And U Targets at 3 and 28.5 GeV Proton Energies.
           Correction Factor Per 100 Milligramm/Cm**2 Target
           Thickness are 3.5% and 4% For Pb and U Targets at 3
           GeV, respectively and 14% For Both Pb and U Targets at
           28.5 GeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Errors Quoted Include Counting Statistics,
           Uncertainties in Counter Efficiencies, Chemical Yield
           Determinations, and Summing Corrections. The
           Uncertainties of the Radiation Abundances and the
           Monitor Cross Sections are not Reflected Therein.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Early G-Ray Measurements on Pb and U
           Targets  at  1,  2,  and  3  GeV  were  Made  with Na-I
           Detectors and Most of the Later Measurements at  3  GeV
           And  Higher  were  Made with Ge-Li Detectors.  Whenever
           The Measurements were Repeated  with  Ge-Li  Detectors,
           The  Agreement with Earlier Result Using Na-I Detectors
           Was Almost  Always  Within  Experimental  Uncertainties
           +-15%,  Thus  Lending Confidence to All Earlier Results
