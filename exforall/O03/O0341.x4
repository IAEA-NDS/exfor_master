ADD-RES    A Comparison is Made of the Present Total Reaction
           Cross Sections and the Integrated Partical Cross
           Sections For Elastic Scattering and Inelastic
           Scattering to the First Excited State of C-12.
DETECTOR   (SOLST).A Lithium-Drifted Silicon Detector.To Detect
           Scattered Charged Particles. Energy Resolution was
           200 KeV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USALAS)
METHOD     (SITA)

REACTION   (6-C-12(P,NON),,SIG,,,EXP)
CORRECTION /by Authors/.The Elastic Correction was Calculated
           Taking Into Account the Finite Size of the Beam and the
           Angular Distribution of Multiple Coulomb Scattering in
           The Passing Counters and in the Target.
SAMPLE     Two Separate Targets were Used For the Measurements of
           The Total Reaction Cross Section on Carbon.Each Target
           Was Self-Supporting Natural Carbon of 99% Purity.One
           Target,Having an Areal Density of 0.015 G/Cm**2,was
           Used For Measurements at 17.41 and 19.46 MeV.The Other
           Target,Having an Areal Density of 0.00449 G/Cm**2,was
           Used For All Other Measurements.
           The Targets were Examined For Roughness and
           Irregularities,and Small Corrections were Made If
           Necessary.
           With Each Target,a Thin (0.00247 G/CM**2) Nickel Foil
           Was Placed in Front of the Carbon.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           (ERR-1).The Total Uncertainty in the Areal Densities
           Of the Targets.

REACTION   (20-CA-40(P,NON),,SIG,,,EXP)
CORRECTION /by Authors/.The Elastic Correction was Made.
SAMPLE     Four Targets of Ca-40 were Used For the Total Reaction
           Measurements.The Thickness was Chosen So That the
           Average Energy Loss in the Target was Between 235 and
            325 KeV.The Targets were Made from Foils.They
           Contained 99.97% Ca-40.The Oxygen Present in the Foils
           Was Estimated to be Less Than 1% of the Weight of the
           Foils.
           Each Targets was Examined For Irregularities and
           Appropriate Corrections were Made.The Areal Densities
           Of the Four Targets were 10.0,10.3,12.2 and 14.1 Mg/
           Cm**2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           (ERR-1).The Elastic Corrections have an Absolute
           Uncertainty.
           (ERR-2).The Uncertainty in the Average Areal Density.
