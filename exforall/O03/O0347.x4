INC-SPECT  The proton beam intensity 3 x 10**11/cm2/s was
           calculated from yield of the 27Al(p,3pn)24Na of the
           monitor foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Irradiation time was 15 minutes.
           (GSPEC). The measurements were began after 35 hours
           of  the end  of irradiation, approximately.
            8 measurements have been executed  during  one  week.
           Additional measurement has been executed after 5 months
           (STTA)  The  stack  has  contained  aluminium  and lead
           foils.
SAMPLE     The lead foil of diameter 30 mm, thickness of 0.1 mm,
           weight of 0.7064 g together with aluminium
           foil (monitor) of the same diameter. All  targets  in
           the stack were surrounded  by additional  identical
           foils  to  exclude activity loss.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in gamma-spectrometer efficiency
           calibration - 7%,
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in proton beam intensity - 9%,
           (ERR-3,,20.) Uncertainty in gamma-ray complex peaks
                     decomposition =< 20%.
            * statistical error of the area peak calculation,
                 This information was extracted from 96Kalmar.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- Any information about energy
           degradation in used stack is absent.
