           Calibration of Used Spectrometer.
           This Information has Been Extracted by Compiler from
           A0580001.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Irradiation Time was 15 Minutes.
           (GSPEC). The Measurments were Began After 35 Hours
           Of  End  of Irradiation, Approximately.  8 Measurements
           Have Been Executed  During  to  One  Week.   Additional
           Measurement has Been Executed After 5 Months.
           (STTA)  The  Stack  has  Contained  Aluminium  and Lead
           Foils.  All Foils have Diameter 30 mm.  Thicknesse  was
           0.1  mm  of  Lead.   All  Targets  in  this  Stack were
           Surrounded by Additional  Identical  Foils  to  Exclude
           Activity Loss.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- Any Information About Energy
           Degradation in Used Stack is Absent.
