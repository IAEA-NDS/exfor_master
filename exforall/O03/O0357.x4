SAMPLE     A 1-Mil Uranium Target Foil was Surrounded by 1-Mil Al
           Catcher Foils.The Target Stacks For the First
           Experiments on a Given Element Also Contained a 1-Mil
           Al Foil For Impurity Activitation Situated Downstream
           From the Target and Catchers.
           The U Foils were of Natural Isotopic Composition,
           Nominally 1-Mil Thick and 1.0*1.5 Cm in Size.The
           Average Thickness,Ranging from 40 to 43 Mg/Cm**2,was
           Determined by Weighing the Target and Carefully
           Measuring Its Size.
ADD-RES    (RANGE) The Recoil Properties of 20 Nuclides of Mass
           About 140 Formed in the 440-MeV Proton Fission of
           Uranium  were  Determined.  The Average Kinetic Energy,
           Cascade Deposition Energy and  Angular  Anisotropy  For
           Each  Fission  Product  were Calculated from the Recoil
           Results.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.This Measurement was Performed in Two
           Ways.
           In the Cumulative Procedure,Three Aliquots were Taken
           After 0.1,1.0, and 1.2 Half-Lives of Pr-139,and
           Analyzed For Ce-139 Activity.
           In the Milking Experiment,Ce was Separated from a
           Single Aliquot from the Same Bombardment As That Above
           After 0.1,1.0 and 12 Half-Lives of Pr-139.The Last Two
           Samples Determine the Activity of Pr-139 at the End of
           Bombardment.This Value was Calculated by a Least-
           Squares Analysis in Which the Activity of Each Sample
           Was Weighted by the Total Number of Observed Counts.
           The Cross-Section Ratio,Calculated by Weighting the
           Results of the Two Experiments by the Squares of the
           Error.
