TITLE      Tritium Production by 2.2-Bev Protons on Iron and Its
           Relation to Cosmic Radiation.

HISTORY    (960310C)
           (970311U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Target Consists of a Stack of 8 Sheets of Hot-
           Rolled Steel,0.225 in. Thick with 1 in.*4 in. Faces.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC).A 16-Cc Geiger Counter was Used.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL).The Brookhaven Cosmotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (INTB).The Beam Strikes the 1 in.*4 in. Face and
           Passes Through the 8 Sheets of Steel.
           (RCHEM).Samples of About 8 G are Cut from the Center of
           Each Steel Sheet of Target.The Samples are Heated to
           About 1800 C Degree by an Induction Heater in an
           Atmosphere (1.0-CM HG PRESSURE) Of Carrier Hydrogen.
           By Three Hours of Pumping All the Gas is Extracted the
           Furnace,During the Pumping About 1/4 G of Iron Evapora-
           Tes to the Furnace Walls.To Test the Completeness of
           The Tritium Extraction,Several Samples were Subjected
           A Second Time to this Procedure with Negative Results.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
           Cross Section For Zero Thickness of the Target was
           Extracted from Variety of Tritium with Target Depth by
           An Extrapolation to Zero.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
ADD-RES    The Variation of Tritium Yield with Target Depth in
           Iron is Measured and Indicates a Decrease Less Rapid
           Than an Attenuation Due to Geometric Cross Sections.

CORRECTION A 20 % Correction to the Front Monitor Foil and 50% to
           The Rear Foil was Included Because of the Na-24
           Produced by Secondary Neutrons from the Target by the
            (N,ALPHA) Reation on Aluminum.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Tritium Cross Section Indicates That
            (1.4+-0.4)*10E-03 Tritons/G Sec would be Produced in
           Small Iron Meteorites /a Few Inches in Radius/ in
           Space by Cosmic Rays of the Intensity of Those
           Striking the Earth'S Polar Regions.In 4*1-E+09 Years,
            (6+-2)10E-06 Cc of He-3 Per Gram of Iron Results from
           This Cosmic-Ray Tritium.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical Uncertainty.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Average Sample Depth.
           (MISC2) Sample Weight in Gramm.
FLAG       (1.) This Datum is Result of the Extrapolation to
           Zero Depth and Zero Thickness.
