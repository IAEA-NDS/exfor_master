HISTORY    (970314C)
           (970326U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Targets Used were Spectrographically Pure Copper,
           Gold, Thorium and Lanthanum.
           Spectrographic Analysis of the Copper Showed the
           Presence of Ca-Approx. 0.002%, Mn-Approx.0.005%,
           Ag-Approx. 0.0002% and Fe,Ni,Cd-Approx. 0.001%.
           The Metallic Thorium Contained Na-Approx. 0.01%,
           Mg-Approx.  0.005%, Ca<0.0001%, Mn-Approx. 0.001% and
           Pb-Approx.  0.001%.
           The Lanthanum Oxide Contained Pr(2)O(3) <=0.02% and
           Ce(2)O(3) <= 0.02%.
           The Targets were 15*5*0.5 mm in Dimension.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Calculated Formation Thresholds For Na-24
           And P-32 in Spallation and Fission are Compared with
           The Experimental Values Showing That in Cu,La and Au
           These Two Nuclei are Formed Mainly by Strongly
           Asymmetric Fission. Formation of P-32 from Cu is an
           Exception, Being Due to Spallation and this Process is
           Also Important in the Formation of Na-24 from Cu.
METHOD     (RCHEM)
           Sodium was Separated from the Exposed Copper As
           Chloride After the Precipitation of Copper and Bismuth
           Sulphides in Weakly Acid Solution,Manganese Sulphide in
           Ammoniacal Solution,Iron Hydroxide,Potassium
           Perchlorate and Adsorption of Cations from 0.3 H-Cl
           Solution on a Chromatographic Column Packed with Ku-2
           Resin in H+ Form. Ammonium Salts were Removed by
           Roasting. The Sodium Chloride was Reprecipitated and
           Dried at 130 Degrees. The Exposed Lanthanum and Gold
           Were Analysed by Initially Precipitating Lanthanum
           Hydroxide with Ammonia and Precipitating the Gold from
            40% H-Cl Solution with So(2).
           In the Copper Analysis, After Precipitation of Copper
           Sulphide, Phosphorus was Precipitated As Ammonium
           Phosphomolybdata in the Presence of 20 Mg be+2.This
           Precipitation was Repeated Twice and the Precipitate
           Dissolved in Concentrated Ammonia, Phosphorus was
           Separated from this Solution Using a Magnesia Mixture
            (AGAIN REPEATED TWICE).The Precipitate was Dissolved
           In 0.3 N H-Cl and Passed Through a Chromatographic
           Column Packed with Ku-2 Resin in H+ Form, Bismuth
           Phosphate was Precipitated from the Solution and
           Dissolved in H-Cl.The Bismuth was Removed with H(2)S.
           Two Precipitations of Iron Cupferronate were Carried
           Out. The Phosphorus was Precipitated Finally As
           Zirconium Phosphate. After Re-Precipitation It was
           Roasted at 900 Degrees C to Zr-P(2)O(7).
