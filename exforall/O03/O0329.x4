TITLE       (P,D) And (P,T) Reactions on B-11,C-14,O-16 and O-18.

HISTORY    (970414C)
           (970422U) Last checking has been done.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Deuteron Results were Analyzed Using the
           Plane-Wave Butler Formalism and Reduced Widths and
           Spectroscopic Factors were Calculated.
           The (P,T) Results,When Compared to Those For the
           Inverse (T,P) Reactions,Inducate That Such Experiments
           May Possible be Described Using a Simple Stripping
           Formalism.
           Deuteron and Triton Spectra were Stored in Separate
           Subgroups of the Analyzer.
DETECTOR   (TELES).A Del'Ta E,E Counter Telescope was Used For
           Particle Detection.The Del'Ta E Counter Used was a
           Double-Celled Proportional Counter.It was Filled with a
           Gas Consisting of 90% Argon,10% Methane,and the Path
           Length in Gas was 3 in.This Counter was Operated at
           Pressures Ranging from 20 to 45 in. Of Mercury.
           The E Counter was Usually a Diffused Junction Solid-
           State Detector,Although Both Nai(TL) And Csi(TL)
           E Counters were Also Used.Collimation was done at the
           Entrance to the Del'Ta E Proportional Counter and There
           Was Negligible Gas-Scattering Loss of Particles in the
           Del'Ta E Counter.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAPTN).The Princeton Variable Energy
           Cyclotron.
METHOD     (BCINT)
ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR).Data-Point Reader Uncertainty.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.

SAMPLE     B-11 was Available in the Form of Powdered Boron,
           Enriched to 89% in B-11.A Target was Prepared from
           This by Floating a Suspension of Boron in Polystyrene
           And Benzene on Water.The Benzene Evaporated Leaving a
           Foil Containing About 1 Mg/Cm**2 Polystyrene and About
            1.5 Mg/Cm**2 Boron.In Order to Secure the Differential
           Cross Section a Target of Natural B(4)C was Used.This
           Was Prepared by Pouring a Slurry of B(4)C in Distilled
           Water onto 0.1-Mil Pt Foil and Letting the Water
           Evaporate.
