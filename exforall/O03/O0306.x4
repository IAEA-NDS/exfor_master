METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB) The proton beam and irradiation times used were-
            20 Nanoamperes and 3-5 hour for Pb foils,
            36 Nanoamperes and 1 hour for Nai pellets,
            20 Nanoamperes and 3 hour for RbCl pellets.
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)  The  stacks  were  repeatedly measured over a
           period of several day.
ERR-ANALYS In the Calculation of the cross sections the following
           errors have been taken into account-
           (ERR-1) The Error in the primary incident energy of the
           proton beam.
           (ERR-2) The error in the total number of protons on the
           targets (mainly due to the error of the monitor
           reactions) in the stack.
           (ERR-3) The error in the target thickness for foils.
           (ERR-4) The error in the target thickness for pellets.
           (ERR-5,3.,5.) The statistical error in the integrated
           area of the photo-peaks.
           (ERR-S) The error in the counting statistics.
           (ERR-7) The error in the absolute efficiency of the
           germanium detector.
           (ERR-8) The error in the attenuation corrections.
           (ERR-9) The error in the decay-data.
           (ERR-10) The Error in the counting geometry.
           (ERR-11) The error of irradiation and decay times.

REACTION   (82-PB-208(P,X)81-TL-202,,TTY,,DT)
SAMPLE     A Stacked Foil Target -Thin Circular Foils 10 mm in
           Diameter with Thickness Which Varied from 0.15-0.20
           Mg/Cm**2- Was Constructed Using Enriched Metallic Lead.
           The Isotopic Composition of the Pb-208 Foil-
           Pb-204-0.08%,
           Pb-206-0.82%,
           Pb-207-1.6%,
           Pb-208-97.5+-0.1%.
           Each Stack Consisted of 3 Foils /Triad/ with 3
           Different Pb Isotopes-Pb-206,Pb-207 and Pb-208.A Total
           Of 20 Triad =60 Foils with Total Mass 11 G/Cm**2- Were
           Used.
           Target was Measured 4-5 Times at Least and the Final
           Result was the Weighted Average of the Measurements.
