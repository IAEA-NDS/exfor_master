REL-REF    (R,A0284001,Y.Homma+,J,ARI,31,399,1980) Irradiation
           time and energy of He+ particles were taken.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,4ZZZDUB) U-200 accelerator was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time was 5 hours.
           (CHSEP,GSPEC)
INC-SOURCE The 5.5 micro-A beam of 35 MeV He+ ions.
DETECTOR   (GE) Ge detector from Ortec having energy resolution
           of 1.5 keV for the Co-60 gamma-quantum energy at
            1.33 MeV and coupled to a multichannel analyzer from
           Ortec.
DECAY-DATA (39-Y-87-G,79.8HR,DG,484.4,0.897)
SAMPLE     Rubidium chloride was used as a target. Suspension of
           RbCl was applied in multi layers on aluminum backing.
           The final target thickness regarding rubidium was
            12 mg/cm**2. The target situated at an angle of 14
           degrees against the beam.
ADD-RES    The radiochemical yield of Sr-87-M (T(1/2)= 2.8
           hours, 388.5 keV gamma-rays(81.9%)) obtained about 45
           hours after the end of bombardment is 1 mCi.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by authors.
