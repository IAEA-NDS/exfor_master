INSTITUTE  (4ZZZDUB)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) 310 cm cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Mica detectors were used.
ADD-RES    Control experiment on Tl-205 interaction with Sc-45 was
           also carried out. Cros section value at Sc-45 energy
           of 240 MeV was 0.1 nb.

DECAY-DATA (104-RF-256,0.5MSEC,SF)
COMMENT    The authors assumed that the 5 msec activity is due
           to Rf-256 decay.
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.978) Contamination of Pb-207 was
           1.6%, Pb-206 was 0.6%.
INC-SOURCE Ti-50 ion flux was 11*10**15 part/sec.
DETECTOR   Time of transport to detector was 0.004 sec; number
           of registered fragment tracks was 70.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,30.) Relative error mainly depends on the
           statistical uncertainty.
           The absolute error in the cross section is estimated
           to be no more than a factor of 2.
