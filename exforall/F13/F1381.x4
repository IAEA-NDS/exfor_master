           protons by deuterons.

METHOD     Method of ganged telescopes was used to separate p-d
           elastic and of p-p and p-n quasi-elastic scattering
           from the variety of meson-producing proton- deuteron
           interactions.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) Two telescopes were used to detect the
           charged particles, each telescope consisting of three
           scintillation counters (photomultiplier and toluene
           crystal). The resolution time of the coincidence
           counts from the scintillation counters in the
           telescope was 4 x 10**(-8) sec. The resolution time
           of the coincidence counts from the telescopes was
           8 x 10**(-8) sec.
SAMPLE     Heavy and ordinary water in aluminium cylindrical
           containers were used as targets.

DETECTOR   An additional selection of the elastic p-d scattering
           events and a decrease in the number of counts in the
           deuteron counting telescope were accomplished by
           placing behind the telescope a deuteron-absorbing
           copper filter together with a scintillation
           set for anti-coincidence.

DETECTOR   One telescope was employed as a highly effective
           neutron detector. The energy of the protons was
           reduced with a series of polyethylene filters placed
           in the path of the proton beam.
