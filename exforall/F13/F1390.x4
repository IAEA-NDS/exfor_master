FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Time of irradiation varied from 5 to 15 min.
           (CHSEP,ASPEC)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation counter consisting of an FEU-19
           photomultiplier with a ZnS(Ag) scintillator was used.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Bismuth of high purity, the total impurity content of
           which did not exceed 10**(-4)% was used. The
           bismuth was sealed in a quartz ampule with an outer
           diameter of (3.9 + - 0.1) mm, a wall thickness of
           0.5-0.6, and a length of 30 mm.
ADD-RES    Cross sections for the production of alpha particles
           with an energy greater than 20 MeV in bismuth, and
           the shape of their spectrum were obtained.
