FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSKUR) 150-cm cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE Oxygen ion current was about 0.1 mu-A. Irradiation
           time was 1-1.5 hr.
METHOD     (STTA,INTB,GSPEC,BSPEC,CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Scintillation counter was used for
           registration of gamma-quanta.

COMMENT    *By compiler* The values in DECAY-DATA were given
           by authors.
SAMPLE     (34-SE-80,ENR=0.92) Stacks of aluminum foils bearing
           hot pressed layers of enriched Se-80 were used.
FLAG       (1.) Stack of five foils was irradiated. A 3 mg/cm2
           layer of Se-80 was deposited on each 5-micron aluminum
           foil.
           (2.) Stack consisted of four 2-micron foils with a
           7 mg/cm2 layer of Se-80 was used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
STATUS     (CURVE) Fig. 2
           (TABLE) Data for 70-MeV incident energy were given in
           text.
