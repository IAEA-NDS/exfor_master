FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB) Nuclotron
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 15 layers (10*20 cm each) of photoemulsion
           BR-2 with the thickness of 600 mu-m were used.
SAMPLE     Proton target.
PART-DET   (RSD) Relativistic fragments He-3 and He-4 were
           determined visually by the density of ionization
           tracks. Recoil protons were also detected.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainties is given.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from the text, p.397.

COMMENT    *By compiler*Original linear momentum units are A GeV/c
            (GeV/c per nucleon). The value of Be-7 momentum equal
           to 1.6 A GeV/c was multiplied by 7.
