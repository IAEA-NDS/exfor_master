DETECTOR   (HPGE) P-type coaxial Canberra high-purity germanium
           detector with a diameter of 58 mm and a thickness 55 mm
           was used. The relative efficiency of the detector
           at 1.33 MeV was about 34.7% and the energy resolution
           1.76 keV at full width half maximum. The detector was
           surrounded by a standard shielding consisting of a 10
           cm thick lead bricks together with additional cadmium
           and copper plates. First measurements started one
           hour after the end of irradiation. Measuring times
           varied from 20 minutes up to several days.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
SAMPLE     The sample consisted of three pure thorium foils
            (141 mg/cm2) surrounded by aluminum foils (106 mg/cm2)
           Foils were wrapped in a paper in order to minimize a
           migration of residual nuclei out of the stack.
