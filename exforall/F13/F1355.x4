DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Magnetic analyzer was used to determine the
           sign of the beta particles.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
DECAY-DATA (7-N-13,10.MIN,B)
SAMPLE     Targets made of Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Cd, Sn, Pt, Au, and
           Pb were used. The target thickness was such that the
           particle energy after traversing the target did not
           exceed 70 Mev.

           No explanation of relative units is given.
METHOD     N-13 were stopped in the collector made of 3.5 mu-m
           lead foil. Lead collector was put into the form of a
           cylindrical surface which included all angles from +
           60 to -60 degrees. After irradiation the collector
           was cut into equal strips for measurement of the
           beta-activity decay curve.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors and the angular spread
           due to the finite size of the strips are given.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) The error in determining the absolute
