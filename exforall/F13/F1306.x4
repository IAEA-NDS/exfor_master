FACILITY   (SYNCY,4RUSLIN)
METHOD     (TOF,COINC) Measurement of the energies and the
           directions of two final protons was performed in
           coincidence.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,SCIN) The two-arm time-of-flight spectrometers.
           Each arm of the spectrometer consists of a starting
           scintillator (10*10*0.5 cm3) and a hodoscope of five
           large scintillators (20*20*100 cm3) which form the
           "crystal wall" with the overall sensitive surface of
           1 m2.
SAMPLE     Li-6 target (10*10*1 cm3) was placed in the focus of
           the spectrometer.
COMMENT    ANG1 is an angle between beam direction and a backward
           going proton; ANG2 is an angle between beam direction
           and a forward going proton.
ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR-D)  Digitizing error of ANG2 (an angle of a
                        forward going proton)
           (ERR-DIG)    Data digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR)   No source of uncertainties is given
