REACTION   (83-BI-209(P,X)85-AT-210,,SIG)
           Averages from several measurements are given.
METHOD     Period of the bombardment ranged from 7 to 20 min.
DECAY-DATA (85-AT-210,8.3HR)
SAMPLE     Bismuth of high purity, shown by chemical analysis
           to contain < 0.001 % of thorium and < 0.01 % of uranium
           was used. The metal plates used in the experiments
           measured 10 x 15 x 2 mm and weighed up to 2 g. The
           plates were wrapped in aluminum foil 25 microns thick
           and were bombarded by a 0.2 to 0.4 mu-ampere proton
           current.

HISTORY    (20240216A) SD: REACTION code (1) deleted (211At
