SAMPLE     Bismuth of high purity, shown by chemical analysis
           to contain < 0.001 % of thorium and < 0.01 % of uranium
           was used. The metal plates used in the experiments
           measured 10 x 15 x 2 mm and weighed up to 2 g. The
           plates were wrapped in aluminum foil 25 microns thick
           and were bombarded by a 0.2 to 0.4 mu-ampere proton
           current.
