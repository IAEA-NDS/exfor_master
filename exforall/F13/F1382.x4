INC-SOURCE (POLIS) The beam had an intensity of about 10**5
           protons/cm2sec. The degree of polarization of the
           beam was 0.58 - + 0.03.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) In the angular region from 5 to 12 degr.
           in lab. system the scattered protons were detected by
           two telescopes standing in back of each other,
           connected in coincidence, and consisting of
           scintillation counters which could be locked into the
           coincidence circuit separately in various
           combinations. In the angular region from 12 to 41
           degr. in lab. system the scattered protons were
           detected by using a pair of telescopes placed in
           positions corresponding to the kinematics of the
           elastic p-p scattering to the right and to the left
           of the beam.
COMMENT    *By compiler* Original author's DATA are given in
           percents.
FLAG       (1.) The scatterer consisted of a thin metallic
           container filled with liquid hydrogen and placed in
           vacuum. The thickness of the hydrogen was 2.1 g/cm2.
           The measurements were carried out with the chamber
           first filled with liquid hydrogen and then empty.
           (2.) Polyethylene and graphite scatterers were used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  No source of uncertainty is given
