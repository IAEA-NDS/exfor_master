TITLE      Absolute polarization of fast neutrons elastically
            scattered from light nuclei.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAYAL) Yale linear accelerator
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) 50-MeV electrons on Pb-U target.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight with 27-meter flight path and
            0.7-nanosec/meter resolution. Fraction of photo-
            neutrons scattered from graphite plate at a reaction
            angle of 50-degrees. Neutrons then passed through a
            solenoid and scatter off another graphite plate. Two
            detectors placed at 50-degree angle, with TOF spectra
            stored in on-line computer. Run repeated with 10-cm
            diameter by 1-cm thick graphite cylinder.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 12.5-cm diameter by 15-cm thick plastic
            scintillator.
ANALYSIS   Narrow state at 0.82-MeV was ignored in overall fit.
           Interaction radius is 4.3-fm.
ERR-ANALYS No information on uncertainties.
