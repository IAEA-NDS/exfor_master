           Resonance Integrals for Curium-243
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) Oak Ridge Research Reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (ASEP) Mass spectrometric analysis.
            Seperated 244Cm produced by the 243Cm(n,gamma)244Cm
            reaction and measured change in mass ratio
            243Cm/248Cm.
            Cadmium-filter technique used in irradiations.
