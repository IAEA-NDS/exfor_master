TITLE      Measured Near-Equilibrium Delayed Neutron Spectra
            Produced by Fast-Neutron-Induced Fission of 232Th,
            233U, 235U, 238U, and 239Pu.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWAU)
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) 10-MeV protons on 9Be to approximate a prompt
            fission neutron spectrum.
METHOD     2-second cycle consisting of a 1.0-sec irradiaiton
            followed by a 0.080-sec delay and a 1.0-sec counting
            period with a 0.020-sec wait.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proton-recoil proportional counters
MONITOR    Detectors calibrated using 3He(n,p)3H reaction
CORRECTION Corrected for energy-dependent detector efficiencies
            and for carbon-recoil events in the methane detector.
           Not corrected for finite detector size and field
            effects (correction about 5%), or for possible bias
            resulting from lead shield.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Includes counting statistics and the slope-
            taking interval used to differentiate the recoil
            spectra.
           Error does not include the variance reduction realized
            by the digital filter which would decrease their
            magnitude by a factor of 2 to 4.
