TITLE      FISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF U-235,PU-239 AVERAGED OVER
           CF-252 NEUTRON SPECTRUM.

INSTITUTE  (1USAMHG)
REFERENCE  (J,ANE,5,583,78)
           (J,ANS,26,595,7706)
N-SOURCE   (CF252) SPONTANEOUS FISSION CALIFORNIUM 252.
METHOD     (MANGB) MANGANESE BATH TECHNIQUE
SAMPLE     U(3)O(8),PU(O)2 DEPOSITS ON 20-MIL PLATINUM FOIL.
DETECTOR   (TRD) LATENT TRACKS ETCHED IN FILMS.
PART-DET   (FF) FISSION FRAGMENTS
CORRECTION COUNTING EFFICIENCY CALCULATED FROM GEOMETRIC FACTORS.
            ANISOTROPY OF FISSION FRAGMENT YIELD,
            NONUNIFORMITY OF TARGET MATERIAL DEPOSIT AND
            SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IN NEUTRON PRODUCTION WERE TAKEN
           INTO ACCOUNT.
            NEUTRON CALIBRATION BY THE MANGANESE BATH TECHNIQUE
           REQUIRED CORRECTIONS WITH RESIDUAL ERRORS FOR-
            ABSORPTION IN THE SOURCE DRY WELL AND IN THE SOURCE
           ITSELF(.6+-.2 PERCENT),
            FAST CAPTURE BY S-32(N,P) AND O-16(N,A) REACTIONS
            (.7+-.2 PERCENT) AND
           NEUTRON STREAMING AND PENETRATION (.2+-.1 PERCENT).
ERR-ANALYS DEPOSIT MASSES OF U-235,PU-239 UNCERTAIN TO .5,1.4
           PERCENT RESPECTIVELY
            TRACK COUNTING STATISTICS, REPRODUCIBILITY AND
           DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN FRAGMENT TRACKS AND ALPHA PITS
           ASSOCIATED WITH .8 PERCENT UNCERTAINTY.
            ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION UNCERTAINTIES OF FISSION
           FRAGMENT EMISSION WEIGHTED OVER THE CF-252 SPECTRUM
           WERE .7 PERCENT
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY M.C.DAVIS,78/1/23.
