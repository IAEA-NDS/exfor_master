FACILITY   (VDG,2ITYPAD)
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.93) Isotopically enriched 10B targets,
           evaporated on thin carbon backings. Targets with
           thicknesses of 25, 60, and 100 ug/cm2 were used.
           Target thickness and elemental composition were
           measured by using Rutherford backscattering and
           nuclear reaction analysis.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two HPGe detectors facing each other in
           coaxial geometry. The entire measurement setup was
           shielded by few cm of copper and 10 cm of lead. The
           irradiated targets were placed between the two
           detectors, 2.5 cm away from each detector surface.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,REC,SITA) The astrophysical S-
           factor of the 10B(p,a)7Be reaction was measured by
           activation for centre-of-mass energies 249-1182 keV.
           0.2 mm thick Al catcher foil was positioned around
           the target, covering 99.8% of the total solid angle,
           in order to catch the recoiling 7Be ions. After the
           irradiation the activity of the catcher foils and the
           targets was determined separately. The measurements
           were repeated for each sample several times in the
           three months following the experiment.

           was performed.
