SAMPLE     Makrofol-Bismuth-Makrofol sandwiched targets were used
           with thicknesses of 90-130 ug/cm2. The bismuth layer
           was deposited by vacuum evaporation on one of the
           Makrofol foils, then it was covered by an other
           Makrofol layer. Finally, the targets were packed
           in vacuum-sealed plastic bags.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol track detectors of size 40x30x0.2 mm3
METHOD     (INTB,SITA) The sandwiched targets were irradiated by
           alpha beams with normal incidence. After the
           irradiation, the targets were dissolved by nitrate
           acid, and the Makrofol detectors were etched in two
           steps in a 20% NaOH solution at 60 degrees of
           Celsius. The etching steps were 25 and 75 mins long,
           respectively. After each etching step, the detectors
           were rinsed with water and alcohol, then evaluated.
           The evaluation was done by analyzing the tracks under
           optical microscope, and by scanning the targets.
