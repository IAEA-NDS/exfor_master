FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
SAMPLE     80 ug/cm2 thick CH2 target
DETECTOR   (TELES,IOCH,IMPSI) dE-E telescope consisting of an
           ionization chamber (dE) and a silicon PIPS detector (E)
METHOD     (EDE,REC,SITA,EXTB) The resonance strength of the
           level at 448 keV in 20Na vas studied in inverse
           kinematics via the 19Ne(p,g)20Na reaction. A
           radioactive 19Ne (charge state: 3+) beam with energy
           of 9.8 MeV was directed at a 80 ug/cm2 thick CH2
           target. The 20Na nuclei from the reaction were
           identified with the ARES recoil separator.
ANALYSIS   Only upper limit was obtained.
