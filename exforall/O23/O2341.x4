SAMPLE     (83-BI-209,NAT=1.00) Metallic 209Bi targets, wrapped
           into 16 micron thick Al catcher foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,EXTB,GSPEC,TTM,SITA,MOSEP) Thick-target
           yields of the 209Bi(a,2n)211At reaction were measured
           at 28.8 and 32.8 MeV bombarding energies. The targets
           were thick enough to ascertain the total absorption
           of alpha particles. The typical beam current was
           50-250 nA, while the integrated beam current amounted
           100-450 uC. Thin Cu foils were used as monitors.
           Thick target yields were determined by
           gamma-spectroscopy before the radiochemical
           separation. The overall radiochemical yield
           for 211At varied between 60 and 80%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code EMPIRE-II.
           (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
