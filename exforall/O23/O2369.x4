INC-SOURCE The primary 120 MeV alpha beam was directed onto a 7
           micron thick CD2 target, where it initiated
           alpha-deuteron elastic scattering. The scattered
           alpha beam was used in the experiment.
SAMPLE     5mm thick thick Si detector were used as target
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) Measuring telescope: 100 micron thick
           transmission detector and a 5 mm thick stopping
           detector, the latter acted also as target for the
           experiment
           (TELES,SIBAR,NAICR) Recoil telescope: 100 micron
           thick Si detector and a NaI(Tl) stopping detector for
           measurement of the recoiling deuterons
METHOD     (EXTB,REC,SITA,COINC,EDE,ASSOP) Alpha elastic
           scattering on deuteron was used to vary the energy of
           the alpha particles. Nuclear reaction probabilities
           in Si were then measured by coincidence detection of
           alpha-deuteron elastic scattering events. Events in
           the thick Si detector of the measuring telescope were
           accepted, if a fast coincidence between its
           transmission detector, and both detectors of the
           recoil telescope was found. Pulse heights, timing
           data, and pileup flags were recorded in event mode on
           magnetic tape.
ANALYSIS   Events were accepted for analysis when the recoil
           telescope identified a deuteron of the correct energy
           and the measuring telescope's transmission detector
           recorded the energy loss expected for the alpha
           particle. The reaction probabilities were then
           obtained from the spectrum of the thick, stopping
           detector of the measuring telescope.
           Events associated with nuclear reactions in the Si of
           the detector register with less energy than the
           bombarding energy of the alpha particle, thus in the
           spectrum they show up below the peak due to stopping
           via normal electromagnetic ionization processes. The
           reaction probability thus can be determined as the
           ratio of reaction events to all events (reaction +
           normal stopping). The cross section was then
           determined by fitting the reaction probabilities via
           Eq. 1 of Ref., and found to be 1147 +/-52 mb. To this
           value, an estimated contribution of 23 +/- 18 mb was
           added, due to undetected inelastic scattering events
           leading to the first excited state.
