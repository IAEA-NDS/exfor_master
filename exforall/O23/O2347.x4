SAMPLE     Natural Zr foils of 10 mm diameter and thickness
           of 0.25 mm
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,TTM,STTA,EDEG) Thick-target yields
           of the natZr(p,x)90Nb reaction were measured. For the
           irradiation, stacked targets were prepared, each
           consisting of three Zr disks of 0.25mm thickness and
           a 0.5 mm thick Al cover foil. The initial proton beam
           energy was set to 20 MeV, which was then decreased to
           17.5 MeV by the Al cover foil. Each stacked target
           was irradiated for 1 hour with an average beam
           current of 5 uA. The production yield was determined
           based by gamma ray spectroscopy, 24 hours after EOB.
           The reported value is the mean of three irradiations.
