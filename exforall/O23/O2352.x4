FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD)
SAMPLE     90Zr target of thickness 1.5 mg/cm2, positioned
           perpendicular to the beam
DETECTOR   (SISD,TELES) Six dE-E telescope detectors from the
           detector array of the EXOTIC facility were used. Each
           telescope consisted of two double-sided silicon strip
           detectors with thicknesses of 55 and 300 microns. The
           telescopes were positioned at different angles around
           the target, at a distance of approx. 11 cm. The total
           solid angled covered was 1.7 sr. The angular
           resolution was estimated to be around 5 degrees.
METHOD     (EDE,EXTB) 8Li+90Zr quasi-elastic scattering was
           studied at 18.5 and 21.5 MeV (laboratory frame). The
           90Zr target was installed in a target ladder at the
           center of the scattering chamber. The same ladder also
           held a 2 mg/cm2 thick 208Pb target, which was used to
           determine the solid angle seen by the detectors.
INC-SOURCE The 8Li beam was produced as secondary beam by means
           of the in-flight technique using the 2H(7Li,8Li)p
           reaction. The primary beam with energies of 27 and 29
           MeV was directed onto a 5 cm long 2H gas cell, with a
           2.2 um thick Havar foil window.
ADD-RES    (TRCS) Total reaction cross section were obtained by
           optical model analysis using the BDM3Y1 interaction
           model.
