TITLE      Cross sections for production of the therapeutic
           radioisotopes 198Au and 199Au in proton and deuteron
           induced reactions on 198Pt.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The cross sections of investigated
           reactions could be investigated using Pt targets of
           natural isotopic composition, containing 7.2% 198-Pt.
           As 198-Pt is the heaviest of the stable Pt isotopes the
           investigated products can be formed only via reactions
           on 198-Pt.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB)
METHOD     (GSPEC) The spectra were measured two or three times:
           a few hours after EOB and after a few weeks in a
           low-background chamber at large source to detector
           distances, to minimize pile up- and coincidence losses.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainties of the calculated energies
           were estimated from the uncertainty of the energy of
           the primary incident beam, the uncertainties of the
           target thickness taking into account the well known
           energy straggling effect and other cumulative effects
           of the used stacked-foil technique.
           (DATA-ERR)  The  estimation of the standard uncertainty
           was performed as required by the Guide of International
           organisation of Standards, neglecting the uncertainties
           of the non linear contributions (time, half-life,
           etc.).  The total uncertainties are in the range of
           11%-13 %.
