TITLE      A study of excitation functions for some residues
           produced in the system 14-N+128-Te in the energy range
            64-90 MeV

SAMPLE     Samples of 128-Te of thickness 0.92 mg/cm2 were
           prepared from the enriched isotope of 128-Te (87%) by
           vacuum evaporation on aluminum foils of thickness 6.75
           mg/cm2.  The thickness of the samples was determined by
           measuring the energy loss of 5.485 MeV alpha-particles
           from a 241-Am source while passing through the target.
           The samples were fixed on aluminum holders of size
           1.2*1.2 cm2 with concentric circular holes of 10 mm
           diameter at their centers.
MONITOR    (52-TE-128(7-N-14,EL)52-TE-128,,DA)
           The two detectors (rutherford monitors) were kept at
           30 degrees with respect to the direction of the beam at
           the forward angle to record the scattered incident ions
           for flux normalization.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) To measure gamma-spectra.
           (SIBAR) Rutherford monitor.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 14-UD pelletron
METHOD     (SITA) Six samples of 128-Te were irradiated
           individually.
           (EXTB)  A 14-N (5+/6+) beam at energies 64, 71, 76, 81,
           86 and 90 MeV. The beam currents of 5-particle
           nanoamperes were employed for irradiation.
           (BCINT) The incident flux was also determined from the
           total charge collected in the faraday cup.
           (ACTIV) The duration of each irradiation was kept at ~3
           hours.
           (GSPEC) In order to measure short-lived activities,
           samples were quickly taken out from the scattering
           chamber using the in-vacuum transfer facility.  The
           sample-detector separation was suitably adjusted so as
           to keep the dead time <5%.  The counting of irradiated
           samples was performed for several days.
COMMENT    -By authors.  The flux of the incident beam determined
           from the counts of the rutherford monitors and from the
           integrated current counts of the faraday cup were found
           to agree with each other within 5%.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainties in the measured
           cross-sections includes:
           1. The  uncertainty  in  determining
           the  efficiency  of  the detector,
           2.  The uncertainty of dead time of the detector,
           3.  The uncertainty in determining the number of nuclei
           in the sample,
           4.  Fluctuations in beam current,
           5.  Statistical uncertainty.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainties are given in data table
