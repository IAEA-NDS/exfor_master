SAMPLE      180 mug/cm**2 208-Pb-Cl(2) on a 15 mug/cm**2 natural
           carbon backing.
MONITOR    (82-PB-208(4-BE-9,EL)82-PB-208,,DA)
           To provide an absolute normalization for the scattering
           yield, two monitor detectors were used.  These were
           silicon surface barrier detectors, positioned at ~15
           degree to the beam.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)
           An array of telescopes using position sensitive silicon
           detectors enabled reaction products to be identified
           and their energy and scattering angle to be recorded
            (to improve the angular resolution, masks with ten
           slots were placed in front of the telescopes).
FACILITY   (VDGT,3AULCBR) The 14UD Pelletron.
METHOD     (SITA)
ADD-RES    (POT) Optical model parameters were deduced at some
           density model of 9-Be.
           Fusion cross section was calculated too.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The number of alpha-singles events was
           determined by subtracting off an exponentially falling
           background, resulting from reactions on light
           components of the target-for first reaction.
           Double-alpha events arising from the decay of Be-8 can
           be identified in the delta-E-E spectrum from the
           detector telescopes where they appear as Li-7 events-
           for second reaction.

REACTION   (82-PB-208(4-BE-9,N+2A)82-PB-208,,SIG,,,DERIV) breakup
           cross section
COMMENT    *By authors*.The breakup cross sections are derived
           using formulae-
           Sigma-a(singles) approx. equal-
           sigma(incomplete fusion)+2(sigma(transfer+
           sigma(breakup)), where the factor of 2 reflects the
           fact that these processes results in two alpha-
           particles in the exit channel.
