           (20041220U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Two batches of enriched 78-Kr were used.  Cylindrical,
           stainless steel gas cells (20 mm 0 X 25 mm), filled
           with enriched 78-Kr to a pressure of 0.42-0.92 bar were
           stacked together (3-5 cells).
                                 Enrichment:
                      78-Kr      80-Kr      82-Kr      83-Kr

METHOD     (EXTB) The intensity of the bombarding beam was kept
           constant during the irradiation to avoid additional
           corrections.
           (STTA) See SAMPLE.  Depending on the primary beam
           Energy several gas cells were stacked and irradiated in
           a tandem arrangement.
           (ACTIV) In all irradiations only low beam currents
            (100-200 nA) were used.
           (GSPEC)
           (BCINT) The beam intensity was monitored by direct
           collection of the incoming charge in a Faraday  cup  as
           well as by using nuclear reactions induced in Ti and Cu
           foils, which were inserted in front of the gas cells.
           -By authors.  The beam intensities obtained via the
            Faraday cup and monitor reaction measurements differed
           in some cases by 20%.  For the calculation of the cross
           section we used the results obtained via monitor
           reactions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the cross sections were
           determined for each target separately from the
           estimated uncertainties in the contributing parameters
           of the activation formula:
           1. Absolute activity (up to 15%),
           2. Beam current (10%),
           3. Nuclear data (3%),
           4. Number of target nuclei (5%-10%).
           The resulting uncertainty was calculated by quadratic
           summation of the individual uncertainties and was found
           to be in the range 15%-20%.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainties in the effective projectile
           energies were calculated by taking into account the
           cumulative uncertainties, the inhomogeneities in the
           degrading target elements and the beam broadening due
           to straggling.  Typical estimated uncertainty in the
           mean energy was about 0.3 MeV at the front foil of the
           stack.  In long stacks the energy uncertainty could
           reach 0.7 MeV for the last cell.
