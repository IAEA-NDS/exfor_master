SAMPLE     Three pairs of CH2 and C targets 40 mm high and 35 mm
           wide with areal densities ranging from about 300 to
           800 mg/cm2 were used. Solid CH2-targets were used to
           avoid the complications, occurring notably at low
           pion energies, associated with a liquid hydrogen
           target, such as the presence of windows, the control
           and stability of the target volume and the
           impossibility of a 4-PI-detector geometry. The carbon
           background was subtracted in background runs on
           graphite targets.
METHOD     (TRN) The transmission experiments where the loss of
           negative pions on a hydrogen target was recorded.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The detector for outgoing charged particles
           was a carefully designed nearly full 4Pi scintillator
           box 20 x 10 x 10 cm3 in size, consisting of six
           scintillator plates, 2 mm thick with the exception of
           the 'back' detector which was 7 mm thick, needed to
           achieve very high efficiency. The only opening in this
           box was the beam entrancehole in the 'front' detector,
           3 x 3 cm2 in size which encompassed the beam
           definition counter. All six detectors forming the box
           were read out on two ends via lucite light guides.
           Each detector was followed by an efficiency counter,
           3 mm thick. The data acquisition system which
           recorded the signals of all detectors for every
           incoming negative pion and thus allowed an off-line
           analysis on an event-by-event basis.
CORRECTION The resulting raw cross sections were corrected for the
            (false) detection of gammas (6 to 8%) and of neutrons
            (1 to 4%) and for Dalitz decays(1.2%) . Corrections
           were also made for the decay of pions very close to
           the target where the time-of-flight discrimination
           was ineffective. Moreover, the known cross sections
           for radiative pion capture (~0.7 mb) had to be
           subtracted.
