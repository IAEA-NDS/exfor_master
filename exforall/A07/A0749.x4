REL-REF    (R,,E.FRIEDMAN+,J,PL/B,302,18,1993) Previous experiment
SAMPLE     Solid CH2-targets were used to avoid the complications,
           occurring notably at low pion energies, associated with
           a liquid hydrogen  target,  such  as  the  presence  of
           windows, the control and stability of the target volume
           and the impossibility of a 4-PI-detector geometry.
           The carbon background was subtracted in background runs
           on graphite targets.
FACILITY   (MESON,2SWTPSI)
METHOD     (TRN) The transmission experiments where the loss of
           negative pions on a hydrogen target was recorded.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The data acquisition system which recorded the
           signals of all detectors for every incoming negative
           pion and thus allowed an off-line analysis on an
           event-by-event basis.
