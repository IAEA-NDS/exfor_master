METHOD     (EXTB) The intensity of the 7-Be beam was 10000
           particles/seconds.  The purity of the beam was 99%.
           (EDE)  The scattering events were detected in a compact
           and efficient delta-E(gas)-E(Si) telescope detector
           system.  All details see in detector and original
           paper.
SAMPLE     The 7-Li target was prepared by evaporation of 7-Li
           material (99.9% pure) on a thin (10 mug/cm2) carbon
           backing.  Special care was taken in preparing the
           target as 7-Li is highly hygroscopic.
PART-DET   (3-LI-7)
           (4-BE-7)
DETECTOR   (PS,SIBAR) The detector system consisted of two
           identical position-sensitive Si annular detectors.
           The front side of the annular detector had 16 rings
           divided into four quadrants, which gave position
            (angular) information.
           The  back side of the annular detector was divided into
           16 sectors, which provided energy information.
           The first detector was placed near the target, at a
           distance of 17mm (from the target).
           The other one was placed behind a gas ionization
           chamber, at a distance of 66 mm from the target.
           (TELES,SI,SI) A pair of deltae-E (Si) detectors was
           mounted in the production chamber to monitor recoil
           protons.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD)
           (SPECM,3INDNSD) The 7-Be beam of energy 20.25 MeV was
           separated at 0 degree using the recoil mass
           spectrometer HIRA (Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) A 25.0-MeV, pulsed 7-Li beam from a 15ud-
            pelletron was made to interact with polypropylene foil
           to produce a 7-Be beam through the inverse kinematic
           reaction P(7Li,7Be)N.

           (20070528U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The intrinsic energy spread caused by the
           energy straggling in the production target.
           (ANG-ERR) The intrinsic angular spread of the beam.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty in target thickness.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty in beam current determination.
           (ERR-3) The uncertainty in solid angle determination.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty, but this may be more
           because of the uncertainty in energy and angle.
