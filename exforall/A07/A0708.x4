TITLE      Effect of projectile structure on evaporation residue
           yields in incomplete fusion reactions

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) The BARC-TIFR Pelletron.
SAMPLE     Rolled tantalum metal foils of thickness around 1.5
           mg/cm2 were backed by 2 mg/cm2 thick aluminium foil to
           form a target catcher assembly.  A stack of two such
           target catcher assemblies was bombarded with the beams
           of 12C and 13C.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The duration of the bombardment was about 1
           hour for 12-C and about 4-9 hours for 13-C.
           (BCINT) An electron suppressed Faraday cup was used to
           measure the integrated beam current.
           (GSPEC)  The duration of the counting was initially 300
           seconds followed by successively longer periods of 1000
           and 5000 seconds so as to follow the decay of short-
           and long-lived evaporation residues.
           (EXTB) Three irradiations were carried out for both the
           projectiles.
CORRECTION For the variation in the beam intensity during the
           irradiation time.  The correction factors are
           particularly significant for short-lived radionuclides.

ADD-RES    (COMP)  Comparison of the measured excitation functions
           with the predictions of the PACE2 code showed a small
           but significant cross section for incomplete fusion
            (ICF). The fraction of ICF in the total cross section
           For complete fusion and ICF was found to be higher in
           the case of 12-C than that in the case of 13-C
           indicating the influence of the cluster structure
           properties of the projectile in ICF reactions.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The absolute abundances of the gamma
           lines of 188-Au is not available in the literature.
           Therefore, the cross sections for 188-Au were obtained
           from the measured activity of daughter product, namely
           188-Pt.  The observed cross sections of 188-Pt can be
           written as
           sig-tot(188-Pt) =sig-ind(188-Pt) + 1.0006sig(188-Au).
           As the independent formation of 188-Pt in the reaction
           under study is negligibly small in the beam energy
           range of interest due to high proton emission barriers,
           the cross sections of 188-Pt have been ascribed to
           those of 188-Au.
