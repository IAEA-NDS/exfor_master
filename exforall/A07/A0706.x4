TITLE      Fission fragment anisotropies for 19-F + 209-Bi system

REL-REF    (N,,A.KARNIK+,J,PR/C,52,3189,1995) Additional details
           of the experimental set up and data analysis.
           (R,,V.E.VIOLA+,J,PR/C,31,1550,1985) The fission
           fragment angular distributions were transformed to the
           centre-of-mass system assuming symmetric mass division
           and using Viola systematics.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) The 14UD BARC-TIFR Pelletron
           accelerator.
           (VDGT,3INDNSD)  The 16UD Pelletron accelerator was used
           at highest energy.
SAMPLE     The measurements were carried out using self-supporting
           209-Bi targets (thickness ~250 mug/cm2)
ADD-RES    (STRUC) In addition to the fission excitation function,
           the quasi-elastic data have been measured in the energy
           range from 84 to 100 MeV by employing a silicon
           telescope at an angle of 170.  The extraction of the
           barrier distribution from this data and its implication
           in the determination of the angular momentum
           distribution of the compound nucleus is discussed.
           (ANGD) The quasi-elastic ( sum of elastic, inelastic
           and transfer channels around the elastics) angular
           distributions have also been measured at a bombarding
           energy of E = 92.7 MeV very close to the fusion barrier
           for this system, to deduce the corresponding fusion
           cross section.
MONITOR    (90-TH-232(9-F-19,EL)90-TH-232,,SIG)
           At lower angles the data have been normalised
           to Rutherford cross sections.

           surface barrier E detectors.  In the case of the
           gas-surface barrier telescopes, the active gas length
           for DE was 200 mm of P-10 gas maintained at a pressure
           of 10 mbar.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the fission cross sections and
           the anisotropies are due to counting statistics,
           inter-detector solid angle normalizations and fitting
           procedure used to extrapolate data to 180 degree.
COMMENT    -By authors.  The differential fission cross sections
           were fitted to the sum of Legendre polynomials and are
           extrapolated to 180 degree to obtain experimental
           anisotropy values.
           The fission fragment angular distributions were
           measured in the angular range of 80 to 170 degree

COMMENT    -By authors.  From an optical model analysis of the
           quasi-elastic data, the fusion cross section has been
           determined and this compares very well with the fission
           cross section measured at this energy
