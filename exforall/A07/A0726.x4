           Characteristics of the deuterium liner accelerared to
            (2.8-7.2)E+7 cm/sec were first experimentally
           investigated with the inverse Z pinch scheme.
SAMPLE     Two types of solid-state targets, which were a layer of
           frozen heavy water D(2)O, deposited on a copper disk,
           diameter 140 mm, thickness 1 mm, cooled by a liquid
           nitrogen and a plate of a deuterated polyethylene CD(2)
            0.1 mm thick and 58 mm in diameter.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (SCIN).Eight counters based on plastic scintillators,
            100*100*375 mm**3.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSTPI) The Hall pulsed accelerator at the
            Nuclear Physics Institute, Tomsk.
COMMENT    *By authors*.Due to variations of the ion current on a
           shot-to-shot base, less than 20%, the charge of the
           collector for each deuteron pulse was normalized to the
           charge of the entrance grid S1 of the spectrometer.
           The variation of the normalized charges did not exceed
            3%.
METHOD     (BCINT) The deuteron current at the HA output was
           measured by the Rogovsky coil with a passive RC
           integrator.

ERR-ANALYS  The resulting errors of the measured values of the
           astrophysical S-factor and the cross-section for the
           dd reaction arise from the error in the number of
           events detected by neutron detectors and from
           inaccurate knowledge-
           of the neutron detection eficiency approx. 6%,
           number and energy distribution of deuterons incident on
           the target, stopping power of deuterons in deuterium
           containing target less or equal 6%,
           deuteron density in a target less or equal 4%.
           (ERR-S).The error is reported by authors on figure.
