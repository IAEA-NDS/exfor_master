SAMPLE     High purity natural 12.14 and 7.99 mumeters Pd foils (>
           99.9% pure) were used.
METHOD     (EXTB) Five stacks were irradiated with beams of
           incident energy on the first foil of 20.5 and 15.1 MeV
           for deuterons and 37.3, 28.5 and 15.9 MeV for protons.
           (STTA) The number of foils in each stack was such as to
           cover the whole energy range from the maximum energy
           down to the threshold of the (p,xn) and (d,xn)
           reactions in nearly uniform energy steps and to get
           overlapping energy regions between stacks.
           High purity Ti, Cu and Ni foils (purity >99.6%)
           were inserted between the stacked Pd foils, in order to
           monitor the intensity and the energy of the incident
           charged particles.
           (ACTIV) The beam current was kept constant (about 200
            nA)  during the irradiations (0.5 hour).
           (BCINT) Faraday cup was used and monitor reactions too.
           (GSPEC) Measurements of the individual foils were
           carried out between 1 and 3 hours after EOB.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The following individual uncertainties are
           included in the propagated error:
           (ERR-1) The number of turget nuclei including
           non-uniformity (5%).
           (ERR-2) Incident partide intensity (5%).
           (ERR-3) Detection efficiency (5%).
           Determination of the peak areas including statisticul
           errors (1%-5%).
           Absolute abundance of the used gamma rays (1%-5%).
           The total resulting uncertainty amounts to 8%-13%
           obtained as positive square root of a sum of the
           contributing sources in quadrature.  The strongly
           non-linear effect of the possible uncertainty of the
           half-lives was not taken into account.
           (EN-ERR)  Overall uncertainty in the average energy for
           the last foil of the longest stack (irradiation with
           28.5 MeV protons, 15 foils) was estimated to be 1.7
           MeV, taking into account the cumulative effects of the
           possible variations in incident energy and number of
           target atoms.
