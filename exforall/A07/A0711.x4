TITLE      Cross section measurements of proton and deuteron
           induced formation of 103-Ag in natural palladium

SAMPLE     High purity natural 12.14 and 7.99 um Pd foils (> 99.9%
           pure) were used.
METHOD     (EXTB) Five stacks were irradiated with beams of
           incident energy on the first foil of 20.5 and 15.1 MeV
           for deuterons and 37.3, 28.5 and 15.9 MeV for protons.
           (STTA) The number of foils in each stack was such as to
           cover the whole energy range from the maximum energy
           down to the threshold of the (p,xn) and (d,xn)
           reactions in nearly uniform energy steps and to get
           overlapping energy regions between stacks.
           High purity Ti, Cu and Ni foils (purity >99.6%)
           were inserted between the stacked Pd foils, in order to
           monitor the intensity and the energy of the incident
           charged particles.
           (ACTIV) The beam current was kept constant (about
            200 nA) during the irradiations (0.5 hour).
           (BCINT) Faraday cup was used and monitor reactions too.
           (GSPEC) Measurements of the individual foils were
           carried out between 1 and 3 hours after EOB.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The following individual uncertainties are
           included in the propagated error:
           (ERR-1) The number of target nuclei including
           non-uniformity (5%).
           (ERR-2) Incident particle intensity (5%).
           (ERR-3) Detection efficiency (5%).
           (ERR-S,1.,5.) Determination of the peak areas including
           statistical errors (1%-5%).
           (ERR-4,1.,5.) Absolute abundance of the used
                                            gamma rays (1%-5%).
           The total resulting uncertainty amounts to 8%-13%
           obtained as positive square root of a sum of the
           contributing sources in quadrature. The strongly
           non-linear effect of the possible uncertainty of the
           half-lives was not taken into account.
           (EN-ERR)  Overall uncertainty in the average energy
           for the last foil of the longest stack (irradiation
           with 28.5 MeV protons, 15 foils) was estimated to be
           1.7 MeV, taking into account the cumulative effects of
           the possible variations in incident energy and number
           of target atoms.
