SAMPLE     A natural Sr-O2 target 50 microgram/cm2 thick
           evaporated on carbon backing
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Reaction products were detected and
           identified by two surface barrier detector telescopes
           each consisting of a delta-E (30 micron) and E (300
           micron) detectors.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) Pelletron accelerator
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,EDE)
