           (DATA-ERR) Errors in the measurement of detection
           efficiency, target thickness and counting statistics
           result in around 10-15% error on the experimental data.

           (37-RB-78-G,17.66MIN,DG,455.0,0.625)

COMMENT    -By authors.  The cross-sections of the two 78-Rb
           isomers, 78-Rb-M (jpi=4-) and 78-Rb-G (jpi=0+) were
           deduced by fitting the common gamma-line of 455 keV
           into two independently decaying radionuclides. The 10%
            it-decay of 78-Rb-M to 78-Rb-G was neglected.

COMMENT    -By authors.  In the case of 77-Br, the high-spin
           isomer 77-Br-M decays by isomer transition (100%) to
           ground state 77-Br-G and hence the cross-section of
           77-Br-G represents the sum of the cross-sections of
           both the isomers.

           deduced by fitting the common gamma-line of 455 KeV
           into two independently decaying radionuclides. The 10%
            it-decay of 78-Rb-M to 78-Rb-G was neglected.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Depending on the beam current, the irradiation

COMMENT    -By authors.  In the case of 77-Br, the high-spin
           isomer 77-Br-M decays by isomer transition (100%) to
           ground state 77-Br-G and hence the cross-section of
           77-Br-G represents the sum of the cross-sections of
           both the isomers.

SAMPLE     Self-supporting scandium metal foils of thickness
           400-700 mug/cm2
DECAY-DATA (23-V-48,15.97D,DG,983.5,1.)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Depending on the beam current, the irradiation
           time was 2-4 hours.
           (REC) Gold foil of 10 mg/cm2 thickness was used to stop
           all the recoiling evaporation residues.
