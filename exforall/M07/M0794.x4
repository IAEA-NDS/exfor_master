TITLE      A convenient method for experimental determination  of
            yields  and isomeric ratios in photonuclear reactions
            measured by the activation technique.

INSTITUTE  (3BULSOF)
           (3BULBUL) A Higher Institute of Medicine, Sofia.
FACILITY   (BETAT,3BULBUL) The betatron of the Medical Academy of
            Bulgaria with the end-point energy of 43 MeV.
SAMPLE     A natural indium target was used for the production of
            ll0m,gIn,  enriched  to 80-95%  118Sn,  119Sn (purity
            93.5%) and l2lSb (purity 97.5%) for the production of
            117m,gIn. The samples had a cylindrical form as close
            as possible to a point source. They were contained in
            thin  walled PVC capsules (10 mm in diameter,  0.5 mm
            thick) and shielded with a 1 mm thick cadmium foil to
            reduce   the  neutron  interactions.  The  capsulated
            samples were closed in another  plexiglass  container
            with 6 mm thick walls.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Different high-resolution Ge(Li)  spectrometers
            (FWHM  <  3  keV  at  1.3  MeV) with maximal absolute
            photopeak efficiency 3-6%.  For low energy  gamma-ray
            measurements a "thin" detector was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The induced activity  measurements  were  made
            observing the gamma-ray spectra.
