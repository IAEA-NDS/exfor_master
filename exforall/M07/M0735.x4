INC-SOURCE (ATOMI) Electromagnetic  scattering  of   radioactive
            nuclei 20,22O on lead target.
SAMPLE     Radioactive nuclei 20,22O.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
ANALYSIS   The radioactive beams were produced by  fragmentation
            of a primary 40Ar beam delivered by the synchrotron.
            Radioactive  nuclei  20,22O   were   identified   by
            measuring  energy loss,  time-of-flight and magnetic
            rigidity. Isotopes  ranging  from  beryllium  up  to
            fluorine  were  transmitted  to  the  secondary lead
            target.    The    neutron-decay    channel     after
            electromagnetic  scattering  of  20,22O  radioactive
            nuclei on a lead target was investigated.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No description of error sources.
COMMENT    The excitation energy prior to decay was obtained  by
            reconstructing the   invariant  mass  from  measured
            four-momenta of  the  decay   products.   From   the
            coincident measurement    of    charged   fragments,
            neutrons, and  gamma-rays,  the  differential  cross
            sections dSigma/dE  were  deduced  by  utilizing the
            invariant-mass method.  The nuclear contributions to
            the cross  section was determined from a measurement
            with carbon target and  substracted  to  obtain  the
            differential cross   sections   for  electromagnetic
            exitation, which were converted to the  photoneutron
            reaction (gamma,xn)  cross  sections by applying the
            correspondent calculations.
