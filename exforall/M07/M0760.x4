SAMPLE     98Mo and 100Mo targets.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma ray spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity Ge detectors with an efficiency of
            100 % relative to a 3 x 3 in. NaI detector.
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Starting  from  the  high-energy  end  of  an
            experimental spectrum,  which contain transitions to
            the ground state only,  the simulated intensities of
            the  transitions  to  the  ground state (Monte Carlo
            procedure) were normalized to the experimental  once
            and the  intensity  distribution  of  the  branching
            transitions was  subtracted  from  the  experimental
            spectrum. Dividing    the    intensities    of   the
            transitions to   the   ground   state,   which   are
            proportional to    the    elastic-scattering   cross
            sections by    corresponding    branching    ratios,
            specially measured,  photoabsorption  cross  section
            was obtained.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.
STATUS     (CURVE)  Data from the Fig. 15 have been compiled  at
            the Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.Varlamov.
HISTORY    (20080811C)
           (20101108A)  Corr. by V.Varlamov: NODATA were inserted
            instead of DATA  in SUBENTs 002 and 003  because data
            were superseded-L0147, REACTION lines were corrected.
