TITLE      Delayed neutron  yields and spectra from photofission
            of   actinides:   data   and    calculations    with
            Bremsstrahlung photons below 20 MeV.

FACILITY   (LINAC,2FR BRC) Electron accelerator of CEA/DIF/DPTA
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Electron beam impinged on thick Ta target, the
             Al cylinder stops the residual electrons.
SAMPLE     Targets of 238U (400 g) and 235U(11 g).
PART-DET   (DN)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Twelve 3He gas counters inside CH2 ring.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The  number  of  delayed  neutrons  (DN)  was
            obtained  as the integral of DN decay spectrum (time
            dependent yield measured) corrected for  background,
            detector efficiency  and  contribution  of  (n,fiss)
            reactions. The  number  of  fissions   (induced   by
            photons and  neutrons) was evaluated using the MCNPX
            transport code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical  errors  only:   the   systematic
            uncertainty due  to the electron charge measurements
            is difficult to evaluate and has not yet taken  into
            account.
