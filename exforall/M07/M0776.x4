TITLE      Photoactivation experiment   on   197Au    and    its
            implications   for  the  dipole  strength  in  heavy
            nuclei.

            andlow  Emittance)    of    the    Forschungszentrum
            Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany.
SAMPLE     The 197Au targets used were thin discs with a typical
            mass of about 200 mg,  a thickness of 0.02 mm, and a
            diameter of 20 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors with relative efficienccies  of
            90 or 60 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 197Au(g,n) reaction produces the unstable
            nucleus  196Au  that  decays  either  to  196Pt   by
            electron  capture  or positron emission (EC + beta+)
            or to 196Hg by beta decay (beta-).

REACTION   (79-AU-197(G,N)79-AU-196,,INT,,BRA)
            Activation yield.
ANALYSIS    For the reaction  197Au(g,n)196Au  activation yield
             (formulae (4) of the article)
                      Y-act = N-act(196Au)/N-target(197Au)
             was  measured  where  N-act is N-target multiplied
             reaction integrated  cross section  (formulae (1))
             and therefore Y-act is determined  as the reaction
             integrated cross section in units B*MEV normalized
             to N-target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties presented in Fig.  8 are
            mainly from the determination of photon fluence. The
            statistical  uncertainties are very small and in the
            order of about 0.5 - 2.0  %.
           (ERR-1) The  systematic  uncertainties arise from the
            extrapolation of measured photopeak efficiencies  to
            the higher energies in 11B transitions (5 %).
           (ERR-2) The systematic uncertainties arise  from  the
            systematic deviation of measured photon fluence from
            the simulated curve (6 %).
           The total   systematic   errors  have  been  obtained
            quadratically and amount to be about 7.8 %.
