TITLE      Photoactivation experiment   on   197Au    and    its
            implications   for  the  dipole  strength  in  heavy
            nuclei.

FACILITY   (LINAC) Superconducting   electron  accelerator  ELBE
            (Electron Linear accelerator of high Brilliance  and
            low     Emittance)    of    the    Forschungszentrum
            Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany.
SAMPLE     The 197Au targets used were thin discs with a typical
            mass of about 200 mg,  a thickness of 0.02 mm, and a
            diameter of 20 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors with relative efficienccies  of
            90 or 60 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 197Au(g,n) reaction produces the unstable
            nucleus  196Au  that  decays  either  to  196Pt   by
            electron  capture  or positron emission (EC + beta+)
            or to 196Hg by beta decay (beta-).

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties presented in Fig.  8 are
            mainly from the determination of photon fluence. The
            statistical  uncertainties are very small and in the
            order of about 0.5 - 2.0  %.
           (ERR-1) The  systematic  uncertainties arise from the
            extrapolation of measured photopeak efficiencies  to
            the higher energies in 11B transitions (5 %).
           (ERR-2) The systematic uncertainties arise  from  the
            systematic deviation of measured photon fluence from
            the simulated curve (6 %).
           The total   systematic   errors  have  been  obtained
            quadratically and amount to be about 7.8 %.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data from Fig. 9  were compiled at the Russia
            MSU SINP CDFE by V.Varlamov.
