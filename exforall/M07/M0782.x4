INC-SOURCE (BRST) Electron  beam  with  energy resolution of ~100
            keV impinged on the 1.2 mm-thick  Ta  target.  An  Al
            cylinder stops the residual electrons.
SAMPLE     The 235U (237Np) target was a cylinder of  6.5  (8.05)
            cm  diameter  and  of  0.02  (0.1) cm thickness for a
            weight of 12.5 (56.7) g.
PART-DET   (DN)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 12  3He  gas counters surrounded by individual
            CH2 moderators.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Two different irradiation procedures were used
            in order to determine the DN absolute yield.
           The first one consists  of  a  very  short irradiation
            (T-irr << T-1/2) and long decay time (t >> T1/2).  In
            this case  absolute  yield  is  proportional  to  the
            integral of the entire decay curve. The
           The second method is based on a very long  irradiation
            (Tirr >> T1/2) and followed by a long decay time.  In
            this case absolute yield is proportional to the  time
            dependent yield. at the beginning of the decay.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematical  errors  due to the uncertainty
            of the  electron  beam  intensity  and  the  detector
            efficiency are shown.
            Statistical uncertainties were negligible in cases of
            both nuclei.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data from the Fig. 3 have been compiled at the
            Russia MSU SINP CDFE by V.Varlamov.
