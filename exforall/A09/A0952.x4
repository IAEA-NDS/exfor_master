TITLE      The cross section in dp elastic scattering at the
           energies of 500, 700 and 880 MeV obtained at the
           internal target station of nuclotron.

METHOD     (INTB)
           (COINC) Deuteron and proton detectors were
           placed in the kinematic coincidence.
SAMPLE     CH(2)-C subtraction was used
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4 proton and deuteron scintillation detectors,
           Each detector consists of 2 scintillation counters and
           has geometric acceptance 20*30 mm. Scintillators have
           thickness 4 mm (first) and 20 mm (second),respectively.
           Coincidences of the signals from both counters are used
           as a trigger.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(P,EL)1-H-1,,DA) This reaction is used as the
           relative intensity monitor of the interaction between
           the beam and the target for calculation of cross
           section of dp-elastic scattering reaction.

COMMENT    *By authors*. The angular dependence has been obtained
           using relative normalization to pp-quasi-elastic
           scattering at 90-degree c.m.s.
