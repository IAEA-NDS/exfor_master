SAMPLE     Half of the obtained 249Bk material,12.7 mg,was shipped
           to the JINR. The 249Bk contained 0.51 mg of 249Cf,
           less than 0.45 ng of 252Cf, and no other detectable
           impurities.
           Six arc-shaped targets, each with an area of 5.4 cm**2,
           were made at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors
           (Dimitrovgrad, Russian Federation) by depositing BkO(2)
           onto 0.72mg/cm**2 Ti-foils to a thickness of
           0.33 mg/cm**2 of 249Bk. The targets were mounted on the
           perimeter of a disk 12 cm in diameter that was
           rotated at 1700 rpm perpendicular to the beam
           direction.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) The detection system was modified to increase
           the position granularity of the detectors, which
           reduces the probability of observing sequences of
           random events that mimic decay chains of synthesized
           nuclei. The new focal plane detectors consisted of two
           6*6 cm**2 silicon detectors each having 16 strips with
           position sensitivity in the vertical direction. These
           detectors were surrounded by six similar 6*6 cm**2 side
           detectors without position sensitivity. Behind the
           focal-plane detectors, which had a thickness of 0.3 mm,
           a pair of veto detectors similar to the side detectors
           was mounted for the detection and rejection of signals
           from high-energy long-range charged particles
