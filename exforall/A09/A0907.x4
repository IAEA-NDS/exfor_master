INSTITUTE  (4KASKAS) National Space Agency of the Republic of
                     Kazakhstan, Almaty and
                     Al-Farabi Kazakh National University.
FACILITY   (VDGT,4KASKAZ) The electrostatic tandem accelerator
                          UKP-2-1.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Scattered protons were recorded by a surface-
           barrier detector for charged particles the diameter
           of the hole in the collimating diaphragm in front of
           the detector was 2 mm, while the thickness of the
           sensitive area was 0.2 mm.
METHOD     (BCINT)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,G)14-SI-28,,DA) The energy calibration of
           the accelerator was tested during the course of the
           experiment by the well-known resonances.
COMMENT    *By authors*. In order to obtain absolute values of
           differential cross sections for elastic 6Li(p,p)6Li
           scattering, the yields for the angular distributions at
           the energies of 593.0 and 746.4 keV for angles smaller
           than 60 degree were normalized to the Rutherford cross
           section.
SAMPLE     A layer of lithium, enriched to 96.9% in the isotope
           Li-6 was deposited onto a backing aluminum oxide(Al2O3)
           film obtained by the electrolytic method. A target in
           which the thickness of the backing (Al2O3) was
           approximately identical to the thickness of the lithium
           oxide film (about 30 mug/cm**2) was manufactured.
CORRECTION The laboratory energy was corrected with allowance for
           energy losses undergone by the protons traversing the
           lithium oxide film and the backing.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors on fig.
