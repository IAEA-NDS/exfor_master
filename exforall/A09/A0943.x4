           Data for Au-197(2-He-6,xn), where x=2-7 reported in
           F0837002-011
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4ZZZDUB)  the MC400 accelerator
           (FRS,4ZZZDUB) AKULINA facility achromatic separator.
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 6He nuclei with energy E=18*A MeV
           was obtained in the channel of the AKULINA facility
           achromatic separator.
SAMPLE     Au-197 was used (detail was reported in F0837001
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,MCPLT,CSICR) multilayer telescope technique
           The beam was then passed through the first group of
           detectors delta-E1 and delta-E2 were replaced by
           plastic delta-E and Si plates of appropriate
           The beam was then passed through the system of
           detectors of an active collimator. Si-(H = 13.6 mm)
           and MCP detectors were used in this experiment.
           Finally, the beam was incident on a target of Au(H=10,
           20 mum), located in the center of a CsI(Tl) gamma-
           spectrometer with 4-pi geometry.
           A p-i-n detector (S = 20*20 mm**2, H=1400 mum) with a
           system for identifying charged particles in the form
           of a pulse was used as E detector. A fast plastic
           scintillator E-detector equipped with a PEM
           photomultiplier was used .
