FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) The UNILAC accelerator.
           (FRS,2GERGSI) The velocity filter SHIP(Separator for
            Heavy-Ion reaction Products) at GSI.
SAMPLE     The enrichment of Cm-248 was 96.85%. Impurities of
           lighter curium isotopes were 0.015% of Cm-247, 3.10% of
           Cm-246, 0.031% of Cm-245 and 0.0007% of Cm-244.
           The titanium foils were produced by cold rolling in
           the GSI target laboratory. Thicknesses of 2.2-2.4 mum
           were achieved. The titanium backing foils were glued
           onto aluminium frames of 1mm thickness. Before
           deposition of the curium material, the titanium backing
           foils were tested and their thicknesses were remeasured
           using the methods of electron scattering and alpha-
           particle energy loss. The amount of Cm-248 deposited on
           the titanium backing was between 0.454 and
           0.465 mg/cm**2. For the further calculations we used a
           mean value of 0.460 mg/cm**2.
           For determining the energy loss of the beam particles
           inside the targets-two oxides of curium -CmO(2) and
           Cm(2)O(3) were used.
           In the case of a CmO(2) layer of 0.519 mg/cm**2
           thickness, the energy loss of Ca-48 is 4.25 and 4.22MeV
           for the lower and higher beam energy, respectively. In
           the case of a Cm(2)O(3) layer of 0.505 mg/cm**2
           thickness, the energy losses amount to 3.97 and 3.95MeV
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporated residues(ERs) were
           separated from the beam by the velocity filter SHIP and
           implanted into a position-sensitive 16-strip Si
           PIPS detector (stop detector) with an active area of
           80 mm*35 mm. Escaping alpha-particles or complementary
           fission fragments were detected by a 'box detector'
           which covered an area of 85% of the backward hemisphere
           (SISD)
           The detector system was completed by a Si veto detector
           and a Ge clover detector, both mounted behind the
           stop detector. The veto detector had the same size and
           thickness as the stop detector, the clover detector
           was separated from the SHIP vacuum by a 1mm thick
           aluminium window. The detector consisted of four Ge-
           crystals, each with a diameter of 50 mm and a length of
           70 mm.
