FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB)the U-400M cyclotron of FLNR
           (PRJFS,4ZZZDUB) The secondary beams of He-6 and He-8
           nuclei produced by the double achromatic magnetic
           separator ACCULINNA
INC-SOURCE Experiments were performed using a 34 MeV/A primary
           beam of B-11 delivered by the JINR U-400M cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The spectrometer ACCULINNA was used to separate
           He-8 from all other reaction products.
           (TELES,SI,SI) a telescope consisting of one 300 mum and
            1mm thick annular Si detectors. The active areas of
           these detectors had the outer and inner diameters of
            82 mm and 32 mm, respectively.  The first, 300 mum
           detector, was segmented in 16 rings on one side and
            16 sectors on the other side and the second,
            1 mm detector, was not segmented. A veto detector was
           installed upstream of the proton telescope to alert to
           the signals generated by the beam halo- for protons.
           A zero-angle Si detector telescope for the 6He and 8He
           included six squared (60*60mm) 1mm thick detectors. The
           first two detectors of the telescope were segmented in
            16 strips each in the vertical and horizontal
           directions. All other detectors in the telescope were
           segmented in 4 strips in the He-8 run and in 16 strips
           in the He-6 run.
            An array of 48 detector modules of the neutron time of
           flight spectrometer DEMON was installed in the forward
           direction at a distance of 3.1 m from the target. In
           events where triple p-6He-n coincidences were detected
           the complete reaction kinematics was reconstructed.
SAMPLE     The tritium target was used.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The lowest-energy group of events in the
           He-10 spectrum was observed at approx. 3 MeV with a
           cross-section of approx. 140 mu-b/sr. This result is
           consistent with the previously reported observation of
           He-10 providing a new g.s. position for He-10 at about
            3 MeV.
