SAMPLE     Si-28 was used as target.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SILI)  The scattered alpha-particles were
           detected by a telescope consisting of five silicon
           detectors of different thickness. A S(Li) ring detector
           with 8 mm inner diameter and 3 mm thick was used as an
           active collimator. The first two detectors, delta-E1
           and delta-E2, were used to separate elastically-
           scattered alpha-particles with an energy E(a), which
           consequently could induce various nuclear reactions in
           the delta-E3 detector and hence change their energy.
           The reaction products were selected using a delta-E3
           and delta-E4 two dimensional plot. The thickness of
           detectors delta-E1 and delta-E2 was 100 mum,
           of delta-E3 and delta-E4 was 160 mum.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(A,EL)6-C-12,,DA)  A self-supported C-12 target,
           0.45 mg/cm**2 thick, was used.
