DETECTOR   (SCIN) plastic scintillators
           (MWPC) two multiwire proportional chambers
            The neutrons were recorded by neutron detectors of
           three types. The low-energy neutron-spectrum section
           between 0.5 and 3 MeV was measured at an angle of 120-
           degree in experiments with beryllium and lead targets
           by means of detector D1 based on a thin stilbene
           crystal. The region of energies above 2 to 3 MeV was
           studied with the aid of detectors D2 based on stilbene
           crystals of a larger volume and detectors D3 based on a
           thick plastic scintillator. The distances from the
           target to the neutron detectors were 64 cm for D1,
             115 to 125 cm for D2 and 200 to 220 cm for D3.
           Veto counters based on thin plastic scintillators
           and arranged in front of the neutron detectors were
           used to discriminate charged particles.

CORRECTION *By author*.The total correction for the loss
           of neutrons because of interaction in the target,
           the veto-detector scintillators and the lead layer in
           front of the neutron detector and because of scattering
           into the detector as the neutrons traverse the target
           was 11%, on average. This was not so only for a number
           of measurements with Be, Al, and Cu targets, where this
           correction was as large as 27%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,16.,25.).The systematic error associated
           with determining the number of target atoms and the
           number of protons that hit the target, as well as with
           taking into account the background, ranged from 16
           to 25% for various angles and detectors.
STATUS      The letter was sent to V.I.Yurevich 25.03.2011
           and received the answer 31.03.2011-
              I am sorry,the numerical data are not available for
           free distribution-Vladimir Yurevich.
