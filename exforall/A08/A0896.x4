SAMPLE     The Pb-207 target was prepared from enriched (92.4 %)
           material. Metallic lead was evaporated on a carbon foil
            36 mug/cm**2 to a thickness of 435 mug/cm**2. The lead
           was then covered by a carbon foil of 10 mug/cm**2
           thickness. The thicker carbon foil was oriented up-
           stream and a charge equilibration foil 60 mug/cm**2
           carbon was mounted downstream at a distance of 16 cm
           from the target.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) The UNILAC accelerator.
           (FRS,2GERGSI) The velocity filter SHIP(Separator for
            Heavy-Ion reaction Products) at GSI.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporated residues(ERs) were
           separated from the beam by the velocity filter SHIP and
           implanted into a position-sensitive strip Si detector
            (focal-plane stop detector)
           (SISD)

DECAY-DATA (110-DS-270-G,,A,11030.)
           Alpha decay (11.03+-0.05 MeV) measured
           Half-life is 100+-140,40 micro-sec
           (110-DS-270-M,,A,10950.,,A,11150.,,A,12150.)
           Alpha rays of energy (10.95+-0.02), (11.15+-0.02) and
            (12.15+-0.05) MeV were attributed to the decay of the
           isomer.
           Half-life is 6.0+-8.2,2.2 msec) measured
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S). The error bar represents the statistical
           uncertainty only, systematic deviations may change the
           cross-section value up to a factor of two.
