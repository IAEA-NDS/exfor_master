SAMPLE     A cylindrical lead target of  20 cm in diameter and
            25 cm thick was used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) One-litre (10*10*10 cm**3) organic scintillators
           were used as the detectors. The first detector was
           placed at distance 8.7 m from the face plane, the
           second detector was placed at distance 29 m at the same
           angle.
FACILITY   (SRING,4RUSFVE) the U-1.5 ring accelerator
METHOD     (TOF) A calorimetric-time-of-flight(CTOF) technique.
