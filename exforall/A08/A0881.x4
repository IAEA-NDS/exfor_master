DETECTOR   (HPGE) All measurements were performed using an HPGe
           detector with 50% efficiency with respect to NaI and
           the FWHM was 1.8 keV for a gamma energy of 1.3 MeV.

          2(VDGT,4ZZZDUB) An experiment on an EG-5 electrostatic
           generator(Laboratory of Neutron Physics, Joint
           Institute for Nuclear Research) was also performed to
           reduce the energy spread of deuterons in the
           subbarrier energy region.
SAMPLE    1The stack of targets consisting of scandium foils with
           thicknesses from 3 to 5 mum was installed at the center
           of the reaction chamber, under the deuteron beam.
           The stack also included titanium foils with thicknesses
           of 1.8 mum, which were used for the monitor reaction.
           Aluminium degraders with thicknesses from 5 to 50 mum
           were installed between targets to reduce the deuteron
           energy. Deuteron energies of 11.7 to 2.0 MeV were
           absorbed in the applied arrays of Sc targets.
          2Scandium foils, thickness, 2 mum, were irradiated by a
           deuteron beam with an energy varying from 0.9 to 2.5MeV

DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors with an energy resolution of
           approx. 1.2 keV for E(g)=662 keV were used in the
           measurements.
FACILITY   (VDGT,4ZZZDUB) A 6He beam was obtained at the DRIBs
           accelerator complex for radioactive beams(Laboratory
           of Nuclear Reactions, Joint Institute for Nuclear
           Research), which is a tandem of two accelerators U-400M
           and U-400 (ISOL).
SAMPLE     The target stack consisted of six Sc foils with
           thicknesses of 3 to 5 mum. The first stack was
           irradiated with a calculated 6He energy of 20 MeV.
           A stack of three Sc foils was irradiated by a 6He beam
           with an energy of ions incident on the stack of about
            23 MeV.
           In both arrays, Al foils with different thicknesses
           were placed between the Sc targets to measure the 6He
           energy.
