            A detailed description of the experiment.
FACILITY   (SRING,4RUSFVE) the U-1.5 ring accelerator
ADD-RES    (COMP).The MARS and the MCNPX code systems.
SAMPLE     A solid iron cylinder with a length of 25 cm and
           diameter of 20 cm was used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) One-litre (10*10*10 cm**3) organic scintillators
           were used as the detectors. The first detector was
           placed at distance 8.7 m from the face plane, the
           second detector was placed at distance 29 m at the same
           angle.
ERR-ANALYS The total relative error including beam intensity,
           beam energy, detector sensitivity, and photometric
           signal errors for 0.4-1.2-GeV protons are presented on
           fig.3.
METHOD     (TOF) A calorimetric-time-of-flight(CTOF) technique.
           (INTB)
STATUS     (CURVE) The letter was send 31.03.2010 to
           V.I.Belyakov-Bodin.
