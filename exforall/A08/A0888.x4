FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) the U-200 cyclotrons of FLNR,
                                                  JINR, Dubna
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,BCINT)
            Both targets were irradiated in an inside irradiation
           position of the U-200 cyclotron with an incident
           alpha-beam of 35 MeV energy, a beam current of 5 mA
           and irradiation angle of 10.degr to the target surface.
