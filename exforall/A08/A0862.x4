METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (EXTB)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The inelastic cross section of relativistic
           protons in Pb was determined indirectly by measuring
           the neutron distribution along a Lead spallation
           neutron source.
           The spallation neutron source was irradiated by 1, 1.5
           and 2 GeV protons. The experimental results were
           obtained using passive methods. By the use of the beam
           attenuation coefficient, deduced by a fitting procedure
           of experimental data, the inelastic cross section of
           protons in Pb was determined.
SAMPLE     A cylindrical Pb target, with 40 cm length and 8 cm in
           diameter covered with a paraffin moderator 6 cm in
           thickness.
DETECTOR   (TRD) The neutron distribution was studied on the
           paraffin moderator a long the target by using Solid
           State Nuclear Track Detectors(SSNTDs).
           Natural Cd foils (mass approx.2 gram, purity 99.9%,
           thickness 1 mm) were also used as an activation
           detector.
COMMENT    *By author*.Each part of the neutron spectrum was
           measured by using two different techniques.
           Neutron fluencies are presented for three neutron
           energy ranges. Thermal neutrons with En < 1 eV, slow
            (1 eV < En < 10 keV) and fast neutrons
            (0.3 MeV < En < 3 MeV) are shown for an irradiation of
           the target with protons of 1 GeV. Slow neutrons were
           measured by Cd-nat activation method while thermal
           neutrons with En < 1 eV and fast neutrons by SSNTDs
           technique.
