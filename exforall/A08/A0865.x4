FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) Experiment performed using UNILAC
           accelerator and velocity filter SHIP at GSI Darmstadt
SAMPLE     The targets were prepared from isotopically enriched
           Pb-207. Layers of 380 mug/cm**2 thickness of the
           chemical compound Pb-207-S have been evaporated on
           carbon foils of 40 mug/cm**2  and covered by
            10 mug/cm**2 carbon.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Velocity separator SHIP with crossed
           magnetic and electric fields was used
           (SISD)
METHOD     (OLMS) On-line velocity separation

COMMENT    *By author*. The double differential cross-sections are
           related to the acceptance angle of the separator,
           which is (0 +-2) degree and to the setting which leads
           to optimized transmission of the respective transfer
           product. Corrections for the transmission have not been
           done, therefore, the cross-sections could be up to a
           factor of two larger after correction. This is a rough
           guess. The cross-sections in the table are given in
           nb/sr. The beam energy is given in the centre-of-mass.
