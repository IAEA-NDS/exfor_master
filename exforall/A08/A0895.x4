SAMPLE     In part 1 the targets were prepared from the chemical
           compound U238F(4) using natural uranium. Layers of
            488, 408 and 451 mug/cm**2 U238F(4) were evaporated on
           backing foils of 42 mug/cm**2 carbon and subsequently
           covered with carbon layers of 10, in a few cases also
           of 20 mug/cm**2.
           In parts 2 and 3 we used metallic uranium targets.
           Metallic U-238 electrodes with a U-235 depletion to
            0.2% were the starting material. The thickness of the
           uranium layers was about 300 mug/cm**2.
           In all parts of the experiment a carbon foil of
            30 mug/cm**2 thickness was placed at a distance of
            125 mm behind the target.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) The UNILAC accelerator.
           (FRS,2GERGSI) The velocity filter SHIP(Separator for
            Heavy-Ion reaction Products) at GSI.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporated residues(ERs) were
           separated from the beam by the velocity filter SHIP and
           implanted into a position-sensitive strip Si detector
            (focal-plane stop detector)
           (SISD)
           The detector system was completed by a Si veto detector
           and a Ge clover detector, both mounted behind the
           stop detector. The clover detector was separated from
           the SHIP vacuum by a 1mm thick aluminium window. The
           detector consisted of four Ge crystals, each with a
           diameter of 50 mm and a length of 70 mm.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Our cross-section is smaller than the
           value of 2.5+1.8-1.1 pb given by Yu.Ts.Oganessianin.
           See Rel-Ref. However, taking into account possible
           systematic deviations, the values are still comparable.

           cross-section value up to a factor of two.
