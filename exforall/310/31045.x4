TITLE      Absolute measurement of thermal neutron absorption in
           chlorine.
INC-SOURCE (A-BE) Ra-Be source of 100 mCi
INC-SPECT   Thermal spectrum
METHOD     (TRN) Sphere transmission technique. Source is placed
            in the centre, surrounded by materialunder investi-
            gation. Detector is placed outside the sphere.
            Detector foils were made of Indium
SAMPLE      Pure C-Cl4
DETECTOR    (GEMUC) Halogen-filled end-window beta counter
CORRECTION Deviations from true cross sections due to various
           corrections, which all depend on the absorber
           thickness, were avoided by extrapolation of the result
           to infinitesimally small absorber thickness.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Given uncertainty includes statistical
            and systematic errors.
