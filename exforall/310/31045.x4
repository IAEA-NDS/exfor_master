TITLE      Absolute measurement of thermal neutron absorption in
            chlorine
AUTHOR     (A.M.Ghose)
INSTITUTE  (3INDBOS)
REFERENCE  (J,BOS,24,7,1961)
INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) 100 mCi
INC-SPECT   Thermal spectrum
METHOD     (TRN) Sphere transmission technique. Source is placed
            in the centre, surrounded by material under investi-
            gation. Detector is placed outside the sphere.
            Detector foils were made of Indium
SAMPLE      Pure C-Cl4
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Halogen-filled end-window beta counter
CORRECTION Deviations from true cross sections due to various
            corrections, which all depend on the absorber
            thickness, were avoided by extrapolation of the
            result to infinitesimally small absorber thickness.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Given uncertainty includes statistical
            and systematic errors.
