TITLE      The (n,2n) reaction cross section of 31P, 64Zn, 69Ga,
           and 107Ag for 14.8 MeV neutrons.
SAMPLE     Except in the case of phosphorus samples in the form
           of either powder or foil. Contained in graphite holders
           where the holders were pots of diameter 2.5 cm and
           had a rim-height of 2 mm. These were of nearly uniform
           weight of about 1g each.

           From curve represented by Glover etc. depicting a
           variation 63Cu(n,2n) cross section with energy, where
           data of Fergusson etc. were considered, the relevant
           cross section at 14.8 +-0.1 MeV was found to be 530 mb.

           Harshaw crystals were used.
