REFERENCE  (R,JINR-P4-11794,1978) communication of the Joint
           Institute for Nuclear Research,Dubna 1978 (in Russian).
ANALYSIS    Data were derived on the basis of studies published
           in the journals (see REL-REF) and spline coefficients
           for description of these reactions  published by
           J.D.Seagrave (see REL-REF).
