           d-d collisions at low energies

REFERENCE  (R,JINR-P4-11794,1978) communication of the Joint
           Institute for Nuclear Research,Dubna 1978 (in russian).
COMMENT    *By author*.In the present paper the experimental
           data about neutron cross section in the p-d and d-d
           interactions for energies until 200 MeV are
           systematized and are generalized.

           Integrated cross sections from this paper
           were used for calculation of pd-nx reaction
           cross-section.

COMMENT    *by author*.The uncertainties of evaluation of the
           cross-sections taking into consideration the
           experimental errors are not exceeding 10 percent.
           Pd-nx reaction cross section was defined as
           difference of p-d interaction total cross section and
           p-d interaction elastic cross section.
