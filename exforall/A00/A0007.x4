ADD-RES    (COMP,THEO).THE DETERMINATION OF ASTROPHYSICAL
           FACTOR WAS MADE. THE CORRELATION OF TOTAL
           CROSS SECTIONS OF THE T(T,2N)HE-4 AND HE-3(HE3,2P)HE-4
           REACTIONS IS DISCUSSED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).ACCIDENTAL ERROR OF TOTAL CROSS-SECTION.
           IT IS CONDITIONED BY STATISTICAL ERRORS OF MEASUREMENT
            (1-10 PERCENT),ERRORS IN DETERMINATION GAS PRESSURE
            (+-3 PERCENT) AND CONCENTRATION OF TRITIUM
            (+-5 PERCENT). IN THE VALUES OF TOTAL CROSS-SECTIONS
           SYSTEMATIC ERROR +-7 PERCENT IS POSSIBLE. THIS ERROR
           IS CONNECTED WITH ACCURACY OF DETERMINING THE
           COEFFICIENT OF ANISOTROPY.
           (EN-ERR).ESSENTIAL ERROR OF MEASUREMENT-ERROR OF
           DETERMINATION THE ENERGY OF TRITONS IN EXIT OF GAS
           TARGET WINDOW.
SAMPLE     GAS TARGET 1-H-3 WITH THIN ENTRANCE WINDOW OF
           ALUMINIUM OXIDE, THICKNESS 50 MICROGRAM/CM**2.
           INSIDE OF TARGET AND IN FRONT OF IT LI-F-TARGETS
           FOR DETERMINATION OF ENERGY LOSS OF ACCELERATED
           PARTICLES IN ENTRACE WINDOW OF GAS TARGET WERE
           PLACED.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD).ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF NEUTRON YIELDS WERE
           MEASURED FOR TRITON ENERGIES OF 52 AND 76 KEV IN THE
           ANGULAR INTERVAL FROM 0 DEGREE TO 150 DEGREE. LATERON
           INTERPOLATION FOR ENERGY AND REPEATED COUNTING
           FROM 0 DEGREE TO 180 DEGREE WERE MADE.
COMMENT     (BY COMPILER). AUTHORS ASSUMED THAT
           1.ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS MAY BE DESCRIBED BY
           FORMULA W(THETA)=A+B*COS(THETA)
           2.VALUE (A+B)/A IS LINEAR FUNCTION OF ENERGY.
