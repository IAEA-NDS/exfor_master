MONITOR    (29-CU-65(A,2N)31-GA-67,,SIG)  The reaction was
           used for calibration of Faraday Cup.

SAMPLE      Tantalum metal foils of 99.9% purity and of 5 and
            10 mu-m thickness were used as targets
METHOD     (BCINT) Faraday Cup was calibrated by 65-Cu(alpha,2n)
           reaction.
           (STTA) Three stacks was used.  Each stack contained
            5 foils.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measured cross section.
           The uncertainty reflect the relative uncertainty
           contribution of:
           (ERR-1) Target thickness,
           (ERR-2) Detector efficiency,
           (ERR-3) Beam charge,
           (ERR-S,1.,4.) Statistical errors between 1% and 4%.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) The beam energy resolution
ADD-RES    Thermonuclear reaction rates were calculted for
           169-Tm(alpha,n), 191-Ir(alpha,n) and
           197-Au(alpha,n) reactions.

COMMENT    - By authors - The Re-184-m (165. days half-life)
           Yield was <4% of the total activity, so the 8+ isomer
           level contribution to the ground state population was
           not taken into account.
MISC-COL   (MISC) The authors' Theoretical calculation of cross
           section, performed with a modified version of the
           STAPRE code.
