METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,BCINT,MOSEP)
           The integrated beam current was determined from the
           65Zn activity in copper monitor foils 18 mg/cm 2 thick.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector having a resolving power
            (FWHM) of 3.2 keV at 1332.51 keV (60Co) and 1.7 keV
           at 122.06 keV (57Co).
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy error results from the error of the
           deflected beam orbit definition and error of
           definition of energy degradation when particles
           are stopped in the stacked foils.
           (DATA-ERR,12.,14.) Error the measurement of yields is
           connected with the systematical error of measurement
           activity and integral current.
ADD-RES    Theoretical yield for 186Re was given.
