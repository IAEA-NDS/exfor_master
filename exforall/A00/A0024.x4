           bombardment by protons

FACILITY   (VDGT,4RUSFEI)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Si-Au detector is ring with the hole for beam
           of protons. Resolution time of detector system and
           setup about 10 nsec. Area 15 cm2, efficiency 15%.
SAMPLE     The layers of U-238 or Th-232 (0.5E-3 g/cm**2)
           on nickel foils 2.7E-3 g/cm2.
METHOD     (SITA,BCINT)
           Absolute normalization of the fission cross section
           was made at 7 -MeV proton energy to a value 5 x 10-4 b.
REL-REF    (D,,G.R.Chopin+,J,PR,131,2149,1963) This is
           disagreement with the results of Kononov+.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainties include error of current
           integrator (ERR-2) and statistical error of number of
           fission measurement.
           (ERR-2) Error of current integrator
STATUS     (TABLE,,V.N.Kononov,W,KONONOV,19780904)  The data in
           form of the tables were received from the authors.
