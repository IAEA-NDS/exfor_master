REL-REF    (D,,C.ROLFS+,J,NP/A,227,291,1974)
           Experimental results of the present paper are
           compared with experimental and theoretical results of
           C.Rolfs et al. Possible source of divergences of
           present paper results and results of Rolfs et al. Is
           conditioned by processing of gamma-ray spectrum.
