COMMENT     (BY AUTHOR) IN THE PRESENT PAPER THE EXPERIMENTAL
           DATA ABOUT NEUTRON CROSS SECTION IN THE P-D AND D-D
           INTERACTIONS FOR ENERGIES UNTIL 200 MEV ARE
           SYSTEMATIZED AND ARE GENERALIZED.

COMMENT     (BY AUTHOR) THE UNCERTAINTIES OF EVALUATION OF THE
           CROSS-SECTIONS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE
           EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS ARE NOT EXCEEDING 10 PERCENT.
           PD-NX REACTION CROSS SECTION WAS DEFINED AS
           DIFFERENCE OF P-D INTERACTION TOTAL CROSS SECTION AND
           P-D INTERACTION ELASTIC CROSS SECTION.
