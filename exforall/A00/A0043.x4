REACTION   (6-C-12(P,X)ELEM/MASS,,SIG,,REL)
METHOD     (EXTB,ASEP,BCINT). Detector of ions is electron
           multiplier.
SAMPLE     The carbon target was a stack of thin graphite plates
            (20-30 pieces) 0.1 mm thick and 9 x 18 mm in area,
           which were separated O. 1 mm apart by means of narrow
           spacers of the same materials (measuring 1 x 10 mm).
            The target was placed in a tantalum box (with walls
           0.03 mm thick).
CORRECTION  A correction was introduced for the decay of the
           beryllium and helium isotopes that neighbor on the
           lithium and also took into account the yields of the
           lithium isotopes from the target enclosure material by
           approximating the available data for tantalum and
           neighboring nuclei at close values of the proton energy

SAMPLE     The carbon target was a stack of thin graphite plates
            (20-30 pieces) 0.1 mm thick and 9 x 18 mm in area,
           which were separated 0.1 mm apart by means of narrow

            The target was placed in a tantalum box (with walls

ANALYSIS    To determine the absolute yields we started from
           a rough approximation, based on the calculations of
           O.B.Abdinov+ (see REL-REF) whereby the cross sections
           for the production of 6Li from 12C are the same at the
           proton energies 660 MeV and 1 GeV.
