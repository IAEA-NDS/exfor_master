ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).THE ENERGY OF THE PRIMARY BEAM WAS
           DEFINED BY MEASUREMENT OF RANGES OF SECONDARY
           PARTICLES IN THE H-1(P,2P) REACTION.
           DISTRIBUTION HAS APPEARENCE OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
           WITH 1 MEV HALF-WIDTH. SEARCH FOR THESE DISINTEGRATIONS
           WAS DONE IN THE PHOTOEMULSION REGION WHERE PROTON
           ENERGY IS VARYING FROM 45 TO 55 MEV WITH
           MAXIMUM OF DISTRIBUTION AT 50 MEV. THIS INFORMATION WAS
           OBTAINED FROM THE AUTHORS.
           (DATA-ERR).UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE STATISTICAL ERROR
           AND ERROR OF DIFFERENT REACTION CHANNELS, APPEARING
           WITH SOLUTION A SET OF LINEAR EQUATIONS.
           UNCERTAINTIES DON'T INCLUDE-
           1. POSSIBLE INCREASE OF CROSS-SECTIONS BECAUSE OF
              FALSE IDENTIFICATION OF REACTIONS BY NEUTRON
              EMISSION,
           2. MODELING OF EVENTS WAS MADE IN CONFORMITY WITH
           EXPERIMENTAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESIDUAL NUCLEI
           EXCITATION ENERGY. IT MAY BE SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL
           ERRORS.
