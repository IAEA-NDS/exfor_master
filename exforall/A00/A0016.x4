METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,MOMIX,REC)
           THE INCIDENT CA-48 ION BEAM WAS GRAZED THE LATERAL
           FACE OF A ROTATING HOLLOW CYLINDER. THIS SURFACE
           WAS COVERED BY A THIN (ABOUT 2 MG/CM**2)
           LAYER OF THE TARGET MATERIAL DEPOSITED
           BY VACUUM VAPORIZATION. IN THIS GEOMETRY THE
           TARGET IS CONSIDERED TO BE 'INFINITELY' THICK
           FOR THE ION BEAM AND RECOIL NUCLEI AND, AT THE
           SAME TIME, SUFFICIENTLY THIN FOR AN EFFICIENT
           DETECTION OF THE FRAGMENT OF SPONTANEOUSLY
           FISSIONING REACTION PRODUCTS. THUS THE CYLINDER
           SURFACE SERVED BOTH AS A TARGET AND A RECOIL
           CATCHER. THE CYLINDER ROTATION TRANSPORTED THE
           NUCLEI TO MICA FISSION TRACK DETECTORS PLACED ALONG
           THE CYLINDER SURFACE,AND SET A TIME SCALE FOR
           MEASURING SPONTANEOUS FISSION HALF-LIVES.
           DURING THE EXPERIMENTS, THE ION BEAM INTENSITY WAS
           CONTROLLED BY A SPECIAL DEVICE PLACED OUTSIDE
           THE TARGET. THE INTEGRAL ION BEAM WAS DETERMINED
           USING AN ACTIVATION ANALYSIS METHOD, NAMELY FROM
           THE BUILD-UP OF A LONG-LIVED ACTIVITY IN AN
           ALUMINIUM SAMPLE OCCUPYING A SMALL FRACTION
           OF THE WORKING SURFACE OF THE ROTATING CYLINDER.

           PERCENT.

COMMENT     (BY AUTHORS). IN THIS EXPERIMENT, THREE
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE DETECTED,
           AND ALL OF THEM CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE
           PB-206(CA-48,2N)NO-252 REACTION ON THE PB-206
           ADMIXTURE OF THE TARGET MATERIAL.
MISC-COL   THE NUMBERS OF TRACKS. THEY CORRESPOND
           TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FISSION EVENTS
           RECORDED DURING BOMBARDMENTS OF THE ORDER
           OF ONE HOUR.
