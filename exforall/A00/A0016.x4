           The incident Ca-48 ion beam was grazed the lateral face
           of a rotating hollow cylinder. This surface  was
           covered by a thin (about 2-mg/cm**2) layer of the
           target material deposited by vacuum vaporization. In
           this geometry the target is considered to be
            infinitely  thick for the ion beam and recoil  nuclei
           and, at the same time, sufficiently thin for an
           efficient detection of the fragment of spontaneously
           fissioning reaction products. Thus the cylinder
           surface served both as a target and a recoil catcher.
           The cylinder rotation transported the nuclei to Mica
           fission  track  detectors  placed  along  the  cylinder
           surface, and set a time scale for measuring spontaneous
           fission half-lives. During the  experiments,  the  ion
           beam  intensity  was  controlled  by  a  special device
           placed outside the target. The integral ion  beam  was
           determined  using an activation analysis method, namely
           from the build-up of a long-lived  activity  in  an
           aluminium  sample  occupying a small  fraction of the
           working surface of the rotating cylinder.
DETECTOR   (TRD). The detection efficiency was about 50%.
ERR-ANALYS No analysis of the error is given by the authors.
ADD-RES    Schematic view of the source of multiply charged
           calcium ions is given in this paper.

COMMENT    *By authors*.In this experiment, three spontaneous
           fission fragments were detected, and all of them can be
           assigned to the Pb-206(Ca-48,2n)NO-252 reaction on the
           Pb-206 admixture of the target material.
MISC-COL   (MISC).The numbers of tracks. They correspond to the
           total number of fission events recorded  during
           bombardments of the order of one hour.
