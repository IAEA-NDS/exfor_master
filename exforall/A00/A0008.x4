METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,EDEG,MOSEP,BCINT)
SAMPLE     Target-oxide mercury. The irradiated samples were
           prepared from mercuric oxide, the conversion factor
           for the yield for HgO to the yield in metallic
           mercury is 1.17.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Detector was calibrated by set of
           standard gamma-emitting isotopes from IAEA.
           This information was received from preceding
           works of the same author.

ADD-RES     The production of Tl-200, Tl-201, Tl-202, Tl-204
            with radioisotopic high-purity is discussed.
            The energy and quantum yields X-rays were measured.
