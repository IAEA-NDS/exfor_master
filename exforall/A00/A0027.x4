           60-1140 keV energy range

FACILITY   (VDG,4ZZZDUB)
DETECTOR   (PROPC).The neutron yield was measured by integral
           neutron counting.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
SAMPLE     Thin gas target- 63-93% tritium.
REL-REF    (A,,N.Jarmie+,J,PR,111,1121,1958)
           The result of extrapolation of the present
           paper data to 1.9 MeV energy agrees with the result
           of Jarmie et al.
           (D,,H.M.Agnew+,J,PR,84,862,1951)
           the total cross-section (at E=1 MeV) calculated
           from the differential cross-section of Agnew et al
           does not agree with the result of the present
           paper.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainties
COMMENT    *By authors*.The contributions to the measured
           neutron yield because of deuterium admixture in the
           gas target and beam with mass=3 was defined by method
           of n-alpha coincidence counting.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data in form of the tables were received
           from the authors.
