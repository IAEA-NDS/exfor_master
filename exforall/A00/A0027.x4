           (19800716A)
           (20080609A) BIB section updated
            Corrections were made according new exfor rules.
FACILITY   (VDG,4ZZZDUB)
DETECTOR   (PROPC).The neutron yield was measured by integral
           neutron counting.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
SAMPLE     Thin gas target- 63-93% tritium.
REL-REF    (A,,N.JARMIE+,J,PR,111,1121,1958)
           The result of extrapolation of the present
           paper data to 1.9 MeV energy agrees with the result
           of Jarmie et al.
           (D,,H.M.AGNEW+,J,PR,84,862,1951)
           the total cross-section (at E=1 MeV) calculated
           from the differential cross-section of Agnew et al
           does not agree with the result of the present
           paper.
STATUS     (APRVD).By A.M.Govorov.
           The data in form of the tables were received from the
           authors.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is given by the authors.
           (EN-ERR).The error is given by authors.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The contributions to the measured
           neutron yield because of deuterium admixture in the
           gas target and beam with mass=3 was defined by method
           of n-a coincidence counting.
