TITLE      The study of alpha+14C cluster states of 18O through
           the resonant breakup reaction 12C(18O,14Calpha) at
           E(18O) = 94.5 MeV

SAMPLE     A 220 microgram/cm2 thick 12C target was used which
           included a 0.35% impurity of 208Pb.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) A small area delta E - E Si telescope
           with thicknesses 5 micrometer and 3 mm respectively,
           on one side of the beam centered at 20 degree w.r.t
           the beam at a distance of 89.2 mm. The telescope is
           used to identify and detect 14C. The energy resolution
           of the telescope was 2.4% at 77.8 MeV 12C ions.
           (PS) On the other side of the beam was a position
           sensitive detector (PSD) centered at 20 degree w.r.t
           the beam direction at a distance of 101.7 mm. The PSD
           was a 300 micro-m single area 8x45 mm2 active region
           covering a solid angle of 34.5 mSr at the target
           center. The PSD therefore covered an angle of
           5.84 - 34.16 degrees. The PSD is used to detect the
           alpha particles. The entrance of the PSD was covered
           with a 250 micro-m (100 mil) thick Mylar foil to
           prevent the entry of heavy ions produced in the
           reaction. The energy resolution of the telescope was
           50 keV for alpha particles (241Am source) at 5.5 MeV.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE)
INC-SOURCE 18O7+ (enriched) beam with an average current of about
           7 pnA
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No detail information on the error analysis.
ADD-RES    The three body kinematic calculations were done from
           the code PAKINE3. The CDCC-FRESCO calculations has
           also been carried out for the breakup angular
           distribution of the projectile from a particular
           state in terms of the center of mass angle.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for the energy loss of the
           incident beam and the decay products in the target.

REACTION   (6-C-12(8-O-18,INL)6-C-12,PAR,DA,,MSC)
           The inelastically excited 18O* nucleus breaks up into
           alpha and 14C which were detected in coincidence.
