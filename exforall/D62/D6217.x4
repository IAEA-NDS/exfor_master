           some natural elements

SAMPLE     Stacks of spectroscopically pure foils of Yttrium and
           Cesium Iodide of thickness 50 mu-g/cm2 and 2.0 mg/cm2
            (on aluminium backing of thickness 6.75 mg/cm2)
           respectively. Copper foil of thickness 10.68 mg/cm2
           was also used as flux monitor.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDVEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A high resolution 100 cc Ge(Li) spectrometer
           having resolution 2.0 keV for 1332 keV. The dead time
           was kept less than 10% by adjusting the sample
           detector separation. Energy and efficiency
           calibrations were done using a standard 152Eu gamma
           point source of known strength by keeping it at the
           target position.
METHOD     (BCINT) The flux determined by the Cu monitor foil
           agree with the flux determined by the charge
           integrator within 10%.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,0.12) The statistical error given in the results
           is the Jaro-erone of the internal and external
           errors. In general these errors are less than 12%. No
           other detail information on sources of uncertainties
           are given by the authors.
