SAMPLE     A self-supporting 232Th target of thickness 1.1 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) For the detection of fission fragments, two
           large-area (20 cm x 6 cm) position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counters were placed at the folding angle,
           covering 67 degree and 83 degree, respectively, on
           either side of the beam axis.
           (SIBAR) Beam flux monitoring as well as normalization
           was performed using the elastic events collected by a
           silicon surface barrier detector placed at forward
           angle and the total charge collected at the Faraday
           cup.
ERR-ANALYS The systematic and statistical errors in the spectra
           are smaller than the size of the data points in the
           figure.
