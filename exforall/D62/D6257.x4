SAMPLE     A self-supporting ~ 99% enriched target of 64Ni of
           thickness 507 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface barrier detector of thickness
           500 um with an angular opening of ~ 7.0 degree was
           positioned at 150 degree to measure back angle
           quasi-elastic yield.
           (HPGE) Two HPGE detectors were placed at 45 degree
           and 135 degree with respect to beam direction to
           detect gamma rays from the residues.
METHOD     (GSPEC,BCINT)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error associated with the data points
           includes statistical as well as systematic
           uncertainties from target thickness measurement,
           estimation of number of beam particles and detector
           efficiency.
