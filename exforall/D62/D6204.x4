            Detailed error analysis of similar measurement given
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     ~3.32 mg/cm2 thick sample prepared by rolling method.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV) A stack of nine such samples was
            irradiated using diffused beam of proton of energy
            20 MeV with a beam current of 100 nA for 12 h.
           (EDEG) Suitable thickness of Al degraders were
            introduced between the samples to have desired energy
            falling on each sample in the stack.
           (BCINT) The beam flux was monitored continuously
            through current integrator connected to Faraday cup
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 100 cc HPGe detector
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors are the sum of all the possible
            errors due to the following factors:
                     - recoil out of product nuclei
                     - dead time loss
                     - inaccuracy in geometry dependent efficiency
           (ERR-1)      number of target nuclei      (1%)
           (ERR-2)      beam current fluctuation     (3%)
           (ERR-3,,2.)  beam intensity loss         (<2%)
           (ERR-S,,3.) statistics in gamma counting (<3%)
