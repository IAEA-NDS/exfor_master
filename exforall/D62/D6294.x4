FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     The sample of antimony was prepared by depositing the
           antimony powder on an aluminum sheet of thickness 6.75
           mg/cm2, by using vacuum evaporation technique. The
           thickness of antimony powder on the aluminum sheet was
           1 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100-cc Ge(Li) detector, coupled with electronics
           and a pre-calibrated multi-channel analyser.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) The stack was bombarded with an
           alpha beam of 55.0 MeV.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Computer Code ALICE/LIVERMORE-82 used for model
           calculations.
