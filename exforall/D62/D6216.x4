INC-SOURCE Beam intensity: 3-4 uA at TIFR and 0.6 uA at BARC.
INC-SPECT  [EN-RSL] The energy resolution in the lower energy
           region was about 1.5 keV at 1 MeV.
SAMPLE     - Target is natural.
           - Chemical-form of target is element (purity of 99.95%)
           - Target-thickness: ~10 keV thick sample was used at
             BARC but ~3 keV and ~15 keV thick samples were used
             at TIFR.
           - Backing is tantalum.
FACILITY   (CCW,3INDTAT) 1 MV used for Ep=720-950 keV
           (VDG,3INDTRM) 5.5 MV used for Ep=900-1300 keV
DETECTOR   Calibration: The accelerator energy was calibrated
           with the resonance at 992 keV in 27Al(p,gamma)28Si
           reaction.
           (NAICR) The gamma-ray yield function in Ep=720-950 keV
                   was obtained by two NaI(Tl) detectors, one
                   10.2 cm by 10.2 cm and the outer 10.2 cm by
                   12.7 cm placed on either side of the target
                   tube at 90 degree to the direction of incident
                   beam. The yield function in Ep=900-1300 keV
                   was obtained with single 12.7 cm by 12.7 cm
                   NaI(Tl) detector surrounded by 5 cm thick lead
                   shielding. The detector was placed at an angle
                   of 90 degree to the direction of incident beam
                   at a distance 5 cm from the target.
           (SCIN) The entire assembly was surrounded by a plastic
                  scintillation detector and viewed by four fast
                  12.7 dia. photomultipliers.
