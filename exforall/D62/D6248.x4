TITLE      Fission cross section and fragment angular
            distribution in gold fission induced by 55 MeV alpha
            particles using solid state nuclear track detectors

SAMPLE     A self-supporting gold foil, 197Au of thickness
           3 mg/cm2 of 100% purity.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
DETECTOR   (SOLST,TRD) The detector foils (Lexan) were arranged
           at various angles from 10 t0 170 degree in a step of
           10 degree. The area over which fission tracks
           registered in each foil was 1.65 cm X 0.2 cm = 0.33
           cm2, while Lexan foils were located at a distance 4.9
           cm from the fissionable target.
INC-SPECT  Diameter of the alpha beam at the target is less than
           2 mm, and beam current is of the order of 50 nA.
METHOD     (BCINT,SITA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error in cross section is estimated to be
           about +/-20%. This error arises primarily due to
           target thickness.
