           alpha-particle-induced reactions in rhenium

SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure (99.99%) rhenium foils target of
           thickness 52.5 mg/cm2.
           The samples were cut into pieces of 1.2 x 1.2 cm2 each
           and glued onto an aluminum frame of size 3.0 x 2.5 cm2
           having a circular hole of diameter 8 mm at its centre.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma activities produced in each foil were
           measured using a 120 cc HPGe detector of efficiency
           30%.
           The detector have resolution of 2 keV for 1332 keV
           photons of 60Co, coupled with a PC-based 4096 channel
           multichannel analyser.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,BCINT) Two sets of gamma-ray spectra
           were recorded with waiting periods of 18-40 h and
           81-87 h after the irradiation was completed.
           The counting periods for these spectra were kept at
           1000 s and 2000 s, respectively
           (EXTB) The beam current of the order of 250 nA, was
           maintained in the stack for about 5.0 hour.
