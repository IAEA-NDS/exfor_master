SAMPLE     Self-supporting natural Nd foil target of thickness
            1 mg/cm2, was prepared by rolling onto a 4 mg/cm2 Au
            backing foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Three efficiency calibrated HPGe Clover
            detectors, each consisting of four individual
            elements, were placed at 10 cm from the target.
           The individual elements of the Clover detectors 2 and
            3 were at mean angles of 32 degree, 58 degree while
            those of clover 1 were at 122 degree and 148 degree
            with respect to the beam direction.
           (SIBAR) Si surface barrier detector, kept at 4 cm
            distance from the target, detected the back-scattered
            projectiles at a mean lab angle 173 degree.
PART-DET   (8-O-16,G)
CORRECTION Data are corrected for 4+ -> 2+ feeding but not
            corrected for 6+ -> 4+ feeding.
