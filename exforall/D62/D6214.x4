SAMPLE     A helium gas target of purity > 99.9% at 0.8 bar
           pressure.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Gamma rays were detected in two arrays, each
           having seven close packed hexagonal bismuth germanate
           scintillation detectors placed ~ 3 cm above and below
           the target. The upper BGO detectors had a thickness
           of 76 mm and a face to face width of 56 mm while the
           corresponding numbers for the lower set were 64 and
           56 mm.
           (SI) The two alpha particles were detected in an
           array of six silicon (Si) p-i-n diodes (9 mm x 9 mm x
           500 mu-m). These were placed at forward angles in a
           close packed configuration. A 300 mu-m thick Si
           detector was also placed at ~ 110 degree with respect
           to the beam and the spectra were recorded separately
           to monitor the impurities (mainly air) in the helium
           gas via their corresponding elastic peaks.
METHOD     (COINC) Detection of two alphas and gamma in
           coincidence.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic error includes the  error due
           to the uncertainty in beam position, the  choice of
           the fitting procedure and the subtracted air
           background.
           (ERR-T) The errors, when added in quadrature, are  33%
           and 67%, for on and off resonance energies
           respectively.
