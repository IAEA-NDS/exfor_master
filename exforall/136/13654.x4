SAMPLE     Prepared by irradiating curium containing 98% 244Cm
            and 2% 246Cm with 41-MeV helium ions.  The californium
            was isolated from the curium by a series of ionic
            exchange columns.  Californium oxide volatilized onto
            a quartz plate in a vacuum evaporator.
           Initially 99.5% of the spontaneous fission events were
            due to 246Cm.
