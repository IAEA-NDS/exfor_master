SAMPLE     Prepared by irradiating curium containing 98% 244Cm
            and 2% 246Cm with 41-MeV helium ions.  The californium
            was isolated from the curium by a series of ionic
            exchange columns.  Californium oxide volatilized onto
            a quartz plate in a vacuum evaporator.
           Initially 99.5% of the spontaneous fission events were
            due to 246Cm.

SAMPLE     Produced from electron-capture decay of 254Es sample.
            Californium separated in Argonne isotope separator.
            250Cf contaminant made a negligible contribution to
            the total fissions.
           Separated 254Cf collected on aluminium.  Sample
            contained 1 spontaneous fission per minute.
