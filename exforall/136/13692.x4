TITLE      Measurement of the 8Li(n,gama)9Li cross section at
            astrophysical energies by reverse kinematics
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) National Superconducting Cyclotron
            Laboratory (NSCL)
INC-SOURCE Virtual gamma field in the U or Pb target
            generated by beam of 9Li produced by A1200
            Spectrograph
SAMPLE     Isotopically pure 9Li beam produced by a fragmentation
            reaction of 60 MeV/nucleon 15N on a thick 9Be target.
METHOD     TOF method with 5.07-m fligh path used to determine
            energy of neutros.
DETECTOR   Si-CsI fragment telescope used to detect 8Li fragments,
            Telescope consisted of 3 individual detectors:
            . Si-strip detector for DE and timing information;
            . Si PIN diode detector for additional DE information
            . CsI stopping detector for residual energy
              information.
           Neutron Wall Array viewed by photomultiplier tubes used
            to detect neutrons. Wall Array consists of 25 glass
            cells filled with liquid scintillator NE-213 having
            the property of pulse-shape discrimination and
            distinguishing between neutron and gamma ray events.
           Both detectors placed at zero degrees with respect to
            the beam and working in coincidence.
MONITOR    Si detectors calibrated with both a 228Th alpha-
            particle source and a series of calibration beams.
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL)
           Photon energy determined as difference between the
            neutron separation energy 4.05 MeV and the decay
            energy measured by complete kinematic analysis of the
            neutron and 8Li fragment.
           Upper limit of the 9Li Coulomb dissociation and of the
            photodisintegration cross section are determined from
            measured total 9Li dissociation without subtracting
            the nuclear dissociation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainty given.
STATUS     Data taken from Table II in reference.
           No reply from P.D. Zecher to author proof.
