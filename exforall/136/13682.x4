INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-D)The incident-deutron-beam polarization was
           62%, thereby producing a neutron-beam polarization
           of 55%.
SAMPLE     Deuterated liquid scintillator (C6D12).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2 pairs of shielded scintillators.
METHOD     (COINC) Energy of scattered neutrons determined by
           time-of-flight from the deuterated scintillator to
           each side detector.
CORRECTION Corrected for accidental coincidence events and
           multiple-scattering and finite-geometry effects
            (typically each 1 %).
ERR-ANALYS Absolute uncertainty given on figure.
           Systematic error due to the uncertainty in the
           polarization transfer coefficient for the 2H(d,n)3He
           reaction and in the polarization of the deutron beam
           is less than 3%; this error enters as a scale factor
           of 1.00+0.03.
