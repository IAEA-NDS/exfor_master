TITLE       Some features of the spontaneous fission of U-238.
METHOD     (COINC) Double coincidence.
           Number of registered coincidences : ~2400 for U-238,
           ~12000 for Pu-240. Three exp.runs.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Two multilayer ionization chambers to detect
           spontaneous fission of U-238. Filled with Ar at 5 atm
           pressure.
           Identical chamber with Pu. Filled with 90%Ar + 10%CO(2)
           at 35 mm Hg pressure.
           (BF3) The fis.chambers were surrounded by 24
           proportional B-10F(3) counters in paraffin.
           Efficiency of prompt fis.neutrons registration ~4.%.
           Time resolution of electronic equipment ~6E-4 sec.
SAMPLE     12 g of uranium depleted of U-235 were deposited as
           layers 2 mg/cm2 thick on both sides of Al foils.
           2.5 mg mass, Pu-240 - 92%, Pu-238 - 8.%.
           On platinum foil.
CORRECTION - Random coincidences for Pu-240 - < 0.2%,
           for U-238 - ~0.01%, were not taken into account.
           - for nonuniform efficiency along the neutron detector.

DECAY-DATA (92-U-238,6.5E+15HR)
           U-238 spontaneous fission HL was measured to be
            (6.5+-0.3)*10**15 years.
REL-REF    (A,,K.W.Geiger+,J,CJP,32,498,1954)
           Agree with value 2.26+-0.16 of K.W.Geiger+.
           (D,,D.J.Littler,J,PPS/A,65,203,1952)
           Smaller then value 2.4+-0.2 of D.J.Littler .
ADD-RES     Q (number of neutrons emitted in unit time by a gram
           of uranium) was measured in three ways to be
           64.5+-2 n/(g*hr).
           Decay constant was defined to be 31.0+-1.5 fis/(g*hr).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are not specified.
