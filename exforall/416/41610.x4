METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (SI)  The silicon-based pixel detector Timepix
            (300 micro-m) and Si detector ( 12 micro-m ) as
           delta-E telescope provided information about position,
           energy, time and type of registered particles.
           Two telescopes placed at 8 mm from Cf source.
SAMPLE     Cf-252 source of 100 Bq activity, on 60 micro-g/cm2
           Al(2)O(3) backing foil, coated with thin (< 10mg/cm2)
           layer of Au .
