TITLE       Energy dependence of the space-parity violating
           asymmetry in the fragment emission from fission of

FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) Reactor neutrons were reflected from magnetized
           crystal Cu(2)MnAl .
INC-SPECT   Monochromatic polarized neutrons. Energy 0.01-0.3 eV.
           Beam polarization ~93.%
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Xe gas filled eight scintillation detectors to
           register fission fragments .
METHOD     (TOF) To measure beam polarization.
           (MAGFR) Polarization was reversed each 2 or 4 sec
           parallel to forward or backward of magnetic field
           Measurements series at 12-18 hr.
SAMPLE      Pu layers of 200 microg/cm2 on both sides of Al foils.
           Pu total mass ~30mg.
CORRECTION  For mixing of LF and HF - 9% or 40%, when 1/3 or 1/2 p
           of integral counts of all fragments was taken into
           account .
            For admixture of higher orders of reflection.
            For background.
            For limited solid angle ( average COS(angle)=~0.5).
ADD-RES      Asymmetry of fission fragments was found as
            (N1-N2)/(N1+N2), where N1 and N2 are normalized
           integral intensities for two opposite directions of
           incident neutron polarization. See fig.2 of
           YF,36,(1),44,1982 .
