           Reactor reactivity was measured with and without Cd
             (0.25 mm thickness) for several samples.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Ionization boron chmber KNT-52 in paraffin block
           of 100 mm diameter. Filled witrh Ar.
           Sensitivity 1.45E-14 a.cm2sec/neutron for thermal
           neutrons.
           Detection efficiency ~1.E-4 .
CORRECTION  For self-absorbtion.
           Block-factors were used for extrapolation to zero
           thickness.
