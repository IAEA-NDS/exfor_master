TITLE      Multiplicity of prompt neutrons in spontaneous fission
           of U-238 .
SAMPLE     No information.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence of FF and neutrons .
DETECTOR  1(PROPC) 28 proportional He3 ( pressure 7 atm) filled
           counters ( detection efficiencies from 0.21 to 0.38 )
           in paraffin block.
           Counters of 500 mm length, 32 mm diameter.
           Was used as neutron detector.
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber was placed inside of neutron
           detector. Filled by 95% Ar + 5% methane at 760 mm Hg
           pressure.
           Used in third series of measurements.
          2  In series 1,2,4 of measurements - detector described
           in REL-REF of G.Flerov+ was used.

MONITOR    (94-PU-242(0,F),PR,NU)  To define detection efficiency.
           Pu-242 was used as standard. Pu-242 sources of 0.1 to
           0.5 fis/sec activity were used in calibration
           measurements.

           4th series was carried out by uranium block, in a mine
           at a depth of 1100mwe in the "internal start" mode.
