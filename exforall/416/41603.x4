TITLE      Topological cross sections of np interactions in the
           interval of monochromatic neutron momenta 1-5 GeV/c .
REL-REF    (I,,A.V.Belogonov+,J,NIM,20,114,1963)
            A Liquid Hydrogen Bubble Chamber details.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
INC-SOURCE     Neutron beam was produced by stripping of deuterons
           on 1cm thick Al target.
           Neutrons outgoing at 0 deg angle relative to deuteron
           beam were collimated by two steel collimators to obtain
           5x4.7 cm2 size on the front wall of the chamber.
           Other particles were absent due to cleaning.
           Distance from target to the chamber 140m.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monochromatic neutrons.
            Spectrum for 3.83+-0.15 GeV/c is given on Fig.2 of
           J,NP/B,99,445,1975.
SAMPLE     Hydrogen bubble chamber - HBC.
METHOD      About 200000 pictures for 8 neutron momenta,
            more 1.5 million events of np interaction.
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) 1 m hydrogen bubble chamber.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The suggested pole model includes exchange by
           PI-meson, RHO-meson and in addition allows for the
           peripheral exchange mechanism. This model permits one
           to get a good description of the data of elastic
           np-scattering at the energy region 1-10 GeV.

            Topological cross sections of 1-,3-,5-,7-prong events
           in detected stars.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,TOT),,SIG)
           The total number of stars for each energy was
           normalized to the total cross section of np interaction
           which is known with accuracy about 1%.
MONIT-REF  (,O.Benary+,R,UCRL-2000,1970) A compilation.
METHOD      Each series of films, obtained in an explosures of the
           chamber  to one momentum neutrons, was scanned 3 times.
           As result, in different scanning the values of Ni/Ntot
           for i=1,3,5,and for all momenta were found to coincide
           within one statistical error.
ANALYSIS    Topological cross sections of 1-,3-,5-,7-prong events
            were defined as:
           SIGi=Ni*(SIGtot/Ntot), where
           i = 1,3,5,7 ;
           Ni - number of events of this topology.
           The incident neutron momentum was estimated by
           selecting the reaction np -> p p PI- whose total
           secondary particle momentum is equal to the neutron
           momentum.
CORRECTION Correction for backgrounds due to:
            (1) "glass-bottom" events,
            (2) low energy neutrons,
            (3) secondary neutrons.

COMMENT    Of compiler.
           An assumption could be done, that these data are
           MONITOR values for Subent 002 data, but the article
           of MONIT-REF  (,O.Benary+,R,UCRL-2000,1970) is not
           available for checking.
           Also it's mentioned in the article, that
           "this data (MONITOR) are known with accuracy about
           1.%", but data (given in Table 1 as SIG-tot) have
           accuracy 1.% - in one point,  0.7% - in one point,
           < 0.5% in other points.
           May be, authors just improved accuracy of data (Subent
           003) in this experiment.
