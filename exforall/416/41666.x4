INC-SOURCE   Boron shutter was used for V=2200 m/sec neutrons.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux was measured by gold foils to be
            1.6E+7 /sec/cm2 .
            to be (3.3+-0.2)*10**14 /sec/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Neutrons were slowed down in plastic and then
           detected by He-3 proportional counters.
            Efficiency for 24 keV  neutrons was measured with
           calibrated Sb-Be source to be (6.6+-0.3) % .
            Efficiency for U-235 fission neutrons (4.5+-0.2) %
SAMPLE      3 g tablet of HfO(2) powder, Hf-180 enriched to 73.7 %
            were irradiated by thermal neutrons (flux measured by
            iron foils (3.3+-0.2)*10**14 /sec/cm2 ) to produce
            Hf-180-M. Activation CS of isomer 0.433+-0.002 b .
            Then target containing ~6 mg of isomer was irradiated
           at external thermal neutron beam.
CORRECTION  For background - 0.7% .
            Attenuation of neutron flux - 0.93+-0.10 .
            Self-shielding - 0.95+-0.02 .
            Activation due to epithermal neutrons - 1.2+-0.1 .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main  error due to uncertainty of neutron
            detection efficiency .

REACTION   (72-HF-180-M(N,INL)72-HF-180-L,,SIG)
            Mentioned by authors as "INNA - inelastic neutron
            acceleration" CS .
COMMENT     Of authors. The experiment does not allow to determine
           which level of Hf-180 is excited after INNA.
            Main contribution to this CS - from transition to
           state with 6+ ( deltaEm3=0.5 MeV, l=1, j=3/2) .
