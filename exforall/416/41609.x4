            given as ~50 microb ( Subent 002 ).
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB) IBR-2M modernized pulsed reactor.

INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons of mean energy 30 meV, mean intensity
           6E+5 1/cm2/s
DETECTOR   (HPGE) ORTEC HPGe detector with relative efficiency 35%
           ,energy resolution ~2.1keV for 1173 keV line of Co-60.
           Surrounded by lead shield and placed at 15-20 cm from
           the sample. The energy calibration was performed by
           gamma-rays of Co-60, Cs-137 and other sources and by
           first and second-escape peaks of 2223 keV line.
SAMPLE     Polyethylene:
           - disc 15.5 x 21 cm with hollow 3x8x14 cm ;
           - disc 15.5x 7 cm;
           - disc 9.5x 4.8 cm with hollow of 5x 4 cm.
            Graphite of 2 cm thickness to measure background.
CORRECTION Backgrounds were measured without sample and with
           graphite.
METHOD     (PHD)
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,PAR,SIG)
            Main 2223 keV gamma transition CS was used.
ANALYSIS   Measured pulse height spectra were analyzed by VACTIV
           code allowing determination of peaks, their energy and
           peak areas.

COMMENT    Of compiler.
            In S,ISINN-16,158,2008 the preliminary value is given
           as ~50microb, which was obtained using the monitor
           value of 334+-0.5 mb for main 2223 keV gamma transition
           from ref. A.F.Cox+,J,NP,74,497,1965 ( Entry 21460).
           This CS value is not mentioned in FCY/L,12,(4),837,2015
           - so is not used as coded information.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error type is not specified.
STATUS     (TABLE) Text, page 843 of FCY/L,12,(4),837,2015
           (SPSDD,41609003) Superseded by newer measurement.

ANALYSIS    The peak at 2223 keV contains 2.06E+8 counts.
            The line 2165 keV area =10600+-3740 .
            Cross-section was estimated as:
            =( SIG0*S(E2)*EPS(E0))/(S(E0)*EPS(E2)), where
            S - peak area for corresponding gamma line,
            SIG0 - CS of main transition 2223 keV ( MONITOR),
            EPS - detector efficiency at corresponding gamma
            energy.

ANALYSIS    Upper boundary of CS ( at 99% confidence level) was
           estimated as:
            (3*sqrt(S)/S(2223))*(EPS(E0)/EPS(E2))*SIG0, where
            S - sum of experimental peak width in the energy range
            SIG0 - CS of main transition 2223 keV (MONITOR),
            EPS - detector efficiency at corresponding gamma
            energy.
