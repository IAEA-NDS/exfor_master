TITLE      Investigation of nuclear isomerism in Hf180m
INC-SOURCE   Thermal neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 18hr, cooling time 8hr.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) 11 mm internal diameter. For beta detection.
           (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal and FEU-29 photomultiplier.
           For gamma detection. Resolution 9% for Cs-137 line.
CORRECTION  For self-absorption.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Decay scheme of Hf-180m on Fig.8 .
           . Coefficients of internal conversion ( measured):
                             Egamma,keV   Type
            al=0.33+-0.10    57.6          E1

           See also Table on page 571.
           . Spin and parity of 1142.9 keV excited level was found
           to be 9- .

SAMPLE     (72-HF-179,NAT=0.138)
           (72-HF-180,NAT=0.354)
            Natural Hf fluoride on Al backing, prepared by
           evaporation. 15 mm length, 1mm width. Placed on surface
           of carbon prism, Ta wire is inside this prism.

ANALYSIS   Cross section was calculated on the basis of the
           Hf-180m and Ta-181 internal conversion electron line
           intensities and ratio of the gamma-line intensities.
