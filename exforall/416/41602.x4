FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
INC-SOURCE     Neutron beam was produced by stripping of deuterons
           on 1cm Al target placed inside vacuum chamber.
           Neutrons outgoing at 0 deg angle relative to deuteron
           beam were cleared from charged particles and gammas.
           Set of collimators was used.
           In HBC - neutron beam parameters :
           impulse resolution 2.5 %,
           solid angle 10**-7 sr.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monochromatic neutrons.
SAMPLE     Hydrogen bubble chamber - HBC.
METHOD      Accuracy of track impulse measurement in HBC - 2-3 %,
            accuracy of angle measurement 0.5 deg.
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) 1 m hydrogen bubble chamber placed at about
           130 m from Al target.
           Registration of particles in 4PI geometry.
ANALYSIS   Processes of elastic np-scattering, both without
            (cos(ANGLEp) < 0) and with charge-exchange
            (cos(ANGLEp) > 0) of nucleons, are analyzed,
            where ANGLEp - angle of outer secondary proton in
            C.M. system.
CORRECTION For loses of counts for slow protons .
ADD-RES    (THEO) The suggested pole model includes exchange by
           PI-meson, RHO-meson and in addition allows for the
           peripheral exchange mechanism. This model permits one
           to get a good description of the data of elastic
           np-scattering at the energy region 1-10 GeV.
