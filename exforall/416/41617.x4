TITLE      Probability of delayed neutron emission from halogens.
INSTITUTE  (4RUSRUS)
METHOD     (CHSEP) Br and I precursors were separated chemically
           from fission products of U-238 and Th-232 irradiated
           by 14-MeV neutrons.
           (COINC) Beta and neutron was measured simultaneously.
PART-DET   (N,B)
ANALYSIS   Neutron and beta decay curves were analyzed to
           determine the activity of isotopes. Probability of
           delayed neutrons was defined as ratio of the neutron
           activity to the beta-activity of the same amount of
           the investigated isotope.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Neutron detector consists of six boron counters
           in paraffin block. Total efficiency 3.0+-0.2 %
           determined by calibrated neutron sources with neutron
           energies 50-800 keV.
           (SCIN) Beta detectors were two 4PI scintillators
           of 15cm3 volume, each equipped by two photomultipliers,
           placed in front and behind absorber.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not explained clear in the article.
