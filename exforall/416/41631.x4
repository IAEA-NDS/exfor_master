INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Sb-124+Be photo neutron source.
            Be cylinder of 90mm diameter, 80mm length,
           Sb-124 gamma-emitter as a sphere of 19mm diameter,
           activity ~6 Curies.
           Intensity of photo-neutron source 10**8 1/sec.
           Surrounded by paraffin blocks and lead screen of
           25-25 cm thickness.
INC-SPECT    Main part - ~24keV, ~7% of intensity due to neutrons
            ~400 keV.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Multilayer ionization chamber of 18cm diameter,
           15cm height. Filled with Ar at 1atm pressure.
            2.4 mg U-natural chamber for neutron flux .
            Chamber was surrounded by Cd absorber and
            B (~0.6g/cm2) absorber.
METHOD      Measurements with and without Cd absorber surrounding
           the chamber.
SAMPLE     Admixture of U < 10**-7 .
           Oxide ThO(2), deposited on Al plates ot total area
           ~ 2300 cm3 ; 2.5 g mass.
CORRECTION  Photo-fission was found to be negligible.
            Fission by fast neutrons was very small.
