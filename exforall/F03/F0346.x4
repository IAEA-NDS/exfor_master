COMMENT    The solid angle of the analyser and the target
           current are thought to be known to about +-10%, and
           the angular distribution was found to be consistent
           with spherical symmetry to +-10%, over the angular
           range 48. - 134. degr.

REACTION   (5-B-10(P,A)4-BE-7,,SIG,,,DERIV)
ANALYSIS   The cross-section for the reaction was calculated
           from the observed excitation function and estimated
           target thickness, with the assumption of an isotropic
           angular distribution of the emitted alpha particles.
           At a bombarding energy of 530 keV, at which the alpha
           particles are well resolved from the scattered
           protons, the thin target yield for a solid angle of
           4Pi is
                 Y(E)=4.3 x 10**(-8) alpha particles per proton.
           In calculating the cross- section for the reaction
           from this yield, allowance must be made for the
           formation of He+ ions (which would not have been
           detected) as the alpha particles leave the target.
           From the work of Briggs (1927) it is estimated that
           the ratio of He+ to He++ ions under the conditions of
           the experiment was 0.5 and the cross-section is
           therefore
               sig(E)= 1.5 x Y(E)/N = 1.2 x 10**(-26) cm2,
                                                for Ep=530 keV
           where N, the number of 10B nuclei/cm2 of the target,
           has been taken to be 5.4 x 10**(-18).
