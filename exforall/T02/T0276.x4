TITLE      Excitation functions for radioactive isotopes produced
            by proton bombardment of Fe, Co, and W in the energy
            range from 10 to 60 MeV
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USADAV) The 30 inch scattering chamber at the
            76 inch Isochr. Cyclotron at the Univ. of Cal., Davis
INC-SOURCE Incident proton beam energy 63.0+-0.3 MeV
            determined by neutron time-of-night measurements.
INC-SPECT  Conservative value of 1% for energy spread and
            uncertainty of incident beam energy chosen to allow
            for foil thickness uncertainty and energy loss
            straggling effects.
METHOD     (BCINT) 6000 micro-Coulombs of protons as measured
             using Faraday cup.
           (STTA,ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) The gamma-ray spectrum of each thin foil was
           recorded with a PGT large crystal Ge(Li) spectrometer
           system (13.8% efficiency relative to
                                7.62 cm x 7.62cm NaI(TI) crystal).
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
            Correction factor of 0.71 was applied to the
            originally reported data.
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.B.Cumming,J,ARN,13,261,1963)
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . proton loss at increasing depths in target stack due
             to inelastic scattering.
           . attenuation (5% at 20 MeV; 1% at 60 MeV).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Accuracy of Faraday cup total deposited charge
             measurement 5%.
           (ERR-2,,5.) Each 1.27 cm square foil was measured
            with a precision micrometer to determine the
            average foil thickness in the central region to an
            accuracy of better than +-5%.
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in in standard gamma-ray sources
            (1.17%), resulted in efficiency curve errors of 5 %
            at 100 KeV, and 0.2% at 800 KeV.
           (ERR-4) Peak stripping errors 3%.
           (ERR-5,,1.) Foils placed beyond the range showed that
           secondary neutrons contributed less than 1.0% to the
           measured isotope activities and therefore did not
           represent a significant source of error.
           EN-RSL - A conservative value of +-1% for the energy
            spread and uncertainty of the incident beam was chosen
            to allow for foil thickness uncertainty and energy
            loss straggling effects.
