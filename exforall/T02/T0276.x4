TITLE      Excitation functions for radioactive isotopes produced
            by proton bombardment of Fe, Co, and W in the energy
            range from 10 to 60 MeV
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USADAV)
INC-SOURCE Incident proton beam energy 63.0+-0.3 MeV
            determined by neutron time-of-night measurements.
INC-SPECT  Conservative value of 1% for energy spread and
            uncertainty of incident beam energy chosen to allow
            for foil thickness uncertainty and energy loss
            straggling effects.
METHOD     (BCINT) 6000 micro-Coulombs of protons as measured usin
             Faraday cup.

CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . proton loss at increasing depths in target stack due
             to inelastic scattering.
           . attenuation (5%at 20 MeV; 1% at 60 MeV).
ERR-ANALYS Accuracy of Faraday cup total deposited charge
             measurement 5%.
           Average foil thickness in central region accurate to
            better than 5%.
           Uncertainty in in standard gamma ray sources (1.17%),
            resulted in efficiency curve erros of 5 % at 100 KeV,
            and 0.2% at 800 KeV.
           Peak stripping errors 3%.
