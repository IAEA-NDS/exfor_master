TITLE      Ground state proton capture reactions from 20 to 100
            MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
METHOD     (SITA)
           Time-of-flight used to reject neutron events.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal surrounded by plastic annulus,
            which served as an anticoincidence shield for
            background and cosmic-ray rejection and also gave a
            measure of escaped radiation from NaI crystal.
CORRECTION Corrected for
           . pulse pile-up,
           . computer dead time,
           . events lost due to raely occuring cyclotron radio
             frequency phase shifts,
           . the resum factor.
STATUS     No reply received from H. Hausman to author proof.
HISTORY    (20020805C) Converted from data set O0264 and updated.
