TITLE      Excited States in N14 from C12(d,d)C12, C12(d,p0)C13
            and C12(d,p1)C13
FACILITY   (VDG,1USARIC) 5.5-MeV Van De Graaff Accelerator
SAMPLE     Self-supporting carbon foil targets, about 20
            microg/cm**2 thick.
METHOD     (BCINT)
DETECTOR   (CSICR) 0.025-inch thick CsI(Tl) crystal scintillation
             counter mounted on photomultiplier tube.
MONITOR    Incident energy calibrated using 7Li(p,n)7Be and
            13C(p,n)13N reaction thresholds.
CORRECTION Corrected for increase in target thickness due to
            cracking of carbonhydrates in vacuum system.
REL-REF    (N,,E.KASHY+,J,NIM,4,167,1959) Method of preparation
            of the foils.
