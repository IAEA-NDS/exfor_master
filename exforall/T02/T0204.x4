SAMPLE     Uniformity of all foils was checked by the accurate
            weighing of segments of the foil, which had been cut
            with a die of known area. Thickness variation of
            foils used was within 3%.

INC-SPECT  Initial beam energy 25.9+-0.1 MeV.
SAMPLE     For low bombarding energy: natural zinc and sample
            enriched to 99.85% 94Zn vacuum evaporated onto
            aluminium after deposition of 1 angstrom silver.
           For higher bombarding energy: commercial 13 microm
            foils when beam loss per foil < 1 MeV.
METHOD     Maximum incident alpha beam energies measured via
            observed range in stacks of aluminium plus blue
            cellophane foils in which ionization-induced
            bleaching indicates the depth of beam penetration.
MONITOR    Range of alpha particles in zinc was determined
            relative to that in aluminium by experiments with
            combinations of zinc, aluminium and blue cellophane.

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAYAL)
SAMPLE     Target, enriched to 99.7% 56Fe, evapolated onto
            aluminium from basic tartrate solution at pH 9.5
            and natural iron evapolated onto aluminium.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           Beams were magnetically analysed upstream of targets.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy uncertainty.
           Absolute errors in cross section <20%.
           Uncertainties in cross sections magnitudes resulted
            from statistical uncertainties in radioassays and
            uncertainties in detector efficiencies.
           Relative errors <10%.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 5 in reference.
