           cross-sections fr charged particles

           Generator.
SAMPLE     Thin foils from natural targets
METHOD     The determination of total reaction cross-sections for
           charged particles was made by measuring the
           attenuation of the incident beam while traversing
           a thin target.
DETECTOR   The charge, collected on the target system, is measured
           by a vibrating reed electrometer.
CORRECTION The data were corrected on:
            * elastic scattering (was calculated from the
           other publications (see MONIT-REF) or optained from
           the optical model calculation
            * non-elastic loss (was obtained by integrating the
              total charged particle yield

COMMENT    Gold was selected as a target in order to test the
           reliability of both the experimental technique and the
           procedure for evaluating the elastic scattering
           correction. At 10 MeV, the major portion of the
           measured attenuation is expected to be due to elastic
           scattering processes.

COMMENT   The angle which determines the elastic correction was
           varied by fitting exit ports of various diameters to
           the target chamber. Results are presented for values
           of 30. and 50.degr. as a check on the self-consistency
           of the measurements. Two target thicknesses, differing
           by a factor of approximately 2 are also included as a
           self-consistency check.
