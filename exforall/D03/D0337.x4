SAMPLE     Thin foils from natural targets
DETECTOR   The charge, collected on the target system, is measured
           by a vibrating reed electrometer.
METHOD     (TRN) The determination of total reaction
            cross-sections for charged particles was made by
            measuring the attenuation of the incident beam while
            traversing a thin target.
CORRECTION The data were corrected on:
            * elastic scattering (was calculated from the
           other publications (see REL-REF) or obtained from
           the optical model calculation
            * non-elastic loss (was obtained by integrating the
              total charged particle yield

REACTION   (29-CU-0(P,NON),,SIG)
FLAG       (1.) Corrected for charged reaction product emitted to
                less than 50 deg.
           (2.) Corrected for charged reaction product emitted to
               less than 30 deg.
COMMENT    The angle which determines the elastic correction was
           varied by fitting exit ports of various diameters to
           the target chamber. Results are presented for values
           of 30 and 50 degr. as a check on the self-consistency
           of the measurements. Two target thicknesses, differing
           by a factor of approximately 2 are also included as a
           self-consistency check.
