           reactions on Praseodymium

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)  Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
MONITOR    The collimated alpha-particle beam was monitored by
           the charge collection method, using Faradays cup,
           kept behind the target stack and coupled to a
           current integrator.
SAMPLE     Targets were made by depositing specpure Pr6O11 of
           thickness 5 mg/cm2 on aluminum backing of uniform
           thickness 6.75 mg/cm2 by vacuum evaporation technique.
           The aluminium backing served as energy degrader for
           alpha-particle.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100 cm3 Ge (Li) detector along with associated
           electronics coupled with CANBERA-88 multichannel
           analyzer
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-T) Total error. The factors likely to introduce
           errors in the present measurements and their estimates
           are given as:
            (i) Targets of different dimensions were weighted on
                an electronic balance and numbers of nuclei
                present in the target were measured. The
                uncertainty in the estimate of number of target
                nuclei is expected to be less than 1 %.
            (ii) Error in the fluctuations of the beam current
                has been incorporated by taking the weighted
                average of aplha-paricle beam current and is
                found to be less than 5%.
            (iii) The error introduced in the determination
                of the photo-peak area of the characteristic
                gamma-rays were limited within 2-5%.
            (iv) The error due to uncertainty in detector
                eft1ciency was estimated to be less than 5%.
            (v) The errors due to decrease in beam intensity due
               to scattering while alpha-particle beam traverses
                through the stack is estimared to be less than 1%.
            (vi) The inherent uncertainty in the energy of the
                alpha-particle beam, i.e., O.5MeV at 50 MeV
                alpha-particle and the energy spread associated
                with the thickness of each target in the stack
                contributes < 4% to the alpha-particle energy.
            (vii) Error associated with the straggling of the
                alpha-particle is estimated to be negligibly small
