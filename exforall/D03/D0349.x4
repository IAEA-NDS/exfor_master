FACILITY   (VDG)
SAMPLE     Two 12C targets were self-supported on the Al holder
           and its thickness were of 120 mu-g/cm2.
METHOD     (BCINT)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two silicon soild detectors (3000 mu-m,
           N-Type). Another silicon detector was used as a
           monitor behind the target. The silicon solid
           detectors were put in the copper box which was
           mounted to rotate about the target.
