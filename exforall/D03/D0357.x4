           decay in the proton  bombardment of natPr

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,EXTB)
           All the cross-section values are for the direct
           production of the particular radionuclide. In the case
           of 138mPr there is no feeding from precursor decay.
           In the case of the other Pr radionuclides, appropriate
           corrections were made to subtract the contributions
           from precursor decay.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) The standard 22Na
           excitation function obtained previously by means of
           foil-stack activations inside a calibrated Faraday
           cup, was used.

DECAY-DATA The cross sections of the observed activation
           products were calculated from their measured
           gamma-ray emissions using disintegration data
           from the catalogue of Firestone et al., Table of
           Radioactive Isotopes, Version 2.1, January 2004.
           Available from URL: http://ie.lbl.gov/toi.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) An accurately calibrated HPGe detector with a
           relative effciency of 13%  and a resolution of 1.8 keV
           at 1.33 MeV was used for this purpose.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The constant component includes:
            * the systematic uncertainty in beam current
              integration (3%),
            * detector effciency (5%),
            * counting geometry (1%),
            * decay corrections (2%)
            * foilthickness (3%).
           (DATA-ERR) The variable component pertaining to each
           individual data point was separately evaluated from
           a constant component pertaining to a particular
           excitation function curve as a whole. It includes
           the uncertainty due to counting statistics and
           photo-peak integration as well as the uncertainty
           associated with the beam-loss correction (<1.6%);
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in the energy value of each
           data point is estimatedBased upon the uncertainties
           in incident energies, foil thicknesses and stopping
           powers.

SAMPLE     Six composite foil stacks were irradiated, two at each
           primary proton-beam energy of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4 and
           39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted ofhigh-purity Pr
           foils of 100 mu-m  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al monitor foils of 250 mu-m thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mu-m thick Cu degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
           All the foils had a diameter of 19 mm and their
           individual thicknesses were determined by weighing.

SAMPLE     Six composite foil stacks were irradiated, two at each
           primary proton-beam energy of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4 and
           39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted ofhigh-purity Pr
           foils of 100 mu-m  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al monitor foils of 250 mu-m thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mu-m thick Cu degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
           All the foils had a diameter of 19 mm and their
           individual thicknesses were determined by weighing.
