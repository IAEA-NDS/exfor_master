           reaction 1H(d,pn)p at 12.2 MeV

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK BIR)  Radial ridge cyclotron
SAMPLE     The target consisted of 3.45 mg/cm2 polythene
           situated at the centre of a specially designed
           scattering chamber
DETECTOR   (SCIN) liquid scintillator, NE213. In addition, a
           monitor counter was maintained at a fixed angle inside
           the scattering chamber to provide normalization for
           the measured cross sections.
METHOD     (BCINT) The deuteron beam was stopped in a Faraday
           cup at the back of the chamber.
EN-SEC     (E,P)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) statistical error
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the absolute differential
           cross sections were included:
             * the neutron detector efficiency,
             * the integrated beam current
             * and the target and geometry parameters.

FLAG       Two measurements were made at two mirrow angles 32.
           and -32. of the scattering chamber. The angle is
           between scattering chamber, which can be rotated and
           the incident deuteron beam direction. This measurement
           showed that there was no asymmetry in the rotation of
           the chamber.
