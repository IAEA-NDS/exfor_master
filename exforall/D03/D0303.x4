INSTITUTE  (3BZLUSP)
REFERENCE  (J,JRN,250,429,2001)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLUSP) CV-28 cyclotron of IPEN-CNEN/SP
METHOD     (EXTB,GSPEC)
           (ACTIV) The irradiation times varied from 10 min to 1 h
            and the average beam currents were between
            0.77 and 1.5 uA.
MONITOR    (29-CU-63(P,2N)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
           (29-CU-65(P,N)30-ZN-65,,SIG)
           A natCu (63Cu - 69.17% and 65Cu - 30.83%)8 foil with
           a thickness of 50 mu-m was used in one irradiation, in
           order to monitor the beam current and energy.
