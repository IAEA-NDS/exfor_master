           Scattered from Copper

           cyclotron, using 9.6-MeV protons.
METHOD     (EXTB) The polarization measurements were made by mean
           double-scattering technique in which a copper foil was
           used for the first target and helium gas was used for
           the second target.
           The polarimeter contained helium gas at a pressure of
           10 atm, with windows of 0.002-in.-thick Mylar foil.
SAMPLE     Natural copper target of spectroscopic purity with a
           thickness equivalent to 390 keV for the incident
           proton beam.
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,CSICR) The double-scattered protons were
           detected with counter telescopes, each consisting of a
           proportional counter and a scintillation counter.
           A multi wire proportional counter was used as a
           flow-counter with an argon (90%)-methane (10%) mixture
           which produced an energy loss of 200 keY for protons
           passing through it. The active volume of the counter
           was made small in order to reduce background. The
           scintillation crystal was a l-in.-diam Cs(Tl) crystal
           with a thickness slightly greater than the range of
           the doubly scattered protons.
