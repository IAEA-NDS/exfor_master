METHOD     (BCINT) The intensity of the beam was measured by a
           Faraday cup, 25 cm long, kept under vacuum and
           separated from the gas chamber by a thin nickel foil.
SAMPLE     A gas target was used to make absolute measurements of
           the cross-section at various angles and energies of the
           incident particles. The pressure of the gas in the
           scattering chamber was regulated by a differential
           pumping system.
           The 160 gas used as a target was  approx. 99% pure.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)Four solid-state movable detectors were placed
           inside the scattering chamber at intervals of 10 degr.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-DIG) Digitizing error
           (ERR-T) Total error on the absolute values of the
           cross-sections. In the cross-section evaluation,
           corrections were made to take into account the 14N
           contamination. These corrections, in the case of the
           elastic scattering were always less than 1 %.
              * The Faraday-cup efficiency was estimated to be
                 better than 99.0 %.
              * The accuracy of the charge integrator introduces a
                0.8 % uncertainty in the charge absolute value.
              * The error in the geometrical factor was estimated
                to introduce a 3.5 % error in the absolute value
                of the cross-section.
              * The errors in the temperature, pressure and charge
                were taken into account.
              * very small uncertainty in the measurement
                of the angle of the detectors.
           The statistical error is negligible for the elastic
           scattering, while for (d, p) and (d, ao) reactions it
           is of the order of a few per cent
           (EN-ERR) Energy spread. Since the target length, as
           seen by the detectors through their collimators, was
           always smaller than 3 cm, an energy spread smaller
           than 15 keV at Ed. = 1.5 MeV
