            Technical details
METHOD     The total fusion cross section has been measured at
            energies close and above the Coulomb barrier.
           Different processes following the breakup should be
            considered:
           - Elastic breakup (EBU),
            when neither of the breakup fragments is captured
             by the target;
           - Incomplete fusion reaction (ICF),
            when one of the fragments is captured by the target;
           - Complete fusion following breakup (CFBU),
             when all breakup fragments are captured by the
             target.
           The sum of complete fusion (including two body fusion
            and complete fusion following breakup) and incomplete
            fusion is called total fusion.

SAMPLE     A metallic 64Zn target, with thickness of 50 mu-g/cm2,
           was deposited on a 10 mu-g/cm2 carbon backing.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error. The normalization of the fusion
           cross sections was obtained by counting elastic
           scattering events in the spectra, when the experimental
           conditions were such that the scattering was purely
           Rutherford. Otherwise, it was obtained using the
           integrated beam current in the Faraday cup and the
           nominal target thickness. In the first case, the
           associated uncertainty was around 2%, whereas in the
           latter it was the sum of three contributions:
           around 2% from the integrated beam current, 10% from
           the target thickness, and 1% from the solid angle
           detection system determination.
