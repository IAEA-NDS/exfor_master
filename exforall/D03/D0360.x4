TITLE      Measurement and analysis of isomeric cross section

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC) IUCF-USA cyclotron facility and at the
           Variable Energy-Centre
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC) activation technique followed by
            offline gamma-ray spectrometry.
           Two consecutive alpha-beam irradiations were carried
           out for the energy range 120 to 50 MeV on two separate
           stacks of foils, each of about 2h duration.
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure (99.99%) niobium (Nb) targets
            (21 mg/cm2) and
           aluminum catchers (7 mg/cm2)/degraders (7 mg/cm2).
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(A,X)11-NA-24,,SIG) For the flux measurement,
           the 27A1(a, a2pn)24Na reaction was used as a
           secondary standard

DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector coupled to a 4K channel analyzer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error in each cross section was
           obtained by combining the following individual errors
           in quadrature:
             * The error in the alpha-beam flux was around 4-7%.
             * The efficiency of the gamma detector was known with
               in an uncertainty of 3-5%.
             * The error in the initial count rate at the end of
               the irradiation as determined by the least
               squares fitting procedure was about 0.5-2.5%.
             * The error in the decay data used was <1%
             * the error in the target thickness was 0.5-1.5%.
