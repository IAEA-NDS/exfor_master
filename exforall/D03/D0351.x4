DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-rays were measured with a HPGe
           detector, with an energy resolution of 2keV for the
           1332 keV gamma-ray from a 60Co source and efficiency
           of 21.5%. Th detector was placed at 55 degr. with
           respect to the beam direction, at a distance of 10 cm
           from the target.
METHOD     (GSPEC) For each bombarding energy of the studied
           systems, measurements were made in-beam and off-beam.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Taking into account the experimental
           uncertainties involved in this experiment; e.g.
           statistical errors, systematic errors due to target
           thickness, absolute efficiency, yield calculation for
           Coulomb excitation and contaminant corrections,
           the total uncertainty in absolute cross section have
           been estimated to be between 8% and 20%.

SAMPLE     The targets consisted of thin layer metallic
           Ti (isotopically enriched to 81.2% ) evaporated on
           0.1mm thick Ta backing. The effective target thickness,
           measured by the Rutherford backscattering method,
           was 97 mu-g/cm2, with an uncertainty of about 5%.
