           Characteristics of the deuterium liner accelerared to
            (2.8-7.2)E+7 cm/sec were first experimentally
           investigated with the inverse Z  pinch scheme.
SAMPLE     The target was a cylindrical copper shell with a radius
           185 mm and with a length of 40 mm. The inner surface of
           the target was coated with a CD2 layer 0.25 mm thick.
PART-DET   (N) Fast and moderated neutrons. Light from the
           discharge.
DETECTOR   (MTANK,BF3) To measure the total flux of neutrons.
           (SCIN) To measure fast neutrons.  Some light detectors.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSRUS) The pulsed high-current accelerator at
           the Institute of High-Current Electronics.
METHOD     (TOF) All details see in REFERENCE
