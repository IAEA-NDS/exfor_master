HISTORY    (20041123C)
           (20041224A) Correction has been done.

SAMPLE     The deuterium gas target, pressurized to about 8 bar
           and cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature to increase
           its density consisted of an upright copper cylinder
           16-mm in diameter.  The entrance and exit windows were
           covered by 12.7-mm thick HAVAR foil.  The target was
           mounted directly beneath the liquid nitrogen reservoir
           which was contained in the lid of the chamber.

           nucleon potential models.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Scattered protons in beam polarimeter
           were detected in two del'ta E-E scintillator telescopes
           at 62.5-degree to the left and right of the beam.
           (SIBAR) Four with a active area of 20*50-mm**2 each
           were used to detect protons in secondary polarimeter.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWTPSI).The Philips injector cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Atomic beam source.
METHOD     (DSCAT) A helium was used for beam and secondary
           polarimeters at high proton energies, resulting from
           primary laboratory scattering angles up to 80-degree.
           At larger scattering angles carbon polarimeter was
           used.
           (BCINT) Beam current measured in the Faraday cup was
           integrated and used to trigger a periodical reversal of
           the beam polarization to reduce systematic errors.
           (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors combine the statistical
           uncertainties of the raw signal and the background
           subtraction.
           The most significant systematic uncertainties are the
           following:
           (ERR-1) Accuracy of the primary scattering angle.
           (ERR-2) The analyzing powers of the secondary
           polarimeter were determined to an accuracy of 0.01.
           1.  The error in the selection of the peak and
           background regions the authors estimated to be ~20%
           statistical error.
           3.  A 2.5% relative normalization uncertainty common to
           all data is the uncertainty of the determination of the
           beam polarization
           other systematic uncertainties that were investigated
           and found to be negligible include:
           4.  The uncertainty of the correction for the angular
           acceptance in primary scattering.
           5.  The errors in the horizontal alignment of the
           quadrupole magnet triplet.
CORRECTION The experimental results are corrected for the finite
           acceptance in the primary scattering and in the case
           of KX'Z for a small X-component of the beam
           polarization.
