INC-SOURCE (POLIS) A typical polarization of ~0.65.
SAMPLE     A  liquid-hydrogen target cell with a thickness of 6 mm
           and a diameter of 20 mm was designed and used for these
           measurements.  For the entrance and exit windows of the
           target, 4 mum-thick Aramid was used.
COMMENT    -By authors.  This was the first time that such a thin
           window of synthetic material has been used in a beam of
           protons.  These windows were used for extended periods
           of 2 to 3 weeks of beam on target without any visible
           damage.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The Small-Angle Large-Acceptance Detector
            (SALAD) was used for the detection of the outgoing
           protons.  It consists of two Multi-Wire Proportional
           chambers (MWPC) for determination of the scattering
           angle of the outgoing protons.  Behind the two
           wire chambers, two layers of segmented plastic
           scintillators are mounted.  The first layer used for
           energy determination of the protons and is therefore
           called the "energy detector".  Protons with an energy
           higher than 135 MeV will punch through the first layer
           and reach the second layer of scintillators called the
           "veto detector".  These protons originate from elastic
           scattering and can be rejected via a hardware trigger.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2NEDGRN) The superconducting cyclotron AGOR.
METHOD     (EXTB) The beam current was typically 6 nA.
HISTORY    (20050303C) By F.Ch
           (20041216R) Data tables were received from
            N.Kalantar-Nayestanaki.
           (20050306U) Last checking has been done.
