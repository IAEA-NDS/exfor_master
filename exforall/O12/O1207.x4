SAMPLE     Argon gas
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Hybrid gas liquid chamber.  The device comprised
           a bubble chamber containing a cloud chamber filled with
           the target gas.
REL-REF    (N,,L.V.BAKALOV+,J,NIM,144,99,1977) Hybrid chamber.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4RUSLIN)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
CORRECTION Correction for probable misses in scanning:  some
           tracks are missed during scanning because they are
           projected onto the image of proton beam in the cloud
           chamber.
HISTORY    (20041102C) By F.Ch
           (20041102U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty. The uncertainty arise mainly
           from:
           (ERR-1) In meausuring the summed path of beam protons
           in the target,
           (ERR-2) In the correction procedure.
