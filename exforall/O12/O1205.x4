SAMPLE     La(2)O(3) powder was suspended in an nitrocellulose
           amylacetate solution and slurried onto thin copper
           foils, which were then folded over and stacked
           together.

COMMENT    -By authors. Due to the variation of the flux across
           the different samples of the stack, the excitation
           functions of the single isomers were not determined.
