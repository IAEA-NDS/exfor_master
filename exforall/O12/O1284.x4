SAMPLE     The dense spherical ceramic particles of about 300 mum
           diameter.
           In the case of UO2 and ThO2, spherical particles of
           about 300 mum diameter were filled into the stainless
           steel target tubes, whereas for NpO2 large spheres were
           first crushed to irregularly sized particles of
           90-300 mum.  The 2.5 X 8 mm target tubes could thus
           contain about 150 mg of NpO2 particles, 240 mg of ThO2
           and 250 mg of UO2 spheres, respectively.  The targets
           were filled with helium and sealed.

METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) An irradiation head with three targets in
           series was used, which allowed the simultaneous
           irradiation of two actinide samples and an 27Al monitor
           rodlet, the targets themselves not affecting the proton
           beam significantly.
COMMENT    -By authors.  High-fluence irradiations make it
           possible to produce enough fission and spallation
           products to use inductively coupled plasma mass
           spectrometry as the analytical technique.  This method
           is the best for the measurement of isobaric production
           cross sections, since the cumulative isobaric mass
           yields in the beta-decay range, mass numbers <204, do
           not depend on time.
CORRECTION For the correction of matrix effects, a known amount of
           a thulium standard was added as an internal standard to
           all sample solutions.  169-Tm was selected as indicator
           isotope since there was no detectable signal on mass
           169 in the concentrated solutions of both actinide
           targets.   Thus, the possibility of interfering effects
           with any fission product in this mass range could be
           excluded.
           Certain volatile and/or insoluble irradiation  products
           could not contribute to the measured mass yields and
           thus rendered the corresponding isobaric production
           cross sections too low.  This was particularly the case
           for several isotopes of the noble gases krypton and
           xenon, as well as for the insoluble oxides of palladium
           and tin.  The corresponding mass yields were upscaled
           by using calculated extrapolation factors, deduced by
           following a procedure similar to that used for  results
           from gamma-spectrometry.  The correction factor values
           were mostly in the range 1 to 3.  For mass numbers 106,
           108, and 110, the insoluble oxides of palladium have
           dominant contributions, and the corresponding
           correction factors were between 3 and 6.
