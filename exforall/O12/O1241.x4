SAMPLE     A 1.05 mg/cm2 (20mum) deuterated polyethylene (CD2)n
           target.   The deterioration of the target was minimized
           by automated linear and rotary motions.
DETECTOR   (TELES,IOCH,SISD)
           The detector telescope consisted of a delta'E gas
           ionization chamber followed by a 50X50 mm2 two
           dimensional position sensitive Si-E detector.
           (MWPC) The detector has been used as monitor of X-Y
           profile of the 7-Be beam.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) The 7Be was produced through the
            p(7Li,7Be)n reaction at E(7Li) = 25 MeV using a pulsed
           7Li beam from the 15UD Pelletron.
           (SPECM,3INDNSD) The forward going 7Be particles were
           selected using the recoil mass spectrometer, HIRA.
METHOD     (EXTB) A radioactive ion beam of 21.0+/-0.5 MeV 7Be.
           (EDE,TOF)

REACTION   (1-H-2(4-BE-7,EL)1-H-2,,DA)
PART-DET   (D,4-BE-7) In an elastic scattering event, the
           recoiling deuteron is detected in the annular detector
           and 7Be in the forward detector telescope
METHOD     (COINC) The 7Be particles reaching the detector
           telescope as a result of scattering from the collimator
           and 12C (in (CD2)n target) and from the beam halo have
           no coincident events in annular detector and were
           eliminated.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is given by authors. An
           analysis is not given.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of 7Be beam energy.
COMMENT    -By authors.  Although the inelastic contribution from
           the 429 KeV state in 7Be could not be resolved, its
           contamination to the elastic scattering yield is
           expected to be small
