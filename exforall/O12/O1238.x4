TITLE      Excitation functions of alpha-induced reactions in
           cobalt and pre-equilibrium effects

SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure cobalt foils with purity better
           than 99.9% were used as target. Target foils of
           thickness 11.25-mg/cm**2 were cut into pieces of 15-mm*
            15-mm and glued with zapon onto identical aluminum
           holders with concentric holes of 10-mm diameter at
           their centers. Samples for irradiated were taken in the
           form of a stack of these targets. Aluminum target
           holders were used for rapid heat dissipation. In order
           to achieve the desired variation in incident energy,
           aluminum foils of thickness 6.75-mg/cm**2 were
           sandwiched between successive target samples of the
           stack as energy degraders.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 100-cm**3
METHOD     (STTA) Eight cobalt foils along with aluminum energy
           degraders.
           (EXTB) A 50 MeV diffused and collimated alpha particle
           beam.
           (BCINT,ACTIV,GSPEC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The maximal value of uncertainty in the
           estimation of number of target nuclei-the nonuniformity
           in the thickness of target foil was negligible because
           the reported accuracy in the thickness was better than
           1%.  The error in the estimation of the number of
           nuclei is expected to be less than 1%.
           (ERR-2) Errors in the fluctuation in beam current was
           found to be less 4%.
           Uncertainty in dead time correction 10%.
           (ERR-3) Errors due to uncertainty in detector
           efficiency.
           (ERR-T) The total error is reported by authors in
           table.

COMMENT    - By authors. Our measured values are in general lower
           by a factor 2-2.5 than the values of Michel+,
           especially at higher projectile energies.
           Mukherjee+ values are lower by a factor of ten than our
           values at low projectile energies, while at a
           projectile energy of 32 MeV and above their values are
           higher by a factor of about two.
           Rao+ measurements are higher by a factor of 1.5 - 2 in
           the higher energy region.

           - By authors. It is noticeable that below 34 MeV, the
           measurements of Mukherjee+ are a little lower than our
           measurements. The cross-sections reported by Rao+ and
            Michel+ are generally in agreement with ours, between
           34 MeV and 44 MeV, while above 44 MeV they are higher
           than ours. Moreover, below 34 MeV the results
           of Michel+ and Rao+ are exceptionally low by an order
           of magnitude.
