SAMPLE     A set of sandwich-type foils was used.  It consists of
           about 1.5 mg/cm2 metallic Bi targets obtained by vacuum
           evaporation onto 7 mum Al foils.  To reduce the helium
           and lithium ion energy 50-100 mum thick Al foil
           absorbers were used.
           For the chosen target layer the efficiency of
           registration of fission fragments was (80+/-7)%.
DETECTOR   (TRD) For the registration of fission fragments 55 mum
           thick  polyterephthalate plastic and muscovite mica
           detectors were used.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-400 and U-400M heavy ion accelerators
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)  The secondary beam of He-6 or He-4 mainly in
            the rection 11B(20 MeV/A) + Ta and 7Li(20 MeV/A) + Ta
            or (CH2)n.
           The purification of He-6 beam was about 95%, its
           intensity was about 200- 300 ions per second.

COMMENT    -By authors.  Surprisingly, for the reaction
           Li-7+Bi-209 induced fission cross section was observed
           much smaller than the predicted value.  It can be
           preliminary explained as the result of disintegration
           of Li-7 nuclei in the strong field of target nuclei of
           Bi-209 into He-4 and H-3 light nuclei.
