TITLE      Experimental study and nuclear model calculations on
           the Os-192(p,n)Ir-192 reaction. Comparison of reactor
           and cyclotron production of the therapeutic
           radionuclide Ir-192.

HISTORY    (20050513C)
           (20051002U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Thin osmium samples were prepared by electrolytic
           deposition of the enriched Os-192 on 25-mum Ni-foils
            (99.9% pure) chemical purityof used osmium- 99.9%.
           Isotopic composition:
           84.5% Os-192,
           15.2% Os-190,
           0.3% Os-189,
           the electrolytic deposit of metallic osmium had a  mass
           between  1  and 4 mg, which was determined by weighing.
           The uniformity of the deposit was checked using a
           microscope.   Also the absence of all oxides, which are
           coloured, could be confirmed.  A check via proton
           activation analysis was done, too.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) The integrated yield of Ir-192 was calculated ,
           assuming a 1 hour irradiation with a proton beam of
           1 microA.
           (COMP) The model codes ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE-II.
           A comparison of the reactor and cyclotron production
           methods is given too.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty in measured cross section.
           The uncertainty is result of:
           1. Uncertainty in decay data (1%).
           2. Uncertainty in cross section of monitor reaction
            (8-10%).
           3. Uncertainty in peak area measurement (2-5%).
           4. Uncertainty in efficiency of the detector (4-6%).
           5. Uncertainty in target uniformity (3-5%).
           6. Uncertainty in number of target nuclei (2-5%).

COMMENT    -By authors:
           1.  The activity obtained was the sum of the ground
           state and the first isomeric state.  Production cross
           section of second isomer state (241 yr) was not
           measured.
           2.  The measured data were extrapolated to 100%
           enrichment of Os-192.
           3.The uncertainty in the primary proton energy amounted
           to 0.2-MeV.  The uncertainty in the energy effective at
           each foil increased with the increasing number of foils
           and is 0.2-0.8 MeV.
