TITLE      Excitation functions for (alpha,xn) reactions on Ag-107
           and Ag-109.

REFERENCE  (J,JRN,89,531,1985)
REL-REF    (M,A0139001,C.Wasilevsky+,J,RRL,50,211,1982) details of
           experiments.
SAMPLE     Stacks of silver foils were used.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,3ARGCNE) The 60-inch synchrocyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) As for any reactions that might occur due to
           secondary neutrons, additional foils were set up beyond
           the range of alpha particles.  Spectra from those foils
           showed no significant contribution to data.

CORRECTION The areas of all gamma peaks observed were corrected
           for efficiency of detection and the activities of the
           radioactive products were calculated separately for
           each peak on the basis of the nuclear data.
           No correction were made either for the energy spread at
           each foil, as resulting from foil thickness variations,
           or for energy losses at the preceding foils.  The
           eventual losses of reaction products by recoil were
           assumed to be negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) An estimation of the average error of the
           excitation functions is given in table.  This average
           error includes:
           (ERR-S) Statistical error
             * the uncertainties due to the target foil thickness,
             * the beam current,
             * the detector efficiency and
             * the analysis of the gamma spectra.
           The uncertainty due to the analysis of the gamma
           spectra differ from case to case.  Much greater
           uncertainties were taken into account in those cases
           where complex peak evaluation and subtraction of
           activities could not be avoided during the calculation
           of the cross sections.
           In many of these cases only a rough lower limit
           estimation of the error could be given.

           (20050110A) Correction of all subentries.
           (20080131A) Correction has been done in Subent 006 and
           007, according to E.Dupont remarks-in data-section
            alpha part. Energy must be 20.4 MeV instead 20.9 MeV.
