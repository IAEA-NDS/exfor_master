TITLE      Excitation functions for (alpha,xn) reactions on Ag-107
           and Ag-109.

REFERENCE  (J,JRN,89,531,1985)
           (J,RRL,50,211,1982) it is A0139 and details of
            experiments.
HISTORY    (20041222C)
           (20050110A) Correction of all subentries.
           (20080131A).Correction has been done in subent 006 AND
           subent 007, according E.Dupont remarks-in data-section
            alpha part. energy must be 20.4 MeV instead 20.9 MeV.
SAMPLE     Stacks of silver foils were used.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,3ARGCNE) The 60-inch synchrocyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) As for any reactions that might occur due to
           secondary neutrons, additional foils were set up beyond
           the range of alpha particles.  Spectra from those foils
           showed no significant contribution to data.

CORRECTION The areas of all gamma peaks observed were corrected
           for efficiency of detection and the activities of the
           radioactive products were calculated separately for
           each peak on the basis of the nuclear data.
           No correction were made either for the energy spread at
           each foil, as resulting from foil thickness variations,
           or for energy losses at the preceding foils.  The
           eventual losses of reaction products by recoil were
           assumed to be negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) An estimation of the average error of the
           excitation functions is given in table.  This average
           error includes the uncertainties due to the target foil
           thickness, the beam current, the detector efficiency
           and the analysis of the gamma spectra. The uncertainty
           due to the analysis of the gamma spectra differ from
           case to case.  Much greater uncertainties were taken
           into account in those cases where complex peak
           evaluation and subtraction of activities could not be
           avoided during the calculation of the cross sections.
           In many of these cases only a rough lower limit
           estimation of the error could be given.
