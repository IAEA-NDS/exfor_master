SAMPLE     Targets of natural mercury oxide pellets with thickness
           of 815 and 509-mg/cm**2 were irradiated with incident
           proton beam energy, using a steel target holder with
           back water cooling.

SAMPLE     Drops of natural mettalic mercury with thickness
           of 445 mg/cm**2 were used.
           For the thin target irradiation HgO-445-mg/cm**2 and
           Hg-445-mg/cm**2, a target holder made of aluminum was
           fabricated and it was water-cooled in the front and in
           the back of the target.
           The incident beam energy on the target was reduced to
           19-MeV due to the water layer and the target windows.
COMMENT    -By authors. The target thickness-445 mg/cm**2 and the
           incident proton energy 19-MeV were chosen to minimize
           the production of other radioisotopes of thallium,
           which could lead to impurities in the Tl-201 product.
FLAG       (1.) Mercury oxide target.
