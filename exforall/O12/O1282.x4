ADD-RES    (THEO) The classical Debye model.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Four Si-detectors, active area=600 mm**2,
           effective thickness=100-mum were used. Detectors were
           electrically insulated from the target chamber.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2GERBOC) The 100-kV accelerator.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current on target was kept below
            20-muA.
           (SITA)
ANALYSIS   (TTUNF) The observed thick-target yield curve was
           differentiated to arrive at a thin-target yield curve,
           which was fitted using 2 free parameters:
           1. The absolute yield provided information on the
           absolute cross section.
           2. The energy dependence of the data gave the screening
           potential energy.
STATUS     (TABLE).The data were received from Joao Cruz 22.01.08
HISTORY    (20050921C)
           (20080123A) Data section was changed according table
