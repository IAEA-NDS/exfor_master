           (N,O1220001,F.RAIOLA+,J,EPJ/A,19,283,2004) The
           experiment.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The classical Debye model.
HISTORY    (20050921C)
           (20060428U) Last checking has been done.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Four Si-detectors, active area=600 mm**2,
           effective thickness=100-mum were used. Detectors were
           electrically insulated from the target chamber.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2GERBOC) The 100-kv accelerator.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current on target was kept below
            20-mua.
           (SITA)
ANALYSIS   (TTUNF) The observed thick-target yield curve was
           differentiated to arrive at a thin-target yield curve,
           which was fitted usind 2 free parameters:
           1. The absolute yield provided information on the
           absolute cross section.
           2. The energy dependence of the data gave the screening
           potential energy.
