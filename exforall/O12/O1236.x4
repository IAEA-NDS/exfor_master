SAMPLE     For the preparation of the targets containing mug-
           amounts of Ra-226, aliquots of 10-mul of stock solution
           were slowly evaporated on thin silver foils and covered
           with a second silver foil. The silver foil sandwiches
           were pressed and encapsulated in silver capsules, which
           were subsequently transferred to a glove box and welded
           gas-tight. For irradiation experiments using larger
           amounts of radium, an aliquot of radium stock solution
           typically containing 30-mg of radium-226, was mixed
           with a stock solution containing 300-mg of Ba-Cl(3) in
           dilute HCL. Barium was used as matrix due to the
           similar chemical properties of Ba- and Ra. The mixture
           was evaporated, the residual solid phase was ground in
           amortar and pressed into a pellet of 16-mm in diameter
           and 0.8-1.0-mm in height. Subsequently, the pellets
           were enclosed in silver capsules which were welded gas-
           tight.

COMMENT    -By authors. The radium elute was analysed for isotopic
           composition using alpha- and gamma-spectrometry and
           conditioned to be used again for target preparation.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERKFK) A 28-MeV proton beam.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           (SITA,EXTB)
           (ACTIV) Series of identical Ra-targets containing
           constant amounts of Ra-226 (12.5-mug) were irradiated
           for 7-hr with a proton current of 10-muA.
           (EDEG)  Silver foils of varying thickness were used for
           energy attenuation.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The formation of Ac-226 and Ac-224 was
           found to be negligible with respect to the isotopic
           purity of the actinium product.
