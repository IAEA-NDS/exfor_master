           (C,2004SANTA,,957,2004) Preliminary data.
REL-REF    (I,D4097001,A.Hermanne+,J,NIM/B,187,3,2002) Details of
           experiment.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB) The CGR-560 cyclotron.
SAMPLE     The target foils consisted of rather thick,(1. to
           4-mg/cm2, 1-4-um) metallic bismuth evaporated onto
           pure Cu (10.83-um) or Al (23.92-um) backings.
           The surface thickness of every target was determined
           by weighing the individual foils before and after
           applying the bismuth layer.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Physical thick target yields, calculated from
           excitation curves for the Bi-209(alpha,2n),
           Bi-209(alpha,3n), Bi-209(alpha,x)Po-210 are presented.
           (COMP) The theoretical model code ALICE-IPPE.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) For alpha particles detection.
           (HPGE) The activity of At-210 was measured by direct
           gamma-spectrometry shortly after EOB by a high-purity
           Ge-detector.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(A,X)30-ZN-65,,SIG)
           (29-CU-0(A,X)31-GA-67,,SIG)
METHOD     (STTA) Two stacks were irradiated with alpha-particle
           beams of incident energy on the first foils of 37.4-MeV
           and 39.1-meV, respectively.
           (ACTIV,BCINT)  The beam current was kept constant about
           200 nanoA during irradiations 0.5-hr.
ERR-ANALYS The following individual uncertainties are included in
           the propagated error-
           (ERR-1) The number of target nuclei including
           differences in thickness from target to target and
           non-uniformity. (8%)
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of incident particle
           intensity.(5%)
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency for gamma-analysis,
           (ERR-4) Detector efficiency for alpha-data,
           (ERR-5,1.,5.) determination of the peak areas including
           error-1-5%,
           (ERR-6,1.,5.) absolute abundance of the used gamma-rays
           decay data 1-5%.
           (ERR-T) The total resulting uncertainty.  (10-15%)
           the strongly non-linear effect of possible uncertainty
           of the half-lives was not taken into account.
           (EN-ERR) Due to broadening of the beam energy by
           degradation and to the uncertainty on the determination
           of the foil thickness a systematic shift of the mean
           energy.

RAD-DET    (85-AT-211,A)
           (84-PO-211-G,A) It is very short-lived daughter At-211.
DECAY-DATA (85-AT-211,7.21HR,A,5880.,0.418)
           (84-PO-211-G,0.516SEC,A,7450.,0.9889) 58.3% decay of
            At-211.
           (83-BI-207,32.2YR,DG,569.1,0.978,DG,1063.,0.749)
METHOD    1 At-211 was identified through its strong
           alpha-lines at 5.88-MeV (41.8% decay to Bi-207) and was
           measured twice in the first 24-hr after EOB.
          2 The activity of At-211 be measured through its
           very short-lived daughter Po-211-g.  At the moment of
           measurement all directly formed Po-211 has totally
           disappeared and the only activity present is from decay
           of the mother At-211.
          3 At-211 was identified through measurement of the
           gamma-spectrum of the very long-lived alpha- decay
           product Bi-207.
