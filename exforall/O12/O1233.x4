HISTORY    (20041221C)
           (20050112A) Correction.
           (20050113U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     High purity Ti-foils (99.6% purity, 20-mm diameter,
           ~0.5-mm thick) were used.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAHRV)
           36-Cl concentrations were determined using the ANTARES
            AMS facility at ANSTO.
METHOD     (STTA,CHSEP)
           (BCINT) Transmission ionisation chamber for measurement
           the incident proton current.  The chamber was
           recalibrated at each energy point.
           (AMS) Cl-36 identification was achieved with a Bragg
           detector  using P10 gas and Cl-35,37 isotope tails were
           suppressed using a Wien velocity filter.
           Each sample was measured 3-5 times, corrected for
           fractionation and dead-time and then normalised to
           Cl-36/Cl standard.  Where applicable, ratios were  also
           carefully corrected for effects of varying and
           excessive S-36 rates which cause integrated Cl-36 rates
           to be enhanced above their true value.  Error
           propagation included a 5% reproducibility  uncertainty,
           a 1-6% statistical uncertainty and a 0-10% uncertainty
           in calculating the correction factor due to S-36
           interference.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Final uncertainties are a quadrature of:
           1.  The Cl-36/Cl uncertainty, which ranged from ~5% for
           foils at 58-147 MeV to ~14% at 33-48 MeV.

           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in Cl-carrier mass,
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in Ti-foil thickness.
