TITLE      A new internal target system for production of At-211
           on the cyclotron U-120m.

HISTORY    (20050514C)
           (20051009U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The thin bismuth layer (3-5-mum) of 10*50-mm area was
           evaporated onto a light (7.5-g) aluminium backing.
           The backing was then released from the target holder
           and used directly for actatine separation via dry
           distillation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (IOCH) The At-211 activity was subsequently measured
           on a calibrated ionising chamber.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CZRUJF) The U-120m cyclotron.
METHOD     (INTB) The intensity of the beam varied between 10 and
            30-micro-amperes.
           (ACTIV) The target was irradiated for 1 -2 hours.
           (BCINT)
COMMENT    -By authors. The overall separation yield of At-211 was
           found to be 65-75%. The activity of at-211 left in the
           target was less than 10%. The most serious losses were
           probably due to deposition of astatine on the colder
           part of the quartz tube. Separation was finished within
           2-hours after EOB.

           The intensities of gamma-lines of Po are given per At
           decay.
COMMENT    -By authors. The At-211 activity was calculated via
           an 897.80-KeV gamma line of Po-211 and the At-210
           activity via its 1181.39-KeV gamma line.
           Presented data are average for 10 measuremenrs.
