SAMPLE     The target was a self-supporting foil of (CD2)n polymer
           of thickness 1-mug/cm**2 and diameter 20 mm mounted on
           a thin frame.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2FR GAN)  The SPIRAL facility.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The new TIARA array is designed to exploit
           such transfer reactions with radioactive beams, using
           inverse kinematics with hydrogen polymer targets.
           The TIARA array is a highly efficient particle detector
           for almost all angles.
DETECTOR   (SISD) The TIARA barrel consists of eight silicon
           strip detectors, each with four resistive strips
           mounted along the beam direction. Each detector has a
           wafer size of 96.8*24.6 mm**2 and an active area of
           94.8*22.6 mm**2, with strips 5.65 mm wide. All
           detectors in the annular arrays are 500 mum in
           thickness.
           (MAGSP) The VAMOS magnetic spectrometer operated in
           dispersive mode.
           (SCIN) The direct beam was intercepted using a plastic
           scintillator finger mounted immediately in front of the
           first-order focal plane and was counted, whilst
           protecting the focal plane detectors from the high
           counting rate.
           For gamma-ray detection, four of the segmented-clover
           Ge detectors from EXOGAM, were mounted with their front
           faces forming a cube around the target, 50 mm from the
           beam spot.
           The data acquisition systems for TIARA, VAMOS AND
           EXOGAM operated separately, each with access to a
           common event counter and the data streams were merged
           in real time.
           The gamma-ray energy spectrum were measured in
           coincidence with the protons from (d,p) reaction.
           Doppler correction was made.
METHOD      Inverse kinematics
ADD-RES    (COMP) Shell-model predictions.
           Energy spectum after Doppler correction for gamma rays
           in coincidence with proton from Ne-24(d,p)Ne-25 was
           reported.
