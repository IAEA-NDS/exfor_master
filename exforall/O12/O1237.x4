SAMPLE     Natural vanadium and indium materials, 99.99% pure were
           used for preparing samples. The samples of vanadium
           and indium were deposited on aluminium backing of 6.75-
           mg/cm**2 using evaporation technique. The thicknesses
           of vanadium and indium deposition were 0.32 and 4.2-mg/
           cm**2, respectively.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Analysis with code ALICE-91. Analysis with
            ACT-code and analysis with EXIFON-code.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA) The two stack, one containing 10 vanadium foils
           and the other containing 9-indium foils, were used.
           The Al-degraders of suitable thicknesses were used in
           between the samples in each stack to cover the broad
           energy range.

ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors of gamma counting are
           given in DATA-sections.
           Other errors in the cross-section may  come  up  mainly
           due to the uncertainty in:
           1. The determination of the number of target nuclei in
           the sample,
           2.The current fluctuation of the incident beam,
           3.The uncertainty in the determination of geometry
           dependent detector efficiency,
           4.The beam intensity loss as the beam traverses the
           stack thickness,
           5.  The recoiling of the product nuclei,
           6.  The dead time of the detector, etc.
           The average total error due to all these factors is
           estimated to be less than 10%.
           (EN-ERR) An analysis is not given.

REACTION   (49-IN-113(P,N)50-SN-113,,SIG)
FLAG       (2.) At the energy reaction In-115(p,n)Sn-113 is
           possible too. In-115 contribution has been excluded.
           See COMMENT.
COMMENT    -By authors. In order to separate out the contributions
           due to In-113(p,n) and In-115(p,3n) reactions at 18.31
           and 20 MeV, the ratio of cross-sections
            sigma(p,n)/sigma(p,3n) are calculated theoretically
           using the code ALICE-91, with those parameters which
           gave a satisfactory reproduction of the lower energy
           data for this reaction. The contribution of two
           reactions has been separated taking into account the
           relative abundances of 113-In and 115-In isotopes and
           the theoretical cross-section ratios. In this way the
           cross-sections for (p,3n) reaction at 18.31 and 20 MeV
           are found to be ~5.9 mb and ~43,3 mb respectively.
