TITLE       (alpha,xn) reactions on Tb-159.
AUTHOR     (O.Bonesso, H.O.Mosca, S.J.Nassiff)
INSTITUTE  (3ARGCNE)
REFERENCE  (J,JRN/L,137,29,1989)
SAMPLE     Stacks of terbium foils, (average 25.8-mg/cm2)
           thickness, were used.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).On the basis of the cross section, the thick
           target yields and saturation production rates of
           Ho-161-m+g, Ho-160-m, Ho-159-m+g, Ho-158-m1+g have
           been calculated.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) A high resolution Ge-intrinsic detector.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,3ARGCNE) The 60-inch synchrocyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB)
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(A,2N)31-GA-67,,SIG)
           (29-CU-63(A,N)31-GA-66,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (D0092001,O.Bonesso,J,JRN,152,189,1991) The monitor
           cross sections were measured in 3ARCCNE and taken from
           private comm. with author in 1989. Later were published
           in JRN.
CORRECTION Corrections for the energy spread in each foil due to
           uncertainties in the foil thickness and the energy
           decrease in the preceding foils, were not applied.
           Losses of reactions products by recoil were assumed to
           be negligible.
REL-REF    (R,,C.F.Williamson+,R,CEA-R-3042,1966) The mean alpha-
           particle energy for each foil was determined using
           energy range tables given by Williamson.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Uncertainties in the cross-section values were
           estimated by propagating in quadrature the
           contributions from:
           1.  Decay curve,
           2.  Peak analysis,
           3.  Absolute detector efficiencies,
           4.  Disintegration schemes,
           5.  Target thicknesses
           6.  Alpha-flux.
           (EN-ERR) External beam energy accuracy.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error

COMMENT    -By authors. The excitation functions for the formation
           of Ho-161-m+g were obtained after the decay of the
           metastable state and are thus sum of the cross sections
           of both isomeric states.

COMMENT    -By authors. The cross section for the Ho-158-m1+g
           production may have contributions of Ho-158-m2.
           -By compiler. 1. According to ENSDF-2000 branching of
           isomer transition from first isomer state is >81%,
           branching of isomer transition from second isomer state
           is <7%.
           2. Decay-data for Ho-158 are questionable.
