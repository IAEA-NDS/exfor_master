SAMPLE     A stack containing 14 high purity Pd foils , thickness
           7.99 mum was irradiated at the VUB cyclotron with a
           36.5 MeV alpha-particle beam. Interleaved high purity
           Cu foils (7.61 mum thick, purity >99.6%) served as
           monitor foils to obtain reliable beam characteristics
            (energy and intensity) by comparison of the cross
           sections of the monitor reactions with reference values
           over the whole energy range studied. These foils  also
           allowed checking the energy degradation in the stack.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The following individual uncertainties are
           included in the propagated error-
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the number of target nuclei
           including non-uniformity,
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in the incident particle intensity
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in the detection efficiency,
           (ERR-4,1.,5.) Uncertainty in the determination of
           the peak areas including statistical errors,
           (ERR-5,1.,5.) Uncertainty in the absolute abundance of
           the used gamma rays.
COMMENT    *By authors*. The strongly non-linear effect of the
           possible uncertainty of the half-lives for isotopes
           with small T1/2 was not taken into account.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The radionuclide 104Cd is formed by
           direct production through (a,2n) and (a,4n) reactions
           on the stable isotopes 102Pd (1.02%) and 104Pd
           respectively. In the energy domain studied only the
            (a,2n) reaction seems to contribute as the excitation
           function is still decreasing at the maximum energy in
           the foils although it is situated slightly above the
           threshold of the (a,4n) reaction.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The sharp rise around 30 MeV and the
           levelling at the highest energy studied seems to
           indicate that the 104-Pd(a,3n) reactions plays a
           dominant role.

COMMENT    *By authors*.In this study the only route for
           production of this metastable state is direct (a,xn)
           reaction on 108Pd and 110Pd as the possible beta-
           emitting parents 111Ag or 111Ag-m decay directly or
           after gamma-de-excitation to the ground level of
           Cd-111-g.

COMMENT    *By authors*. The major contribution to the activity
           was from the 104-Cd parent. The uncertainties on a
           tentative separation based on the single time
           measurement of the different signals were so high that
           no reliable result for direct Ag-104-g cross section.

COMMENT    *By authors*.This short-lived radioisotope is only
           produced through the direct reaction 110Pd(a,p+n). The
           practical threshold lies here also about 8 MeV above
           the theoretical limit. The reaction cross section,
           obtained by taking into account the abundance of 110-Pd
           in nat-Pd (11.72%) reaches a maximum in the
           neighbourhood of 37-38 MeV with a maximal value 62.5 mb
