            measured the fission cross section of Np-237 relative
            to that of U-235. The chambers were made of Al and
            filled with a mixed gas of 97% Ar and 3% N(2) at
            pressure of 1-atm.
           (SIBAR) The number of atoms in the sample deposit and
            that in the reference one together with those of
            impurities were determined by the alpha-spectrometry
            with a Si-surface barrier detector in vacuum.

SAMPLE     .Neptunium oxide Np-O2 of about 2 mg weight with high
            purity was electrodeposited on a stainless steel plate
            28-mm in diameter and 0.2-mm thick. The diameter of
            the deposit was 2-cm. Number of Np237 atoms is
            (1.99 +- 0.02)E+17, thickness 25 microgram/cm2.
            Pu-238 admixture was 0.320+-0.003 ppm,
            Pu-239 admixture was 1.10 +-0.13  ppm,
           .Uranium-235 monitor sample, highly enriched uranium
            oxide, purity 99.91%, electrodeposited in the same
            way as Np-237. After the electrodeposition, each plate
            was sintered with gas burner, and the reference
            deposit became U3-O8. Number of U-235 in the sample
            is (4.12 +- 0.09)E+17, Thickness is 50 microgram/cm2
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T). The uncertainty is reported by authors in
            table, in which the statistical error for the fission,
            the error in the determination of the numbers of
            Np-237 and U-235, 2% as systematic error and the
            uncertainty in the fission cross section for U-235
            were taken into account.

REACTION   (93-NP-237(N,F),,SIG)
ANALYSIS   The cross section for the Np-237(N,F) reaction from
           about 1 eV to about 5-KeV normalized to that for the
           U-235(N,F) reaction.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for setting position of Np-237
            and U-235 deposits. The loss of fission fragments in
            the both deposited was found to be negligible.
