COMMENT    *By the compiler* --
           .Dummy neutron energy EN-DUMMY was evaluated as an
            weighted average of two energy distributions- Maxwell
            in the 1.E-5 to 1 eV energy range and Fermi in the
            1 to E-lim energy range. The explicit expression is :
            EN-DUMMY = Eind*Etherm + 0.75*(1.-Eind)*((E-lim) + 1.
                       + SQRT((E-lim)* 1.)), Eind = energy index
           .Energy dependence of gamma efficiency was verified by
            three dysprosium activation experiment:
            twice at KUCA B core, once at KUR-D2O.

            cell:  Np-237 and Au-197 samples placed at exact

            Two other gold foils were set in two diagonally
            neighbored assemblies as monitor foils to check
            conditions of irradiation and gamma counting.
            Two additional experiments were performed:
             1) to eximine effect of void assembly,
             2) by using dummy sample to investigate perturbation
             effect of Np-237 sample to reaction rate of Au.
INC-SPECT  .Neutron spectrum was varied by changing the
            combination or configuration of fuel and moderate
            plates,i.e. moderator-to-fuel ratio.
