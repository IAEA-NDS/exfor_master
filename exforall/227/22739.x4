COMMENT    *By the compiler* --
           .Dummy neutron energy EN-DUMMY was evaluated as an
            weighted average of two energy distributions- Maxwell
            in the 1.E-5 to 1 eV energy range and Fermi in the
            1 to E-lim energy range. The explicit expression is :
            EN-DUMMY = Eind*Etherm + 0.75*(1.-Eind)*((E-lim) + 1.
                       + SQRT((E-lim)* 1.)), Eind = energy index
           .Energy dependence of gamma efficiency was verified by
            three dysprosium activation experiment:
            twice at KUCA B core, once at KUR-D2O.

            Two other gold foils were set in two diagonally
            neighbored assemblies as monitor foils to check
            conditions of irradiation and gamma counting.
            Two additional experiments were performed:
             1) to examine effect of void assembly,
             2) by using dummy sample to investigate perturbation
             effect of Np-237 sample to reaction rate of Au.
INC-SPECT  .Neutron spectrum was varied by changing the
