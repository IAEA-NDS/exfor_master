INC-SOURCE (D-T) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons were produced via
            1-H-3(d,n)2-He-4 reaction at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-MeV
            inciedent deutron energy.

INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons.
            High-purity metallic foils of aluminum,iron,nickel,
            indium,niobium supplied by Goodfellow Metals,Cambrige,
            England, were used for neutron flux density unfolding.
            Cutoff Energy Was Below The Energy Of Primary
            H-3(D,N)He-4 Neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (TOF)  Neutron flux spectra were determined by
                  activation spectral index method in combination
             with TOF spectrum measurements.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detectors for irradiated
            samples radioactivity measurement.
SAMPLE     .Monitors were disk-shaped with 50-300 microm thickness
            and diameter equal to those of investigated sample.
            Samples were placed at angles between 0 Deg and
            135 Deg relative to incident deutron beam and distance
            of about 4 cm between center of target and the front
            of sample stack.
CORRECTION  -Correction factor for volume sample was determinated
            taking into account three effects- volume distribution
            of induced activity, detector efficiency as function
            of distance, gamma-ray self-absorption.
