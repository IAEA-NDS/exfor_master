INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The accelerated proton beam is focused on a
           natural lithium target. The 7Li(p,n)7Be gr.st.
            (Q=-1.644 MeV) and 7Li(p,n)7Be (0.431 MeV) reactions
           produced at 0 degr. lab. angle a quasimonoenergetic
           neutron beam. Using a 3-mm-thick lithium target and
           a 10**(-5)A proton beam, about 10**6 n/s are available
           at the location of reaction chamber (around 3m
           downstream from the lithium target).
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
DETECTOR   (TELES) Four charged-particle detector telescopes are
           used simultaneously. Each of them consists of a deltaE
           detector (NE102 pl.scin., 0.1 mm thick, 4cm in diam.)
           viewed by an XP2020 photomultiplier via lucite light
           guide, and an E detector (CsI(Tl) crystal, 22 mm thick
           38.2mm in diam.), viewed by an XP2262B photomultiplier.
           For energy calibration of the detectors the protons and
           deuterons recoiling from a polypropylene (1 or 0.5 mm
           thick) and a 0.6-mm-thick deuterated polypropylene
           target, respectively, are used.
           (SCIN) The neutron-beam radial distribution measured
           with NE102 scin. ( 5mm in diam.)
SAMPLE     An elemental carbon target (5x5 cm2 surface and 1 mm
           thick. The angle of the target with the beam was chosen
           to minimize the thickness of the target material
           traversed the produced charged particles towards
           telescopes.
MONITOR    The beam monitoring system is realized in two ways.
           Behind the lithium target, the incident proton beam is
           deflected by a magnetic dipole into a water-cooled
           Faraday cup which serves as beam monitor.
           Second: The integral of the recoil proton peak. A
           charged particle telescope detects at 45 degr.
           the H(n,p) scattered protons. It consists of a NE102
            (2-mm-thick) scin. as delta-E and a CsI(Tl) crystal as
           E detector.
METHOD     (TOF)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainty of the cross section absolute
           scale.
           5%- the measured reference (n,p) cross sections
           2%- beam monitoring
           2%- statistics in the H(n,p) recoil proton peak
           1%- solid-angle corrections
           1%- number of target nuclei
           (ERR-2) Relative error
STATUS     (SPSDD,22303001) duplication with 22303
