INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a thick
           7Li target with a proton beam whose energy Ep=1.912 MeV
           is above the reaction threshold of the 7Li(p,n)7Be.
           The thick 7Li target as prepared by evaporating
           metallic Li on a Pt plate in a Cu target assembly
           which has 10 mm diam. The target was cooled by an
           air-jet during the experiment.
SAMPLE     The 14N sample was a thin melamine film (C3H6N6)
           prepared by vacuum evaporation on a 0.01 mm thick
           Al foil. From weight of the sample, its thickness was
           determined to 212+-1.2mu-g/cm2.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG) To measure the neutron
           flux on the melamine sample, it was replaced with a
           6LiF film which was evaporated on an Al foil
            (0.01 mm) and 289+-1.2mu-g/cm2 thick.
           An unevaporated Al foil was used for background
           measurement.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The gridded ionization chamber was filled with
           Ar+2.5%CO2 as a counter gas. The gas pressure was
           7.8x10**4Pa (0.8kgf/cm2).
