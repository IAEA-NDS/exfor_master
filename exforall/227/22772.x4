DETECTOR   (HPGE) For mesurement of transitions from excited to
             ground state. g-ray from the the first excited state
             of 8Li to the ground state were detected by an
             anti-Compton Ge (HPGe) spectrometer. The HPGe spect-
             rometer consisted of the central 436 cc Ge detector
             with a diameter of 79 mm and a thickness of 89 mm,
             surrounded by an annular NaI(TL) detector with an
             inner diameter of 112 mm, an outer diameter of 254 mm
             and a length of 305 mm. The distance between the
             sample and the HPGe detector was 746 mm.
