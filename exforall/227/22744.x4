INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux 2.E+7 n/cm**2/sec under 5 MW
            operation.
           The neutron beam at the irradiation position was
           approximately 14x61 mm2.
           The fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by 198Au
           activity by inserting the 197Au sample approximately
           every 6 h. The fluctuation was determined to be small
           enough not to have affected the measurements.
SAMPLE     (11-NA-23,NAT=1.00) Natural sample.
           Powder sample was wrapped in waxed paper.
           The samples were located on a holder made of graphite,
           and they were set at a 30 deg angle to the detector in
           the target box.

           tmd - time of beta-delayed gamma-ray measuring.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba,
           152Eu, (Firestone and Shirley, 1996; IAEA, 1991),
           and the prompt gamma rays from the 14N(n,c)15N
            (Miyazaki et al.,2008), and Monte Carlo simulation
           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122
           and 5 MeV, and 1.0% above 5 MeV.

INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux 2.E+7 n/cm**2/sec under 5 MW
            operation.
           The neutron beam at the irradiation position was
           approximately 14x61 mm2.
           The fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by 198Au
           activity by inserting the 197Au sample approximately
           every 6 h. The fluctuation was determined to be small
           enough not to have affected the measurements.
SAMPLE     (25-MN-55,NAT=1.00) Natural sample for 55Mn.
           Powder samples were wrapped in waxed paper.
           The samples were located on a holder made of graphite,
           and they were set at a 30 deg angle to the detector in
           the target box.

           tmp - time of prompt gamma measuring,
           ti - irradiation time,
           tmd - time of beta-delayed gamma-ray measuring.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba,
           152Eu, (Firestone and Shirley, 1996; IAEA, 1991),
           and the prompt gamma rays from the 14N(n,c)15N
            (Miyazaki et al.,2008), and Monte Carlo simulation
           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122
           and 5 MeV, and 1.0% above 5 MeV.

INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux 2.E+7 n/cm**2/sec under 5 MW
            operation.
           The neutron beam at the irradiation position was
           approximately 14x61 mm2.
           The fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by 198Au
           activity by inserting the 197Au sample approximately
           every 6 h. The fluctuation was determined to be small
           enough not to have affected the measurements.
SAMPLE     (74-W-186,ENR=0.975) Separated isotope sample for 186W.
           Powder samples were wrapped in waxed paper.
           The samples were located on a holder made of graphite,
           and they were set at a 30 deg angle to the detector in
           the target box.
            186W abundance 97.5%, chemical form WO3 powder,
           thickness 1.1 mm, weight 68.8 mg,
           tmp(=ti) 8.4 hr, tmd 1.3 hr,
           tmp - time of prompt gamma measuring,
           ti - irradiation time,
           tmd - time of beta-delayed gamma-ray measuring.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba,
           152Eu, (Firestone and Shirley, 1996; IAEA, 1991),
           and the prompt gamma rays from the 14N(n,c)15N
            (Miyazaki et al.,2008), and Monte Carlo simulation
           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122
           and 5 MeV, and 1.0% above 5 MeV.

CORRECTION For pile-up loses caused by accidental coincidence-
            0.38-3.6 %.
           The correction for coincidence summing effects was
           approximately 5% of the all corrections.
           For self-absorption of target material, absorption by
           material of target box, and escape ratios.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainties were evaluated from the
           experimental uncertainties inherent in the counting
           statistics, the detection efficiency including total
           efficiency for correction of summing effect, the escape
           ratio, peak evaluation and adopted nuclear data
           themselves.
