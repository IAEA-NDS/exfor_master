TITLE      A systematic study of (n,7Be) reactions on medium and
           heavy mass nuclei induced by 53 MeV d(Be)-Breakup
           neutrons

INC-SOURCE (D-BE) The 53 MeV deuteron beam impinging on a 1 cm
           thick water-cooled Be disc produced breakup neutrons
           which were very strongly forward peaked.
           The elements to be irradiated were packed between Al
           monitor foils. The thickness of each packing
           containing several elements was kept between 0.8 and
           1.5 cm.
INC-SPECT  Mean neutron flux density of about 3.x10**10 n/cm2/sec
           The neutron spectrum in the 0.degr. direction was
           characterized by TOF technique over the neutron energy
           range of 11.5 to 43.5 MeV by Schweimer and 4 to 50 MeV
           by Meulders et al. (see REL-REF). The averaged result
           extrapolated up to 53 MeV  was used as a standard in
           the present work. The integrated neutron flux was
           adopted as 6.377 x 10**11 n/mu-C/sr.
            Originally adopted spectrum is in EXFOR Subent
            o1924.002 - neutron energy range 12.5 -43.5 MeV.
            Then neutron spectrum shape was reconstructed using
            extensive measurement data ( 4- 50 MeV energy range)
            of Meulders+.
