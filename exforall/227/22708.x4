TITLE      A systematic study of (n,7Be) reactions on medium and
           heavy mass nuclei induced by 53 MeV d(Be)-Breakup
           neutrons

INC-SOURCE (D-BE) The 53 MeV deuteron beam impinging on a 1 cm
           thick water-cooled Be disc produced breakup neutrons
           which were very strongly forward peaked.
           The elements to be irradiated were packed between Al
           monitor foils. The thickness of each packing
           containing several elements was kept between 0.8 and
           1.5 cm.
INC-SPECT  Mean neutron flux density of about 3.x10**10 n/cm2/sec
           The neutron spectrum in the 0.degr. direction was
           characterized by TOF technique over the neutron energy
           range of 11.5 to 43.5 MeV by Schweimer and 4 to 50 MeV
           by Meulders et al. (see REL-REF). The averaged result
           extrapolated up to 53 MeV  was used as a standard in
           the present work. The integrated neutron flux was
           adopted as 6.377 x 10**11 n/mu-C/sr.

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) The neutron flux density
           effective at the irradiated sample was determined via
           27Al(n,a) monitor reaction, the excitation function of
           which is known well up to 28 MeV.

FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERJUL) The Julich Isochron.Cyclotron
DETECTOR   (GELI) 32 cm3 Ge(Li) detector coupled to a Nuclear Data
           ND66 multichannel system was used.
METHOD     (CHSEP,STTA) The details of separations from various
           irradiated targets are given.
SAMPLE      Samples were packed between Al monitor foils. In
           general two and in exceptional cases a maximum of
           five elements were packed together.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The total error in the neutron flux density
           includes:
           3% - deviations in deuteron beam currents in long
           radiations;
           10% - uncertainty in the spectrum-averaged
           cross-section of the 27Al(n,alpha) monitor reaction;
           5% - uncertainty in the intensity distribution of the
           forward peaked neutrons;
           4% - uncertainty in the absolute activity of 14Na;
           (ERR-2) Error related to the efficiency of the detector
           (ERR-3) The error due to the chemical yield of 7Be
           separation;
           (ERR-T) Total errors in the (n,7Be) cross sections.
