TITLE      .Excitation functions of natTi(n,x)46,47,48Sc processes
            in the energy range of 12.5 - 19.6 MeV

SAMPLE     About 5 g Ti metal powder (&gt;99.9%) was pressed a
           10t/cm2 and disk (2cm in diam., 0.5 cm - thick) was
           obtained. Fifteen such samples, each sandwiched
           between pairs of aluminium sheets (2 cm diam. x0.1cm),
           were suspended from a graduated ring.
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 3 Mg/Cm2 T-Ti Target was Used. The Target
            Was Backed by a 4 Cm Diameter Silver Sheet of 0.3 mm
            Thickness, Fixed in an Aluminium Tube of 1 mm Wall
            Thickness. The Silver Sheet was Cooled by a Thin
            Water Film.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Samples were Activated in Different
            Angular Positions with Respect to the Beam Direction.
            In this Way the Neutron Energy Variation with Angle
            From the Source Reaction Could be Used For the Exci-
            Tation Function Measurement.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) A Proton Recoil Telescope,
            Positioned at an Angle of 16 Degrees Relative to the
            Deuteron Beam Direction and at a Source to Radiator
            Distance of 80 Cm, was Used For the Absolute Fluence
            Determination. The Fluence at Other Angles was Deter-
            Mined by Using the Known Angular Distribution of the
            Source Reaction. The Fluence Rates Averaged Over the
            Sample Volumes were in the Range 0.6 to 1.8E+6
            Neutrons/Cm2/Sec.
            In Addition, the Activities from the 13-Al-27/N,a/-
            Reaction in the Aluminium Foils were Detected with
            Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy Using the Same Equipment As
            For the Activity Measurements For the Molybdenum
            Sheets.
CORRECTION .The Neutron Fluence Measurements with the Recoil Te-
             Lescope were Corrected For Distortions by the Target
             Assembly. The Activation of the Samples were Correc-
             Ted For the Neutron Source Intensity Variations with
             Time, Neutron Attenuation and Multiple Scattering.
             The Count Rate in the Activity Measurements were Cor-
             Rected For the Small Differences Between Counting and
             Calibration Geometry, For Coincidence and Pile-Up
             Losses and For Gamma Self-Absorption Within the
             Samples.
           .Corrections were made for:
            - Deviation from Calibration Geometry - 0.8%;
            - Gamma-Ray absorption within the Sample - 2.4 -11.7%;
            - Coincident Events - 4.5%;
            - Activity Uncertainty - 4.0 - 5.1%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty. The Main uncertainty
            contributions in the neutron fluence measurements and
            in the activity measurements.
           (EN-ERR) Scale error
