SAMPLE     About 5 g Ti metal powder (>99.9%) was pressed at
           10t/cm2 and disk (2cm in diam., 0.5 cm - thick) was
           obtained. Fifteen such samples, each sandwiched
           between pairs of aluminum  sheets (2 cm diam. x0.1cm),
           were suspended from a graduated ring.
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 3 Mg/Cm2 T-Ti Target was used. The target
            was backed by a 4 cm diameter silver sheet of 0.3 mm
            thickness, fixed in an aluminum  tube of 1 mm wall
            thickness. The silver sheet was cooled by a thin
            water film.
INC-SPECT    Neutron flux density is given as MISC in Subent 002.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were activated in different
            angular positions with respect to the beam direction.
            In this way the neutron energy variation with angle
            from the source reaction could be used for the exci-
            tation function measurement.

DETECTOR   (GELI) 35 cm**3 Ge(Li) detector to measure sample
            activity induced.
MONITOR   1(1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) A proton recoil telescope,
            positioned at an angle of 16 degrees relative to the
            deuteron beam direction and at a source to radiator
            distance of 80 cm, was used for the absolute fluence
            determination. The fluence at other angles was deter-
            mined by using the known angular distribution of the
            source reaction. The fluence rates averaged over the
            sample volumes were in the range 0.6 to 1.8E+6
            neutrons/cm**2/sec.

            In addition, the activities from the 13-Al-27(N,A)-
            reaction in the aluminum  foils were detected with
            gamma-ray spectroscopy using the same equipment as
            for the activity measurements for the molybdenum
            sheets.

CORRECTION .The neutron fluence measurements with the recoil te-
             lescope were corrected for distortions by the target
             assembly. The activation of the samples were correc-
             ted for the neutron source intensity variations with
             time, neutron attenuation and multiple scattering.
             The count rate in the activity measurements were cor-
             rected for the small differences between counting and
             calibration geometry, for coincidence and pile-up
             losses and for gamma self-absorption within the
             samples.
           .Corrections were made for:
            - Deviation from calibration geometry - 0.8%;
            - Gamma-ray absorption within the sample - 2.4 -11.7%;
            - Coincident events - 4.5%;
            - Activity uncertainty - 4.0 - 5.1%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty about 6%. Main uncertainty
            contributions in the neutron fluence measurements and
            in the activity measurements.
           (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-1) Total fluence uncertainty -3%.
             Total uncertainty in determination of absolute
             activity -  4. - 5. % .

REACTION   (22-TI-0(N,X)21-SC-47,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   Cross-section normalized to 47-Ti + 48-Ti (summed
           abundance 81.2%).Contribution of Ti-47(N,P) and
           Ti-48(N,NP) were considered. Contribution of (N,NP) was
           not negligible since Ti-48 abundance is about 10 times
           higher than that of Ti-47.
