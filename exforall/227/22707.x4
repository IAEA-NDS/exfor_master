SAMPLE     About 3 g of purified water used as the oxygen target
           in a acrylic container of 2 cm in diam. X 1 cm was
           irradiated with aluminum beam monitors by p-Be
           neutrons at Ep=20-40 MeV in 2.5-MeV steps and by p-Li
           ones in 5-MeV steps.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Liquid scintillation counter, PACKARD 2000CA/LL
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOK) The SF Cyclotron of the Institute for
           Nuclear Study was used for the neutron irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CHSEP) Extraction of tritium by distillation
CORRECTION Corrected for low energy neutrons
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors refer to those from the neutron
           flux determination, tritium-counting statistics and
           efficiency, and distance between the Li and the water
           target in the neutron irradiation.

INC-SOURCE (P-BE) Proton beams of energies at every 2.5 MeV
           between 20 and 40 MeV were impinged to 1-mm-thick
            (Ep=20 to 37.5MeV) and 2-mm-thick (Ep=40 MeV)Be
           targets, which backed by a water coolant. The neutrons
           produced in the forward direction by this target system
           were measured with a 51-mm-dia.x51-mm-long NE213
           scintillator placed at about 1.1m from the target.

REACTION   (8-O-16(N,X)1-H-3,,SIG,,AV)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The target system of the p-Li neutron field
           comprised of a 2 mm thick Li (7Li 99.98% enriched)
           target backing by a 12 mm thick carbon (graphite)
           used as a beam stopper for primary protons. The lithium
           target was fixed in an aluminum target holder, which
           enabled the target to slide up and down manually. This
           made it possible to irradiate samples using two types
           of target systems: one was a lithium-plus-carbon target
           the other was only carbon target.
           The neutron spectra at 0 degr. were measured with TOF
           method using a 127-mm-diam. x 127mm-long NE213
           scintillator about 10 m away from the target.
