SAMPLE     .Approximatelly 2 g of high-purity Sc2-O3 powder,
            more than 99.9% purity, was pressed into a pellet of
            13 mm diameter and 7-mm thickness. Thin Al-flux
            monitor foils of same diameter as the sample were
            attached in front of each sample.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons produced via the H-3(d,N)He-4
            reaction.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 82 cc. Hpge-detector.
            The full energy peak efficiency of this detector is
           known to be better than 2% overall inaccuracy from 60
           to 1800-KeV gamma rays.
           (SCIN) The neutron source strength is monitored by
           means of an Ne-213 liquid scintillation counter with
           pulse shape discrimination against gamma rays.
INC-SPECT  .The samples were placed at different neutron emission
            angles O, 30, 60, 90, 120, 130-degrees and irradiated
            for approximately 1-hr at irradiation position,
            depending on the target conditions, covering the
            neutron energies from 13.6 to 14.9-MeV. The neutron
            energy was  determined by the technique based on the
            activation ratio of Zr-90(N,2N)Zr-89 and
            Nb-93(N,2N)Nb-92-m reaction products.
ADD-RES    (THEO) Staistical model calculation
ERR-ANALYS The major uncertainties and their estimated values in
           cross section measurements are similar to those given
           in rel-ref.
           (ERR-T).The total error in cross section values was
           obtained by combining the individual errors in
           quadrature. See table 1.
           (ERR-1)  The peak area determination was achieved with
            2% uncertainty for both gamma lines, 271 and 1157-KeV,
            due to good counting statistics.
           (ERR-2)  The uncertainties in the determination of the
            effective neutron flux and the photopeak efficiency of
            the gamma detector, including self-absorption and
            counting geometry, were 3%.
           (ERR-3)  The error in the decay data used was less than
            1%.

ANALYSIS   .             Isomeric cross section ratios were
            determined by applying the method of least squares to
            the time behavior of the ground-state decay of
            isomeric pair. The absolute cross section for the
            formation of the metastable state was measured by the
            usual activation technique. The ground-state cross
            section was obtained by using the absolute cross
            section of the metastable state and isomeric cross
            section ratio for each neutron energy.
