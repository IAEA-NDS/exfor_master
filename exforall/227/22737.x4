            detector, 2.3 keV resolution at 1.3 MeV gamma energy
            - for Cs-137/Cs-138 measurement.
           .Monitor samples Co-60 and Au-198 were measured with

METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (CADMB)  Modified cadmium ratio method. Irradiation
             produced with (10 min) and without (2 min for Run 1,
             10 min for Run 2) cadmium shield
           (STTA)   Simultaneous irradiaton of sample and
                    monitor wires
           (CHSEP)
SAMPLE     .0.4 MBq of Cs-137 was used as a sample contained in
            a 0.003 litres of Ca-Cl solution which was then
            evaporated to dryness and deposited at the bottom
            of the bottle as a thin disk 7 mm diam. and less than
            0.5 mm thick. Accurate number of Cs-137 atoms was
            detrmined relative to Cs-138 product atoms about
            30 min after irradiation
           .Monitor samples were 0.475% Co/AL and 0.061% Au/AL
            alloys wires 0.76 and 0.51 mm diameter, 3 mm long
            sticked on the outside of the sample bottle.
