              second irradiation, except Au foils of 0.2mm thick.
            Sample set was composed of two Al foils sandwiched
            between Nb foils with Au foil opposite the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 2-nd series of irradiations for c-s ratios:
               Neutron energy 19.4-12.7 MeV, angle for irradiation
            0-140 deg., d+ energy 2.85MeV, beam current 10 microA,
            irradiation time 36 hours.
           (TOF)   Angular spectra of source neutrons were
            measured by TOF technique at angles from 0 to 150 deg
            at intervals of 10 or 5 deg.
           (GSPEC) Gamma-rays from samples were measured.

ANALYSIS    Cross sections ratio was derived from ratio of
            reaction-rates.
CORRECTION - Fluctuation of neutron flux during irradiation.
           - Difference of neutron flux between foils.
           - Nonmonochromaticity of irradiating neutrons.
           - Contribution of parasitic D(d,n)He-3 neutrons to
             reaction rate of Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24 .
           - Finite dimensions of sample foils.
           - Self-absorption of gamma-rays in the foils.
           - Sum-coincidence effect of cascade gamma-rays for Al
             samples was evaluated experimentally to be less 1%,
             was included in uncertainties of efficiencies..
