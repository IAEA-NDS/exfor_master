COMMENT    *By authors*,cross section values for the Al-27(N,2N)
           reaction is within the range of the reported AMS-data.
           For the other two reactions, C-13(N,alpha)Be-10 and
           K-36(N,alpha)Cl-36 was determined the first results
           obtained via measurement of the product nuclides.

ERR-ANALYS For error estimation one has principally to consider
           the error involved in the determination of the neutron
           flux density and hence the fluence. Furthermore, every
           individual AMS-measurement contributes to the total
           error which can turn out to be the main error for the
           case of low isotopic ratios-below 10E-13. In case of
           Al-26 determination, the current was exceptionally low,
           the number of events recorded was small and hence the
           statistical error was rather large. Finally, the
           chemical separation leads to an error of about 3%.
           Combining the individual errors in quadrature was
           obtained the total error of each cross section value.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors.
