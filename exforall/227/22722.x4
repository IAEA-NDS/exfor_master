           The isotopic ratio be-10/be-9 for irradiated graphite,
           Al-26/Al-27 for aluminium and Cl-36/Cl for potassium,
           the ratio of the atoms of the radioactive product
            to those of the inactive carrier was determined.

COMMENT    *By authors*,cross section values for the Al-27(N,2N)
           reaction is within the range of the reported ams-data.
           For the other two reactions, C-13(N,a)be-10 and
           K-36(N,a)Cl-36 was determined the first results
           obtained via measurement of the product nuclides.

ERR-ANALYS For error estimation one has prinsipally to consider
           the error involved in the determination of the neutron
           flux density and hence the fluence. Forthermore, every
           individual ams-measurement contributes to the total
           error which can turn out to be the main error for the
           case of low isotopic ratios-below 10e-13. In case of
           Al-26 determination, the current was exceptionally low,
           the number of events recorded was small and hence the
           statistical error was rather large. Finally, the
           chemical separation leads to an error of about 3%.
           Combining the individual errors in quadrature was
           obtained the total error of each cross section value.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors.
