DETECTOR   (HPGE) 5.5 cm in length * 5.6 cm in diameter.
                  The performance of the HPGE detector was
            characterized by a relative efficiency of 34% for
            a 7.6 cm * 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) detector.
INC-SPECT  -1/E epithermal spectrum for hydraulic tube facility.
            where neutron irradiation of targets was performed
            Samples were irradiated with cadmium shield.

MONITOR    ((MONIT)79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
             Gold-aluminium alloy wire was used for monitoring of
             neutron flux.

SAMPLE     .An In-115/Al alloy foil, atomic weight indium is
            114.82, net weight of the sample in the Al alloy
            is 0.0025 g, isotopic composition In-115 is 95.7% and
            In-113 is 4.3%, size of sample is 5.0*5.0*0.3 mm.
           .Gold monitor sample is Au/Al alloy wire, gold atomic
            weight is 196.97, net weight of the sample in the Al-
            alloy is 0.000136 g, size of sample is 30mm length *
            0.510 mm in diameter.
