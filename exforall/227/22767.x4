FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2-MV PELLETRON accelerator of the
            Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (GSPEC)
           (PHD) A pulse-height weighting technique was applied to
            observed capture gamma-ray pulse-height spectra to
            derive the capture yields.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Lithium target bombarded by 1.5 ns bunched
            proton beam. The lithium target was made by
            evaporating metallic lithium on a copper disk with a
            diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 0.4 mm. The
            diameter of the Li-layer was about 20 mm.
INC-SPECT  .The proton energy was set to 2.4 MeV to generate
            neutrons with an average energy of 550-KeV.
           *EN-rsl-FW*  - energy resolution, full width at half-
            maximum
SAMPLE     .A standard gold sample, purity 99.999%, weight
            6014.3 mg, thickness 0.983 mm, diameter 20.10 mm
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Anti-compton NaI(Tl) spectrometer located at
            86 cm from the sample and at an angle 125-degrees with
            respect to the proton-beam direction. The main
            detector of the spectrometer was a 15.2 cm diameter
            and 20.3 cm long NaI(Tl) detector was centered in a
            large hollow compton-suppression detector 33.0 cm
            diam and 35.6 cm long - for gamma detection. Energy
            resolution of the main detector is 7.6% at 0.662 MeV
            and time resolution is 4.0 ns for 0.511 MeV
            annihilation gamma-rays.
           (GLASD)  Li-6 glass scintillation detector for neutron
                    energy monitoring with diameter 102.0 mm and
             thickness of 6.4 mm located at 4.6 m from the neutron
             source and at 1.9 degrees with respect to the proton
             beam direction.
               As a neutron flux monitor was used a small Li-6
             glass scintillator with a 5 mm diameter and a thick-
             ness 5 mm and was placed at 40-degrees with respect
             to proton beam direction and 0.48-m from the neutron
             target.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
ADD-RES    (G-SPC) The capture gamma-ray spectra were obtained and
           shown on figure
COMMENT    *By authors*.Runs with and without the sample (sample
           ran and blank run) and a run with a standard gold
           sample (gold run) were made cyclically in each
           measurement to average changes in experimental
           conditions, such as the incident neutron spectrum.
           Since the measurements were carried out cyclically,
           systematic changes in experimental conditions could be
           corrected for.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for neutron self-shielding and
            multiple scattering in the sample, for gamma-ray
            absorption and scatteing in sample, from the
           dependence of the gamma-ray detection efficiency on the
           gamma-ray source position, from the impurities in the
           sample ad from the dead time. The overall correction
           factors obtained were about 0.99 for Gd-155 and Gd-157
           and 1.04 for Au-197.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The neutron capture cross section of Dy-
                    isotopes were derived with the error of about
             6-12% in the neutron energy at 550-KeV.
           (MONIT-ERR)  Error of the standard cross-section
           (ERR-S)  Max statistical error. Min error = 3%
           (ERR-1)  Error in the weighting function of the gamma-
                    ray spectrometer
           (ERR-2)  Error of extrapolation of the net capture
                    gamma-rays below discrimination level is 3%.
           (ERR-3)  Max error due to corrections. Min error = 1%
