TITLE      Fission cross-section measurements of 241Am between
           0.1 eV and 10 keV with lead slowing-down spectrometer
           and at thermal neutron energy

SAMPLE     The purified americium solution and isopropyl alcohol
           were mixed thoroughly and electrolyzed on a stainless
           disk (28 mm in diam. and 0.2 mm in thick.) to produce
           an americium deposit (radioactive area of 20mm in diam.
           Then the sample was sitered with a gas burner to fix
           the americium layer on the disk making americium oxide.
           The layer thickness was 2.2 mu-g/cm2 for 241Am deposit.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) The deposit of highly enriched
           uranium oxide (99.91% of 235U) was used to monitor the
           neutron flux.  The layer thickness was 41 mu-g/cm2 for
           235U deposit.

DETECTOR   (FISCH) Back-to-back type double fission chambers and
           a lead slowing down spectrometer couped to an electron
           linear accelerator. This lead slowing down
           spectrometer (KULS) is composed of 1600 lead blocks
            (each is 10x10x20 cm3 and purity is 99.9%) and these
           are piled up to make a cube of 1.5x1.5x1.5m3(appr.40t)
           without any structural materials. The KULS is covered
           with thick cadmium sheets.
           (BF3) The BF3 counter was used for the fission cross
           section measurement of 241Am in the resonance interface
           energy region of 241Am and 235U cross sect. The counter
           was cylindrical type, 50mm in effective length, 12 mm
           in diam. and 1 atm.
