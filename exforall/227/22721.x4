COMMENT    *By authors*.Apart from the gamma-ray line integral in
           the detector spectrum and the areal density of nuclei
           in the sample, determination of cross-sections requires
           two additional quantities, I.E. The neutron integrated
           intensity and the detector efficiency.
SAMPLE     Samples were placed in the neutron beam, 2-m behind the
           exit of the collimator. In this position, the neutron
           beam diameter is 3-cm and its intensity is 2*10e+6
           neutrons-1 in the high-energy peak for an incident
            10-mua proton beam.
           Be-plates, purity more than 99.6% weight, of 5-mm
           thickness and natural iron-plates of 3 and 4-mm
           thickness were irradiated, for 8-Hr in the first case
           abd 2-hr in the latter case. All plates have a surface
           of 50*50-mm**2.
DETECTOR    A 90% efficiency Ge-detector.
INC-SPECT  *En-rsl-fw*.The energy resolution of the detector was
             2-KeV fwhm for 511-KeV gamma-rays.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons are produced by the Li-7(P,N) reaction
           on a natural Li-target of 3-mm thickness.
FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGLVN)
CORRECTION *By authors*.For each observable activity in a given
           mass chain, peak area were corrected for detection
           efficiency and decay branching of the corresponding
           transitions in order to obtain the number of decay.

ERR-ANALYS Error is indicated on figure contain statistical errors
           on the gamma-peak integral-less 8% and systematic error
           on the gamma-detector efficiency-5%, the proton beam
           integration-5% and the Li-target thickness-5%. An
           additional 10% uncertainty on the absolute scale
           results from the uncertainty in the neutron production
           cross-section.
