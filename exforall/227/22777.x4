INC-SPECT  .Thermal neutron spectrum. The flux of the neutrons
            was about 4.37E+13 n/cm2/s
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  The gamma-rays irradiated from the sample were
             measured by two HPGe detectors, each of which had
             about 20% relative to 3"x 3" NaI detector efficiency,
             their energy resolution were about 2.2 keV at
             1.3 MeV gamma-ray energy.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG) The flux was normalized
             by the measurement of the decay gamma-ray from the
             activated Co in the Al-Co wires.

SAMPLE     .Natural thin Re foils and AL-Co wires. The weights of
            the Re foils were 43.8 mg and 58.1 mg. The weights of
            the Al-Co wires are 1.74 mg and 4.58 mg and a percen-
            tage of the Co is 0.475 %.
           .After irradiation samples were cooled during four
            months on the reason of strong activity of 186- and
            188-Re. The samples were measured at a 5 cm (3 cm)
            distance from the end cap of the detectors at the
            first (second) measurement with low-background
            environment
