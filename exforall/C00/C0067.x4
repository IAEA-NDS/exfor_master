TITLE      Total proton reaction cross section of copper
FACILITY   (LINAC)
INC-SPECT  Energy given is for proton energy at center of
            copper target.
SAMPLE     1.2 MeV thick copper attenuator.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 3 adjacent gas-filled dE/dx proportional
            counters in incident beam.
           (NAICR) NaI at an angle of 57 degrees to attenuator
            used as E counter.
METHOD     (EDE) Measured anticoincidence rate between E counter
            and 3 dE/dx detectors.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . nuclear reactions in E counter,
           . elastically scattered particles not detected by E
             counter,
           . inelasctically scattered protons with energies above
             bias energy of E counter,
           . particles scattered elastically out of last
             proportional counter,
           . geometrical effects,
           . multiple scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty given is mainly statistical.
STATUS     Data taken from reference.
