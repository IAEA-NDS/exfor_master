TITLE      Cyclotron production of PET radionuclides: 118Sb

REFERENCE  (J,ARI,41,521,1990)
           (J,RCA,60,57,1993) Data compared to ALICE calculations.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USADAV)
INC-SPECT  External proton beams of 67.5, 60.0 and 42.2 MeV.
           Energy given is average of incident and exit energy
            of proton beam.
SAMPLE     Thin targets of natural Sb (42.7% 123Sb, 57.3% 121Sb)
            were prepared by using Sb2O3 powder (density 5.2
            g/cm3) pressed into Al holders (0.5 mm).
           Target thicknesses varied from 0.11 to 0.17 g/cm2.
           Several stacks were prepared.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB)
           Stacks containing up to 20 Sb targets were irradiated
            several hours with 50-100 nA beams in Faraday Cup.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   Normal high resolution gamma-spectrometry method.
DECAY-DATA Nuclear data were taken from Lederer and Shirley,
            Table of Isotopes, 7th Ed. (1978).
STATUS     No reply from M. Lagunas-Solar to author proof.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Overall data uncertainties estimated by
            summing up the individual errors in quadrature.
           Relative cross section uncertainty is, generally, 10%,
            but increased to 20% near threshold because of the
            increased statistical error.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from text of reference.
HISTORY    (20030626A) Reaction corrected.
           (20170919A) TS+On. REACTION(SF8) revised.
