TITLE      Polarization Measurements on D+D and T+D Neutrons
            Generated by Low Energy Deuterons
FACILITY   (CCW)
SAMPLE     Heavy ice target with an estimated stopping power of
            50 keV.
METHOD     (LRASY,DSCAT)
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) High pressure gas scintillator at 17
            atmospheres with a mixture of 90% helium and 10%
            Xenon in cylindrical stainless steel cup 5 cm diameter
            by 7 cm long coupled to an EMI 6255B photomultiplier.
           This scintillator was in coincidence with two liquid
            scintillators, p-terphenyl in xylene.
CORRECTION Multiple scattering and asymmetry due to the variation
            of neutron intensity over the angle subtended by the
            scatterer were considered to be negligible.
           Geometrical corrections were made.
           No asymmetries in the apparatus were found within the
            limits of statistical accuracy.

REACTION   (1-H-3(D,N)2-HE-4,,POL/DA)
ANALYSIS   Calculated from measurement of left-right asymmetry
            of 4He(n,n) scattering.
COMMENT    The measured asymmetries do not differ significantly
            from 0, therefore, the polarization does not differ
            significantly from 0, since the magnitude of the
            helium analysing power is on the order of 95%.
