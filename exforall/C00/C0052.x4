REACTION   (2-HE-3(P,EL)2-HE-3,,DA)
SAMPLE     3He gas target mounted in cylindrical scattering
            chamber with Mylar window.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Telescopy consisting of a long cylindrical
            crystal on Naton as the E detector, a thick circular
            crystal viewed edge-on by a photomultiplier as the
            delta E detector, and a 3rd detector to eliminate
            counts from the entrance and exit windows of the gas
            cell.

CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . background,
           . electronics dead time,
           . nuclear absoption and outscattering of the detected
             protons by the counter material,
           . overlap of elastic and inelastic peak.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Includes RMS uncertainty in corrections and
            error introduced by the angular uncertainty.
           Total systematic uncertainty ranged from about 13% at
            small angles to abouy 18% at the largest angles.
