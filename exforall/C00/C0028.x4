TITLE      Polarization of Neutrons from the 2H(d,n)3He Reaction
            below 400 keV
FACILITY   (CCW)
SAMPLE     Thick D2O ice target on copper cylinder.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) Polarimeter consisted of a helium gas
            scintillator in coincidence with a pair of NE213
            scintillators. gas scintillator was a 5cm long by 5cm
            diameter cell at 150 atmospheres.  The liquid
            scintillators were located at 123 deg. with respect to
            the neutrons.  Alternate runs were taken with the
            scintillators exchanged.

            analyzing powers from the measured 4He(n,n) scattering
            asymmetries. The analyzing power was averaged over
            the scattering angles and energy spread.
