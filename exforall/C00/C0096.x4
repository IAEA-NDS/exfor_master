INC-SPECT  Energy given is average of incident and exit energy
            of proton beam.
           Proton energies for each target in the stacks were
            calculated using range-energy tables of Williamson et
            al., report CEA-R3042 (1966)
SAMPLE     Thin targets were prepared from NaCl and Na2CO3 by
            pressing it into Al (0.5, 1.0 mm) holders and drying
            at 120 C for several hours.
           Thick targets made with Na and NaCl pressed into Al
            cylinders, then covered with 0.5 mm Al foils.  Target
            thicknesses varied from 0.5 to 3.0 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB) External proton beam (max 67.6 MeV)
            used for irradiation.
           Details on irradiation can be found in: Lagunas-Solar
            et al., Appl. Radiat. Isot.,37,823,1986.

SAMPLE     Thin target results were used where they were similar
            with those obtained from thick-target experiments and
            reproducible.
ERR-ANALYS Overall uncertainties of the cross section estimated
            by summing up the individual errors in quadrature.
            Maximum cross section uncertainty 10%.
           Maximum total energy uncertainty 5%.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 2 of reference.
