TITLE      Measurement of the Production Cross Section of 11C from
            Natural Carbon for 385 MeV Protons.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2UK LVP)
SAMPLE     42-millimeter diameter polystyrene discs of naton 136.
            Various targets of four nominal thicknesses, 50, 250,
            375, and 625 mg/cm2.  92.3% carbon.
METHOD     (BCINT) Faraday cup
           4pi beta-gamma counting
DETECTOR   (SCIN) After bombardment, the naton-136 target was
            placed between two other naton-136 discs, 6-mm thick.
            The three scintillators were coupled to a 56avp
            photomultiplier and enclosed in an aluminum can.
           (NAICR) The 4pi beta counter was mounted within a few
            centimeters of a 7-cm diameter by 5-cm NaI gamma
            counter.

REACTION   (6-C-0(P,X)6-C-11,,SIG)
            Authors assumed target to be pure carbon-12 for
            purposes of calculations.
ANALYSIS   Measurements were taken for six separate 5-minute
            intervals after the bombardment.  From these six
            measurements, three values of the cross section were
            calculated for each bombardment.
           Seventeen measurements were made using different beam
            intensities and target thicknesses.  All measurements
            were consistent to within the statistical uncertainty
            of 1%.
           Activity produced by neutrons from the synchrocyclotron
            and collimators was not detectable at the level of
            0.01% of the proton-induced activity.
DECAY-DATA (6-C-11,20.34MIN,B+,960.,1.,AR,511.,1.)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Allowing for 1% statistical uncertainty,
            less than 0.5% uncertainty from Compton scattering,
            about 0.5% uncertainties in the efficiency and
            calibration of the Faraday cup, and uncertainties of
            about 0.2% arising from the target thickness, the
            time constant, timing errors, and beam fluctuations.
           Systematic uncertainties from secondary particle
            interactions in the target, losses of carbon-11 during
            and after the bombardment, and gas loss of carbon-11
            were expected to be much less than 1 per-cent and were
            neglected.
