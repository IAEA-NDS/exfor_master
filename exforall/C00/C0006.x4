ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,3.5,10.) The counting errors at the lowest
           energies are about three percent, and at the higher
           energies are negligible, The geometry of the counter
           used at low energies is known within about nine
           percent; for the other counter it is better known to
           about two percent. The current measurements with the
           integrator are probably good to two percent. The
           error due to the presence of neutral particles in the
           beam is, in general, not more than one percent; any
           errors due to target contamination or secondary
           electron emission were together not more than one
           percent. The bombarding voltage is known within one
           percent. The combination of these factors leads to an
           aggregate error in the thick-target yield amounting
           to 3.5% at high energies and about 10% at low energies.

DETECTOR   Measured with 2 different detector geometries (below

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The counting errors at the lowest
           energies are about three percent, and at the higher
           energies are negligible, The geometry of the counter
           used at low energies is known within about nine
