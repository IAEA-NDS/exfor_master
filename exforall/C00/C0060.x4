TITLE      Cross Section for C12(p,pn)C11
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USACHI)
SAMPLE     Thin polyethylene foils, 4 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (BCINT) Thin ionization chamber with calibration by
            means of an Ilford G5 nuclear track plate.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4pi proportional counter continuously flushed
            with methane at atmospheric pressure.  The counter
            was standardized with P32 or Na24 sources.
DECAY-DATA (6-C-11,20.5MIN,B+,982.,1.)
CORRECTION A guard foil was placed in contact with the foil to be
             counted.  The guard served as a source of recoil
             carbon-11 nuclei, compensating for recoils lost
             through the back of the counted foil.
           The self-absorption in the foil was investigated and
             the correction was found to be less than 1% up to
             4mg/cm2, then increasing by about 0.8% per mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Estimated from impact parameter of the escape
            orbit and from the range in copper.
REL-REF    (D,B0101002,CRANDALL+,J,PR,101,329,1956) Marked
            difference in self-absorption curves at small
            thicknesses.
           (D,,BURCHAM+,J,PPS/A,68,1001,1952) Burcham appears to
            overestimate the data.  This may be due to a large
            neutron flux around the Birmingham synchrocyclotron.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimated uncertainty due to counting
            statistics combined with an assigned 1% error to
            electrometer reading, foil weight, and beam
            fluctuation correction.
FLAG       (1.) 9.8 mg weight foil.  3.16x10**9 protons.

           (3.) 9.7 mg weight foil.  4.81x10**9 protons.
           (4.) 9.7 mg weight foil.  3.76x10**9 protons.

           (6.) 9.2 mg weight foil.  5.21x10**9 protons.
