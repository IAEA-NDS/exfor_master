INSTITUTE  (1USACHI)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The University of Chicago
           synchrocyclotron.
SAMPLE     Thin polyethylene foils, 4 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (BCINT,ACTIV) Thin ionization chamber with
           calibration by means of an Ilford G5 nuclear track
           plate.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4pi proportional counter continuously flushed
           with methane at atmospheric pressure. The counter was
           standardized with P32 or Na24 sources.
DECAY-DATA (6-C-11,20.5MIN,B+,982.,1.)
CORRECTION A guard foil was placed in contact with the foil to
           be counted. The guard served as a source of recoil
           carbon-11 nuclei, compensating for recoils lost
           through the back of the counted foil. The
           self-absorption in the foil was investigated and the
           correction was found to be less than 1% up to 4mg/cm2,
           then increasing by about 0.8% per mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Estimated from impact parameter of the
           escape orbit and from the range in copper.
REL-REF    (D,B0101002,W.E.Crandall+,J,PR,101,329,1956) Marked
           difference in self-absorption curves at small
           thicknesses.
           (D,,W.E.Burcham+,J,PPS/A,68,1001,1955) Burcham appears
           to overestimate the data.  This may Be due to a large
           neutron flux around the Birmingham synchrocyclotron.
