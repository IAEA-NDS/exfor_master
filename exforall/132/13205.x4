INC-SPECT  Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) at an unperturbed
           flux of 6 x 10**13 neutrons/cm2-sec (nvt=2.4 x 10**20).
METHOD     (ASEP) Am aluminum capsule (CPP-6-6-1) prepared at
           Philips Petroleum Company which contain 85.2 mg of
           U3O8 irradiated for three cycles in the MTR. The
           cadmium ratio for cobalt for the position in which
           the capsule was irradiated was 15. The capsule was
           dissolved in the acid mixture of 6M HCl - 1.6M HNO3.
           The number of fissions in the irradiated capsule was
           determined from the difference in the weight of total
           uranium before and after irradiation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data uncertainty is standard deviation.

HISTORY    (20161205A) BP: removed Cs data as not original.
           Original MONITOR information was removed and REACTION
           SF8 was changed.
CORRECTION Small corrections were applied for neutron capture
           effects and, and in the case of Nd-144, for Ce-144
           holdup.
