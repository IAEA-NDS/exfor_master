           The double-chamber fission counting apparatus.
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Brookhaven graphite reactor.
INC-SPECT  Fairly constant flux of ~2x10**11 neutrons/cm2/sec
           mostly thermal neutrons.
SAMPLE     Small, accurately measured aliquots (~10-5 mg) of
           235U or 239Pu (designated foils).
DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) Two gas proportional counters with
           silver cathodes, 2 cm dia. and 30 cm long. The
           krypton pressure was about 300 mm and methane was
           added to bring the total pressure to 1 atm.
METHOD     (CHSEP,FISCT) Foils were mounted on platinum in each
           of the two chambers of fission counting apparatus.
           The entire assembly was then irradiated in the
           Brookhaven graphite reactor for 6-12 hr, and the
           fission counting rates of the foils were recorded
           continuously. After irradiation the 85Kr was
           radiochemically separated from the slug, purified,
           and its activity measured by internal gas phase
           proportional counting. From these values of the 85Kr
           activity and the measured number of fissions the
           fission yield was calculated.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data uncertainties include possible
           sources of error in fission counting, separation
           procedure, and 85Kr gas counting.
