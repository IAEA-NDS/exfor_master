TITLE      Accurate nuclear fuel burnup analysis, fourteenth
           quarterly progress report
AUTHOR     (B.F.Rider,C.P.Ruiz,J.P.Peterson Jr,F.R.Smith)
INSTITUTE  (1USAGEB)
REFERENCE  (P,GEAP-4893,1965)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAGEB) Vallecitos boiling water reactor.
           Irradiation assembly GEV-2. The Cd ration for Co is
           7.1+-0.5.
METHOD     (MASSP)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION Small corrections (<2%) were made for traces of natural
           neodymium as determined from the amount of Nd-142
           present. The calculated holdup of Ce144 was added to
           the Nd144 measured to provide the total chain yield for
           the mass 144 position.
STATUS     (TABLE) Tab.4 (p.19) in P,GEAP-4893,1965.
HISTORY    (19890519C) VM
           (20210105A) OG. Converted to lower case and 4-digit
           year. STATUS, REACTION updated. CORRECTION added.

CORRECTION Small corrections were applied for the thermal capture
           on Nd143 to form Nd144 (0.7%) and on Nd145 to form
           Nd146 (0.2%).
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Information, that 0.9946 of
           Nd-148 is from fission, was in the old version of
