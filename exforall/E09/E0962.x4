SAMPLE     Chemical-form of target is element.
           Physical-form of target is solid. Aluminium foils
           which consisted of three or four layers are used. An
           inner aluminium foil which was sandwiched with outer
           aluminium foils was used as a sample in order to
           cancel scattering-in and scattering-out nuclei by
           incident protons [A.M. Poskanzer et al., Phys. Rev.
           102(1956)1390].
           Target-thickness is 5.26+-0.05, 3.44+-0.03mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (ACTIV)Immediately after irradiation foils were
                  removed from the hot area, and a sample portion
                  of the inner foil which corresponded to a beam
                  spot size was cut and sealed in a disk
                  container made of lucite.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNLEP)KEK 12 GeV proton synchrotron
DETECTOR   (GELI)Detection efficiency is 1.57E-2+-0.05E-2.
                 Standard 60Co sources of about 0.1 micro-Ci were
                 used for calibration of the detection
                 efficiency.
           (HPGE)Pure Germanium detector, detection efficiency is
                 1.96E-3+-0.06E-3. Standard 60Co sources of about
                 0.1 micro-Ci were used for calibration of the
                 detection efficiency.

REL-REF    (A,,J.B.Cumming+,J,NIM,180,37,1981)
           H.Hirabayashi et al., mention that the obtained
           averaged cross section 8.1+-0.19 mb at 12 GeV is
           nearly equal to 7.92+-0.18 mb at 28 GeV obtained by
           J.B Cumming et al. Therefore the present results
           support Cumming's remark the cross section is nearly
           constant in the energy region of 10-30 GeV.
