TITLE       Measurement and calculation of average
            activation cross sections in the spontaneous
            fission neutron field of 252-Cf
FACILITY   .Outdoor irradiation facility of PTB.
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Two single sources of 300microg of
            Cf-252 each in a ceramic tablet, doubly
            encapsulated by zircaloy cylinders 10mm diam.
            by 10mm high with a wall thickness of 1.5mm.
INC-SPECT  .Cf-252 neutron field with total source strength
            of 1.33 by 10**9 neutrons per sec., Giving an
            integrated flux in 4pi over the samples of
            10**13 to 10**15 neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) 70 cm3.
COMMENT    .Comparison with other authors and calculations
            carried out (compiler).
CORRECTION .For -
            counting losses due to dead time and pile-up-
                0.5 - 4.5%,
            true coincidences - 1-3%,
            gamma attenuation - 1-2%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes individual
            contributions that combined quadratically -
           (ERR-S,0.3,0.7) 0.3 to 0.7 for counting statistics,
           (ERR-1) 1% for photopeak efficiency calibration,
           (ERR-2)  1.2% for effective neutron path length, and
           (ERR-3)  1.7% for source strength determination.
            The quoted uncertainties correspond to
            a confidence level of 68%.
