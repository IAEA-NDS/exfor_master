TITLE       Activation cross section sigma-therm and half-life
            of 53-Mn
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERKLN)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Average flux for  587 days irradiation
              ('Long term'): 1.093 x 10**14 +- 3% n/cm2/s.
                 Average flux for  19.6 days irradiation
              ('Short term'): 1.805 x 10**14 +- 5% n/cm2/s.
INC-SPECT  Thermal Maxwellian flux.
SAMPLE      2 mg of meteoritic manganese extracted from about
            20 grams of the iron meteorite "Duchesne" and
            containing 6.5 dpm 53Mn were purified by paper chroma-
            tography, ashed and dissolved in dilute HN03 + H202.
            The Mn solution was then homogenized with 2.3 mg of
            high purity ZnO (65Zn as internal standard) and
            285 mg MgO.
            The composition of the meteoritic Mn-samples:
            'Long term' irradiation:
            53Mn - 0.00019 mu-g; 55Mn - 230.5 mu-g;
            Zn - 216.0 mu-g; Mg - 19.70 mg
             'Short term' irradiation:
            53Mn - 0.000208 mu-g; 55Mn - 253.3 mu-g;
            Zn - 237.4 mu-g; Mg - 21.65 mg.
            Amounts of each 35 mg oxide-mixture were enclosed in
            quartz ampoules (diam. = 6 mm; 25 mm long). Two of
            these ampoules were used for the 'Long' term reactor
            irradiation, a third one for the short (20 d)
            irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  The 54.Mn was counted in a NaI(TI) detector
            2 x 2 inch. by its 0.835 MeV-gamma-line. The yield of
            55Mn was determined by neutron activation via 56Mn by
            its 0.847 keV-line.
            The 65Zn activity was determined by its
            1.12 MeV-gamma-line in a large distance of 33 cm by a
            2 x 2 inch NaI(TI) detector.
           (GELI) In order to increase the security, aliquots were
           counted with a 30 cc Ge(Li)detector independently.
           The Mn and Fe standards were treated in the same way.
