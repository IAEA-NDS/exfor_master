INSTITUTE  (2SWTBAS)
FACILITY   (NGEN,2SWTBAS) No mention of machine, vector polarized
            140keV deuterons with a mean degree of polarization
           of 0.5 at 0.5 uA.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-T) 140 keV deuterons (0.5 uA) with
            a vector polarization of about 50% emerging from
            a conventional 'atomic beam' source impinged on
            a T-Ti target. Outgoing neutrons at different angles
            are used to get differently polarized neutrons.
SAMPLE      Same as detector 3.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP,COINC) Flight paths 16 and 30 cm.
            To obtain the energy spectrum of the scattered
            neutrons, the time-of-flight difference between the
            scattered neutron and the associated alpha-particle
            from the neutron production is measured.
            To reduce the background, a coincidence was required
            between the associated alpha particle (production)
            and the recoil deuteron ( elastic scattering).
            For the asymmetry measurements the whole set-up
            remained fixed and only the incident neutron
            polarization was reversed.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Thin plastic scintillator to detect the
            associated alpha particles at 90 degrees with respect
            to the deuteron beam. The solid angle subtended by the
            detector is defined by a 1.5 cm x 3.0 cm rectangular
            slit at 8.0 cm from the target.
           (SCIN) Liquid scintillator NE213, 12.7 cm diam.,
            length 5.1 cm to detect the scattered neutrons.
           (SCIN) Deuterated scintillator, cylindrical, 3.81 cm in
            diam., 7.62 cm long, model NE230 (liq. scint).
CORRECTION  For background and for non-linear response of the
            NE230 scintillator.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  Only statistical errors are given.

REACTION   (1-H-2(N,EL)1-H-2,,POL/DA,,ANA) Analysing power at
            different scattering angles.
MONITOR    (2-HE-4(N,EL)2-HE-4,,POL/DA,,ANA) Runs with opposite
            neutron polarization were performed alternately using
            the alpha-particle detector as a monitor.
REL-REF    (A,,P.Doleschall,J,NP/A,201,264,1973)
           (A,,S.C.Pieper,J,NP/A,193,529,1972) Good agreement
           with the theoretical calculations of both Doleschall
           and of Pieper. Also good agreement is found with the
           data of the charge symmetrical process.
