TITLE      The giant dipole resonances in 11C and 15O observed

INSTITUTE  (1USASTF)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USASTF) The Stanford FN-tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator provided proton beams from 2.2 to 19 MeV.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN)
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (COINC) The gamma-rays were detected with a 24 cmx 24
           cm NaI(Tl) crystal surrounded by a plastic
           scintillator operated in anticoincidence. The use of
           fast electronics makes efficient pile-up suppression
           possible with negligible deadtime even in the
           presence of high background. In an effort to reduce
           background, radiations from sources other than the
           target itself were reduced to a minimum. Only one
           aperture was placed between the target and the
           switching magnet which was located outside the target
           room. The beam current striking this aperture one
           meter in front of the target was monitored and
           maintained at less than 0.2 % of the target current.
           After traversing the thin targets the beam was
           collected in a Faraday cup, surrounding by shielding,
           about 4 m from the target.

SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.965) Target consisted of three stacked,
           self-supporting 10B foils made by electron gun
           evaporation. Each  foil was about 100 microg/cm2 thick.
