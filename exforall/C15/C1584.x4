ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in the yields is either
           statistical, due to the number of gamma-ray counts,
           or set to 7% due to uncertainties in the beam
           integration, target location, and detector efficiency,
           whichever is larger. This 7% figure is due to an
           uncertainty of approximately 5% in bombardment
           parameters such as current integration and 5% in
           counting due to source location, and so forth. These
           uncertainties are then added quadratically.

           integration, target location, and detector efficiency,

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in the yields is either
           statistical, due to the number of gamma-ray counts,
           or set to 7% due to uncertainties in the beam
           integration, target location, and detector efficiency,
           whichever is larger. This 7% figure is due to an
           uncertainty of approximately 5% in bombardment
           parameters such as current integration and 5% in
           counting due to source location, and so forth. These
           uncertainties are then added quadratically.
           (ERR-1) Bombardment parameters.
           (ERR-2) Source location.
