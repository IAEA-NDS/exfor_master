TITLE      Alpha-decaying states in 10,12Be populated in the
            10Be(14C,10,12Be) reaction
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAFSU) the Florida State University
             superconducting LINAC facility.
INC-SPECT  The 14C beam was not debunched following LINAC. The
            integrated beam exposure was 0.44 mC.
SAMPLE     The reaction target, 280 microg/cm2 BeO, was mounted on
            a 1.0 mg/cm2 Pt backing for mechanical support. The
            10Be enrichment was about 94% and the total 10Be
            thickness about 100 microg/cm2. The target was
            orientated with the Pt backing upstream and the BeO
            facing the detectors.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) An array of two (50 mm x 50 mm) detector
            telescopes. The first element in each telescope was
            a 65 microm thick silicon double sided strip detector
            (DSSD) used for energy loss (DE) measurements. Each
            DSSD was segmented into 32 independent (50 mm x 3 mm)
            strips, with 16 horizontal strips on the front face
            and 16 vertical strips on the back face. The second
            element was a 500 microm thick silicon resistive
            strip detector (RSD).
