SAMPLE     (6-C-12,ENR=0.99945) All targets used in the present
           experiment were made by the thermal cracking of
           methyl iodide by means of an electric current passed
           through a 0.008 cm thick tantalum strip; when the
           strip is heated, the methyl iodide decomposes, and a
           layer of elemental carbon is deposited on the strip.
           The methyl iodide was prepared from two different
           samples of 12C. The first target had the 13C content
           of the elemental carbon targets prepared from this
           material was about 0.1 %. The second target the
           starting material for the targets was methyl alcohol,
           in which the 13C/C ratio was believed to be <50 parts
           per million.

REACTION   (6-C-12(A,G)8-O-16,PAR,SIG) electric dipole, E1, cross
           sections.
METHOD     (PHD) The angular distribution measurements were used
           to separate the observed ground state gamma-radiation
           into El and E2 components, on the assumption that the
           E2 radiation has the energy dependence to be expected
           for direct E2 radiative capture. The angular
           distributions thus determine a normalization for the
           strength of the E2 capture, and the calculated E2
           radiation components were subtracted from the
           observed yields at those energies for which angular
           distribution measurements were not possible because
           of low intensity.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The first step in the extraction of the 160
           ground-state gamma-ray yields from the two-dimensional
           spectra was to identify a rectangular region-of-
           interest in the time energy (pulse-height) plane. The
           background spectrum was normalized to the 12C
           spectrum according to the height of the prompt
           neutron peak and the magnitude of the
           time-independent background, and was then subtracted
           from the 12C spectrum to obtain the gamma-ray yield.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors shown are derived from the
           statistical errors on the 90 degrees gamma-ray yields
           and from the uncertainties in the strength of the E2
           radiation.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors in the S-factor were determined
           by observing the range of variation of S(0.3 MeV,
           c.m.) over a contour of chi2 corresponding to one
           standard deviation error (minimum chi2 plus the
           number of degrees of freedom), which was traced out
           as a function of the parameters varied in the fit to
           the 12C(alpha,gamma)160 data.
