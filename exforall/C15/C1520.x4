TITLE      Subbarrier fusion of 9Li with 70Zn
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1CANTMF) the ISAC facility at TRIUMF
INC-SPECT  Beams of radioactive 9Li were extracted with energies
            up to 18.4 keV, mass separated by passage through
            two dipole magnets and accelerated to their final
            energy by radiofrequency quadrupole and drift tube
            linear accelerators.
SAMPLE     Targets of about 95% enriched 70Zn (thickness about
            0.8-1.1 mg/cm2) were prepared by electrodeposition
            on Al backing foils (0.54-0.71 mg/cm2).
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The experiment was carried out in a
            large-volume (about 40 L) scattering chamber, known
            as the Laval chamber, at the end of this beam line.
MONITOR    Si detectors (300 mm2) were mounted about 40 cm from
            the target at +/-16.2 degree to monitor the 9Li
            elastic scattering during each irradiation.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the cross sections reflect
            the uncertainties in the measured activities (primary
            uncertainty) and the systematic uncertainties, such
            as detector efficiencies, beam integration, decay
            branching ratios, correction for missing activities,
            etc.
