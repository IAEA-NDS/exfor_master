TITLE      Astrophysical S factor for a-capture on 112Sn in the
            p-process energy range
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
            at the University of Notre Dame, USA, in the energy
            range 7.59-11.42 MeV
INC-SPECT  112Sn targets were irradiated with an alpha beam in
            the energy range starting from 7.59 MeV in energy
            steps of 0.5 MeV. The typical current recorded was
            between 200 and 250 nA
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detection system was composed of two Clover
            Ge detectors (Clover 1 and Clover 2), each detector
            having four HPGe crystals
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 112Sn targets in the form of
            thin self-supporting foils of 2.2mg=cm2 were used for
            the measurements. The highly enriched (99.60 %)
            112Sn targets were prepared at Argonne National
            Laboratory via mechanical rolling. The 112Sn foils
            were mounted on Ta frames with hole diameters of
            12.5 mm. The target thickness was determined by
            Rutherford back scattering (RBS) to be 2.2 +/-
            0.2 mg/cm2 and was verified at the end of the
            experiment.
ERR-ANALYS The total error of the measured cross section values
            includes two components: statistical error based on
            counting statistics of the analyzed gamma-lines
            (between 0.2 and 25% depending on the bombarding
            energy) and systematical error based on the
            errors in the procedural techniques such as the
            error in the efficiency measurement (2%), the error
            in the beam current integration (2%), and target
            thickness (9%). These components were added in
            quadrature.
