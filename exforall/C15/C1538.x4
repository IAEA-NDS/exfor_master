TITLE      The 12C(p, pn)11C Reaction from 50 to 160 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAHRV) 160 MeV Harvard synchrocyclotron.
SAMPLE     Polystyrene discs, 30 mm in diam. and 1.4 mm thick
DETECTOR   (NAICR)a 5 cm diam x 5 cm long NaI crystal.
MONITOR    The proton beam was monitored by a Faraday Cup placed
            after the sample.
METHOD     Activation
CORRECTION The absolute values have been obtained by normalizing
            to the absolute determination of Kavanagh et al.,
            i.e. 63.3 +/-0.3 mb at 98.1 MeV.
