INSTITUTE  (1USAORL,1USATEN,1USACSM,1USATTU,1USANCA,1USARUT)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) The Holifield radioactive ion beam
           facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge national laboratory.
INC-SPECT  Low-energy beams of 17O from the HRIBF tandem
           accelerator with an intensity of about 1 pna.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target. Large scattering chamber
           filled with hydrogen gas at a pressure of 4 torr.
           Ultrahigh purity gas (>99.999% H2).
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Nitrogen recoils from the 1H(17O,alpha)14N
           reaction have laboratory angles <21 degree and thus
           pass through the center of the annular Silicon
           Detector Array (SIDAR) from any point of origin inside
           the target chamber.
METHOD     (COINC) The alpha and 14N reaction products were
           detected in coincidence by an array of silicon strip
           detectors operating within the hydrogen gas
           environment. The kinematics and relative timing of
           the two detected particles allowed the 1H(17O,alpha)
           14N reaction to be cleanly distinguished.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in the resonance energy was
           determined from the extrapolation by including
           appropriate correlations between the uncertainty in
           the resonance energy and the uncertainty in the width.

ANALYSIS   The resonance strength was obtained from the best fit
           to the yields data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The three largest sources of purely systematic
           uncertainties in the resonance strength were:
           the thickness of the carbon foil used for beam current
           normalization (6% arising primarily from the
           uncertainty in stopping powers for alpha particles in
           carbon), the strength of the alpha source used for
           efficiency calibrations (3%), and the stopping power
           for 17O in hydrogen gas (2% as determined in this
           measurement). Adding each of these uncertainties in
           quadrature with the result from the fit to the yield
           curve produces a final result.
           (ERR-1) Carbon foil thickness.
           (ERR-2) Alpha source strength.
           (ERR-3) Stopping power of 17O.
