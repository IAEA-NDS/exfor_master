FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) The experiments were conducted at
           the the Ohio University 4.5 MV Tandem Van de Graaff
           Accelerator using beam swinger TOF system
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutron detector consisted of a 170 mm diameter
           Bicron BC-408 plastic scintillator with thickness of
           2.54 cm. The scintillator was read out by three
           Hamamatsu photomultipliers.
