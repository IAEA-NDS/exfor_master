           (20030424U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A self-supporting C-foil of nominal thickness 15 mug/
           cm**2 was first produced. On the two surfaces of the
           foil Au and Ag films were evaporated, nominally 50 and
            100-nm thick respectively. The front Ag film is used a
           a spacer to separate the surface C contamination from
           the signal of the C foil and as a Rutherford reference
           element. The back Au film is used to prevent systematic
           errors from the increasing C deposition during the
           measurements and a second rutherford reference element.
ADD-RES    Spectra of different Si-C and Si-Ge-C samples.
           Carbon and silicon channeling dips across [111] axis.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The detector diaphragms defined a area to
           achive optimum energy resolution and detector
           efficiency.
