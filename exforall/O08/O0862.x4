DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
SAMPLE     1 mumeter diamond like carbon has been inserted between
           thin film of Ba-Cl/2 and silicon substrate to avoid
           the formation of silicide and to separate the Cl peak
           from peak of Si substrate easily.
           Target stability was measured in special experiments.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR). Within the operation range terminal voltage
           fluctuation was below +/- 1 KeV
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties are presented in authors'
           data tables.
HISTORY    (20010616C)
           (20010614R) Data tables were sent by j.K.Kim
           (20030501U) Last checking has been done.
ADD-RES    1.Isotope effect influence on elastic cross section has
           been calculated.
           2. Mass resolvable energy for several recoiled
           particles in silicon matrix is presented for
           investigated targets.
COMMENT    - By authors.  The recoil cross section of 6-Li, 12-C,
           16-O and 19-F by 35-Cl below 10 MeV were measured and
           compared with Rutherford cross section.  The recoil
           angle was fixed at 30 degrees.
