TITLE      Backscattering  of 7-Li-ions from oxygen below 6.25 MeV
AUTHOR     (E.Rauhala, J.Raisanen)
INSTITUTE  (2SF HLS) Accelerator laboratory
REFERENCE  (J,NIM/B,35,7,1988)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2SF HLS) The 7-Li(2+) ion beam was generated by
           the 5 MV EGP-10-II tandem accelerator
           (VDG,2SF HLS) The 4-He+ ion beam from the 2.5 MV Van de
            Graaff accelerator.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)  A silicon surface barrier detector [100 mm**2,
           60 mum] positioned at a scattering angle of 170
           degrees.  The energy resolution of the detection system
           was 28 KeV at E/Li= 3 MeV.
METHOD     (SITA) An Sn-O/2 layer vacuum evaporated on a carbon
           substrate was used for obtaining the elastic scattering
           cross-sections for oxygen.  For reference purposes a
           thick target of the carbon substrate material was also
           used.
           (MOMIX) For the absolute oxygen cross section values
           the Rutherford cross section for tin was assumed to be
           valid.
MONITOR    (50-SN-0(P,EL)50-SN-0,,DA)
SAMPLE     The stoichiometry and thickness of the Sn-O/2 film was
           determined by 2 MeV 4-He ion backscattering.  The
           atomic ratio of oxygen to tin was observed to be 2:1
           with an accuracy of 1%.  The film thickness was
           determined to be 125 nanometers specific gravity of
           6.95 g/cm3 for Sn-O2.  The film thickness corresponds
           to an energy width of 100 KeV for 3 MeV and 80 KeV for
           6 MeV 7-Li-ions.
           No impurities in the film were detected and the
           impurity concentration in the carbon substrate was
           found to be insignificant.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties given are due to statistical
           error in calculating the oxygen peak area and possible
           error from the background subtraction.
