SAMPLE     The krypton gas was contained in aluminium cylinders
           having a thin window made of tantalum, at a pressure of
           about  980 mbar.  The target thicknesses were 185, 230,
           310 and 520 keV at 40, 30, 20 and 10 MeV, respectively,
DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ITYMIL) Milan AVF cyclotron
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) Irradiations were performed with durations of
           the order of 1 min and beam currents of about 100
           nanoampere.
           (GSPEC) After irradiation, the targets were measured
           with a Ge(Li) detector, and followed over a period of
           time, in order to evaluate the activities of the
           various radioisotopes produced.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is shown on figure without
           any analysis.
CORRECTION The yield was corrected for decay during irradiation.
COMMENT    -By compiler.  Other isotopes besides 81-Rb, 82m-Rb and
           84m-Rb were detected.  However their yields are not
           given in the paper, since their activity is too low,
           and this would involve excessive measurement errors.
