SAMPLE     A thin layer of natural silicon was deposited on a
           vitreous carbon substrate by argon sputtering. The
           silicon layer was mounted alongside a Harwell series1
           bismuth standard in the analysis chamber and promptly
           evacuated to minimise exposure to oxygen.  The layer
           was found to contain 6.7e+17 atoms/cm**2 of silicon,
           1.5 at.% Oxygen, 0.05 at.% Argon and 0.01% krypton.
COMMENT    - By authors - abstract.
           A discrepancy between theoretical and experimental data
           for the proton elastic scattering cross-section from
           silicon was investigated.  The proton elastic
           scattering cross-section for silicon was measured
           between 600 and 2500 KeV for 110 and 170 degrees
           backscattering by normalising yields from a thin
           natural silicon layer against corroborated
           cross-section data.  The results obtained are in good
           agreement with the theoretical calculations.  Thus the
           discrepancy is resolved and the power of the
           theoretical approach to cross-section data handling is
           confirmed by these measurements.

           The data were used for normalization at beam energies
           2.40, 2.42, 2.44, 2.46 and 2.48 MeV for 170 degrees
           scattering cross section and 1.81, 1.82 MeV for 110
           degrees scattering.

           The data are used by authors for comparing
ERR-ANALYS The combined counting statistics contributed less than
           2% to the 110 degrees scattering and 3% to the 170
           degrees scattering error.

COMMENT    - By authors.  The cross section data may be
           overestimated by up to 1.5% because of a contribution
           from oxygen at low energies.
