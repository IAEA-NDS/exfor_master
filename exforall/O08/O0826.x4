SAMPLE     The gold foils were cut in squares of 1-cm*1-cm and
           weighed individually. The average surface density was
            57-mg/cm**2. Aluminium foils, with a surface density
           of 4.5-mg/cm**2, were sandwiched between the gold
           foils. The purity of the aluminium and gold was
           spectroscopically analysed to be 99.9% and 99.7%,
           respectively.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,3ARGCNE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
CORRECTION A correction was made at high deuteron energies for the
           contribution made by Hg-195 to the total counting.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1).The error in the surface density.
           2.  Statistical uncertainty.
           3.  The error in the determination of the deutron flux.
           4.  The error of counting efficience.
           (EN-ERR-DIG).Digitizing error of incident energy.
