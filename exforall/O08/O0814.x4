SAMPLE     Two U-238 targets of 15 mg/cm**2, were used.
COMMENT    /By compiler/ All decay-data have been determined by
           authors.
DETECTOR   (SOLST).Two high-efficiency germanium detectors were
           placed around the source. More detail information for
           used detector is absent.
           (SCIN) Thin plastic detector was used for detecting the
           beta-particles.
FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGLVN) At the Leuven Isotope Separator on-line
           with an ion-guide laser ion source.
METHOD     (OLMS) Two U-238 targets were installed in a gas cell
           filled with the 500 mbar of argon. The reaction recoil
           products were thermalized and neutralized in the buffer
           gas. The gas flow transported  the atoms into the beam
           paths of two excimer-pumped dye lasers, that
           selectively ionized the nickel atoms in the two-step
           process. At the exit hole of the gas cell, the ions
           were injected into sextupole ion guide, connecting the
           high pressure area of gas cell to the low pressure zone
           of the mass-separator.

STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is reported by authors. Any
           analysis is absent.
