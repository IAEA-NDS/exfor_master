TITLE      Deviations from Rutherford backscatterig cross section
           for backscattering of 6-Li ions from fluorine between
           2.5 and 7 MeV.

METHOD     (SITA)
           (MOMIX) Yttrium in used target
           (EXTB)The beam current was maintained at several
           nano-ampere.
SAMPLE     A thin two component sample  of Y-F/3 has been used.
           It contains the fluorine for which the cross section
           deviation was measured together with an element of high
           z value - yttrium which insures pure Rutherford cross
           section.
           Thickness of the sample was 47.3 mugramm/cm**2.
CORRECTION A correction due to the screening effect for the
           heavier element in the compound was also included.
ADD-RES    Backscattering spectra for elastic scattering at
           different 6-Li ion incoming energy.
