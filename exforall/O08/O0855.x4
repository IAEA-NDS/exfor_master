           2.5 and 7 MeV.

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CRORBZ)
METHOD     (SITA)
           (MOMIX) Yttrium in used target
           (EXTB)The beam current was maintained at several
           nano-ampere.
SAMPLE     Thin YF3 film with a thickness of 47.3 mu-g/cm2
           deposited onto a Nucleopore substrate. A Nucleopore
           is an organic compound that consists of oxygen,
           hydrogen and carbon.
           It contains the fluorine for which the cross section
           deviation was measured together with an element of high
           Z value - yttrium which insures pure Rutherford cross
           section.
DETECTOR   (SI) A standard backscattering apparatus with PIPS
            (Passivated, Implanted, Planar Silicon) Canberra
           particle detector (50 mm2) positioned at a scattering
           angle of 150. degr. was used.
           Thickness of the sample was 47.3 mugramm/cm**2.
CORRECTION A correction due to the screening effect for the
           heavier element in the compound was also included.
STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl.1 from NIM/B,136-138,81,1998
ADD-RES    Backscattering spectra for elastic scattering at
           different 6-Li ion incoming energy.
