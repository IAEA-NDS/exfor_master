SAMPLE     The Rh foils were analyzed spectroscopically and it was
           found that the quantities of impurities were
           negligible.  The thickness of these foils was about
           16.86 mg/cm2, whereas the one corresponding to Cu was
           about 16.6 mg/cm2.

           The standard excitation functions were used for the
           determinations of the energy of the incident beam and
           the flux of alpha-particles.  The fluxes obtained
           through both standard functions differ only in 1%,
           whereas the error in its determination is less than
           11%.

METHOD     (INTB) The maximum incident energy was approximately
           88.7 MeV and the flux of the beam in the target was
           2.38e+13 particles/sec.
           (STTA) Cu foils were interleaved between the Rh foils:
           their function was to monitor both the flux and the
           energy beam in the stack.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation lasted 465 minutes.

HISTORY    (20050224C) By F.Ch
           (20050306U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty is given in data table.
           (ERR-1) An overall error of target thickness
           (ERR-2)  High limit of error due to angular straggling.
COMMENT    -By  authors.   The uncertainty in the energies, due to
           the dispersion of the incident beam and the dispersion
           produced on the target, was estimated to be 0.5 MeV for
           10 MeV alpha-particles.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C)
           (COMP) A comparison between the experimental and the
           cross sections calculated using the EXCLUSIVE INDEX
           model is presented.
