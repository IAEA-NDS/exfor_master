SAMPLE     The Rh foils were analyzed spectroscopically and it was
           found that the quantities of impurities were
           negligible.  The thickness of these foils was about
           16.86 mg/cm2, whereas the one corresponding to Cu was
           about 16.6 mg/cm2.

           The standard excitation functions were used for the
           determinations of the energy of the incident beam and
           the flux of alpha-particles.  The fluxes obtained
           through both standard functions differ only in 1%,
           whereas the error in its determination is less than
           11%.

DETECTOR   (GE-IN) A Ge detector of high resolution (FWHM =1.5 keV
           at 122 keV) was used
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
INC-SOURCE the flux of the beam in the target was 2.38 x 10.**13
           particles/sec. The irradiation lasted 465 minutes
METHOD     (INTB) The maximum incident energy was approximately
           88.7 MeV and
           (STTA) Cu foils were interleaved between the Rh foils:
           their function was to monitor both the flux and the
           energy beam in the stack.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation lasted 465 minutes.
           (GSPEC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty including:
           (ERR-1) An overall error of target thickness
           (ERR-2,,1.)  Error due to angular straggling.
           (ERR-3,,11.) The error in flux determination is less
           than 11% whereas fluxes obtained through both standard
           functions differ only in 1%
COMMENT    -By  authors.   The uncertainty in the energies, due to
           the dispersion of the incident beam and the dispersion
           produced on the target, was estimated to be 0.5 MeV for
           10 MeV alpha-particles.

           (COMP) A comparison between the experimental and the
           cross sections calculated using the EXCLUSIVE INDEX
           model is presented.
