           The experiment has been performed by the MGC cyclotron
           in Debrecen and the dynamitron tandem accelerator in
            Bochum from e=5.0 MeV up to 7.8 MeV, using a He++-Beam
METHOD     (SITA) See sample
           (EXTB) An average He++ target current of 1
           particle-mu-a has been used without any target
           deterioration.
           (BCINT) An electric field of 300V was applied to
           eliminate the effect of secondary electrons on
           beam-integration.

SAMPLE     High beam current, long measuring time and improved
           detection efficiency is necessary to compensate the
           expected small reaction cross section.  For reducing
           the background yield - predominantly caused by high
           energy gamma-rays and neutrons from the 13-C(A,N)-
           thin, 0.1 mu-m, gold foil was used as target backing
           and a liquid nitrogen shroud close to the target served
           against carbon deposition.  The evaporated 70-Ge
           enriched (86.5%) target had a thickness of 36 mu-g/cm2.

COMMENT    - By authors.  The total cross section of the reaction
           was obtained using the intensity of the 635-KeV peak
           only with a small correction due to a loss through
           another ground state transition. The transition is fed
           by many transitions, therefore a correction for angular
           distribution is not necessery.
           The coincidence measurements proved by presence of
           further gamma lines from the deexcitation of 74-Se, in
           addition to the 635-KeV transition in the single
           spectra, however, since all the observed transitions go
           through the 635-KeV transition, no correction in the
           cross section was necessary.
           - By compiler:
           1. Possible production of ground state of 74-Se due to
           854-KeV e0 transition is not taken in account.
           2. Authors' data for sum of projectile and target
           nucleus kinetic energies were recalculated for
           projectile energy in Lab.-System By compiler. The
           authors' data are saved in MISC.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors are mainly due to the errors in:
           1.  Peak area,
           2.  Detector efficiency,
           3.  Beam integration,
           4.  Number of target atoms,
           5.  The corrections applied.
