ERR-ANALYS - By authors.- The uncertainties in the cross section
           values, resulting from the statistical and background
           subtraction errors in the determination of the peak
           areas, increased from 2% at the low energy end to 5%
           towards the high energy end of the given ion energy
           intervals.
