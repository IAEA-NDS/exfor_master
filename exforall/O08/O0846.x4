SAMPLE     The Uranium Target was Tilted by an Angle of 80 Degree
           With Respect to the Beam Direction in Order to Increase
           Its Effective Thickness to 86 Mg/Cm**2.
COMMENT    /by Authors/. Fission Products Recoiling Out of the
           Target were Thermalized by Collisions with He Gas and
           Accelerated and Mass Separeted As Single Charge Ions.
           This Socalled Ion-Guide Technique has the Advantage
           Over Conventional Ion Sources in That It can Deliver
           Beams of All Elements,Thus Including Yttrium and Within
           A Time of Typically 1 Ms,Avoiding Decay Losses of Beta-
           Decaying Activities.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SOLST,SOLST).A 0.9-Mm Thick Plastic
           Scintillator For the Detection of Beta-Particles,a Ge-
           Detector with an Active Area of 10 Cm**2 and a
           Thickness of 1-Cm For Low-Energy Gamma-Radiation,and
           A Coaxial Ge-Detector of 18% Relative Efficiency For
           The Higher-Energy Range (UP TO 2.1 MEV) With a 1.9-KeV
           Resolution at 1.32 MeV.

ERR-ANALYS The Independent Yields For Zr, Nb and Mo are Obtained
           With a Relative Accuracy of About 15%. Extrapolating
           These Values with a Gaussian Dependence on Z Leads to
           A Relative Yield of 2.5 For Y-103.
