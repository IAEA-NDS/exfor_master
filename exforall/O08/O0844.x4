HISTORY    (20010115C)
           (20031022U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     U-238 was used as target. Another information is absent
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 30% hyperpure Ge-detector.
           (SCIN) 0.5- and 0.75-mm thick plastic scintillator
           sheets as trigger detectors for beta-particles
           and LEGE-detector for low energy gamma-rays and X-
           rays.

ERR-ANALYS The error bars given refer to the relative error. An
           additional uncertainty in the absolute yields that is
           due to the uncertainty of detector efficiencies is
           estimated to be of the order of 30%.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is shown by authors on figure.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) The measured beta-decay half-life Nb-108
           0.20+-0.03 sec agrees with the previous measurement
           based on beta- delayed neutron detection.
           The life-time of the first 2+ state in Mo-108 was
           measured to be 0.5+-0.3 nanosecond.
