SAMPLE     The Cylindrical Lead Target of 5-Cm Diameter and 10-Cm
           Lenght was Placed in the Centre of the Radiation
           Camera.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Statistical Calculation by the Monte-Carlo
           Method of the Interaction of the Nucleons with Energies
           Higher Than 10.5 MeV on the Basis of the Cascade-
           Evaporation Model of the Nuclear Reaction with a
           Cylindrical Target of a Onecomponent Materials.

DETECTOR   (GLASD) Two Glass Track Fission Fragments Detectors.
           The Track Detectors were Covered by U-235 and U-238
           Layers. The Thickness of the Layers were 0.591+-0.023
           Mg/Cm**2 For U-235 and 0.696+-0.021 Mg/Cm**2 For U-238.
           To Preclude the Thermal Neutron Contribution the
           Detectors were Surrounded with 1 mm Thick Metallic
           Cadmium.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSITE)
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (BCINT) The
           Proton Current Integral During the Experimental Time
           Was Measured Just in Front of the Target by Two Methods
           Usind Induction and Acoustic Sensors. Their Absolute
           Calibration was Made on the 12-C(P,PN)11-C Reaction.
