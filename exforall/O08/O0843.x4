TITLE      Study on Production of Pd-103 and Characterisation of
           Possible Contaminants in the Proton Irradiation of
           Rh-103 Up to 28 MeV.

SAMPLE     Seven stacks containing high purity 26-mum thick Rh-
           foils more 99% pure, major impurities 100-ppm Fe and
            100-ppm and high purity Ti, Cu and Ni monitor foils,
           purity more 99%, were used.
CORRECTION Normalized excitation function for the contaminating
           56-Fe(p,n)60-Co process.
           Correction for self-absorption was applied.
COMMENT    *By Authors*.At all energies systematic contamination
           with Co-56 is observed. The most probable route is
           through activation of the Fe present in the Rh foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           used. Seven stacks were irradiated with 14.7, 22.5 and
           29.4  MeV proton beam. Beam current was monitored and
           measured in Faraday-cup. Irradiation lasted from 1 hour
           to two hours with 200-500 nA beam current.
