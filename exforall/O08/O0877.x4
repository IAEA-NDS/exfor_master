HISTORY    (20010613C)
           (20030501U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Thin targets were used in order to reduce the
           scattering of ions from the substrates. Aluminium
           containing natural oxygen was deposited on a self-
           supporting carbon film (40 nm) and coated with a layer
           of 10 nm Ag. Targets of different thickness were used
           for the scans over narrow resonances and over slowly
           varying portions, with an energy loss of 4 and 8-KeV,
           respectively, in an Al/2-O/3 layer for 3-MeV alpha
           particles.  Because the elastic scattering cross
           sections for silver is expected to be essentially
           rutherfordlike even at 9 MeV, the silver film can be
           used as a reference.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two  surface barrier detector.
           The scattered ions were usually detected by an annular
           surface barrier detector with an energy resolution of
           25-KeV and sensitive area of 140 mm**2.  Another
           surface barrier detector was with an energy resolution
           15-KeV and a sensitive area of 28 mm**2.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) A NEC 9SDH-2 pelletron tandem at Fudan
           university.
METHOD     (BCINT)
ADD-RES    (COMP).The threshold energies of oxygen at which the
           backscattering cross sections begin to departure from
           their Rutherford values have been measured. The
           experimental results were compared with the predictions
           from the analytical formulae developed by Bozoian et.
            al.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty in the cross section is
            reported by authors.

           It is for the 3500-3800 KeV energy region. Data were in
           agreement within 3%.

           For the 5.55-5.85 MeV region, the were 20% and 10%
           larger than those obtained by John at scattering angles
            165.5 degree and 175.7 degree, respectively.

           For the 8.50-8.80 MeV energy range,the data measured
           at scattering angles 165 and 175-degrees were in
           agreement with those made by John+ at scattering
           angles 165.6 and 175.6 degrees within 8% and 3%,
           respectively. This discrepancy is partly accounted for
           by the fact that extracting accurate cross section
           values from the small-scale graph by John is difficult.
           (A,,J.A.MARTIN+,J,APL,52,2177,1988)
           The cross section values measured by Martin+ for
            8.5-8.8 MeV at 166 degree are in agreement with this
           experiment at 165 degree within 3%.
           (D,,J.C.BARBOUR+,J,PR/B,38,7005,1988)
           The cross section values measured by Barbour+ for
           8.7 MeV at 164 degree is 22, which is 21% less than
           that in data-section. In order to avoid the error due
           to the uncertainty in scattering angle, the cross
           section can be measured at certain scattering angle and
           subtended solid angle by using a thick-high-z oxide
           target, in this experiment, highly pure Y/2-O/3 powder,
           which was pressed into a small disc 1 mm thick and a
           diameter of 1 cm, was used as target.
