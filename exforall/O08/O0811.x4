SAMPLE     The Dy foils were analyzed spectroscopically, and the
           impurities were smaller than 0.1%.  The surface density
           of these foils was about 21.38 mg/cm2.
           Each one of the 27 dysprosium foils of the target was
           wrapped in Al of surface density of 3.72 mglcm2, in
           order to avoid the loss of radioactive nuclei by
           recoil.

           The fluxes obtained through both standard functions
           differ only in 1% whereas the error in its
           determination is less than 11%.

METHOD     (EXTB) The incident energy was 88.5 MeV, and
           (STTA) The target was cooled by a cooling coil with
           water, in order to avoid target melt.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation and cooling times are not given

ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
HISTORY    (20050217C) By F.Ch
           (20050306U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is shown in table. The
           details are not given.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of Dy foil thickness.  No
           corrections due to the nonuniformity of the foil
           thicknesses were made.
COMMENT    -By author.  The uncertainty of the energy in each foil
           of the stack is due to the dispersion of the incident
           beam and the dispersion produced in the target.  The
           latter was estimated to be 0.5 MeV for 10MeV
           alpha-particles.

RAD-DET    (67-HO-160-G,DG)  Due to the short half-lives of Ho-160
           isomers and long cooling time, the gamma-rays measured
           was exclusively corresponding to the formation of
           160-Er and there is no contribution of 160-Ho
