TITLE      Isomeric yield ratios of 195m,gHg and 197m,gHg in the
            196Hg(gamma,n)  and 198Hg(gamma,n) reactions induced
            by  bremsstrahlung  energy   within   giant   dipole
            resonance region.

SAMPLE     The investigated  samples of 0.3 g mass (or thickness
            t = 0.3 g/sm**2) prepared  from  the  99.99%  purity
            HgCl2,  packed  in  polyethylene  wrap in disk shape
            with surface area of 1 cm**2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial p-type HPGe detector (Canberrs) with a
            diameter  of 60.5 mm  and  length  of 31 mm.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The  total  uncertainty of the isomeric ratio
                   (IR) consisted  of  the systematic errors and
                    the error of the IR calculation.
           (ERR-1) Systemastic   error   including   sample   to
                   detector  distance,  electron beam variation,
                   irradiation time and cooling time.
           (ERR-2) The  error of IR calculation by using formula
                   (1) of the article.
HISTORY    (20190926C) Data  were  compiled at the MSU SINP CDFE
            by V.Varlamov.
