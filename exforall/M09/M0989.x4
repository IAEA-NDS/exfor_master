INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     The principal measurements were carried out with a
            target of natural copper 40 mg/cm**2 thick.
           Additional measurements of the yield of the
            photoprotons as a functions of the energy Eg-max,
            made with a target 13 mg/cm**2 thick have made it
            possible to introduce a correction for the target
            thickness.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Cesium-Iodide crystal 0.9 mm thick and 30 mm
            in diameter.
ANALYSIS   (PLA) Unfolding of photonuclear cross section from
            the reaction yield using Penfold-Leiss method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-root-squared uncertainties.
