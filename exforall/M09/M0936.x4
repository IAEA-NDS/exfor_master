REACTION   (73-TA-180-M(G,2N)73-TA-178-M/G,,SIG/RAT,,BRA)
SAMPLE     Natural Ta target.
            The reactions with 180Ta-m isomer were studied using
            natural   (nat-Ta)  targets  despite  the  very  low
            abundance (1.2 10**-2%) on this nuclide
ANALYSIS   The yield of the exotic reactions
            180Ta-m(gamma,2n)178Ta-m and
            as well   as   yields  of  many  other  photonuclear
            reactions on ground states of Ta and Hf nuclei  were
            measured by   the   method   of  the  g-spectroscopy
            off-line after  the  tarGets   activation   by   the
            bremsstrahlung radiation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
