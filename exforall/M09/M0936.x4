SAMPLE     Natural Ta target.
            The reactions with 180Ta-m isomer were studied using
            natural (nat-Ta) targets despite the very low
            abundance (1.2 10**-2%) on this nuclide
ANALYSIS   The yield of the exotic reactions
            180Ta-m(gamma,2n)178Ta-m and
            as well as yields of many other photonuclear
            reactions on ground states of Ta and Hf nuclei were
            measured by the method of the g-spectroscopy
            off-line after the targets activation by the
            Bremsstrahlung radiation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
