COMMENT    The possibility  of  studying  photonuclear reactions
            near  by  means  of  powerfulfemtosecond  lasers  is
            explored     by     con    example    of    deuteron
            photodisintegration.
FACILITY   (LASER,4RUSRUS)
           The terawatt  femtosecond  laser  facility   of   the
            Internat  Center  at  Moscow  State University.  The
            radiation from is characterized by a pulse energy of
            upto 50 mJ,  a durat a repetition rate of 10 Hz, and
            a wavelength of 805 nm This provides a  power  above
            10**18 W/cm**2.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
           Intense relativistic-electron  and  photon  beams  of
            energ   were   obtainedafter   the  optimization  of
            relevant experiers, including the focus of the laser
            beam, its time structhoice of target.
           Respective bremsstrahlung interacted with a secondary
            de target in the form of a heavy-water container.
SAMPLE     Heavy-water.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 10 3He counters.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.

CRITIQUE   As was confirmed by V.G.Nedorezov the data  published
            in  the text are correct but those presented in Fig.
            5 not (energy value is 1 MeV smaller).
