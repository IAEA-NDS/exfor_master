REACTION   (65-TB-159(G,3N)65-TB-156,,SIG,,,EVAL)
ANALYSIS   The new data for the  partial  reaction  (g,3n) cross
            section on 159Tb were  estimated  on the base of the
            experimental (g,2n) reaction  cross section obtained
            in  the energy range above the threshold  B3n of the
            reaction (g,3n) in  discrepancy  with  the objective
            physical data reliability criteria:
            F1 =  SIG(g,1n)/SIG(g,Sn),
            F2 =  SIG(g,2n)/SIG(g,Sn),
            F3 =  SIG(g,3n)/SIG(g,Sn),
            where SIG(g,Sn)=SIG(g,1n)+2SIG(g,2n)+3SIG(g,3n).
          In accordance with definition:
            F1 must be smaller than 1.00;
            F2 must be smaller than 0.50;
            F3 must be smaller than 0.33.
          At  energies  above the  (g,3n) reaction threshold  B3n
            = 23.66 MeV this  cross   section  was  not  obtained
            experimentally  at all but the estimated SIGest(g,3n)
            can be naturally  described using  the expression for
            the neutron yield reaction cross section:
                       SIGexp(g,Sn) = 2SIGexp(g,2n) =
                 SIGeval(g,1n)+2SIGeval(g,2n)+3SIGest(g,3n),
            where SIGeval(g,1n) and SIGeval(g,2n) were evaluated
            using the  experimental-theoretical  method  and the
            data reliability criteria F1-3:
           The  new data  for (g,3n) cross section  undetermined
            before were estimated using the following equation:
              SIGest(g,3n) = 2/3[SIGexp(g,2n)-SIGeval(g,2n)-
                             1/3SIGtheor(g,1n).
