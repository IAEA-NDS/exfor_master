INSTITUTE  (4UKRKFT)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)   2000  MeV  electron  linac  of  the
            Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The linearly  polarized  photons were produced
            by coherent bremsstrahlung of 600 MeV electrons in a
            diamond crystal, 0.3 mm and 2 mm thick.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR)  In the two-arm  experiment the reaction
            products  were  registered  in  coincidence  by  two
            silicon  surface  barrier  detectors  (SBD)  located
            on  both sides.
           (TELES,SIBAR)  In  the   one-arm   measurements,  the
            particles were detected by a telescope consisting of
            two SBD operating in deltaE x E regime.
SAMPLE     Target  consist   of   self-supporting   isotopically
            enriched  (90%) foils  of  6LI  that  was  40 micron
            thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
           (ERR-1,0.,5.)  The  systematic   error  in   A  value
            dependent on  the accuracy of polarization Pc in the
            coherent part of the photon spectrum was better than
            5%.
HISTORY    (20171211C) Data were compoled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
