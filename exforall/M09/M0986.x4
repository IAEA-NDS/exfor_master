TITLE      Isomeric yield ratios of 195m,gHg and 197m,gHg in
            the 196Hg(g,n) and 198Hg(g,n) reactions induced
            by bremsstrahlung energy within giant dipole
            resonance region.

FACILITY   (MICRT,4ZZZDUB) Electron accelerator Microtron  MT-25
            of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna,
            Russia.
SAMPLE     The samples of 0.3 g mass (or thickness t =
            0.3 g/cm**2), prepared from the 99.99% purity HgCl2,
            packed in polyethylene wrap in disk shape with
            surface area of 1 cm**2.
           There were seven isotopes 196Hg, 198Hg, 199Hg, 200Hg,
            201Hg, 202Hg and 204Hg with abundances of o.15, 9.97,
            16.87, 23.1, 13.18, 29.86 and 6.87%, respectively,
            available in natural mercury.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector (Canberra) with  a diameter  of
            60.5 mm  and  length  of 31 mm.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Error of sample to detector distance, electron
                    beam variation, irradiation time, cooling
                    time.
           (ERR-2) Error of the isomeric ratio (IR) calculation
                    by using formula (1) of article.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of the IR estimated to
                    be about 10%, which consists of the
                    systematic errors and error of the IR
                    calculation.
HISTORY    (20191031C) Data were compiled at the MSU  SINP  CDFE
            by V.Varlamov.
