INSTITUTE  (4RUSLEB)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSLEB) 260 MeV synchrotron of the Physical
            Institute of Academy of Science.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced-radioactivity method.
DETECTOR    Beta counters.
SAMPLE     Targets were prepared from sufficiently pure
            substances, so that the reactions with the impurities
            were neglected.
ANALYSIS   (PHDIF) The "photon-difference" method for cross
            section unfolding from the reaction yield.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-root-squared uncertainties the main
            part of which is connected with the inaccuracy in
            determining the absolute beta activities of the
            samples.
HISTORY    (20191112C) Data were compiled at the Russia MSU SINP
            CDFE by V.Varlamov.
