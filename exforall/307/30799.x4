TITLE      Precise measurement of the integral cross section for
           the reaction Mg-24(n,p)Na-24 between 13.5 and 18.0 MeV
FACILITY   (VDG,3POLIPJ) 3 MV Van de Graaff accelerator in the
           Institute of Nuclear Problems in Warsaw used for
           producing neutron gives a 50 micro-Ampere deuteron
           beam.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)He-4 reaction.
           Applied T-target in the form if Titanium Tritide was
           about 0.5 milli-gram/cm thick. The dia. of the beam
           hot spot on the target was 6 mm.
INC-SPECT  Monoenergetic neutrons with energies between 13 and
           18 MeV.
SAMPLE     99.7 % Mg and 99.99 % Al pure metallic samples.
           Sample weight of about 120 milli-gram for Mg and
           170 milli-gram for Al was chosen.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           Mg and Al samples were activated simultaneously in the
           same position and were counted directly one after
           another for equal counting times
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.5*7.5-cm NaI(Tl) detector
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           Values were obtained by recalculation of nuclear data
           standards for nuclear measurements, p. 59, IAEA
           Technical Report Series no. 227, Vienna. by H.Vonach
             (1983), and Physics Data. Compilation Series,
           Fachinformationszentrum Energie, Physik, Mathematik,
           Karlsruhe, 13 - 1 by S.Tagesen, H.Vonach and
           B.Strohmaier (1979). Recalculations were made under
           assumption that the activating neutron flux had a
           truncated Gaussian distribution. It was assumed also
           that the FWHM of the distribution is equal to double
           the value of the energy resolution for the given
           neutron energy. Values of cross section were then
           calculated by numerical integration of the Sig(E)
           function over the energy interval of one FWHM on both
           sides of the given experimental neutron energy. The
           values of Sig(E) were obtained by a polynomial
           interpolation between the values of Tagesen et al.
            (1979) and Vonach (1983).

ERR-ANALYS -Statistical
           -Systematic
           Most of the systematic errors were eliminated in
           the applied procedure.
           Only two sources of errors (chemical purity and
           isotopic composition) were not taken into consideration
COMMENT    Differences between given values of Mg-24(n,p)Na-24
           reaction cross section and those of Exfor V0014002
           are rather small and only for the highest neutron
           energies, 17.09 and 17.86 MeV are remarkable.
           Uncertainties of the obtained cross-section values
           range from 2 to 4 mb, and are lower than the values of
           exfor V0014002 for most neutron energies. The best
           improvement is reached for 14.78 and 15.23 MeV neutron
           energies, for which the ratio of cross-section
           uncertainty for the investigated and reference reaction
           is the highest.
