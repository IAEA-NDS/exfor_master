TITLE      Charge distribution study in the neutron induced
           fission of 237Np - fractional cumulative yield of

SAMPLE     Approx. 100 microgram, prepared by electrodeposition
           from isopropyl alcohol medium on Al-foil, covered with
           0.007 cm Al catcher foil, wrapped in 0.002 cm Cd foil.
           Original sample purified from Pu, Am. Alpha spectrum
           showed less than 0.004 % 239Pu.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Apsara swimming pool reactor
            neutron flux is about 10**12 n/cm2/s
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum - sample shielded by 0.002 cm
             cadmium, estimated Cd ratio is 200 (assumed by the
             compiler. In the publication the number is called
             cadmium cutoff). Cd-wrapping used to reduce 238Np
             fissions (calculated to be less than 0.05 % of
             237Np fissions).
           Irradiation times were up to a maximum of 30 minutes.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma-ray counting of catcher foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE).45 ccm, 4096 channel analyzer
                  resolution = 2.1 kev at 1332 keV.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Fractional cumulative yields were derived from
           the growth and decay curves of daughter products.

ADD-RES    From the measured fractional cumulative yields, the
           following values were derived for the most probable
           charge (ZP) using the equation of D.R.Nethaway,
           UCRL-51640 (1974):
           ZP(A=134)=52.29   ZP(A=135)=52.73   ZP(A=138)=53.96
           from a plot of the fractional cumulative yield versus
            (Z-ZP), a value of 0.6 was obtained for the Gaussian
           width of the distribution.
