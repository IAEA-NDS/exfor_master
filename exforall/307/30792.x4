SAMPLE     Encapsulated solutions containing approximately 1
           microg. of Pu-241.
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (RCHEM) the antimony was separated from the irradiated
           target at different times, between 2 and 10 min, after
           the irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) For each separation time the separation time
           activities of Sb-128-m and Sb-128-g, as slope and
           intercept respectively, were evaluated from least
           square fitting of the corresponding time dependent
           activity profile ( 743 and 754 keV gamma lines).
           The separation time activities were correlated to the
           independent yields of Sb-128-m, Sb-128-g and the
           cumulative yield of precursor Sn-128.
           The latter two yields were determined by a least square
           fitting analysis of the separation time activity of
           Sb-128-m as function of separation time. The precursor
           contribution to the Sb-128-m activity was found to vary
           between 77% and 86%, depending upon separation time.
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum
ERR-ANALYS The values given are mean of three or more measurements
           The error on an individual measurement is the compoun-
           ded error due to counting statistics, uncertainties in
           abundances of gamma lines, the fractional cumulative
           yield of Sn-128, the irradiation and separation times
           and half lives.
CORRECTION The contribution from 3.6% internal-transition decay of
           Sb-128-m was found to be within the experimental error
           on the isomeric yield ratios and hence was not
           considered.
