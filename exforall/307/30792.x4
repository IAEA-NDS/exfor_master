TITLE      FRAGMENT ANGULAR MOMENTA IN LOW AND MEDIUM ENERGY
           FISSION OF PU-242.

SAMPLE     ENCAPSULATED SOLUTIONS CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 1
           MICROG. OF PU-241.
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (RCHEM) THE ANTIMONY WAS SEPARATED FROM THE IRRADIATED
           TARGET AT DIFFERENT TIMES, BETWEEN 2 AND 10 MIN, AFTER
           THE IRRADIATION.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) FOR EACH SEPARATION TIME THE SEPARATION TIME
           ACTIVITIES OF SB-128-M AND SB-128-G, AS SLOPE AND
           INTERCEPT RESPECTIVELY, WERE EVALUATED FROM LEAST
           SQUARE FITTING OF THE CORRESPONDING TIME DEPENDENT
           ACTIVITY PROFILE ( 743 AND 754 KEV GAMMA LINES).
           THE SEPARATION TIME ACTIVITIES WERE CORRELATED TO THE
           INDEPENDENT YIELDS OF SB-128-M, SB-128-G AND THE
           CUMULATIVE YIELD OF PRECURSOR SN-128.
           THE LATTER TWO YIELDS WERE DETERMINED BY A LEAST SQUARE
           FITTING ANALYSIS OF THE SEPARATION TIME ACTIVITY OF
           SB-128-M AS FUNCTION OF SEPARATION TIME. THE PRECURSOR
           CONTRIBUTION TO THE SB-128-M ACTIVITY WAS FOUND TO VARY
           BETWEEN 77% AND 86%, DEPENDING UPON SEPARATION TIME.
INC-SPECT  THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM
ERR-ANALYS THE VALUES GIVEN ARE MEAN OF THREE OR MORE MEASUREMENTS
           THE ERROR ON AN INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENT IS THE COMPOUN-
           DED ERROR DUE TO COUNTING STATISTICS, UNCERTAINTIES IN
           ABUNDANCES OF GAMMA LINES, THE FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE
           YIELD OF SN-128, THE IRRADIATION AND SEPARATION TIMES
           AND HALF LIVES.
CORRECTION THE CONTRIBUTION FROM 3.6% INTERNAL-TRANSITION DECAY OF
           SB-128-M WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN THE EXPERIMENTAL ERROR
           ON THE ISOMERIC YIELD RATIOS AND HENCE WAS NOT
           CONSIDERED.
