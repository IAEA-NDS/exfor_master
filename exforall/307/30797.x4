TITLE      Cumulative yields of short-lived ruthenium isotopes in
           the thermal neutron induced fission of 233U, 235U and
           239Pu.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM).CIRUS,natural uranium fuel,CANDU type;
            pneumatic carrier facility for irradiations.
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of about 10E13 n/cm2/sec;
           irradiation time: 20 seconds.
SAMPLE     About 10-15 microgram of 233U,235U and 239Pu in 1M HNO3
           was encapsuled in polypropylene tubes.
METHOD     (RCHEM).using ruthenium carrier and 106Ru tracer. One
            part of the solution was analyzed for ruthenium,
            another part was assayed for monitors 97Zr and 104Tc.
           (GSPEC)
           Fission rate determination: by 97Zr and 104Tc monitors;
           Chemical yield determination: by 106Ru tracer.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)of 45 cm3 coupled to a 4K multichannel analizer.
           Resolution: 1.8 keV at 1332 keV (60Co).
ANALYSIS   Gamma-spectrum photopeak analysis; decay of samples was
           checked for correct half lives and radiochemical
           purity. Standard equations were used for calculation
           of activities from photopeak areas and for buildup and
           decay.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).only given as 1 standard deviation on the
           average of 4 detereminations for each target.

            except the error for the Ru-109 yield, which was
            taken from the 83Mysore conf (see COMMENT).
COMMENT    by compiler: the error for the Ru-109 yield given
           in Table 2 of the main publication was 0.98 which
           seems to be wromg as it is unreasonably high,
           differs from the ones given in the other
           publications and is in conflict with the error
           of the chain yield.
