            Same cumulative and chain yields in tables
           (C,83MYSORE,2,143,1983) Yields as main publication.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS pneumatic carrier facility
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of about 10E+13 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     About 10-15 ug of 233U,235U and 239Pu in 1M HNO3
            encapsuled in polypropylene tubes.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 20 sec
           (CHSEP) Using Ru carrier and 106Ru tracer. One part of
            the solution was analyzed for Ru, another part was
            assayed for monitors 97Zr and 104Tc.
           (GSPEC)
           Fission rate determination: by 97Zr and 104Tc monitors;
           Chemical yield determination: by 106Ru tracer.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) 45 cm3, resolution of 1.8 keV at 1332 keV
ANALYSIS   Gamma-spectrum photopeak analysis; decay of samples
            was checked for correct half lives and radiochemical
            purity. Standard equations were used for calculation
            of activities from photopeak areas and for buildup
            and decay.

            except the error for the Ru-109 yield, which was
            taken from the 83Mysore conf (see COMMENT).
COMMENT    by compiler: the error for the Ru-109 yield given
           in Table 2 of the main publication was 0.98 which
           seems to be wromg as it is unreasonably high,
           differs from the ones given in the other
           publications and is in conflict with the error
           of the chain yield.
