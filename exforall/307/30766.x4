            H.Naik+, preliminary value for 241Pu(n,f) given
METHOD     (CHSEP) After irradiation, standard aliquots were
            counted at a fixed geometry. The growth and decay of
            fission products was followed by gamma-spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 45 ccm (resolution=2.5 keV at 1332 keV) coupled
            to a 4 k channel analyzer. the deadtime was kept
            below 10%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given. Compiler assumes
            that totalerror is given corresponding to 1 standard
            deviation.
