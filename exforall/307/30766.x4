METHOD     (CHSEP) After irradiation, standard aliquots were
           counted at a fixed geometry.the growth and decay of
           fission products was followed by gamma-spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 45 ccm (resolution=2.5 keV at 1332 keV) coupled
           to a 4 k channel analyzer. the deadtime was kept
           below 10%.
ERR-ANALYS No information given. compiler assumes that total error
           is given corresponding to 1 standard deviation.

ANALYSIS   For obtaining the fractional cumulative yield of 134Te
           the growth and decay of 134gI was measured by gamma-
           spectrometry. 134mI  directly formed in fission was
           assumed to have decayed completely before measurement.
