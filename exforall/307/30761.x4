TITLE      STUDY OF STRUCTURE IN THE LOW ENERGY PART OF THE LONG-
           RANGE ALPHA-PARTICLE SPECTRUM IN SPONTANEOUS FISSION
           OF CF-252

SAMPLE     CF-252 SOURCE DEPOSITED ON PT BACKING WAS 1.2*10+6
           FISSIONS/SEC,IN DIA.6 MM.
METHOD     THE THREE PARAMETER CORRELATION TECHNIQUE AND CHARGED-
           PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION TELESCOPE WERE USED.
DETECTOR   (TELES) SEMICONDUCTOR TELESCOPE WAS USED FOR ALPHA
           PARTICLE DETECTOR.
            SURFACE-BARRIER TYPE SILICON DETECTOR WAS USED FOR
           FISSION DETECTOR.
ADD-RES    THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE
           IN THE LOW ENERGY PART OF THE LONG-RANGE ALPHA-PARTICLE
            (LRA)SPECTRUM IN SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252. THE
           AUTHORS FOUND THAT THERE EXISTS A WEAK STRUCTURE IN
           THE REGION 10-14 MEV OF THE LRA SPECTRUM IN THE CASE
           OF ANGLE 67DEG. LABORATORY SYSTEM(THE EMISSION ANGLE OF
           THE LRA WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT
           FRAGMENT).
