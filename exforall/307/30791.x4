FACILITY   (REAC,3CHFTHU). 1 MW open pool type 'THOR'
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor neutron spectrum with a cadmium ratio
           of 10:1 (determined by gold foil). To reduce dead-time
           loss during counting, THOR was operated at a power of
           500 watts only, yielding fission rates in the target of
           around 10E+7 fissions/sec.
SAMPLE     3.5 mg of 93% enriched U-235 metal foil, sealed in
           polyethylene bag.
METHOD     To avoid loss of gaseous fission products, the sample
           was not removed from the polyethylene bag during the
           experiment. The sample was irradiated, together with a
           fission track detector, for 11 sec, then transported in
           a polyethylene carrier to the measuring position.
           (FISCT,FPGAM) fission track etch method combined with
           rapid gamma-ray spectroscopy.
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) The counting system consisted of a 50 ccm Ge(Li)
           detector connected to a TN-1710 2048-channel analyzer
           coupled to an Apple-II PC. The system resolution was
           2.4 keV FWHM at 1332 keV. The detector efficiency in
           the range 80-2000 keV was calibrated using sets of IAEA
           and NBS standard sources.
           12 consecutive gamma-spectra were collected.
           (TRD) The fission track detection system consisted of
           0.003 inch thick 93% enriched U-235 metal foils backed
           on polycarbonate as fission track detector, calibrated
           in the thermal column of THOR. The detector was etched
           in NaOH.Fission tracks were counted under a microscope.
ANALYSIS   Fission yields were obtained from measured photopeak
           areas (from which activities were deduced) and fission
           rates (deduced from the measured total number of
           fissions = 6.7E+7) using standard equations for growth
           and decay.

CORRECTION Gamma-ray spectrometry:
            - gamma-ray emission probability
            - efficiency of detection system
            - interfering gamma-rays from other fission products
              (the list is given under DECAY-DATA, taken from
              table 3 of Radiochimica Acta 37(1985)131)
           Growth and decay during irradiation and cooling time,
            taking into account differences in cumulative yields
            of parent and daughter products.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total yield error           (8.7-33.0%)
                   The total error was calculated as the square
                   root of the sum of squares of individual
                   errors (Compiler's comment: irrespective of
                   their random or systematic nature).
                   The errors are given as one standard deviation:
                   - gamma-ray intensity       (3.9-12.0%)
                   - gamma counting statistics (2.1-31.6%)
           (ERR-1)   detection efficiency           (4.5%)
           (ERR-2)   fission track counting         (5.0%)
           (ERR-3)   sample weight                  (3.1%)

FLAG       At the time of the experiment, the decay branching of
           Te-136 to the I-136 isomers was unknown. Therefore two
           values have been calculated for the I-136m cumulative
           fission yield, distinguished by the FLAG.
           Compiler's comment: at the time of compilation we know
           from the current 'Nuclear Data Sheets' and 'Table of
           Isotopes' that there is no branching of Te-136
           to I-136m, and hence the second value is correct.
           (1.) assuming 100% decay of Te-136 to 44.8 sec I-136m
                =upper limit (Compiler's comment: wrong value)
           (2.) assuming 100% decay of Te-136 to 83.4 sec I-136g
                =lower limit (Compiler's comment: correct value)
