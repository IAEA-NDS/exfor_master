TITLE      FISSION FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY AND MASS DISTRIBUTIONS
           MEASUREMENT FOR CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION
METHOD     SELF-TRANSFERRED SOURCE OF CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION
           FISSION FRAGMENTS DETECTED BY  AU-SI DETECTORS.MASS
           DISTRIBUTION AND CORRELATION OF FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY
           VERSUS FRAGMENT MASS DERIVED FROM THE DATA OBTAINED.
           FRAGMENT MASS RESOLUTION ABOUT 5 U. FRAGMENT ENERGY
           RESOLUTION ABOUT 2 MEV. 7.6*10+6 EVENTS COLLECTED.
ADD-RES    THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO CONFIRM SOME STRUCTURES IN
           THE MASS DISTRIBUTIONS AT FIXED TOTAL POSTNEUTRON-EMIS-
           SION FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY, AND IN TOTAL POSTNEUTRON-
           EMISSION FISSION  FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
           AT FIXED MASSES. THE FINE STRUCTURES ON MASS DISTRIBU-
           TION(M 107,112,118) AT HIGH KINETIC ENERGY REGION (EK
           200-216MEV)(SEE FIG.3 OF CNP 4,41,8202) AND THE FINE
           STRUCTURES AT M 132,135,140,145,150 155 AT THE FIXED
           TOTAL KINETIC ENERGIES AND AT THE FIXED EXCITATION
           ENERGIES (SEE FIG.1 AND FIG.2 OF CNP 5,289,8311) HAVE
           BEEN OBSERVED. NO NUMERICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE FROM
           PAPER. BUT THE DATA FOR FIG.4 OF CNP 4,41,8202,WHICH IS
           THE TOTAL PRENEUTRON-EMISSION FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY A
           A FUNCTION OF THE PRENEUTRON-EMISSION FRAGMENT MASS.
           SHOULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE AUTHORS.
