INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of about 10E+13 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     ~1 ug of 241Pu in 1M HNO3 encapsuled in a
            polypropylene tube
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 120  sec
           (CHSEP) Ru was separated as RuO4 by fast radiochemical
            technique using a distillation method.
           The distillate was collected in a vial containing 5 ml
            ice-cold 1M HCl.
           The residual distillation liquid was collected and
            assayed for monitors 97Zr and 104Tc.
           (GSPEC) All samples were counted in fixed geometry.

ANALYSIS   Gamma-spectrum photopeak analysis; decay of samples was
            checked for correct half lives and radiochemical
            purity. Standard equations were used for calculation
            of activities from photopeak areas and for buildup and
            decay.
ERR-ANALYS The total error of an individual measurement including
            detector efficiency, irradiation and separation times,
            chemical yield and fission rate is about 10%.
           (ERR-S) 1 standard deviation for the average of 4
            determinations.

ANALYSIS   Chain yields were derived from cumulative yields using
           Wahl's charge distribution systematics (A.C.Wahl et al,
           2nd IAEA Symposium on Physics and Chemistry of Fission,
           Vienna, Austria, 28 July-1 August 1969, proceedings,
           page 813).
           Zp and the Gaussian width parameter SIGz of the
           distribution were calculated according to:
           Zp(A) = A/(1+(N/Z)p)
           SIGz(A) = 0.04A/((1+N/Z)p)**2
           where: (N/Z)p = (N/Z)f-0.05
           derived in: A.Goswami et al, J.Phys.26(1986)179
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error given in the DATA table for the chain
           yield is the same as that of the cumulative yield which
           is given as 1 standard deviation of 4 determinations.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,94-PU-241(N,F)MASS,,ZP,,SPA) Zp value
MISC-COL   (MISC) the Gaussian distribution width SIGz(A)
CRITIQUE   by compiler: it is not appropriate to assign the
           statistical errors derived for the cumulative yields
           also to the chain yields, since they were derived from
           charge dispersion systematics using rather crude
           estimates for Zp and the width parameter SIGz. Instead,
           an overall error should have been estimated. Whereas
           the difference is probably insignificant for A=107 (the
           Ru-107 cumulative yield is almost equal to the A=107
           chain yield), it is certainly significant for A=108,
           and particularly for A=109 where the difference is
           fairly large, and the statistical error is unusually
           small and unrealistic for the chain yield.
