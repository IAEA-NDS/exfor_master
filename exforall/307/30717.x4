TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF FISSION CROSS SECTION FOR NP-237 INDUCED
           BY FAST NEUTRON
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP)
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
SAMPLE     ELECTRO-DEPOSITED FOIL OF NP-237, 1.3CM IN DIAMETER,
           0.546 MG IN WEIGHT.
METHOD     FISSION CROSS SECTIONS OF NP-237 WERE MEASURED USING
           A RECOIL PROTON SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR TELESCOPE AND
           FISSION IONIZATION CHAMBER PLACED BACK-TO-BACK SYSTEM.
DETECTOR   (FISCH)
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,N)1-H-1,,SIG) DATA WAS TAKEN FROM NUCL.DATA
           TAB.A9,137(1971)
ERR-ANALYS ERRORS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA ARE MAINLY
            1. 0.5 PER CENT, UNCERTAINTY IN CROSS SECTION FORMULA
           APPROXIMATION.
            2. 1.0 PER CENT, FISSION COUNTING STATISTICS.
            3. 0.5 PER CENT, UNCERTAINTY IN DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
               CORRECTION.
            3. 0.5 PER CENT. UNCERTAINTY IN POLYTHELENE AREA
               DENSITY.
            4. 0.5 PER CENT, UNCERTAINTY IN NP-237 QUANTITY.
            5. 0.1 PER CENT, UNCERTAINTY IN NEUTRON SCATTERING
               CORRECTION.
            6. 0.9 PER CENT, SUM UNCERTAINTY IN GEOMETRY FACTOR
               AND (N,P) DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION.
            7. 1-1.5 PER CENT, UNSTABILITY IN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM
               AND D-D BACKGROUND NEUTRON PRODUCED IN BEAM LINE.
