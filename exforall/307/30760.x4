           long range alpha particle accompanied fission of Cf-252

SAMPLE     Electro-plated Cf-252,dia.6 mm,was used.
METHOD     Gamma-ray detector-semi conductor telescope coincidence
           technique was used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,NAICR,SILI) 55mu-m - dE detector and 3mm - E-det
ADD-RES    This work is to investigate the depindence of the aver-
           age number of the prompt/ gamma rays per fission on the
           triton energy and on the energy of the long range alpha
           particle(LRA) in the spontaneous fission of Cf-252. The
           strong variations of the gamma ray yield with the tri-
           ton energy and with the energy of the lra are observed
           when the light charged particles have low or extreme
           high energy.
