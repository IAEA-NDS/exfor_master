TITLE      Absolute yields of some fission products in the 14 MeV
           neutron induced fission of 238U
FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) FLUX=2.26*10E+9 N/CM2/S
SAMPLE     About 1 mg of solid uarnyl nitrate
METHOD     (ABSFY)'Track-etch-cum-gamma-ray spectrometry' combined
            with absolute fission counting.
           The sample was irradiated together with a monitor tube
            on either side in neutron beam direction.
           (FISCT).Aqueous solution of uranyl nitrate, irradiated
            in a thin glass tube containing the Lexan plastic
            fission detector. Fission tracks were counted with an
            optical microscope. The track density was determined.
           (FPGAM).of the solid sample.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Lexan plastic fission track detector
            The efficiency for track registration in solution has
            been determined by comparison with another Lexan
            detector on which a known amount of solution was
            evaporated.
           (HPGE).,precalibrated,resolution: 2 keV at 1.33 MeV,
            coupled to a multichannel analyser.
            The detector efficiency for the measured fission
            product gamma-rays is given in Table 1 of Nucl.Instr.
            Meth.Phys.Res. B24/25(1987)501.
ANALYSIS   The total number of fissions was derived from the
            fission track density taking into account:
            - weight of the fissile material
            - efficiency for track registration in solution
            - concentration of target material in solution.
            Details are given in Nucl.Instr.Meth.Phys.Res.B24/25
           Fission yields are derived from measured activities
            and total number of fissions using a standard formula
            containing factors for decay during irradiation,
            cooling and data accumulation.
           Compiler's comment: the formula does not account for
            any precursors in decay.

ERR-ANALYS No information
COMMENT    by compiler: the following information pertinent to
           evaluators is missing or insufficient in the paper:
           - exact value of the neutron energy;
           - duration of irradiation, cooling and measurements;
           - analysis of gamma-spectra: interfering peaks,
             uncertainties involved;
           - genetic parent-daughter relationships; details on the
             way yields were obtained;
           - error analysis: types and numerical values of
             different error contributions involved/considered.
CRITIQUE   In the following cases it is unclear what type of yield
           the values represent (or values are doubtful):
           1. Sb-126: shielded by 10E+5 year Sn-126
           2. Sb-128 has a metastable state which is fed by beta
              decay of Sn-128 but decays only to 3.6 % to Sb-128g.
           3. Te-131m is fed only in 6.8 % of Sb-131 beta decays.
              The yield value given seems to be too high for the
              cumulative yield of the metastable state.
           These points need clarification.
