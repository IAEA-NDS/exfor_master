ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors were given at table 1 as follows.
             * 1.0 Per cent, nuclear areal density of fission
                      sample.
             * 0.40%, detected efficiency of fission chamber
             * 0.30%, effects of incident neutron momentum,
                      self-absorption of fragment in sample and
                      anisotropic of fission fragments.
             * 1.0%, nonuniformity of sample.
             * 0.27%,  attenuation of neutron
             * 0.63%,  fission events of non-U-235.
             * 0.3%,  spread of neutron cone.
             * 0.1%.  (n,g) effect
             * 0.2%, charged particle effect.
