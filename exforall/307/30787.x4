FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Swimming pool type reactor APSARA
INC-SPECT  - 1e+13 neutrons/sec/cm2
           - Irradiated for 10 to 30 sec (depending on half-lives
             of fission products and their precursors)
SAMPLE      About 12 ug of plutonium (94.1% of 239Pu) in solution
             form sealed in polypropylene tubes
METHOD     (CHSEP,GSPEC) Technetium was separated at various
            cooling times (40 to 100 sec) as tetraphenyl arsonium
            pertechnate by exchange on a performed precipitate of
            tetraphenyl arsonium chlorate

RESULT    1(FRIND) Fractional independent yield for a given
                   mass chain
ANALYSIS    Since the last members of the mass chains 101, 103,
            and 104 are either long lived or stable, their
            independent formations were assumed to be negligible
            and therefore the fractional independent yields (FIY)
            of 101Tc, 103Tc, and 104Tc were obtained as (1-FCY),
            where FCY refers to the fractional cumulative yield
            of precursor molybdenum. In the case of 105Tc, the
            FIY was obtained from the difference between the FCY's
            of 105Tc and 105Mo with the assumption that the chain
            terminates at 105Rh.
ERR-ANALYS1(DATA-ERR) Standard deviation of average value based
            on 3 independent measurements. The following sources
            were taken into account:
            - chemical yield;
            - separation time;
            - counting statistics.
