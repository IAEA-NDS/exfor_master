TITLE      Neutron capture cross section measurement of Th-232 in
            the energy range of 400-950 keV

           (P,BARC-1239,19,1984)  En=450-1100 keV, no data given
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM) 5.5 MV Van-de-Graaff
SAMPLE     The Th-oxide target in form of discs of ~14 mm (diam)
            and 2 mm (thick) along with two thin Au foils
            (0.013 mm thick) of the same diameter, placed on
            either side.
           The Th+Au targets were enclosed in a cadmium box.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           - Activation method was employed in which the gammas
             emitted from the decay of the Th-233 were measured.
           - The cross sections were measured relative to the
             neutron capture cross sections of Au-197.
           - These relative measurements were normalized to their
             respective thermal neutron capture cross sections by
             irradiating the same samples (using the same geom.)
             of Th and Au with the thermal neutrons at the
             thermal column of the CIRUS reactor.
ANALYSIS   The photopeak area of 459 keV g-ray was extracted with
            the computer code SAMPO, which fits each gamma-ray
            with Gaussian + two exponentials.
           The fitting parameters for the code were determined by
            using standard monoenerg. gamma-sources.

           The ratio of the capture cross section of Th and Au at
            thermal neutron energy was used as monitor.
           The values of the thermal neutron capture cross section
           used were: 7.40 +/- 0.08 barn for Th-232
                      98.8 +/- 0.3  barn for Au-197

             The capture cross sections of 197-Au in the keV
             energy range were taken from standard cross sections
             recommended by IAEA.
