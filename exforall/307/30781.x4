           FOILS(0.013 MM THICK) OF THE SAME DIAMETER, PLACED ON
           EITHER SIDE. THE TH+AU TARGETS WERE ENCLOSED IN A

           THE RATIO OF THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF TH AND AU AT

METHOD     (ACTIV)
           -ACTIVATION METHOD WAS EMPLOYED IN WHICH THE GAMMAS
            EMITTED FROM THE DECAY OF THE TH-233 WERE MEASURED
           -THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE MEASURED RELATIVE TO THE
            NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS OF AU-197
           -THESE RELATIVE MEASUREMENTS WERE NORMALIZED TO THEIR
            RESPECTIVE THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS BY
            IRRADIATING THE SAME SAMPLES (USING THE SAME GEOM.)
            OF TH AND AU WITH THE THERMAL NEUTRONS AT THE THERMAL
            COLUMN OF THE CIRUS REACTOR.THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS
            OF 197-AU IN THE KEV ENERGY RANGE WERE TAKEN FROM
            STANDARD CROSS SECTIONS RECOMMENDED BY IAEA.

                  TED WITH THE COMPUTER CODE 'SAMPO', WHICH FITS
                  EACH G-RAY WITH GAUSSIAN + 2 EXPL). THE FITTING
                  PARAMETERS FOR THE CODE WERE DETERMINED BY USING
                  STANDARD MONOEN  G-SOURCES.
