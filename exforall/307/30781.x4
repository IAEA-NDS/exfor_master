FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM) 5.5 MeV accelerator
SAMPLE     - The Th-oxide target in form of discs (~14 mm diam.,
            2 mm thick).
           - Two thin Au foils (0.013 mm thick, ~14 mm diam.)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100 cm3
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           - Activation method was employed in which the gammas
             emitted from the decay of the Th-233 were measured.
           - The cross sections were measured relative to the
             neutron capture cross sections of Au-197.
ANALYSIS   The photopeak area of 459 keV g-ray was extracted with
            the computer code SAMPO, which fits each gamma-ray
            with Gaussian + two exponentials.
           The fitting parameters for the code were determined by
            using standard monoenerg. gamma-sources.

           The ratio of the capture cross section of Th and Au at
            thermal neutron energy was used as monitor.
           The values of the thermal neutron capture cross section
           used were: 7.40 +/- 0.08 barn for Th-232
                      98.8 +/- 0.3  barn for Au-197

             The capture cross sections of 197-Au in the keV
             energy range were taken from standard cross sections
             recommended by IAEA.

              This correction factor was found to be less than 6%.

              beam for Li target thickness. The neutron spread
              due this was calcu. to be varying from +/-15 to
              +/- 25 keV
           5. The energy spread due to the angular spread of
              neutrons. This was estimated to be about +/- 17 keV.

            cross sections of 232-Th and 197-Au:          (<1%)
CRITIQUE   The present measurements are in good agreement with the
            other recent measurements and deviations are within
            experimental errors up to En=740keV.
