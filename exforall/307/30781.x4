           (P,BARC-1239,19,198406) measured in neutron energy
                          range  of 450-1100 keV. No data given.
SAMPLE     The Th-oxide target in form of discs of 14 mm dia.
           approx., and thickness of 2mm along with two thin gold
           foils(0.013 mm thick) of the same diameter, placed on
           either side. The Th+Au targets were enclosed in a
           cadmium box.

           The ratio of the capture cross section of Th and Au at
           thermal neutron energy was used as monitor
           The values of the thermal neutron capture cross section
           used were: 7.40+-0.08 barn for Th-232
                      98.8+-0.3  barn for Au-197

METHOD     (ACTIV)
           -Activation method was employed in which the gammas
            emitted from the decay of the Th-233 were measured
           -The cross sections were measured relative to the
            neutron capture cross sections of Au-197
           -These relative measurements were normalized to their
            respective thermal neutron capture cross sections by
            irradiating the same samples (using the same geom.)
            of Th and Au with the thermal neutrons at the thermal
            column of the CIRUS reactor.The capture cross sections
            of 197-Au in the keV energy range were taken from
            standard cross sections recommended by IAEA.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Approx. 100 cm3 Ge(Li) detector.
           (BF3) Long counter for monitoring the neutron flux.

ANALYSIS   (AREA) The photopeak area of 459 keV g-ray was extrac-
                  ted with the computer code 'SAMPO', which fits
                  each gamma-ray with Gaussian + 2 expl). The
                  fitting parameters for the code were determined
                  by using standard monoenerg. gamma-sources.

           2.-The effect of the variation of neutron flux as a
              function of time was taken into consideration.
              This corr. factor was found to be less than  6%
           3.-Second group of neutrons  due  E(protons)> 2.4 MeV
              the estimated error due to this  corr  < +- 1 %
           4.-The average energy and the spread of the neutron
              beam for Li target thickness.
              The neutron spread due this was calcu. to be
              variying from +-15 to +- 25 keV
           5.-The energy spread due to the angular spread of
              neutrons.This was estimated to be about +- 17 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty was estimated
           to be :   5-6 %
           Uncertainty includes following sources of errors:
           (DATA-ERR,1.,4.) The statistical and fitting error
             in the determining the photopeak areas of the
             459 and 412 keV gammas by 'SAMPO':(for keV) 2 to 4%
                                               (for thermal) <1%
           (ERR-1,2.,) The uncertainty due the self-shielding
             and multiple scatt. :                           <2%
           (ERR-2,1.,) The uncertainty on the thermal capture
             cross sections of 232-Th and 197-Au:            <1%
CRITIQUE   The present measurements are in good agreement with the
           other recent measurements and deviations are within
           experimental errors up to En=740keV
