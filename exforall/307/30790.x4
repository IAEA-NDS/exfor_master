TITLE      Independent yield of 88Y from thermal neutron induced
           fission of 235U
AUTHOR     (Sun Jianguo,Guo Jingru,Wang Fangding)
INSTITUTE  (3CPRAEP)
REFERENCE  (J,JRN/L,108,347,198703)
SAMPLE     Weight:0.3 g; composition: 15% metallic Mg, 85% U02
           enriched to 10% U-235
FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) swimming-pool type
INC-SPECT  thermal neutron flux = 10**12 n/cm2/sec;
           irradiation time: 10 days.
METHOD     (RCHEM)after about 1 month cooling time
           (GSPEC)sample placed in 1 g/cm2 polyethylene container
           to reduce bremsstrahlung.
           3 hour live-time counting repeated 34 time (total: 102
           hours counting time)
DETECTOR   (GELI)of 130 cm3, resolution: 2 keV at 1332 keV, with
           Canberra 2001 preamplifier, Canberra 2010 amplifier,
           Canberra SCORPIO-3000 multichannel analyzer system.
           (SCIN) FH-1914 beta plastic scintillator for measuring
           the activity of the Y-91 monitor.
ANALYSIS   Program library SPAL used for automatic peak search,
           energy calibration and photopeak area determination.
           Counting efficiency determined with Y-88 standard,
           which was also used for continuous check of stability.
CORRECTION made for counting efficiency, decay during irradiation
           and cooling time and degree of saturation.

            (1984).
ANALYSIS   No peak was seen in the fission product spectrum. The
           upper limit was derived from the background count rate
           in the energy range where the Y-88 gamma-ray peak
           should be.
