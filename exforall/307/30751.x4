SAMPLE     Natural metallic uranium, disk shaped foils of 16 mm
           diameter, sealed in 0.2 mm aluminum foil.             3
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Double-fission chamber containing standardized
           thin deposits of U-238, attached to the sample.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutron flux = 2. X 10**7 n/cm2/s.
           The background of low energy neutrons (2-6 MeV) is less
           than 3.5 %.
COMMENT    With the results of both methods,
             70.45 % of the yields in the light mass peak, and
             74.133 % of the yields in the heavy mass peak
           have been measured. Together with interpolated and
           extrapolated chain yields, the sums of yield in the
           light and heavy mass peak are 101.52 and 100.28 % per
           fission respectively.
           The average mass derived is:
               97.3 for the light mass peak, and
              138.3 for the heavy mass peak.
           From these data, nu-bar = 3.4+/-0.2 is derived.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)MASS,CHN,FY)
METHOD     (FPGAM) Direct gamma-ray spectroscopy of unseparated
             fission products
           Irradiation: 30 min to 2 hrs for short lived,
             5 to 25 hrs for long lived fission products.
           Cooling time: no information
           Measurements: repeated, following 2-4 half-lives decay
               of fission products.
             Of 13 samples, 217 spectra were taken altogether.
             Each spectrum was recorded for about:
               15 minutes for short lived fission products,
               1-2 hours for long lived fission products.
           Chain yields were derived from measured cumulative
             yields.
SAMPLE     13 Samples weighing 0.6-1.5 grams
DETECTOR   (GELI) 130 cm3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector resolution:
           1.85 keV (FWHM) at 1332.5 keV Scorpio-3000
           multichannel analysis computer system Detector
           efficiency calibration by 4-Pi beta-gamma coincidence
           technique using the following sources: Am-241,Nd-147,
           Ce-144,Ce-141,Mo-99,Ag-111,Na-22, Cs-137,Zr-95,Sc-46,
           Co-60 and Ta-182. Uncertainty of efficiency curve:
           4.2% below 264.6 keV and 2.4% above.
ANALYSIS   Standard equations for production and decay of fission
             products including parent-daughter relationships were
             used to deduce cumulative fission yields.
           Chain yields were derived from cumulative yields by
             correcting for the difference using published
             empirical fractional yields (see 'CORRECTION')
CORRECTION of recorded gamma-ray spectra applied for:
             Gamma-ray self absorption in sample
             Pulse pile-up in detector-analyser system
             Sum-peaks from chance coincident cascade gamma-rays
           Correction for the difference between total chain yield
             and measured cumulative yield:
             The data and semiempirical formula of D.R.Nethaway,
               UCRL-51640 (1974), was used to calculate the ratio
                            YB/YA
               where:  YB=independent yield of measured product
                       YA=cumulative yield of its precursor
             The corrections applied were less than 2% except for
               I-134,where it was 8%.
           Compiler's  comment:
             The semiempirical formula given in UCRL-51640 can be
             used to derive Zp-values for incident neutron
             energies not tabulated. Fractional yields can be
             obtained from Tables for given values of Z-Zp.
           No explanation is given on how chain yields
             were derived using the ratio YB/YA defined above.
           Also,from fractional yields tabulated in UCRL-51640,the
             8% correction for I-134 is doubtful. On the other
            hand, the correction for Sn-128 should be significant.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)MASS,CHN,FY)
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation of fission products
             which were then measured by beta- or gamma-ray
             detection.
           No information given on irradiation,cooling time and
             duration of measurements (data accumulation).
           Decay of fission products was followed 2-4 half lives.
           Chain yields were derived from cumulative yields.
SAMPLE     32 Samples weighing 0.6-3 grams
DETECTOR   Low background level (2-3 cpm) beta-detector FH-1914
           (SCIN)  FH-1906 (low background) for gamma-rays
           Detector efficiency calibration standards with radiat-
             ion energy and source thickness similar to the
             measured samples were used. If this was not possible
             corrections (see there) were applied.
ANALYSIS   Activities of individual fission products were measured
             and standard equations for production and decay
             including parent-daughter relationships were used to
             obtain cumulative fission yields.
           Relative measurements (using the 'internal calibration'
             method: see 'CORRECTION') were performed for:
             Br-83,Br-84,Ru-103,Ru-106,Pd-109,Pd-112,Cd-115-g+m,
             Sb-127,I-131 and Tb-161.
           Isomeric yields: both isomers of Cd-115 were measured,
             published isomeric yield ratios were used for Ag-113
             and Sn-151. No information is given for other fission
             products having isomers (Br-84,Ag-111)
           Chain yields were derived from cumulative yields by
             correcting for the difference using published
             empirical fractional yields.
ASSUMED    Isomeric yield ratios r=(g+m)/g were taken as
             r(Ag-113)=1.35+/-0.14     r(Sn-121)=1.16+/-0.11
           from: S.Nagy et al, Phys.Rev. C17(1978)163.
CORRECTION For differences in thickness between calibration source
             and measured sample by using calibration curves
             (compiler assumes: of absorption versus thickness)
           For differences in radiation energy: the 'internal
             calibration' method using radiations of different
             energy from the same source or sample for relative
             efficiency calibration.
           Yields determined this way are regarded as relative
             by the authors (assumed by the compiler)
           Correction for the difference between total chain yield
             and measured cumulative yield: the data and semi-
             empirical formula of D.R.Nethaway, UCRL-51640 (1978)
             was used.

COMMENT    by compiler:
           1.)The main publication does not explicitly state the
              connection between relative yields and 'internal
              calibration' method, but the fission products listed
              are identical except for Eu-156.
           2.)It is not mentioned, how the internal calibration is
              performed in beta-ray measurements.
           3.)In the main reference it is mentioned that the decay
              data used in the analysis of data from the radio-
              chemical method can be found in
              He Huaxue, Yu Fangshe, Hua Xue (J.Nuclear and Radio-
                chemistry, China) 7(1985)1.( see Exfor30743)
              However,in this publication no decay data are given,
              only the method (beta- or gamma-ray measurement)
              used for the different fission products.
              Therefore the compiler assumes that the method given
              there is also used in the present work.
              For the decay data, those given for the direct
              gamma-spectrometric method are used, if available.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)50-SN-125-G,CUM,FY)
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation of fission products,
             beta-ray measurement
           No information given on times for irradiation,cooling
             and measurement
           The decay was followed for 2-4 half-lives
SAMPLE     Weight: 0.6-3 grams
DETECTOR   Low background level (2-3 cpm) beta detector FH-1914
           calibrated using sources of the same dimensions as the
             sample and emitting beta-rays of similar energy.
           No further details given.
CORRECTION No information
DECAY-DATA No information
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Random error (counting statistics,averaging of
                   several determinations)
           (ERR-1) Error of fission rate determination
           (ERR-2) Error of detector efficiency
           (ERR-T) Total relative error,including only errors
                   given above.
COMMENT    Partial cumulative yield of 1 isomer (presumably the
           ground state)
           By compiler: The information given is insufficient.
           It was assumed from a previous publication (see
           Exfor30743) cited in the main reference (as ref.No.7),
           that the method applied here was also beta-ray
           detection.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA and DATA-ERR from Table 2,
           relative errors from Table 4 of the main reference
