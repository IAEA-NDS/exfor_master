COMMENT    WITH THE RESULTS OF BOTH METHODS,
             70.45 % OF THE YIELDS IN THE LIGHT MASS PEAK,AND
             74.133 % OF THE YIELDS IN THE HEAVY MASS PEAK
           HAVE BEEN MEASURED.TOGETHER WITH INTERPOLATED AND
           EXTRAPOLATED CHAIN YIELDS,THE SUMS OF YIELD IN THE
           LIGHT AND HEAVY MASS PEAK ARE 101.52 AND 100.28 % PER
           FISSION RESPECTIVELY.
           THE AVERAGE MASS DERIVED IS:
               97.3 FOR THE LIGHT MASS PEAK, AND
              138.3 FOR THE HEAVY MASS PEAK.
           FROM THESE DATA, NU-BAR=3.4+-0.2 IS DERIVED.

METHOD     DIRECT GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF UNSEPARATED FISSION
             PRODUCTS
           IRRADIATION: 30 MIN TO 2 HRS FOR SHORT LIVED,
             5 TO 25 HRS FOR LONG LIVED FISSION PRODUCTS.
           COOLING TIME: NO INFORMATION
           MEASUREMENTS: REPEATED,FOLLOWING 2-4 HALF-LIVES DECAY
               OF FISSION PRODUCTS.
             OF 13 SAMPLES,217 SPECTRA WERE TAKEN ALTOGETHER.
             EACH SPECTRUM WAS RECORDED FOR ABOUT:
               15 MINUTES FOR SHORT LIVED FISSION PRODUCTS,
               1-2 HOURS FOR LONG LIVED FISSION PRODUCTS.
           CHAIN YIELDS WERE DERIVED FROM MEASURED CUMULATIVE
             YIELDS.
SAMPLE     13 SAMPLES WEIGHING 0.6-1.5 GRAMS

              CS-137,ZR-95,SC-46,CO-60 AND TA-182.
             UNCERTAINTY OF EFFICIENCY CURVE: 4.2% BELOW 264.6 KEV
              AND 2.4% ABOVE.
ANALYSIS   GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA WERE ANALYSED AND PHOTO-PEAK AREAS
             DETERMINED.
           STANDARD EQUATIONS FOR PRODUCTION AND DECAY OF FISSION
             PRODUCTS INCLUDING PARENT-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIPS WERE
             USED TO DEDUCE CUMULATIVE FISSION YIELDS.
           CHAIN YIELDS WERE DERIVED FROM CUMULATIVE YIELDS BY
             CORRECTING FOR THE DIFFERENCE USING PUBLISHED
             EMPIRICAL FRACTIONAL YIELDS (SEE 'CORRECTION')
CORRECTION OF RECORDED GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA APPLIED FOR:
             GAMMA-RAY SELF ABSORPTION IN SAMPLE
             PULSE PILE-UP IN DETECTOR-ANALYSER SYSTEM
             SUM-PEAKS FROM CHANCE COINCIDENT CASCADE GAMMA-RAYS
           CORRECTION FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL CHAIN YIELD
             AND MEASURED CUMULATIVE YIELD:
             THE DATA AND SEMIEMPIRICAL FORMULA OF D.R.NETHAWAY,
               UCRL-51640 (1974), WAS USED TO CALCULATE THE RATIO
                            YB/YA
               WHERE:  YB=INDEPENDENT YIELD OF MEASURED PRODUCT
                       YA=CUMULATIVE YIELD OF ITS PRECURSOR
             THE CORRECTIONS APPLIED WERE LESS THAN 2% EXCEPT FOR
               I-134,WHERE IT WAS 8%.
           COMPILER'S  COMMENT:
             THE SEMIEMPIRICAL FORMULA GIVEN IN UCRL-51640 CAN BE
             USED TO DERIVE ZP-VALUES FOR INCIDENT NEUTRON
             ENERGIES NOT TABULATED.FRACTIONAL YIELDS CAN BE
             OBTAINED FROM TABLES FOR GIVEN VALUES OF Z-ZP.
           CLARIFICATION BY THE AUTHORS IS NEEDED, HOW CHAIN YIELD
             WERE DERIVED USING THE RATIO YB/YA DEFINED ABOVE.
           ALSO,FROM FRACTIONAL YIELDS TABULATED IN UCRL-51640,THE
             8% CORRECTION FOR I-134 IS DOUBTFUL.ON THE OTHER
             HAND,THE CORRECTION FOR SN-128 SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

COMMENT    BY COMPILER
           1.)THE MAIN PUBLICATION DOES NOT EXPLICITLY  STATE THE
              CONNECTION BETWEEN RELATIVE YIELDS AND 'INTERNAL
              CALIBRATION' METHOD,BUT THE FISSION PRODUCTS LISTED
              ARE IDENTICAL EXCEPT FOR EU-156.
           2.)IT IS NOT MENTIONED,HOW THE INTERNAL CALIBRATION IS
              PERFORMED IN BETA-RAY MEASUREMENTS.
           3.)IN THE MAIN REFERENCE IT IS MENTIONED THAT THE DECAY
              DATA USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE RADIO-
              CHEMICAL METHOD CAN BE FOUND IN
              HE HUAXUE YU FANGSHE HUAXUE (J.NUCLEAR AND RADIO-
                CHEMISTRY,CHINA) 7(1985)1.(SEE EXFOR30743)
              HOWEVER,IN THIS PUBLICATION NO DECAY DATA ARE GIVEN,
              ONLY THE METHOD (BETA- OR GAMMA-RAY MEASUREMENT)

              THEREFORE THE COMPILER ASSUMES THAT THE METHOD GIVEN
              THERE IS ALSO USED IN THE PRESENT WORK.
              FOR THE DECAY DATA,THOSE GIVEN FOR THE DIRECT
