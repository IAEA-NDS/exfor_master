INC-SOURCE THE NEUTRONS ORIGINATED FROM THE REACTOR CORE ARE
           SLOWED DOWN IN A GRAPHITE THERMAL COLUMN AND COLLIMATED
           THE COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM IMPINGES ON A 235-U FISSION
           PLATE AND PRODUCES FAST FISSION NEUTRONS WHICH ARE USED
           AS SOURCE TO HIT THE SAMPLE
SAMPLE     SIX FISSIONABLE DEPOSITS WERE USED AS SAMPLES.THE
           DEPOSITS WERE 20-MM-DIAM VACUUM EVAPORATED ON BACKINGS
           OF 32 MM DIAM POLISHED PLATINUM 0.125 MM THICK.THE MASS
           ASSAY OF THE DEPOSITS IS AS FOLLOWS

           THE ISOTOPIC CONCENTRATION OF THE DEPOSITS UT-51,UT-52
           AND UT-53 IS AS FOLLOWS
                         1.179 % OF 234-U
                        93.197 % OF 235-U
                         0.250 % OF 236-U
                         5.435 % OF 238-U
           THE ISOTOPIC CONCENTRATION OF THE DEPOSITS UT-81,UT-82
           AND UT-83 IS AS FOLLOWS
                         0.005 % OF 235-U

INC-SPECT  THE INCIDENT-PROJECTILE BEAM IS A PRODUCT OF THE
           REACTION 235-U(N,F) AS EXPLAINED UNDER INC-SOURCE
DETECTOR   12 MAKROFOL SOLID STATE NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTORS WERE
           USED. SIX OF THE MAKROFOL FILMS WERE 0.025 MM THICK
            (THIN FILMS) AND THE REST WERE 0.06 MM THICK (THICK
           FILMS)
METHOD     THE 235-U/238-U FISSION CROSS SECTION RATIO WAS
           MEASURED IN THE FAST NEUTRON FIELD USING MAKROFOL
           SOLID STATE NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTORS.THE TRACK DETECTORS
           WERE IRRADIATED WITH THE UT ENRICHED AND DEPLETED
           DEPOSITS, AND AFTER THE ETCHING THEY WERE COUNTED BY AN
           OPTICAL MICROSCOPE
CORRECTION THE CORRECTIONS APPLIED TO THE ISOTOPIC FISSION TARES
           INCLUDE THE ABSORPTION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS IN THE
           DEPOSITS, FISSION IN OTHER ISOTOPES WHERE THE
           CORRECTIONS ARE 0.9863 AND 0.9998 FOR 235-U AND 238-U
           RESPECTIVELY,NEUTRON SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION AND FLUX

ERR-ANALYS THE COMBINED UNCERTAINTY ASCRIBED TO THE OBSERVED
           NUMBER OF TRACKS PER UNIT AREA ARISES FROM THE POSSIBLE
           SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WHICH ARE TRACK COUNTING
           STATISTICS,BACKGROUND,EXPOSURE TIMING,IRRADIATION
           POSITIONING,IMPERFECT CONTACT BETWEEN DEPOSIT AND THE
           SOLID STATE NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTOR,RADIAL UNIFORMITY OF
           THE FISSION SOURCES AND CALIBRATION OF THE MICROSCOPE
           FIELD OF VIEW.OTHER POSSIBLE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS SUCH AS
           INTEGRITY OF THE DEPOSITS,FLUX PERTURBATION BY THE
           SPECIMEN HOLDER,TRACK OVERLAP,VARIATION OF TRACK
           DENSITY WITH ETCHING TIME AND TEMPERATURE AND
           UNCERTAINTY IN THE ETCHANT CONCENTRATION ARE ALL
           ASSUMED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSIGNED TO
           THE 235-U/238-U FISSION RATIOS INCLUDE UNCERTAINTIES IN
           MASS PER UNIT AREA(MASS ASSAY ERRORS,DEPOSIT AREA),
           UNCERTAINTIES IN CORRECTIONS(SEE UNDER CORRECTION) AND
           UNCERTAINTIES IN COUNT RATIOS
COMMENT    THE FOLLOWING VALUES OF THE 235-U/238-U FISSION CROSS
           SECTION RATIO SHOW THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT
           DIFFERENCE WITH THE THIN AND THE THICK FILMS
