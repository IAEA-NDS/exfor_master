INC-SOURCE The neutrons originated from the reactor core are
           slowed down in a graphite thermal column and collimated
           The collimated neutron beam impinges on a 235-U fission
           plate and produces fast fission neutrons which are used
           as source to hit the sample
SAMPLE     Six fissionable deposits were used as samples.The
           deposits were 20-mm-diam vacuum evaporated on backings
           of 32 mm diam polished platinum 0.125 mm thick.The mass
           assay of the deposits is as follows:
           Foil            Principal   Mass of
           identification  isotope     principal isotope
           UT-51           235-U       79.7  +- 0.4
           UT-52           235-U       264.8 +- 1.3
           UT-53           235-U       729.5 +- 4.0
           UT-81           238-U       81.9  +- 2.5
           UT-82           238-U       276.1 +- 8.3
           UT-83           238-U       777.0 +- 23.0
           The isotopic concentration of the deposits UT-51,UT-52
           and UT-53 is as follows
                         1.179 % of 234-U
                        93.197 % of 235-U
                         0.250 % of 236-U
                         5.435 % of 238-U
           The isotopic concentration of the deposits UT-81,UT-82
           and UT-83 is as follows
                         0.005 % of 235-U
                        99.995 % of 238-U
INC-SPECT  The incident-projectile beam is a product of the
           reaction 235-U(n,f) as explained under INC-SOURCE
DETECTOR   (TRD) 12 Makrofol solid state nuclear track
           detectors were used. Six of the Makrofol films were
           0.025 mm thick (thin films) and the rest were 0.06 mm
           thick (thick  films)
METHOD     The 235-U/238-U fission cross section ratio was
           measured in the fast neutron field using Makrofol
           solid state nuclear track detectors.The track detectors
           were irradiated with the UT enriched and depleted
           deposits, and after the etching they were counted by an
           optical microscope
CORRECTION The corrections applied to the isotopic fission rates
           include the absorption of fission fragments in the
           deposits, fission in other isotopes where the
           corrections are 0.9863 and 0.9998 for 235-U and 238-U
           respectively,neutron scattering and absorption and flux
           perturbation caused by the hydrogen in the Makrofol
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The combined uncertainty ascribed to the
           observed number of tracks per unit area arises from
           the possible sources of systematic errors which are
           track counting statistics,background,exposure
           timing,irradiation positioning,imperfect contact
           between deposit and the solid state nuclear track
           detector,radial uniformity of the fission sources
           and calibration of the microscope field of view.
           Other possible systematic errors such as integrity
           of the deposits,flux perturbation by the specimen
           holder, track overlap, variation of track density
           with etching time and temperature and uncertainty
           in the etchant concentration are all assumed to be
           negligible. The uncertainties assigned to the
           235-U/238-U fission ratios include uncertainties in
           mass per unit area(mass assay errors, deposit area),
           uncertainties in corrections  (see under correction)
           and uncertainties in count ratios
COMMENT    The following values of the 235-U/238-U fission cross
           section ratio show that there is no significant
           difference with the thin and the thick films.
