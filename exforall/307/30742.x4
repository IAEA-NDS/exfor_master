TITLE      Fast neutron cross sections on Zr isotopes
FACILITY   (VDG,3POLIBJ)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuterons have been accelerated to 440 keV and to
           990 keV in order to obtain monoenergetic neutrons
SAMPLE     consisted  of metallic Zr cylinders
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were analysed in terms of the compound
           nucleus decay and pre-equilibrium emission.The standard
           angular momentum dependent Hauser-Feshbach theory and
           an angular momentum dependent version of the hybrid
           model were used for analysing the evaporation spectra
           and the spectra of particles emitted prior to the
           formation of compound nucleus,respectively. The
           parametrisation of the calculations was based on the
           global optical potentials of Moldauer for neutrons,
           those of Bjorklund and Fernbach for protons and of
           Mc Fadden and Satchler for alphas.
MONITOR    the neutron flux was monitored by irradiation of iron
           samples in the same geometry but in separate
           accelerator runs
STATUS     Data taken from priv.Comm.Marcinkowski 20 May 1986.

ERR-ANALYS the errors contain the statistical and systematic
           errors.The latter ones consist mainly of the error of
           the reference reaction,estimated to about 5%,and of
           the uncertainty in the integration of the pulse height
           spectrum,which amounts up to 10 % for the weakest
           gamma-ray lines
