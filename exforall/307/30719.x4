TITLE      RESEARCH OF PROMPT NEUTRONS FROM CF-252 SPONTANEOUS
           FISSION FRAGMENT
METHOD     SELF-TRANSFERRED SOURCE OF CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION.
           FISSION FRAGMENTS DETECTED BY AU-SI DETECTORS.FISSION
           NEUTRONS DETECTED BY GD-LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR,(60C
           IN DIAMETER).BY USING A THREE-PARAMETER CORRELATION
           MEASUREMENT,THE VARIATIONS OF AVERAGE NEUTRON NUMBER
           RELATED WITH THE FRAGMENT MASS AND TOTAL KINETIC ENERGY
           ARE OBTAINED. AVERAGE MASS RESOLUTION IS 5.3U.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU)  DATA TAKEN FROM PHYS.REV. 141,
           1146 (1966).
ADD-RES    THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO CONFIRM EVEN-ODD EFFECT IN
           THE NU-A DISTRIBUTION.BUT THIS EFFECT HAS NOT YET BEEN
           OBSERVED,BECAUSE MASS RESOLUTION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
STATUS     GRAPHICAL RESULTS WERE GIVEN.NO NUMERICAL DATA  ARE
           AVAILABLE FROM PUBLICATION.
HISTORY    (861006) -WD-
           (870205U)-WD-NEW REFERENCE ADDED-
ERR-ANALYS 2.3*10+6 EFFECTIVE EVENTS WERE COLLECTED.CORRECTIONS
           FOR HALL BACKGROUND NEUTRON AND SCISSION NEUTRON  WERE
           MADE.
