           for the fast neutron induced fission of U-238.

REFERENCE  (J,JRN,81,29,198401) Experimental details, mass chain

            and analysis, relative and fractional iodine yields
           (P,INDC(BUL)-5,1,198105)very brief information, no data
FACILITY   (REAC,3BULBLA)
INC-SPECT  Reactor pile spectrum, sample wrapped in cadmium foil
           to reduce thermal neutron component;
           neutron flux = 10**11 neutrons/cm2/s
SAMPLE     500 mg containg natural uranium as UO2(NO3)2
METHOD     5 samples, each irradiated for 10 min
           (RCHEM) performed at fixed separation times of  8, 30,
            75, 261 and 1177 min after the end of irradiation.
            Purified iodine precipitated as AgI, filtered,
            enclosed in polyethylene and covered with Al-foil for
            counting.
           (GSPEC) of separated samples at varying cooling times
            after the fixed separation times.
DETECTOR   (GELI) of 26 cm3 coupled to 4000-channel analyzer
ANALYSIS   Equations for growth and decay were set up describing
           the genetic relationships beween fission products in
           the investigated mass chains A=131-135.
           Genetic relationships: for A=131 see SE3: DECAY DATA;
           for A=132-135 they were taken from R.W. Parsons and
           H.D. Sharma, J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem. 36(1974)2392.
           Independent yields were derived by least squares
           analysis of curves obtained from different samples at
           different separation times.
CORRECTION For decay and buildup as described above.No corrections
           necessary for chemical yield as all activities were in
           the same samples for a given run.
ERR-ANALYS The data are averages of 4-16 determinations. No
           information is given on the derivation of errors.
HISTORY    (20010330C) ML.

MONITOR    Compiler's note:
           All yields were determined relative to the cumulative
           yield of I-235. However, the absolute yield of I-235
           was obtained in this experiment via a fit of the
           relative derived chain yields for A=132 and A=134 to
           the absolute chain yields from the evaluation of
           E.A.C. Crouch, At.Data.Nucl.Data Tables 19(1977)417.
           Therefore the reference yield for I-135 is included in
           the data table.

           The origin of the decay data for I-135 is not given.
           Compiler's note: the latter differ from those given in
           subentry 2.

                      DG,1260.4,0.29)
           For decay chains A=132-134 the decay data given in
           subentry 2 were used (for genetic relationships see
           also subentry 1 under ANALYSIS).
STATUS     Data taken from Table 3 of J.Rad.Nucl.Chem. 81(1984)29
           (DEP,30767002) ratios to I-135 cumulative yield: the
           independent yields of I-132,3,4 in the data table are
           calculated by multiplying the corresponding relative
           yields in 30767002 by the I-135 cumulative yield.
