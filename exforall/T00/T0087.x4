TITLE      Excitation function for 22Na from deuterons on
            aluminium
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) 184-inch cyclotron
SAMPLE     Aluminium foils targets, 0.002-inch thick.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (ACTIV) 15-30 minute irradiations.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . air and water absorption of 22Na and 24Na,
           . self-absorption and self-scattering,
           . backscattering.
           Due to an appreciable flux of neutrons with sufficient
            energy to cause the 27Al(n,alpha)24Na reaction, 24Na
            data is too high below 50 MeV, therefore, the 22Na
            low energy data represent only a guess.
