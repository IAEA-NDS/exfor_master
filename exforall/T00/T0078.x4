TITLE      Survey of the (3He,t) reaction: Excitation of the
            isobaric analog of the giant dipole resonance
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMRY)
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,GE-IN) For the 130 MeV, experiment the
            tritons were detected and identified with a 1 mm
            thick Si surface barrier dE detector and a 15-mm thick
            Ortec high-purity Ge E detector.
           (TELES,GE-IN,GE-IN) The experiment at 170 MeV used a
            stack of two 13-mm thick high-purity Ge detectors
COMMENT    Since this experiment was planned as a target survey,
           only a few angles were measured for each target.
           Those fragmentary angular distributions are shown in
           Fig. 8 to give the reader an idea of the size
           of the cross sections. => in REACTION code SF8=MSC.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-DIG) Digitizing error for data 5%.
           (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in the cross section value,
            mainly due to uncertainty in determining background.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by S.L. Tabor, 16 April 2001.
