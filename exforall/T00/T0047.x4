TITLE      Measurement of the Ground-State Gamma-Ray Branching
            Ratio of the dt Reaction at Low Energies
FACILITY   (CCW,1USACSM)
SAMPLE     Thick metallic tritiated target.
METHOD     (COINC,PSD) Pair coincidence spectrometry and pulse
           shape-discrimination were used
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7.6-cm x 7.6-cm cylindrical 'plug' detector
            surrounded by an axially split NaI(Tl) annulus in
            anticoincidence mode used to detect gammas.
           (SIBAR) The detector consisted of a 1-mm-thick silicon
            detector which was fixed at an angle 135. degr.
            relative to the forward beam direction and was
            protected from the back-angle elastically deuterons
            by a 2-mg/cm2 aluminum foil.
MONITOR    Detection efficiency measured using 11B(p,gamma) and
            11B(p,alpha) reactions at 163 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS)  Systematic uncertainty of about 20%
             primarily due to the reported error in the branching
             ratio of the 11B(p,gamma)/11B(p,alpha) reactions
             which was used to determine the efficiency in the
             present measurement.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by E. Cecil, 8 March 2000.
HISTORY    (20000224C) Transferred from data set A1245, produced
            by Arzamas RFNC-VNIIEF, and updated.
           (20001219A) Reference update.
           (20120317A) SD: REACTION code in Subent 002 corrected:
             SF6=MLT, SF8=TT were added instead of SF6=SIG.
             ERR-ANALYS was corrected.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR-DIG) Digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR) The error bars indicated in Fig. 2 are
             purely relative counting errors. Error given also
             includes digitizing error.
