FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) Experiment performed at 4.5 MV tandem
           accelerator at Edwards Accelerator Laboratory.
SAMPLE     Heavy water D2O samples enclosed in plastic
           containers having shapes of a truncated cone were
           used. Weight of heavy water was 65.5 g, the container
           weight was 3.2 g. For background measurement a normal
           water H2O sample with weight of 59 g in the same
           container was used. The actual weight was determined
           before each measurement.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A NE213 liquid scintillator detector with
           diameter of 5 inch and thickness of 2 inch was placed
           in the tunel at a distance of 8 m from the scattering
           sample. Detector threshold for neutrons was about 1
           MeV.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD)
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)

INC-SOURCE (D-T) For neutron production a D-T reaction was used
           with a tritiated titanium target and 0.5 MeV pulsed
           deuteron beam from the tandem accelerator The
           reaction produced 15.1 MeV neutrons at 0 deg in
           laboratory frame.
CORRECTION Data were corrected using MCNP code for
            - scattering of neutrons on oxygen in sample
            - multiple scattering in the sample
            - multiple scattering of neutrons in whole
              experimental setup
