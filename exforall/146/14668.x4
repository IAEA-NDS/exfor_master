FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USAWIS) The concentric electrode electrostatic
           generator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The protons were accelerated to the
           accurately measured and controlled energy of 2.27 MeV
            (using 1.86 MeV as the threshold).

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
METHOD     (MANGB) The number of neutrons from the Li(p,n)
           reaction for 2.27 MeV protons incident upon a lithium
           target approximately 40 keV thick was compared with
           the number of neutrons emitted by a 200 mc Ra-Be
           source by the manganese solution method. The solution
           tank used was 2 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep. The
           strength of the Ra-Be source was taken as 1.9x10**6
           neutrons per second but this value is subject to
           change after recalibration by the Chicago group.
           Determination of the Fission Rate: the two separated
           foils, Mg-XIII-7 and Mg-C-3, were placed back to back
           l/32 inch apart in a fission chamber which allowed
           the simultaneous counting of the fissions due to each
           foils This chamber has been improved by mounting the
           first amplifier stages right below the chambers. The
           scalar bias was set so as to count all pulses more
           than twice the height of the alpha pulses. The
           chamber was mounted directly in front of the target
           at a distance of 1.864 inches from the center of the
           foils to the center of the target. The above
           comparison combined with a measurement of the angular
           asymmetry of the neutrons from lithium and an
           observation of the fissions induced in the Mg-C-3 and
           Mg-XIII-7 gives the cross-section for 235U.
