DETECTOR   (IOCH) BF3 ionization chamber.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron bursts were produced by modulation of
           the arc source of a small cyclotron. Neutrons
           subsequently slowed down in paraffin were detected by
           a BF3 ionization chamber and linear amplifier.
           Modulation of an additional amplifier allowed the
           counting of all detected neutrons as well as those
           arriving in a specified time interval. Time of flight
           experiments were carried out at 3.0 meters with "on"
           times of 50 or 100 microsec (microseconds) out of a
           period of 2500 microsec.

SAMPLE     Thin cadmium, 0.052 g/cm2.
METHOD     3 meters source detector distance.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical accuracy of each point is
           about 10 percent in the measurement of the
           transmission.
CORRECTION No correction has been applied for the possible
           effect of the resolution of the apparatus or the
           effect of delayed emission of thermal neutrons, both
           of which are discussed later.

SAMPLE     Thick cadmium, 0.45 g/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,10.,25.) The statistical accuracy above 0.4 eV
           is 10 percent but at lower energy it was decreased
           because of the long time involved in taking accurate
           data where the transmission is low. At 0.21 eV the
           error is 15 percent and the lowest energy point has a
           statistical error of 25 percent.
CORRECTION No correction for delayed emission of thermal
           neutrons need be considered for these data as the
           energy range is above that where the thermal
           distribution plays an important role.
