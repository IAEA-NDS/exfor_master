INC-SOURCE (D-D) A low voltage neutron source which employs the
           deuteron-deuteron reaction with a continuously
           renewable target of ND4C1. Such a target is formed by
           subliming ND4C1 on a metal target cooled with solid
           CO2.
DETECTOR   (BF3,GEMUC) A conventional scale of sixteen Wynn-
           Williams counters is used with either a BF3 ionization
           chamber and linear amplifier, or with a thin window
           Geiger counter. The constancy of the source during a
           measurement is determined by means of a LiF lined
           Lauritsen electroscope which is lead shielded against
           x-rays and placed near the small side hole cut in the
           howitzer.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

SAMPLE     Blocks about 5 mm thick and 35 mm square of iron were
           cut.
METHOD     (TRN) Targets were then surrounded with a tightly
           fitting block of the borax-paraffin mixture and the
           transmission measured as a function of thickness
           using the BF3 ionization chamber.  It may be noted
           that placing a 1 mm sheet of cadmium in front of the
           ionization chamber reduced the counts to 0.1 of the
           unshielded value.
ANALYSIS   From the transmission slope curves the sum of the
           scattering and absorption cross sections for iron was
           found.
