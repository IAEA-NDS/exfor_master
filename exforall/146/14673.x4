DETECTOR   (BF3) Boron trifluoride ionization chamber.
SAMPLE     235U enriched sample, no details on 239Pu sample.
METHOD     The number of delayed neutrons from Pu239
           relative to the number from U235 has been measured by
           means of a boron trifluoride ionization chamber
           immersed in a block of paraffin. The sample of Pu239
           was placed on one end of the BFs chamber and the
           paraffin block was exposed to the direct beam of
           neutrons from the cyclotron target about 10 ft away.
           The strong neutron intensity, with the cyclotron on,
           caused the grid of the first amplifier tube to drift
           to such a negative voltage that nothing was recorded.
           However, as soon as the cyclotron was turned off the
           grid voltage would snap back to a sensitive bias
           within a few milliseconds and the amplifier system
           would then record boron disintegrations due to
           delayed neutrons. The procedure, then, was to expose
           the block to the cyclotron beam for 5 minutes and
           then to count for 5 minutes with the beam off. This
           was sufficient time for the delays to build up to
           equilibrium during exposure and to die out completely
           during the recording period. A sample of enriched
           U235 prepared in as nearly as possible the same
           geometry as the Pu239 was then substituted for the
           Pu239 and the procedure was repeated. To determine
           the contribution of the U238 in the sample, a disk of
           uranium metal was substituted for the U235 sample,
           and counts recorded. No sample at all gave no counts
           at all.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) A comparison ionization chamber in which
           known amounts of Pu239, enriched U235 and enriched
           U238 could be placed was inserted in the paraffin
           block in the same position that the Pu239 or U235
           sample had occupied. From the relative counts
           recorded and the known cross sections one can
           calculate that there are only 48 percent as many
           delayed neutrons per fission from Pu239 as there are
           from U235.
CORRECTION If one assumes the neutrons are all thermalized and
           applies a correction, the percentage of delayed
           neutrons from Pu239 relative to U235 is changed to 44
           percent.  It is difficult to draw any conclusions
           about the delayed neutrons of U238 from the data.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) However, not all the neutrons are thermal,
           so we can only say that the proper ratio lies within
           the range of 44-48 percent, and is probably about 46
           percent.
