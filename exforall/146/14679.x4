TITLE      Cross sections for thermal neutron capture by 180W
           and 184W

FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORU) Measurements were performed at the
           Oregon State University TRIGA Reactor.
SAMPLE     Natural W sample in form of foil with thickness of
           0.025 mm and purity of 99.85%. The foils had
           quadratic shape with side of 5-6 mm and mass in the
           range of 15-18 mg.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma rays were observed with a high-
           purity Ge detector with efficiency of 35-40% compared
           with NaI at 1332 keV. The detector resolution was
           typically 1.7-1.8 keV at 1332 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were performed at two sites in
            reactor core
           -on the perifery with with thermal flux 4.4E+12 n/cm2/s
               and epithermal flux 3.5E+11 n/cm2/s
           -in Cd lined site with epithermal flux 1.2E+12 n/cm2/s
