METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) In order to verify that the activity
           was indeed properly assigned to Lr, extractions with
           0.1 M thenoyl trifluoroacetate (TTA) in
           methylisobutyl ketone (MIBK) were performed. The KCI
           deposit was dissolved in a buffer solution of
           monochloroacetic acid or acetic acid adjusted to pH
           ranges of 1.86 to 5.5. Extractions with TTA from
           buffer solutions of different pH were performed. The
           organic phase was dried on a Pt plate and alpha
           counted. The entire procedure required about three
           minutes. The energy histogram of the 62 fission
           events was observed. Whatever the fissioning species
           is, it has reasonably symmetric mass division with a
           total kinetic energy of about 210 MeV, which is
           calculated by taking a weighted average over the
           252Cf spectrum, normalizing to TKE=186.5 MeV for
           252Cf, and scaling the 261Lr data to it.

REACTION   (103-LR-261(0,F),(SEC),AKE,LF+HF)
SAMPLE     Lr-261 was poduced by Cm-248(O-18,p4n) reaction.
ANALYSIS   The fragments may come either from fission of Lr-261
           or, after electron capture, from No-261.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
