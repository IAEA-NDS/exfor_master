TITLE      Reactor production of promethium-147

REFERENCE  (J,ARI,144,54,2019)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) Irradiations were made in the core of
           ORNL High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR)
SAMPLE     Target in form of neodymium oxyde  Nd2O3 in synthetic
           quarz ampoules with 6 mm  outer diameter, 4 mm inner
           diameter and ID ~40 mm long. Seven targets with two
           different enrichments were used. Targets with lower
           enrichment (86.8% for 146Nd) were used mainly for
           development of chemical separation procedure
           (60-ND-142,ENR=0.0043)

           (60-ND-148,ENR=0.0032)
           (60-ND-150,ENR=0.0013)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using two HPGe
           detectors with active volume 10 and 100 cm3 with
           resolution 1 keV at 123 keV 1.8 and 1.9 KeV at 1332
           keV, respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Cross sections were determined by
           analysing product yields and their decay variation.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were performed in center of reactor
           core with thermal neutron flux up to 2.1E+15 n/cm2/s,
           with thermal to epithermal flux ratio of 30+-1.5 and
           fast (En > 1 MeV) to thermal ratio approx. 0.25.
