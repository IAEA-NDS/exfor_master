INC-SPECT  Total flux 9x10**10 neutrons.

           (96-CM-245,ENR=0.207) Sample I after MTR irradiation.
           (96-CM-246,ENR=0.751) Sample I after MTR irradiation.
           (96-CM-247,ENR=0.042) Sample I after MTR irradiation.
METHOD     (CHSEP,INTB) Sample was irradiated in the MTR for six
           weeks and change in Cm245 contents was measured.
           Alpha-pulse analysis of curium sample showed a rather
           broad alpha peak with energy of about 5.4 MeV due to
           Cm245 and Cm245. The ratios of the 5.4-MeV alpha
           particles (Cm245 and Cm246) to spontaneous fission
           disintegrations were (5.8+-0.3)x10**3 and (2.7+-0.1)
           x10**3, respectively.
ANALYSIS   A thermal-neutron fission cross section was
           calculated for Cm245 based on the fissionability of a
           sample I.

METHOD     (CHSEP,MASSP) The curium produced by the irradiation
           of two plutonium samples (total integrated fluxes
           4x10**21 and 8x10**21 neutrons) in the Materials
           Testing Reactor (MTR) was chemically purified from
           fission products and other actinide elements. The
           curium samples were analyzed in a 12-in., 60 degree
           mass spectrometer with a multiple filament source.
ANALYSIS   Re-analysis of the previous measurement for fission
           channel.
