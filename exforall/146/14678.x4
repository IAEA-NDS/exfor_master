FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) Irradiations were made in the core of
           ORNL High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR)
SAMPLE     Enriched 186W sample in form of WO3 was encapsulated
           in synthetic quartz ampoule with inner diameter 3 mm,
           outer diameter 5 mm and length of 20 mm. Eight targets
           with 186W masses from 1.97 mg to 18.23 mg
           were prepared as follows.

ANALYSIS   Derived from the measured effective cross section
           assuming RI/sigma0=43.
           Due to relative short half-life of target
           nucleus, the cross section was determined by least
           squares fit between theoretical and experimental
           yields, keeping all parameters constant except
           measured cross section.
