TITLE      Characteristics of 6.7h I135 (I)
AUTHOR     (L.E.Glendenin,R.P.Metcalf)
INSTITUTE  (1USAWAS)
REFERENCE  (B,RCS,2,992,1951)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) The Clinton Pile
INC-SPECT  Pile neutrons
SAMPLE     Uranyl nitrate
METHOD     (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curve of iodine activity.
CORRECTION 1) Standard. All samples were counted with reference to
           a standard UX (Th234-Pa234) sample and corrected for
           any variations in the standard. This correction was no
           more than a few per cent.
           2) Coincidence. The coincidence error of the counter
           used in the fission-yield experiment was found to be
           about 0.4% per 1,000 c/m.
           3) Chemical. Yield of barium and iodine.
           4) Absorption. The absorption correction factor for
           I135 1s 1.21, and for Ba 1.33.
           5) Decay. The observed actinides of I135 and Ba140 were
           corrected back to the end of irradiation, using
           half-life values of 6.7 hr and 12.8 days, respectively.
