           particle data for U238
SAMPLE     The Cf252 source, about 1/8 in. in diameter, mounted
           on 0.003-in. platinum foil and covered with a
           100-mu-g/cm2 nickel foil, provided about 10e5
           fissions/min for calibration.
METHOD     (COINC)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR,TELES)
           The fission detectors were p-n junction semiconductor
           devices, approximately 1 cm sq and self-collimated,
           with each subtending an angle of about 14 degrees at
           the center of the chamber. For the fission-fragment
           measurements, the cover foils were removed and a lower
           level discriminator was set to prevent the natural
           decay alpha particles from being counted.
           The light charged particles were detected in a deltaE-E
           counter telescope consisting of two semiconductor
           detectors: a totally depleted deltaE detector, 112 mu-m
           thick, followed by an E detector, depleted to depth
           of about 400 mu-m. An Al foil with a surface density
           of 6.6 mg/cm2 prevented fission fragments and low-
           energy electrons from reaching the detectors,
           yet transmitted alpha particles with energies greater
           than 5.5 MeV. For the alpha-particle measurements, the
           counter telescope was covered with 7.6 mg/cm2 of
           aluminum to stop fission fragments and alpha particles
           from natural decay.
