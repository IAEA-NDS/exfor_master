REL-REF    (O,14696001,J.R.Dunning,J,PR,45,586,1934) First
           measurement with fast neutrons.

FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USAPTN)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The neutrons were produced by the action of
           100 keV deuterons on targets of heavy ice.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A paraffin-lined ionization chamber.
SAMPLE     Scatterers were cylindrical and were slightly larger
           in diameter than the ionization chamber (4.2 cm) and
           between 4 and 6 cm in length.
METHOD     The neutron energy was varied by rotating the counter
           and scatterer about the target, that is, by varying
           the angle theta between the paths of the neutrons and
           the deuterons.
ANALYSIS   The cross section for a particular scatterer was
           calculated from the measured transmission, i.e., the
           ratio of the number of neutrons indicated by the
           counter with the scatterer in front of it to that
           indicated with the scatterer removed, the times being
           such that the electroscope deflections in each case
           were the same. The possible reactions to be
           considered are elastic and inelastic scattering and
           neglected too, being about 10**-4 times as probable
           as scattering. Inelastic scattering also is
           apparently small.
CORRECTION A correction was made for the number of neutrons
           deflected by the scatterer into the ionization
           chamber on the assumption that the scattering was
           isotropic.
