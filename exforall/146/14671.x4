INC-SOURCE (RN-BE) A radon-beryllium source of about 600 mC
           initial strength was symmetrically located 3 cm below
           this surface. Cadmium sheet 0.45 mm thick covered the
           entire surface with the exception of a 9x9 cm opening
           at the center. For all measurements with D neutrons
           this square was covered with a plane sheet of cadmium
           0.1x10x10cm.
SAMPLE     The thick Rh absorbers consisted of powdered metal
           placed in containers of four-mil nickel sheet with
           the aid of a template to secure uniform thickness.
           Thinner absorbers were made to a convenient thickness
           by diluting with talc. The thinnest absorber was
           obtained by electroplating Rh on nickel. All
           absorbers were approximately 6x7 cm.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (ACTIV) For the activity measurements a standard
           procedure of one-minute irradiation and one-half-
           minute interval followed by a one-minute ionization
           measurement was used. The results, therefore, while
           applying to the 44-sec. period, are independent of
           exact knowledge of the period, and the contribution
           of the longer period is sufficiently small to be
           neglected. Any data used for calculation of
           transmission values were the average of at least nine
           such activity measurements.
ANALYSIS   The absorption curves have been analyzed by assuming
           a single sharp resonance and taking into
           consideration the angular distribution of the
           neutrons emerging from the source and the absorption
           of the neutrons and the electrons in the detector.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) From the individual measurements and their
           deviations it follows that no transmission value has
           a probable error greater than 3%
