INSTITUTE  (1USACHI)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) The graphite chain reacting pile.
DETECTOR   (BF3) A BF3 proportional counter.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: 1 eV is approximately equal 11600
           K or 1 K = 0.0862 meV. This ratio was used to convert
           temperatures into neutron energies. Therefore, 18 K
           neutron temperature is 1.5516 meV (0.0015516 eV).

SAMPLE     Graphite, 12.96 g/cm2.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons of energy much lower than thermal were
           produced by filtering a beam of thermal neutrons
           through a block of graphite 23 cm long. In such a
           block, Bragg scattering removes the neutrons whose
           wave-length is less than the largest Bragg
           wave-length in graphite, 6.69 angstroms. Measurement
           of the boron absorption of the filtered neutrons
           showed that they had an effective wavelength of 7.15
           angstroms which corresponds to neutron temperatures
           around 18 Kelvin. The whole assembly was isolated
           from stray thermal neutrons by the cadmium shield. A
           cadmium plate could be inserted above the graphite
           filter in order to measure the background. In all
           measurements the small background observed with this
           cadmium plate in place was always subtracted.
           Measurements by the transmission method were made of
           the total cross sections of a number of substances
           with and without the 23-cm long graphite filter.

SAMPLE     Graphite, 15.4 g/cm2.
METHOD     To show the effects of the thermal motion of the
           atoms in a crystal on the interference conditions,
           the scattering cross section for graphite was studied
           with filtered neutrons as a function of temperature
           of the scatterer. The scatterer was heated with an
           oxyacetylene torch and the temperature measured using
           a thermocouple. Temperature equilibrium was not
           perfectly established in these experiments but the
           effect is evident. These experiments show clearly
           that the thermal motion of the crystal atoms tends to
           destroy the interference conditions.
