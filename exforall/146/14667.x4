TITLE      Fission Cross Sections of U235 and U238 for Fast
           Neutrons

DETECTOR   (FISCH,IOCH) Two chambers were used. The second
           chamber with a larger collector was used for enriched
           uranium samples which were one inch in diameter. The
           distance between the neutron source and the uranium
           sample was increased for the absolute cross-section
           determinations. The chambers were cadmium-lined as
           shown. A boron-lined ionization chamber, surrounded
           by paraffin, was used as a neutron monitor.
SAMPLE     Samples of normal uranium of various thicknesses were
           used for comparison with the enriched samples. The
           235U content of the first two samples was checked by
           comparing their UX2 beta ray yield with normal
           uranium, after the UX2 content of the samples was in
           equilibrium.
CORRECTION The correction for fission absorption was obtained
           from an absorption curve, determined with the use of
           a number of uniform U3O8 samples of known weight,
           prepared by the Bureau of Standards.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG,,SPA)
INC-SOURCE (D-C12) Cl2(d,n) neutrons of 640 keV maximum energy.
           The carbon neutrons were produced by deuteron
           bombardment of thick graphite discs. About 99 per
           cent of these neutrons are due to the reaction
           C12(d,n) for which Q = -.28 MeV.
SAMPLE     The measurement was made with a normal U3O8 sample of
           11 mm diameter and containing 1.140 mgm of U3O8.
METHOD     For determining the absolute fission cross-section,
           the distance between the uranium sample and the
           graphite target was increased to 2.77 cm (distance to
           top surface of graphite).  The deuteron energy was
           970 keV, giving neutrons of maximum energy 665 keV in
           the forward direction.

ANALYSIS   To obtain the cross section for U235 for C12 neutrons,
           the natural value must be multiplied by 140 and by
           .505 the fraction of fissions due C12 neutrons for
           ordinary uranium. Dr. Way has made a more detailed
           calculation of correction for the above data and
           finds 235U cross section of 1.10 b.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,SPA)
INC-SOURCE (D-C12) Cl2(d,n) neutrons of 640 keV maximum energy.
           The carbon neutrons were produced by deuteron
           bombardment of thick graphite discs. About 99 per
           cent of these neutrons are due to the reaction
           C12(d,n) for which Q = -.28 MeV.
SAMPLE     Enriched sample Mg-XVII-B-1. This sample is
           advantageous for getting sigma 235U because the
           corrections for the fast neutrons from 13C and the
           deuterium contamination will be small amounting to
           only 5 per cent of the total number of fissions
           observed.
ANALYSIS   For a distance between sample and target of 5.35 cm,
           8.7x10-3 fissions/mu were observed, using for the
           neutron yield Q(15 degrees) = 15.2x10**6 neutrons/mu,
           for a deuteron energy of 963 keV. Detailed
           calculation by Dr. Way yields 1.20 b.

INC-SOURCE (D-D) D(d,n) neutrons of maximum energy 3.95 MeV.
           D3PO4 targets were used for most of this work.
SAMPLE     All the data were taken with a U3O8 sample of weight
           1.140 mg, diameter l1 mm.
METHOD     Two absolute measurements have been made on the
           fission cross-section for D-D neutrons in the forward
           direction for normal uranium. From the value of the
           observed fissions/mu, using the D3PO4 target and
           applying the corrections the cross section was
           extracted.

           MeV neutrons. A special chamber was constructed for
           comparing two samples simultaneously. This was a
           double ionization chamber with the two samples
           mounted back to back on the high voltage plate. The

           were made with a distance of 5 cm between target and
