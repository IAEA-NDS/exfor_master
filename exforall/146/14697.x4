FACILITY   (REAC,1USADAV) Part of 88Yr samples were irradiated
           using high power TRIGA reactor at McClellan Nuclear
           Research Center located in Sacramento, operated by
           the University of California, Davis
           (REAC,1USAMIS) 88Yr and 88Zr samples were irradiated
           at 10MW open pool PWR at the University of Missouri
           Research Reactor Center (MURR).
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Sample activities was measured using HPGe
           detector
METHOD     (ACTIV)
MONITOR    The monitor foils for the 1-hour irradiation contained
           Zr, Fe, and Mo, foils for the 10-hour irradiation
           contained only Zr and Fe. Monitor foils were
           individually encapsulated in quartz.

INC-SOURCE At MURR, one set of samples was irradiated for 1 hour
           and a second one for 10 hours in the graphite reflector
           At MNRC, two sets of samples containing 88Zr and Fe,
           Zr, and Mo monitor foils were separately encapsulated
           in quartz and irradiated for 12 hours in the Neutron
           Transmutation Doping location. This location has the
           highest ratio of thermal (<0.5 eV) to fast (>1 MeV)
           neutrons in the MNRC reactor. One set of samples was
           irradiated with a 1-mm-thick cadmium wrapping, to
           reduce the thermal flux by two orders of magnitude.

SAMPLE     88Zr was produced by projectile fragmentation of
           140 MeV/A 92Mo primary beam at NSLS. 88ZR fragments
           were separated by A1900 projectile fragment separator
           and collected in water target irradiation cell. Water
           target was then radiochemically processed  and
           concentrated as the final Zr stock containing 7 mu-Ci
           of 88Zr and 1.1 mu-Ci of 88Y resulting  from 88Zr
           decay, and detectable amounts of 85Sr and 83Rb.
           Two 88Y targets were prepared by pipetting Zr stock
           into 4 mm/6 mm diameter Suprasil quartz tubes, dried
           and sealed.

REACTION   (39-Y-88(N,G)39-Y-89,,SIG)
SAMPLE     (39-Y-88,ENR=0.96) 88Y was produced by projectile
           fragmentation of 140 MeV/A 92Mo primary beam at NSLS,
           fragments were separated by A1900 projectile fragment
           separator and collected in water target irradiation
           cell. Water target was then radiochemically processed
           and concentrated as the final Y stock containing 0.9
           mu-Ci of 88Y 0.3 mu-Ci of 85Sr, and 0.02 mu-Ci of
           83Rb and no detectable 88Zr. Two 88Y targets were
           prepared by pipetting Y stock into 4 mm/6 mm diameter
           Suprasil quartz tubes, dried and sealed
METHOD     Since reaction product 89Y is stable,
           the upper limit for thermal neutron capture
           cross section for 88Y was determined from
           the disappearance of 88Y by measurement of
           88Y activity before and after irradiation.
