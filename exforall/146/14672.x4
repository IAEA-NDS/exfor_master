INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) The neutron source was a mixture of 200 mC of
           Ra with Be, embedded 3 cm below the surface of a
           paraffin cylinder 15 cm high and 20 cm in diameter.
           Average neutron energy: 3.6 MeV (13.2 MeV max).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     (ACTIV) In each case, sets of four Cd shielded
           detector slabs, each measuring 2.2 by 4 cm, were
           irradiated at a standard elevation of 35 mm above the
           paraffin surface in an arrangement in which they
           covered an area of 4.5x8 cm. For counting, the
           four detectors were placed on a frame which fitted
           around a thin-walled Geiger-Mueller counter. The
           counter was connected to a scale-of-eight circuit.
           The 44" period of Rh and the 54' period of In were
           used. The routine of counting and irradiation was, of
           course, strictly standardized, both with regard to
           geometrical arrangement and to timing.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,10.) Curves show that the ratios of widths
           and spacing have an error of less than 10 percent.
           (ERR-S,,2.) The statistical error in the
           determination of each point was less than 2 percent.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: These measurements for the 1.259
           eV resonance in Rh-103 (100% isotopic abundance) and
           1.457 eV resonance in In-115 (95.71% isotopic
           abundance). These resonance energies (1.259 and 1.457
           eV) are not mentioned in the article.
