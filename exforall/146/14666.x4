TITLE      A Measurement of Fission Cross-Sections by the Use of
           a Coincidence Proportional Counter
AUTHOR     (A.O.Hanson)
REFERENCE  (R,CF-618,1943)
REL-REF    (I,,J.M.Blair+,R,CF-617,1943) The construction and
           operation of proportional counter.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) The c-p (coincidence-proportional)
           counter and alternately the fission chamber was
           placed in front of the target so that the face of the
           paraffin radiator and the center of the fission
           chamber was at the same definite distance in front of
           the target chamber.
SAMPLE     The factor 3.5 is the average ratio of the mass of 28
           to the mass of 25 in the Mg-XVII-B-6 samples.
METHOD     (REC,COINC) Measurement of the 25 and 28 cross-
           sections were made using the neutrons from the
           Li(p,n) reaction. The determination of the neutron
           flux through the samples was made by the use of a
           coincidence-proportional counter for measuring the
           number of proton recoils from thin paraffin films of
           accurately known weights. Three different runs were
           made at different times with c-p data taken between
           them. The first run was taken with the Mg-XVI-B-7 and
           the Mg-C-3 samples, the second with Mg-XVII-B-5 and
           Mg-XVII-B-6, and the third with Mg-XVII-B-6 and
           Al-XIV-4.
CORRECTION Approximate corrections have been made for the
           effective solid angle of the recoil counter and for
           the reduction of fission counts due to absorption in
           the samples.

COMMENT    Author's summary: It is seen that the 235U
           cross section is essentially constant for neutron
           energies above 0.5 MeV and has a value of 1.66 b.
