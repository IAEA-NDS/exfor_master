FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) experiment was performed at the Ohio
           University Edwards Accelerator Laboratory using 4.5MV
           pelletron tandem and beam swinger facility.
SAMPLE     Active sample in the form of plastic scintillator
           EJ-200 with dimensions D=1.5cm and H=4.5 cm coupled
           to XP2900 phototube was used as target and as a
           detector of recoil protons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Three liquid scintillation detectors with
           NE213 and dimensions D=12.7 cm, H=5.08 cm, coupled to
           RCA 4522 phototube were placed in the tunnel at a
           flight path of 4.108 m. All three detectors were used
           in close triangle configuration.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to determine scattered
           neutron energy. The swinger magnet was rotated about
           the scatter-detector to provide different scattering
           angles.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Solid tritium target was used to generate
           incident neutrons with E = 14.9 MeV from the T(d,n)
           reaction.
CORRECTION Corrections for
             1. C(n,n')3alpha reaction
             2. edge effects
             3. dead time and cross-talk
             4. neutron absorption in air
             were made.
