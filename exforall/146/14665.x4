INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Production of photoneutron sources.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,GEMUC) Ionization chamber was filled with freon.
SAMPLE     The uranium samples were deposited as ammonium nitrate
           or as U3O8 on platinum discs; discs of 5 or 3.3 cm
           diameter and their distance from the bottom of the
           neutron sources varied between 3.40 cm and 1.86 cm in
           the various runs.
METHOD     (MANGB) For monokinetic energies photoneutron sources
           were selected; they were produced by power
           artificial gamma sources generated by Berkeley
           cyclotron. The total number of photoneutrons was
           determined by slowing them in a large bath of
           manganous sulphite, and a fraction of neutrons
           crossing the uranium sample was calculated. The
           neutron source was put immediately above an
           ionization chamber connected to a linear amplifier
           and containing the uranium samples to be investigated.
ANALYSIS   From the observed count (R) the fission cross section
           was obtained using the formula: R = sigma x Phi x S,
           where sigma is the cross section in square cm, Phi is
           the number of neutron crossing the perpendicular to
           the sample per unit of time, and S is the number of
           uranium nuclei per square cm.
