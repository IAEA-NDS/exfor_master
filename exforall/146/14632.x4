FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Studied precursors were were produced
           at the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade
            (CARIBU) facility from the spontaneous fission of a
           approx. 100-mCi 252Cf source.The fission products
           thermalized in helium buffer gas and extracted from
           the exit nozzle of the gas catcher. Ions were then
           focused into the RFQ section and accelerated to 36 keV.
DETECTOR   Ions of interest were studied using the Beta-decay Paul
           Trap (BPT), an open-geometry linear radio frequency
           quadrupole (RFQ) ion trap designed for precision
           beta-decay studies. BPT was used to collect and suspend
           radioactive ions of interest at the center of detector
           array. The detector array consisted of
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Two plastic scintillation telescopes
            with EJ-204 plastic scintillators were used to detect
            beta particles. dE detector has diameter of 10.6mm and
            1 mm thickness. E detector was 10.2cm thick with 13.3
            cm diameter.
           (MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detectors with nominal
            active area of 50.3 x 50.3 mm2 with 1 ns timing
            resolution to detect recoiling daughter ions. Position
            of ion impact was determined from relative amounts of
            charge collected at the corners of resistive anode
            with sub-mm precision.
           (HPGE) Two high-purity germanium p-type HPGe detectors,
             with relative efficiency of 140 and 80% were used
             to detect gamma rays
METHOD     Ions of interest were produced by spontaneous fission
           of 252Cf, captured by the BPT ion trap and their decay
           radiation detected by an array of various radiation
           detectors
