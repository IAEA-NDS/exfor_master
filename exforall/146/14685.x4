FACILITY   Nuclei were produced by Californium Rare Isotope
           Breeder Upgrade (CARIBOU) facility and measured using
           Beta-decay Paul Trap.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two coaxial single-crystal HPGe detectors were
           used to detect gamma rays. Two detectors with
           relative efficiences 80% and 140% were located in the
           distance 10 cm within the ion trap. Detectors were used
           to identify ions.
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) For beta spectroscopy two plastic
           scintillator dE-E telescopes were used. dE detector
           was 1 mm thick and 10.6 cm in diameter. E detectors
           were 10.2 cm thick and diameter of 13.3 cm. Both
           telescopes were placed approx. 105 mm from the center
           of ion trap. The left and bottom dE detectors had
           beta-energy thresholds of 76+-24 and 62+-30 keV,
           respectively.
           (MCPLT) Recoil ions were detected using two resistive-
           anode Chevron microchannel plate detectors with 1-ns
           timing resolution and submillimeter position
           sensitivity. Each detector area was 50.3 x 50.3 mm2
           and was located 53 mm away from the ion trap center.
METHOD     (TOF) The nuclei of interest were produced in CARIBOU
           facility and trapped for some time in ion trap.
           Fission fragments from approx. 100 mCi 252Cf source
           were thermalized in a large He filled gas catcher,
           extracted as 1+ ions, separated and delivered to
           radiofrequency quadrupole buncher. The ion bunches
           were then injected into Beta-decay Paul Trap, which is
           also a linear radiofrequency quadrupole ion trap, where
           their decay was measured. Ions were periodically
           ejected from the trap to measure background.
           Time of flight of recoiled ions was determined from
           time difference between dE beta detector and MCP ion
           detector.
           Decay products - beta rays, gamma rays and recoiled
           ions were detected and beta-decay kinematics event by
           event reconstructed using a Monte Carlo code.
           Neutron energy was obtained from measured ion recoil
           momentum assuming that neutron and ion had equal and
           oposite momenta.
ANALYSIS   The beta-n branching ratios were obtained by
           comparing number of beta-ion coincidence events with
           neutron emission to the number of detected beta
           particles. Ratios were obtained from the weighted
           average of the results from the four dE-MCP detector
           pairs.
