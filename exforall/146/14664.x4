ANALYSIS   Absorption coefficients (alpha) in water for
           different neutron energies in water were analyzed and
           fitted as exponent at large distances. The data
            (Manhattan project report C-121) with a plane source
           in paraffin and not in water. The data were fitted
           numerically with -Ei(alpha z) where z is coordinate.
           The best fit for z less 25 cm was obtained with
           alpha=0.162. That value would correspond to 2.2 MeV
           neutrons using the absorption curves. It is very
           difficult to locate the C-121 report. However, Ra-Be
           neutron sources were used in the early reactor piles,
           so the C-121 report incident neutron energy is
           assumed as 3.6 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Upper limit on uncertainty if the
           experiments are reasonably accurate.
