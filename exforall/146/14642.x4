TITLE      Spectrum of gamma rays in the 8- to 20-MeV range from
           252Cf spontaneous fission

METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight techniques was used to eliminate
           the effects of fission neutrons.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The gamma detector was a 25.4 cm diam x 25.4 cm
           long NaI scintillator surrounded by a 15.24 cm thick
           NE102 plastic anticoincidence shield on the sides and
           a 3.81 cm thick shield in front.
           The energy calibration was accomplished by using a PuBe
           neutron source, which provides gamma peaks of 2.23 MeV
           from neutron capture in the plastic shield, 4.43 MeV
           from 9Be(alpha,n)12C*, and 6.797 MeV from full-energy
           capture of slow neutrons on 127I. The calibration was
           linearly extrapolated to the 10- to 20-MeV region.
SAMPLE     The 252Cf source was evaporated onto a 5-cm2 nickel
           foil and placed in an ionization chamber filled with
           methane (CH4).
ANALYSIS   To determine the absolute yield, the accepted gamma
           pulse-height spectra were unfolded by an iterative
           technique using response functions for discrete gamma
           lines measured with the identical geometries used in
           the 252Cf source runs. Gamma rays of energy 14.0 and
           16.8 MeV were produced by the 15N(p,gamma)160
           reaction at incident proton energies 2 and 5 MeV
           furnished by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory tandem
           accelerator; 4.43-MeV gamma rays were observed from
           the 15N(p,alpha)12C* reaction in the same series of
           runs. The line shapes were parametrized with a
           functional form which was also used to extrapolate
           them to low energies. For each geometry, line shapes
           at other energies mere determined by linearly
           interpolating or extrapolating the measured line
           shape parameters. Uncertainty in the low-energy
           extrapolation of the line shapes contributes an
           uncertainty of +/- 15% to the final absolute scale.
           The counting statistics in the original spectra are
           amplified by the unfolding procedure; these
           variations mere reduced by Gaussian smoothing with
           FTHM in the range 2-4%.
CORRECTION The absolute yield mas corrected for a 12% absorption
           of gamma rays in the front 6LiH shield, the front
           plastic, and the NaI housing materials, and for the
           gamma rays that pass through the NaI without
           interaction (calculated as 3% for the two small solid
           angles). For the large solid angle, the correction for
           gamma rays not interacting in the NaI was found by
           comparing the observed yields of the 15N(p,gamma)16O
           gamma rays with the different solid angles.
ERR-ANALYS No information on uncertainties.
