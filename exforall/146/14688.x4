SAMPLE     A gold sheet, 3.01 g/cm2 thick.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons of high energy were produced by
           bombardment of a Be target with deuterons. The
           neutrons were slowed down in a moderating medium near
           the cyclotron chamber. The moderator consisted of a
           5-cm thickness of a solution of 7 g of B203 per
           liter of water, boron being used to shorten the mean
           life of the source. Neutron energies were determined
           by measuring their time of Right over a 7.6-meter
           path from the moderator to a BF3-ion chamber.
CORRECTION Corrections, which amortized to less than 3 percent
           of the time of flight, were made to take account of
           the 68-microsecond mean life of the moderator.

ANALYSIS   Under this assumption, the total cross section in the
           region investigated is expected to follow the
           approximate relation given below. sigmat = alpha
           sqrt(Er/E)*(1+2E/Er) + sigmas, sigmat = total cross
           section, E = neutron energy, Er = resonance energy =
           4.8 eV. The scattering cross section sigmas, is
           assumed to be approximately constant, while alpha is
           a constant depending on the Breit-Wigner parameters
           of the 4.8-eV resonance as is given below. alpha =
           sigma0 Gamma**2 /4*Er**2, sigma0 = cross section at
           resonance, and Gamma = resonance width.
