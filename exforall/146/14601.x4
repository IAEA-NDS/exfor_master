FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed using K150
           cyclotron at the Texas A&M University Cyclotron
           Institute
SAMPLE     (94-PU-240,ENR=0.99995)
           (94-PU-238,ENR=0.0000493)
           240Pu material was electroplated on 100 mu-g/cm2
           thick natural-carbon foil covering circular area
           of 1.90 cm in diameter. Activity of 240Pu was
           67.374 mu-Ci, thickness was 104.078 mu-g/cm2.
           Carbon foil was glued by epoxy glue onto Al frame.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) Charged particles were detected
           with a Si telescope located 19 mm downstream from the
           target. Telescope consisted of two Micron S-2 type
           anular Si detectors, 152 mu-m thick dE detector and
           994 mu-m thick E detector, separated by 4 mm.
           Both Si detectors were segmented into 48 0.5-mm-wide
           rings on one side and 16 22.5deg wide sectors on
           the other. Fission fragments were detected with a
           third 146 mu-m thick Micron S2 silicon detector
           located 19 mm upstream from the target.
           (SCIN) Target and charged particle telescopes were
           located inside neutron detector, consisting of a tank
           filled with 3.5 t of liquid scintillator EJ-335,
           doped with 0.25 wt% of natural gadolinium. Tank
           was segmented into four identical quadrants, which
           formed central cylindrical part of the detector and
           two spherical endcups. Twenty photomultiplier tubes,
           three on each quadrant and four on each endcup were
           used to read out the neutron detector. In present
           experiment only central part of the detector was
           used.
METHOD     (EDE) Charged particles p, d, t, 3He and alpha were
           identified by E-dE method in forward Si telescope
           (COINC) A 240Pu(a,a'f) reaction was identified by
           a coincidence of alpha particle in forward telescope
           and fission fragment in backward telescope.
ANALYSIS   (SURGT) Surrogate method was used.  For identified
           240Pu(a,a'f) reactions a time window  opened 50mu-s
           before and closed 500 mu-s after the event was used
           for neutron detection.The excitation energy of 240Pu
           following inelastic alpha particle scattering was
           determined from the beam energy,the scattered alpha
           particle energy and the 240Pu recoil energy.
           The equivalent incident neutron energy
           was  determined from calculated excitation energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty is dominated by statistical
           uncertainty in the number of coincidences and the
           number of detected neutrons
