TITLE      Fission cross section of 94239 for 220 keV neutrons
           and Ra plus Be neutrons
AUTHOR     (E.Segre,C.Wiegand)

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (COINC) A coincidence chamber with a sample mounted
           on a thin film, taking advantage of the fact that the
           fission fragments fly apart in opposite directions.
           The two samples were put successively in the
           ionization chamber, the chamber was filled with
           nitrogen, and an yttrium-plus-beryllium source was
           put in a standard position above the chamber.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

           for the determination of sigma 239Pu.

INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) A photoneutron source giving 220 keV neutrons
           was used to generate thermal neutron flux.
SAMPLE     A sample of enriched uranium containing 35.5 microg of
           235U, prepared by the Berkeley method, was used as a
           standard, and a sample containing 16.8 microg of
           239Pu as determined by its alpha activity was used
           for the determination of sigma 239Pu.
METHOD     Since thickness of the samples or inequality in their
           distribution is always a possible cause of error in
           measurements of this type we checked that our samples
           give the accepted value of sigma 239Pu/sigma 235U for
           thermal neutrons. This was done by surrounding the
           whole apparatus with a thick paraffin layer and
           measuring cadmium differences.
