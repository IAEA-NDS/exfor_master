           as in the 1-st ref., but presented in another form.

SAMPLE     To irradiate, the actinide samples replaced in the
           capsules made from high-purity vanadium. The vanadium
           capsules have a 7.6-mm length, a 1.5-mm outside
           diameter, an interior volume of 0.52 mm3. Each
           vanadium capsule was sawed open and its solid oxide
           sample was removed and then dissolved in acid (HN03).
           A portion of this solution was determined by aliquot
           for the measurements, the amount being deduced a priori
            upon the expected activity of the total sample. Each
           aliquot was diluted with HN03 to a 4-ml volume and
           transferred to a glass bottle. The material was sealed
           in the bottle with a semi-permanent sealing plastic cap
           impervious to the acid solution.
           The samples were in fuel pins during the irradiation
           and were irradiated for about 1 year.
DETECTOR   (GELI,GE-IN) Two different high-resolution detectors
           were used. One was a large-volume Ge(Li) diode having
           a resolution of 2.1 keV full-width-at- half-maximum
            (FWHM) for Eg 1.3 MeV. Measurements were made with
           this detector for 0.1 < Eg < 3 MeV. The second
           detector was a low-energy-photon- system (LEPS)
           intrinsic germanium detector having a resolution of
           0.5 keV FWHM at Eg 120 keV. It was used for
           measurements of gamma rays and x rays having energies
           20 < Eg < 230 keV. The efficiencies of both detectors
           as functions of Eg were determined using
           well-calibrated commercially available sources.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   There are presented the deduced radionuclide yields
           as ratios to the 137Cs yield for each sample. The
           absolute yields of the fission product 137Cs in the
           various samples are presented in Tab.4 in Oak Ridge
           Nat.Lab.Rep.-6266,1986 as the absolute values of the
           number of atoms of the particular radionuclide that
           were in the sample at the time of the gamma-ray
           measurement.
ADD-RES    Evaluated yields and uncertainties of 137Cs for
           fast-neutron fission of 18 actinides. These data were
           fitted using an empirical function of actinide mass
           number and charge. These absolute yields of the fission
           product 137Cs in PC/FIS, with the exception of curium
           samples (taken from Tab.III), taken from Fig.1 in
           Nucl.Sci.Eng.,96,8,1987,digitized by GSYS2.4.7 are

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties include uncertainties
           assigned to gamma-ray branching ratios and
           uncertainties associated with the data reduction,
           including those associated with detector efficiency
           calibrations and sample gamma-ray attenuation
           calculations.

MISC-COL   (MISC) Adjustment factors for the experimental ratio
           data, deduced from the irradiation history and the half
           life of each fission product so as to provide an
           estimate of the ratio values that would have been
           measured following an instantaneous irradiation.
            To determine experimental ratio data, data have to be
           multiplied by the adjustment factor given in MISC.
