REL-REF    (R,,F.Rasetti+,J,PR,49,104(1),1936) Cd data from the
            wheel experiment.
INSTITUTE  (1USACOR)
INC-SOURCE (RN-BE)
SAMPLE     A shield of 20 mil Cd equivalent to 0.582 g Cd/cm2
           covered the boron shield.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 gas chamber for the detection of the
           neutrons.
METHOD     (TRN) The Rn-Be source of neutrons was placed inside
           a lead sphere of 3.65 cm radius around which was
           fastened a paraffin shell 7.1 cm thick. The distance
           from the center of the Rn-Be source to the outer
           surface of the paraffin shell was 10.75 cm. The outer
           wall of the BF3 gas chamber was placed 6.4 cm from
           the paraffin surface. This chamber had a shielding
           jacket of B4C of thickness equivalent to 0.391 g
           B/cm2 the end of which lapped over the end of the
           chamber in order to define accurately the aperture,
           2.6 cm diameter, over which the absorbers were placed.

ANALYSIS   A sheet of Cd 0.5 mm thick reduces the neutron counts
           to 8.4 percent of the total; 5.7 percent are
           absorbable in heavy layers of boron. Assuming the 1/v
           law for the absorption of neutrons in boron the
           absorption limit in Cd is found to be 0.41 eV. With
           the aid of data from the wheel experiment of Rasetti
           and collaborators the resonance energy and the
           half-width are calculated.
