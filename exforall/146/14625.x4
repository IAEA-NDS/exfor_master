TITLE      Radiochemical studies of the fast neutron fission of
           uranium-235 and uranium-238
AUTHOR     (L.R.Bunney,E.M.Scadden,J.O.Abriam,N.E.Ballou)
REFERENCE  (C,58GENEVA,15,449,1958)
INSTITUTE  (1USANRD)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACLA) The 60-in. cyclotron at the
           University of California
SAMPLE     The targets were stacks of uranium foil which had
           been enriched (93.5% U235) or depleted (0.031% U235)
           in U235. These foil stacks were enclosed in cadmium
           sheet 0.75-mm thick to filter out the thermal neutrons
           present. These target assemblies were placed in the
           cyclotron behind a beryllium target.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Side-window, gas-flow, proportional counters.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After irradiation, the uranium foils were
           dissolved in 6 N HNO3. The final precipitates were
           collected on 23-mm filter paper. A filter tower was
           used, which defined a sample area 20 mm in diameter.
           The filter papers were mounted on brass planchets
           3/8-in. thick and covered with thin  pliofilm (about
           1 mg/cm2).
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS No information on uncertainty.  The precision of the
           radiochemical analyses is about 5%.
CORRECTION The counting rates were corrected for chemical yield,
           decay from the end of the irradiation to the time of
           counting, the length of irradiation, and the counting
           shelf if it differed from the "standard" shelf.
           An empirical correction for self-scattering and
           self-absorption was made by plotting observed specific
           activity vs. sample weight for samples made up from the
           same solution of each radionuclide of interest and
           normalizing to a convenient sample weight. In this way
           these corrections were kept smaller than 10% in all
           cases.
