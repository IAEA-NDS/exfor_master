FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment performed using the 10 MV
           FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at the Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory
SAMPLE     (1-H-2,ENR=0.984) Deuterated polyethylene sample CD2
           with diameter of 28.3 mm, height of 36.4 and weight
           25.172 g was used for n-d measurements.
           Standard polyethylene sample CH2 with diameter of 14.2
           mm, height of 22.7 and weight 3.389 g was used for
           n-p measurements.
           Two graphite samples with masses of 2.9424 and 42.055 g
           were used for background measurements from n-C
           scattering in polyethylene samples.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scattered neutrons were detected using two
           5.08 cm long liquid scintillation detectors with
           diameters of 12.7 and 8.89 cm filled with NE- 213 and
           NE-218 liquid scintillators. Detectors were placed at
           equal angles of +-36.7deg with respect to beam axis
           in a distance of 264.9cm (left detector) and 264.3 cm
            (right detector) from the sample. Both detectors
           were placed in a shielding of Li-doped paraffin with
           conical Cu collimator.
METHOD     (TOF) Energies of scattered neutrons were determined
           using time of flight. The incident neutron beam was
           pulsed at a repetition rate of 2.5 MHz and pulse
           width was 2 ns.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced via the 2H(d,n)3He
           reaction with a pulsed deuteron beam incident on a
           3.16 cm long gas cell filled with deuterium at the
           pressure of 5 atm. Beam period was 400 ns and pulse
           width 2 ns.
