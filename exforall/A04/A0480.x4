FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK)
METHOD     (EDEG,SITA,BCINT,CHSEP,ACTIV,INTB,EXTB)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)  The disintegration rates were determined using
           end window "Amperex" Geiger counter tubes
           (PROPC) The counting rates of spallation products which
           decay by negatron emission or electron capture were
           determined with a methane-flow windowless proportional
           counter.
           (IOCH) The total disintegration rate of alpha-emitting
           samples was determined in a 52%-geometry argon-flow
           ionization chamber.

COMMENT    /By authors/ the counting rates of spallation products
           which decay by negatron emission or electron capture
           were determined with a methane-flow windowless
           proportional counter.

SAMPLE     The U-233 (isotopic purity of  approximately 96 %,
           U-238 - 3%, U-234 <1%). Most of the targets were
           prepared  by  electrodeposition of 0.1 to 2 mg of
           hydrated uranium oxide over an area of about 1 cm**2 on
           a dish-shaped aluminum disk. The amount of deposited

SAMPLE     The U-233 (isotopic purity of  approximately 96%,
           U-238 - 3%, U-234 <1%). Most of the targets were
           prepared  by  electrodeposition of 0.1 to 2 mg of

ANALYSIS   (CHGDS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error are estimated to be
           about 15% for most of the mass chains reported.
           However, at higher energies, the chain yield
           corrections become quite sizeable and the errors
           may be somewhat greater.

ANALYSIS   (CHGDS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,15.,25.) These errors arise from many sources
           and are rather difficult to evaluate, The most likely
           source's of error are in the determination of the
           number of atoms per cm2 in the target, from
           uncertainties in decay schemes and counting corrections
           of the observed products, and, to a lesser extent,
           uncertainties in mass chain yield corrections.

REACTION   (92-U-238(A,F)MASS,CHN,SIG)
SAMPLE     The U-238  with isotopic purity > 99.% used. Most of
           the targets were prepared by electrodeposition  of 0.1
           to 2 mg of hydrated uranium oxide over an area of about
            1 cm**2 on a dish-shaped aluminum disk. The amount of
           deposited material was determined by direct alpha
           counting, weighting, or both. These targets were then
           mounted in a water-cooled microtarget holder which also
           served as a Faraday cup for beam intensity measurements
ANALYSIS   (CHGDS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error are estimated to be
           about 15% for most of the mass chains reported.
           However, at higher energies, the chain yield
           corrections become quite sizeable and the errors
           may be somewhat greater.
FLAG       (2.) Cross section is for 129m-Te only.
           (1.) Cross section is approximated owing to
           complexities in the decay scheme.

SAMPLE     The U-233 (isotopic purity of  approximately 96%,
           U-238 - 3%, U-234 <1%). Most of the targets were
           prepared  by  electrodeposition of 0.1 to 2 mg of
           hydrated uranium oxide over an area of about 1 cm**2 on
           a dish-shaped aluminum disk. The amount of deposited
           material was determined by direct alpha counting,
           weighting, or both. These targets were then mounted in
           a water-cooled micro-target holder which also served as
           a Faraday cup for beam intensity measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error are estimated to be
           about 15% for most of the mass chains reported.
           However, at higher energies, the chain yield
           corrections become quite sizeable and the errors
           may be somewhat greater.

REACTION   (92-U-235(A,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,SIG)
SAMPLE     The U-235  with isotopic purity > 99.9% used. Most of
           the targets were prepared by electrodeposition  of 0.1
           to 2 mg of hydrated uranium oxide over an area of about
            1 cm**2 on a dish-shaped aluminum disk. The amount of
           deposited material was determined by direct alpha
           counting, weighting, or both. These targets were then
           mounted in a water-cooled microtarget holder which also
           served as a Faraday cup for beam intensity measurements
ANALYSIS   (CHGDS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error are estimated to be
           about 15% for most of the mass chains reported.
           However, at higher energies, the chain yield
           corrections become quite sizeable and the errors
           may be somewhat greater.

REACTION   (92-U-238(A,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,SIG)
SAMPLE     The U-238  with isotopic purity > 99.% used. Most of
           the targets were prepared by electrodeposition  of 0.1
           to 2 mg of hydrated uranium oxide over an area of about
            1 cm**2 on a dish-shaped aluminum disk. The amount of
           deposited material was determined by direct alpha
           counting, weighting, or both. These targets were then
           mounted in a water-cooled microtarget holder which also
           served as a Faraday cup for beam intensity measurements
ANALYSIS   (CHGDS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error are estimated to be
           about 15% for most of the mass chains reported.
           However, at higher energies, the chain yield
           corrections become quite sizeable and the errors
           may be somewhat greater.

REACTION   (88-RA-226(A,4N)90-TH-226,,SIG)
SAMPLE     The radium used was isotopically pure Ra-226.
           The target material was deposited on l-mil gold plates
           rather than aluminum "hats" to simplify the chemical
           procedures following bombardment. The radium was
           electrodeposited on the gold foil from a solution
           0.15 M in sulfuric acid and 0.15 M in ammonium formate.
            The plating yields were rather low, but this did not
           present much difficulty as 0.1 mu-g was sufficient to
           produce adequate amounts of the 26-min.
STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl. VIII from UCRL-3858,1057 report.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated errors of ~ 20% are
           principally due to uncertainties in determining the
           amount of target material bombarded

REACTION   (90-TH-230(A,4N)92-U-230,,SIG)
MONITOR    (94-PU-239(A,3N)96-CM-240,,SIG) The monitor reaction
           gave an average recoil-collection efficiency for all
           of the bombardment of 80 +- 5%.
SAMPLE     The thorium used had an isotopic composition of
           87.85 +- 0.1% Th-230 and 12.12 +- 0.1% Th-232.
           The target used for the recoil bombardments was
           prepared by electrodeposition of the thorium and
           plutonium onto a gold cathode from a 6 M ammonium
           chloride solution. The target was found to contain
           1.61 mu-g/cm2 of Th-230 and 2.43 mu-g/cm2 of Pu239.

REACTION   (92-U-236(A,4N)94-PU-236,,SIG)
SAMPLE     The uranium had an isotopic composition of 94.9% U-236,
           0,04% U-234, 4.52% U-235, and 0.54% U-238. The targets
           were electrodeposited on gold or aluminum plates by the
           same technique used to prepare the thorium target.
           The amount of material deposited was determined by
           direct alpha counting, and the targets usually
           contained about 0.1 mg of U-236 .

COMMENT     The contribution of the Pu-236 produced by the
            (alpha,3n) reaction from the U-235 present in the
           target has been subtracted.
