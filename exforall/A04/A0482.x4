TITLE      Nuclear reactions of medium and heavy target nuclei
           with high-energy projectiles. Fragmentation of Ag-nat
           and Au-197 by 3.65 A*GeV C-12-ions and 3.65 GeV
           protons.

HISTORY    (19910724C)
           (20011018A) Lower Case. Elem/Mass Formalism was
           Transformed to Usual Records.
           (20110926A) Value of incident energy was changed
           MeV to GeV, according B.Kiraly comment.

SAMPLE     The target foils were enclosed in mylar catchers
           17.5 mg/cm**2 thick.The induced Na-24 activity in the
           Al-foil of thickness 20 mg/cm**2, surrounded by guard
           foils of the same Thicknesses, was used to calculated
           beam flux.
