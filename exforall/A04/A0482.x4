TITLE      Nuclear Reactions of Medium and Heavy Target Nuclei
           With High-Energy Projectiles.Fragmentation of Ag-Nat
           And Au-197 by 3.65 A*GeV C-12-Ions and 3.65 GeV
           Protons.

HISTORY    (19910724C)
           (20011018A) Lower Case. Elem/Mass Formalizm was
           Transformed to Usual Records.

SAMPLE     The Target Foils were Enclosed in Mylar Catchers
           17.5 Mg/Cm**2 Thick.The Induced Na-24 Activity in the
           Al-Foil of Thickness 20 Mg/Cm**2, Surrounded by Guard
           Foils of the Same Thicknesses, was Used to Calculated
           Beam Flux.
