ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).The errors of the cross sections values are
           estimated at 10 per cent at the maximum of the
           excitation functions.
           (ERR-2).The errors of the cross sections values are
           estimated at 30 per cent near the threshold.
           (ERR-3).The incident alpha-particle energies are most
           accurate at the highest energy with a relative error
           of 2 per cent.
           (ERR-4).The error in the incident a-particle
           increases to 10 per cent below 16 MeV due to straggling
           process.
           (ERR-T).The uncertainties is reported by authors.
