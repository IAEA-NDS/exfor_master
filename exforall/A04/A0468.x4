TITLE      A method for the production of iron-52 with a very
           low iron-55 contamination

INSTITUTE  (2UK BIR,2UK MAN)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK BIR)
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,CHSEP)
SAMPLE     The chemical form of the ORNL material was Cr(2)O(3)
           with an enrichment of 96.8% whereas the Russian
           material was elemental chromium with an
           enrichment of 96.4%.
           The electroplated targets were self-supporting foils,
           7 mm dia and 130 mg/cm2 thickness, and were
           clamped to water cooled Al holders.
CORRECTION The data are corrected for decay occurring between the
           end of bombardment (EOB) and the time of counting.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainties
