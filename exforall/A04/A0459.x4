TITLE      Complete  and incomplete fusion reactions in the 12-C +
           169-Tm
AUTHOR     (S.Chakrabarty, B.S.Tomar, A.Goswami, G.K.Gubbi,

SAMPLE     For the excitation function measurements,
           self-supporting metal foils of thulium having thickness
           around 1 mg/cm**2 backed by 2 mg/cm**2 thick aluminium
           catcher foils were bombarded with 12-C beam.  In each
           irradiation a stack of two such target catcher
           assemblies was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM)
METHOD     (STTA) See sample
           (ACTIV)  The duration of irradiation was about one hour
           with the total charge collection of about 400 micro
            Coulombs
           (BCINT) Measured using an electron suppressed Faraday
           cup placed behind the target-catcher assembly.
           (GSPEC) The time elapsed between the stoppage of beam
           and the start of counting of the sample on detector
           was about 5 minutes. Thus the excitation function
           measurements could be carried out only for evaporation
           residues having half-life more than 5 minutes.
           Initially the counting time was kept as 100 seconds and
           was subsequently increased to longer periods for
           counting long-lived products.
COMMENT    -By authors.  The radioactivity produced due to
           bombardment of aluminium catcher foil by the 12-C beam
           is due to 146 KeV gamma-ray of 34-Cl-m which has a
           half-life of 32 min.  This does not interfere with
           gamma-ray energies of interest.  All other reaction
           products of 12-C + 27-Al do not have suitable half
           lives or gamma-rays so as to cause any interference
           with the gamma-rays of interest.
HISTORY    (20021220C)
           (20030123R) Data tables are received from S.Chakrabarty
           (20030714A) Subentry A0459008 is corrected.
           (20030715U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the cross section values are in
           the range of 10-20%.  The major factors contributing to
           the errors are that due to the target thickness (5%),
           detection efficiency (5%) and statistical and fitting
           error on the peak area (1-15%).
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty is shown on figure without
           any analysis.

COMMENT    - By compiler. Lu-172 production due to Hf-172 decay is
           negligible, because half-life of Hf-172 is equal 1.87
           years.
           - By authors.  The calculated cross section is
           negligible compared to experimental data.  This shows
           that 172-Lu and 171-Lu are formed purely by incomplete
           fusion reaction such as 169-Tm(C-12,Be-8)173-Lu.
