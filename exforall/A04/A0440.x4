           reaction of indium with 42 MeV/nucleon 12-C ions

INSTITUTE  (3CPRIMP)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,3CPRIMP) The irradiation was performed on heavy
           ion research facility
METHOD     (SITA) The target assembly used for the irradiation
           consisted of three pieces of 99.99% pure natural indium
           foils (95.3% 115-In), backed by 1.8 milligramm/cm2
           aluminum foil and their aluminum or mylar catcher
           foils.  The thickness of these targets was around 18
           milligramm/cm**2.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation lasted for about 10 hours, with
           typical beam intensities of 5-10 electrons nanoampere.
           The total particle fluence was 1.9e+14 12-C ions.
           (GSPEC) At the end of the irradiation, the middle
           indium target together with its mylar catcher foil,
           10.4 milligramm/cm**2 thick, was analyzed by direct
           gamma-ray spectroscopy.
           (CHSEP) The other two indium targets with their
           aluminium catcher foils were subjected to chemical
           separations.  The chemical procedures used in this work
           were based mainly on the differences in the
           solubilities of sulfides.  The procedures yield six
           chemical fractions as follows:
           1.  Antimony fraction,
           2.  Indium fraction,
           3.  Strontium fraction,
           4.  Rubidium fraction,
           5.  Silver fraction.
           (GSPEC) The counting of the samples began about 23 min
           [for unseparated foils] or about 40 min [for chemical
           fractions] after the end of irradiation and continued
           for 5 weeks.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY) Decay curves were analyzed using a
           least-squares code.  Nuclidic assignments and
           calculation of the production cross sections were done
           using conventional radiochemistry techniques.
COMMENT    Abstract.  Cross sections for the production of the
           target residues in the interaction of indium with 42
           MeV/nucleon 12-C ions have been measured by nuclear
           chemistry techniques.  From these data, the mass yield
           distribution was deduced.  The results are in good
           agreement with the calculations using a MONTE CARLO
           code based on the statistical binary decay model.
           - By authors. The total energy loss of 12-C ions
           traversing the assembly was 36 MeV, with the energy at
           the center of the middle indium target being 506 MeV.
           - By compiler. Sorry, but the authors did not give any
           decay data obtained products.
HISTORY    (20020830C)
           (20030113U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The errors listed are the standard deviations,
           including the errors in analysis of gamma spectra and
           in resolution of the decay curves by the least-squares
           method, and a 5% error in detector efficiencies.  While
           the uncertainty in the thickness of the targets is
           negligible, the uncertainties in beam-current
           measurement and in the chemical yields are not included

FLAG       (1.) Production due to isomer decay is included.
           (2.) Production cross section of the nuclide was marked
           by authors as cumulative. It is an error. Therefore
           compiler moved the nuclide to A0440002
           (3.) According to ENSDF, In-108-g production cross
