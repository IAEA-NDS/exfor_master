SAMPLE     THREE MONOISOTOPIC OR QUASI-MONOISOTOPIC ELEMENTS V-51,
           NB-93 AND AU-197 WERE CHOSEN FOR INVESTIGATIONS.FOR
           EACH ELEMENT 5 FOILS OF 13 MM DIAM. WERE STACKED
           TOGETHER.THE THICKNESS OF EACH FOIL WAS CHOSEN SUCH
           THAT THE RECOIL LOSS OF BE-7 PARTICLES OF UP TO
            200 MEV ENERGY WOULD BE NEGLIGIBLE.
