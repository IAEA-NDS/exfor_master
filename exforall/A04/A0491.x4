SAMPLE     Three monoisotopic or quasi-monoisotopic elements V-51,
           Nb-93 and Au-197 were chosen for investigations. For
           each element 5 foils of 13 mm diam. Were stacked
           together. The thickness of each foil was chosen such
           that the recoil loss of Be-7 particles of up to
            200 MeV energy would be negligible.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainties in beam current monitoring.
           (ERR-2) The errors in the determination of absolute
           activity of the product.
           (ERR-3) The errors in the determination of chemical
           yield.
           (ERR-T) By summing all the individual errors in
           quadrature the total error for each cross section value
           was obtained and amounted to about 13%.
