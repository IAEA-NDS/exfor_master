TITLE      Pre-equilibrium particle emission in alpha-induced
           excitation functions in niobium
AUTHOR     (R.K.Y.Singh, M.Afzal Ansari, R.P.Gautam)

INSTITUTE  (3INDTHO,3INDMUA,3INDJCB)
ADD-RES    (COMP)  Measured excitation functions are compared with
           pre-equilibrium geometry dependent hybrid model
           calculations.  It has been found that the initial
           exciton number N0 = 4 gives a satisfactory reproduction
           of the experimental data.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDVEC) Variable energy cyclotron
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure natural niobium metallic foils
           of thickness 10.69 mg/cm**2 were used for
           investigation.
           The stack was comprised of fifteen niobium foils
           interspersed with aluminium foils of thicknesses 6.75
           mg/cm**2 and 3.83 mg/cm**2 , which served as energy
           degraders, to get the desired alpha-particle energy
           incident on the individual target foil.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB) The cooled stack was irradiated with a diffused
           alpha-particle beam of energy 39 MeV.  By using a
           tantalum collimator placed in front of the stack the
           diameter of the beam spot was adjusted to 8 mm.
           (BCINT)
           (ACTIV)  By collimated alpha particle beam of about 100
           nanoAmpere
           (GSPEC) The dead time for counting was kept to less
           than 10% by adjusting the sample detector separation in
           these measurements.

COMMENT    - By compiler.
           1.  It is unclear, what cross sections are shown on
           figure 2.  Was isomer production cross section included
           in published data?
           2. The paper text contains phrase: " the cross-section
           was measured at eleven alpha-particle energies", but
           only 10 data points are shown on figure 2.

COMMENT    - By compiler. The probability of isomer transition to
           ground state is very low (<0.1%).
           -By compiler. The angle between X and Y axes
           on this figure is not equal 90 angular  degrees.
            This deviation is  2.28e-02 radians.
           -By  authors. In this reaction two isomers of 94Tc are
           produced.  The ground and metastable states have
           half-lives of 4.88 H and 52.5 minutes respectively.
           The ground state isomer gives four major gamma-rays:
           0.702, 0.850, 0.871 and 0.916 MeV.  The 0.850 MeV
           gamma-ray is in common with Tc-96-g, produced in the
            (alpha,n) reaction whereas the 0.871 MeV gamma-ray is
           also obtained from Tc-94-m.  The 0.871 MeV gamma ray
           was also used in the analysis of the cross-section
           corresponding to the ground state by counting the
           activity, after the decay of several half-lives of the
           metastable state.  The 0.916 MeV gamma-ray overlaps
           with the 0.913 MeV gamma-rays, emitted from Nb-92-m,
           produced in the (a,a+N) reaction.  The absolute
           intensity of the latter gamma ray is 1.6% and the cross
           sections for the (a,a+N) reaction in the energy range
           of our interest is small.  Therefore, the 0.913 MeV
           gamma ray has negligible contribution to the photopeak
           counts of the 0.916 MeV gamma ray.  Thus the cross
           sections of the 93Nb (a,3N) reaction were measured by
           considering  the 0.702, 0.871 and 0.916 MeV gamma-rays.
