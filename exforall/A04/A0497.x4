           on manganese and nickel.

ANALYSIS   Cross-sections and radionuclide yields were calculated
           from the measured emission rates of the characteristic
           gamma-rays of the relevant activation products, making
           use of the decay data tables of Reus et al. (1983).
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV)
           For irradiation, the foil stacks were mounted either
           in one of the standard Faraday cups used for beam
           diagnostic purposes in the NAC external beam lines,
           or in a simple, more easily accessible stack holder
           at the end of one of the beam lines.
CORRECTION All yields were corrected for decay losses during and
           after bombardment, and are therefore reported as
            (instantaneous) 'production rates', rather
            than 'yields'.
           Corrections for the decrease in beam current due to
           nonelastic nuclear interactions as the beam traversed
           the stacks were taken from the tabulation of
           Janni (1982) while the energy degradation in the stacks
           was computed by means of the stopping power expressions
           of Anderson and Ziegler (1977).

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes partial
            uncertainties described in Subents 002-009.
COMMENT    /By authors/.The total uncertainties in the cross-
           sections and production rates were obtained by
           summing all the contributing uncertainties in
           quadrature and were expressed with a 1 standard
           deviation (1 sigma) criterion.

SAMPLE     Each of the target foils was followed by a 250 mu-m
           high-purity Al catcher foil (99.999%).
           These foils also served as monitor foils for the
           accurate measurement of the incident proton flux.
           Additional beam degradation within the stacks, if
           required, was accomplished by means of suitable Al
           foils and/or Cu foils or discs. All the foils and discs
           had a diameter of 19 mm and their individual
           thicknesses were determined by weighing.
METHOD     (BCINT) The monitor reaction cross-sections were based
           on accurate Faraday-cup measurements.

REACTION   (28-NI-0(P,X)26-FE-59,,TTY,,PHY)
SAMPLE     The stacks of Ni powder(99.5%) was used.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG)
METHOD     The incident beam currents were determined from the
           22Na activity produced in the Al monitor foils in
           the stacks.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).The total uncertainty in the liquid-
           scintillation data.
           (ERR-1).An uncertainty in the correction for the effect
           of the Fe-59 gamma-activity.
           (ERR-2,,2.5).The uncertainty in the beam-loss
                corrections.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty in beam current integration.
           (ERR-4).The uncertainty in the thickness variations.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainties in the chemical separation
           losses and
             * the subtraction of the indirectly-produced 55Fe
               (via 55Co) from the measured 55Fe contents.
