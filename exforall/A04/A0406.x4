COMMENT    Abstract.-The total cross section of the 6-Li(D,A)4-He
           reaction has been measured for deuteron energies
           between 50 and 180 KeV.  From a detailed distorted-wave
           born approximation analysis of the angular
           distributions and the excitation function up to 1 MeV
           it was possible to determine the strength of a
           subthreshold resonance that dominates the cross section
           at sub-coulomb energies and contributes significantly
           to the increase of the astrophysical S factor at low
           energies.  Consequently the electron screening energy
           we have determined for the 6Li(D,A)4He reaction is
           considerably smaller than the value given in previous
           works which overestimate the theoretical predictions.
           In addition the stellar reaction rate has been
           calculated up to a temperature of T9=3.
