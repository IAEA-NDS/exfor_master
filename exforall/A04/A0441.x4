COMMENT    Abstract. Incomplete fusion reactions were
           investigated by measuring the excitation functions of
           nine evaporation residues in 16-O + 51-V reaction in
           the beam energy 4-6 MeV/amu, using the well-known
           recoil catcher technique and gamma-ray spectrometry.
           The experimental data were compared with that obtained
           from MONTE CARLO simulation calculations using the
           PACE2 code. The results indicate the presence of
           incomplete fusion process in the production of two
           alpha emission products. This was further confirmed by
           the measurement of recoil range distribution of these
           isotopes at 96 MeV beam energy. Calculations of the
           average angular momentum associated with these products
           revealed the peripheral nature of these incomplete
           fusion reactions.
           /Special remark by authors/. In case of cobalt products
           the experimental data are much higher than the
           calculated data indicating the contribution from
           incomplete fusion reactions. These incomplete fusion
           reactions can be of the 51-V(16-O,8-Be)59-Co* type.
           The excited 59-Co* nucleus may subsequently de-excite
           by neutron emission to give 58-56 Co. In the case of
           the evaporation residues 61-Co, there may be a breakup
           of 16-O into 12-C and 4-He and subsequent incomplete
           fusion of 12-C in the reaction 51-V(16-O,A)63-Cu; the
           evaporation of two protons leads to the formation of
           the residues. It was found that the incomplete fusion
           contributions with respect to the complete fusion
           cross-sections increase from 3% at 60 MeV to about 20%
           above 90 MeV.
REL-REF    (R,,L.C.Northcliffe+,J,ND/A,7,233,1970) To calculate
           the beam energy degradation in each target foil
METHOD     (EXTB) The target samples were irradiated with the
           collimated 16-O beam of diameter 1-2 mm.
           (STTA)
           (ACTIV) Several irradiations were carried out for each
           such stack of target and degraders to encompass the
           16-O beam energy between 58 and 94 MeV.
           (GSPEC) After the irradiation, the target and the
           catcher foil were counted in the live time mode.
           The recording time period were chosen in such a way so
           as to get the good counting statistics. The duration
           of counting was initially kept in the order of seconds
           and subsequently increased to longer periods for
           counting long-lived products.
SAMPLE     Stacks consisting of two self-supporting targets
           of vanadium, each of thickness 2.1 mg/cm2 and purity
           99.99%, approximately, separated by aluminum foils,
           2 mg/cm2, approximately.
