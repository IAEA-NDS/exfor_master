METHOD     (STTA,INTB)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The energy resolution was typically 2.1 keV
           FWHM at 122 keV. The absolute efficiency of the
           detector was determined with calibrated gamma-ray
           standard sources /57Co, 60Co, 22Na, 54Mn, 106Ru, 133Ba,
           137Cs and 152Eu/

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainty
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties were estimated by
           propagating in quadrature:
            * the contributions from the decay curve,
            * the peak analysis,
            * the absolute detector efficiency,
            * the disintegration scheme,
            * the target thickness and
            * the alpha-particle flux.
            Generally, the error is estimated to be 17-22%, except
           for the values corresponding to the minimum and maximum
           energies whose error increased to 50% due to the very
           low counting rate.
SAMPLE     The stack consisted of gold foils and copper foils
           interleaved between the first as degraders of the
           beam.All the target foils of the stack were generally
           thick enough to make the loss of recoil atoms
           negligible,the thickness of each foil (Au and Cu)
           ranged from 17 mg/cm**2 to 25 mg/cm**2.
