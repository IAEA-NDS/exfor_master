TITLE      Measurement and analysis of alpha-induced reactions
           on Ta,Ag and Co.
AUTHOR     (M.Ismail,A.S.Divatia)

INSTITUTE  (3INDVEC)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,BCINT,ACTIV)
           The total alpha-particle flux was measured with the
           help of the ORTEC current integrator.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The hybrid model of Blann.
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE) 114 cm3 Ge(Li) or HPGe detectors.
           The efficiency calibrations of the detectors were made
           with a calibrated Eu-152 source.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error from:
           (ERR-1).The error due to target foil thickness.
           (ERR-2).The error due to beam current.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty due to the detector
           efficiency.
           (ERR-4,,2.).The error due to the analysis of the gamma-
           ray spectra.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainties caused by the larger
           dimensions of the irradiation area and the edge
           effects contribute a 5% error to the average
           error of the alpha-induced reaction.
           (EN-ERR) The errors of the thickness of the target
           foils, energy straggling as well as beam energy
           resolution.

SAMPLE     Aluminium - flux monitor foils were added in front
           of most of the stacks.
COMMENT    Since the reaction 27Al(alpha,x) 24Na had been studied
           extensively in the past, authors have checked the
           quality of their absolute cross-section values by
           measuring the cross-sections for this reaction by
           way of flux monitoring foils kept in front of some of
           the stacks.
           A comparison of the production cross-section for 24Na
           from alpha-bombardment with other authors shows
           good agreement (see REL-REF).
