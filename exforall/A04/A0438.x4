COMMENT    Abstract.  Cross sections for the production of target
           fragments in the reactions of iron with 135 MeV/nucleon
           12-C and 80 MeV/nucleon 16-O ions have been measured by
           of-line gamma-ray spectroscopy.  Through these data,
           the mass yield distributions have been obtained.  The
           result of the experiment for the reaction with 135
           MeV/nucleon 12-C ions is compared with theoretical
           calculations using the fusion - fragmentation model and
           the GEMINI code for sequential binary decay,  following
           a calculation with the fireball model.
           -  By  authors.   Cross  sections for the production of
           radioactive products were calculated, assuming full
           ionization of the incident 12-C and 16-O ions.
SAMPLE     The beam was impinging a target assembly, which
           consisted of three pieces of 15.7 milli-g/cm**2 iron
           foils, 99.99% in purity.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNIPC)
METHOD     (EXTB) 135 MeV/nucleon 12-C beam and 80 MeV/nucleon
           16-O beam, with an intensity of 200 electric
           nano-ampere
           (ACTIV) In the experiment with 12-C ions, a 6.2 min
           irradiation was performed in order to obtain
           information for the short-lived target fragments.  An
           additional irradiation of longer duration, 48.8 min,
           was performed for the longer-lived fragments.  In the
           experiment with 16-O beam, a single irradiation, 60 min
           in duration, was conducted.
           (GSPEC) The sample from the short irradiation was
           measured for 8 H, starting a few min after the end of
           bombardment.  Those from the longer irradiation were
           measured for approximately 4 weeks.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY) Decay curves were analyzed by an iterative
           least-square fit code.  Assignments of radioactive
           nuclides were made on the basis of energy, half-life,
           and concordance with other gamma- rays, if any, emitted
           by the presumed nuclide.
HISTORY    (20020829C)
           (20021217U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The uncertainties in these values are standard
           deviations, including errors in analysis of the
           gamma-ray spectra, in the resolution of the decay
           curves by the least-squares method, and a 5% error in
           detector efficiencies.  While the uncertainty in the
           thickness of the target was negligible, the uncertainty
           in beam current measurement was not taken into account.

COMMENT    - By compiler:
           1. Cl-34-m production has been marked as cumulative by
           authors. It is incorrect, because Ar-34 decayed to
           ground state of Cl-34 only
           2. Sc-47 production has been marked as independent by
           compiler,  because cross section of Ca-47 production is
           less than Sc-47 production uncertainty.
