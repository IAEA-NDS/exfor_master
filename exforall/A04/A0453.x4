COMMENT    Abstract.  Fusion cross sections were measured for
           the 6,7-Li+27-Al, 64-Zn systems, at energies above the
           the coulomb barrier, in order to study the influence of
           the breakup of stable weakly bound nuclei on the fusion
           process.  The analysis was completed by the inclusion
           of the data of fusion induced by 9-Be and the strongly
           bound 16-O and 11-B projectiles on the same targets.
           The fusion excitation functions have similar behavior
           for all projectiles incident on both targets and they
           show no indication of fusion hindrance.
           - By authors:.The masses of residual nuclei originating
           from the complete fusion and those from the incomplete
           fusion are mostly the same, and we were not able to
           separate complete fusion from incomplete fusion.
           Therefore, the measured fusion cross sections
           correspond to the sum of these two proccesses.

METHOD     (TOF)
           (BCINT) From the comparision of the normalization
           factors obtained when Rutherford scattering and beam
           current integration could be applied simultaneously, it
           was proved that the normalization method using Faraday
           cup was quite reliable.

           The normalization of the fusion cross section was

           the spectra, when the experimental conditions were such
           that the scattering was purely Rutherford.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) Differential fusion cross sections were
           measured for 10, 12, 15 and 20 degrees.  The measured
           angular range covers around 60% of the complete angular
           distribution.  The extrapolation to the most forward
