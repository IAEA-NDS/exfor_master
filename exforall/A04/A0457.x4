DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3POLWWA)
METHOD     (STTA) A stack contains four Ag and Au targets. The
           Au foils were applied to stop the reaction products
           created in the Ag.
           (BCINT)
           (ACTIV) The irradiation of used stack of foils was
           performed during 6.6 hours with the integrated charge
           of 6.487E+06 nano-Coulombs.
           (GSPEC) The measurements were conducted for one week.
CORRECTION The changes in the beam intensity were taken into
           account in order to estimate the fraction of nuclei
           decayed during the irradiation.  The correction equal
           to 2.9% and 15% was obtained
           for 111-In and 123-I, respectively.
