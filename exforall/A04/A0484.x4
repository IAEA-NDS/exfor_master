TITLE      Cross sections of isomeric ratios of (alpha,alpha+n)
           and (alpha,2p+3n) reactions on Rh-103.

SAMPLE     The stack consisted of target foils interleaved
           between copper absorbers which degraded the energy
           Of the bombarding particles.

REL-REF    (R,,C.F.Williamson+,R,CEA-R-3042,1966) Tables of

           Charged Particles of Energy, 0.05 to 500 MeV.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Calculations of the Pre-equilibrium hybrid model
           in combination with the statistical decay process were
           carried out with the code-Alice.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The average alpha-particle energy for each
           foil was determined using range energy tables given in
           the literature (see REL-REF), where an error of
           about 5% was estimated.

           BIB update. Small corrections in all Subents. DATA-ERR
           moved to Subents 002-004. DATA were update. Rh-102g and
           Rh-102m were swapped according to description in the
           article (high and low spin). RAD-DET deleted
           from Subents (info presented in DECAY-DATA).
           ANALYSIS (AREA) deleted (not relevant).

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors in the measured cross sections
           arise in the determination of the product nuclide
           activity and of the alpha-flux. The gamma-ray yield
           involves the photopeak counts, the photopeak efficiency
           of the detector, the internal conversion correction.
           The alpha-flux involves the same quantities. The
           error in the flux measurement is estimated to be equal
           to the combined errors of these quantities. Errors in
           timing, weight of the samples and in background
           subtraction were also estimated.
