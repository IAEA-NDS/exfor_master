TITLE      Preequilibrium emission in alpha induced reactions on
           bromine and thallium

SAMPLE     Targets of KBr and TlCl of thicknesses 1.5 and 3.52
           mg/cm**2 , respectively, were prepared by a special
           vacuum evaporation technique because of the hygroscopic
           nature of these compounds.  These targets were
           deposited on aluminum backings of uniform thickness of
           6.75 mg/cm**2 , placed over a rectangular masking
           plate. A thin aluminum layer of thickness 25 mg/cm**2
           was further deposited by vacuum evaporation onto the
           upper surface of the prepared targets, so that the
           moisture would not affect the surface of these targets.
METHOD     (STTA) See sample
           aluminum foils of different thicknesses were also
           interspersed as energy degraders in order to get the
           desired alpha-particle energy on different targets.
           (ACTIV) A stack of KBr and TlCl comprised of eight
           targets each was irradiated at 50 MeV for 3 hours.
           Moreover, stacks of KBr comprised of six foils and of
            TlCl  having two foils were irradiated at 30 and 25
           MeV, respectively, for 3 hours each.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The uncertainty in the detector efficiency due
           to the statistical errors of counting, is estimated  to
           be <1%.  Since the irradiated targets were not point
           sources, the uncertainties due to a solid angle are
           estimated and is found to be <5%.  The total
           uncertainty in the efficiency is estimated to be <6.5%.
           The uncertainty due to flux variation is estimated to
           be <4%.  In order to minimize the errors due to the
           dead time, particularly for the cases where the
           activity in the irradiated samples was large, the
           sample-detector distance was suitably adjusted to keep
           the dead time <10%.  However, the corrections were
           applied in the counting rates accordingly.  The errors
           in the estimation of number of target nuclei were
           analyzed and are estimated to be <1%.  To avoid the
           uncertainty due to the recoiling of nuclei out of the
           sample, the targets were placed perpendicular to the
           incident beam such that sample deposition faced the
           incident beam.  As such, the recoiling nuclei are
           likely to be trapped in the aluminum backing;  hence,
           no correction is applied for that.  As the beam
           traverses the stack materials, low-energy neutrons may
           be released which in turn may disturb the yield.
           However, it was indicated that such disturbing yields
           are negligible.  The overall error due to all these
           factors mentioned above is expected to be <12%. The
           overall errors including the statistical errors in
           counting and are generally <20% except for few  points.
           These errors do not include the uncertainty of the
           nuclear data such as the branching ratio, the decay
           constants, etc
           (EN-ERR) Noany information is presented.
