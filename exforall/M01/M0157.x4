COMMENT    CROSS SECTIONS OF PHOTONUCLEAR REACTIONS WITH EMISSION
           OF NE24 CLUSTERS AND RANGES OF THESE CLUSTERS IN
           POLICARBONATE WERE MEASURED IN THE PHOTON ENERGY RANGE
           18.-28. MEV. THE CLUSTERS WERE DETECTED STUDYING
           GAMMA-RADIATION OF THE DAUGHTER NUCLEUS NA24. THE
           ENERGY OF THE CLUSTERS TURNED OUT TO BE 40 MEV. THE
           PROBABILITY OF THEIR EMISSION BY THE COMPOUND NUCLEUS
           AT EXCITATION ENERGY OF 28. MEV WAS 5.*10**(-8). THE
           MECHANISM OF THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON WAS DISCUSSED.
STATUS     (TABLE) DATA ARE PUBLISHED IN FORM OF TABLES.
