           Detailed characteristics of the spectrometer.
           description of procedure of neutron spectrum
           restoration.
FACILITY   (BETAT,4RUSMOS)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (REC,PSD) Zero-crossing method.
INC-SPECT  Gamma-beam near the target has right-angled form
           1.2 * 10.0 cm**2 (last dimension is vertical).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE-213 type liquid scintillator of 20 mm thick
           in glass container of 30 mm diameter with 3.5 cm lead
           shield in front of the detector. AVP-56 multiplier,
           4096-channel amplitude analyzer working in
           two-dimensional regime.
PART-DET   (P)
CORRECTION Corrected for background, and
           for the interaction of neutrons with the lead shield.
ADD-RES    (COMP)  A statistical theory of nuclear reactions was
           used. nuclear temperatures and level density
           parameters were obtained.
COMMENT    Comparison of the obtained experimental results with
           the predictions of the statistical theory of nuclear
           reactions shows that the theory does not describe the
           decay of nuclear collective states of the kind of
           the giant dipole resonance.
