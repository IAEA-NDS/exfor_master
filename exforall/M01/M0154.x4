COMMENT    The energy spectra of photons from the reaction
            B-11(gamma,xgamma') have been  studied  at
            bremsstrahlung end-point energies Eg-max=20 and 32MeV
           The 1.5-10 MeV secondary photons were detected at 135.
            degrees relative to the incident beam.
           In the spectrum a line has been observed at Eg-max=32
            MeV which corresponds to 8.47 MeV total binding
            energy of the H3 nucleus produced in the reaction
            B11(gamma,t+gamma').  the absence of the 8.47 MeV
            level in the spectrum of possible final nuclei states
            gives rise to the suggestion that this line is
            associated with the reaction mechanism.
