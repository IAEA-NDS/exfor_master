TITLE      STUDY OF THE MECHANISM OF B-11(G,TG') REACTION.
FACILITY   (BETAT,4CCPMOS)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (GELI)  GERMANIUM DETECTOR DGDK-80.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS GIVEN.
COMMENT    THE ENERGY SPECTRA OF PHOTONS FROM THE REACTION
            B-11(G,XG') HAVE BEEN  STUDIED  AT BREMSSTRAHLUNG
            END-POINT ENERGIES EG-MAX=20 AND 32 MEV. THE
            1.5-10. MEV SECONDARY PHOTONS WERE DETECTED AT 135.
            DEGREES RELATIVE TO THE INCIDENT BEAM.
           IN THE SPECTRUM A LINE HAS BEEN OBSERVED AT EG-MAX=32.
            MEV WHICH CORRESPONDS TO 8.47 MEV TOTAL BINDING ENERGY
            OF THE H3 NUCLEUS PRODUCED IN THE REACTION
            B11(G,T+G').  THE ABSENCE OF THE 8.47 MEV LEVEL IN THE
            SPECTRUM OF POSSIBLE FINAL NUCLEI STATES GIVES RISE
            TO THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS LINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH
            THE REACTION MECHANISM.
