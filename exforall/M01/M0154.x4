TITLE      Study of the mechanism of B-11(gamma,tgamma')
            reaction.
FACILITY   (BETAT,4RUSMOS)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (GELI)  Germanium detector DGDK-80.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors given.
COMMENT    The energy spectra of photons from the reaction
            B-11(gamma,xgamma') have been  studied  at
            bremsstrahlung end-point energies Eg-max=20 and 32 MeV
           The 1.5-10. MeV secondary photons were detected at 135.
            degrees relative to the incident beam.
           In the spectrum a line has been observed at Eg-max=32.
            MeV which corresponds to 8.47 MeV total binding energy
            of the H3 nucleus produced in the reaction
            B11(gamma,t+gamma').  the absence of the 8.47 MeV
            level in the spectrum of possible final nuclei states
            gives rise to the suggestion that this line is
            associated with the reaction mechanism.
