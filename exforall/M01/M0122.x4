COMMENT    Absolute measurements of the cross section have been
           performed for the reaction gamma+(Li-6) - p+d+t -
           21.29 MeV at energies Eg <= 30 MeV. The measurements
           were carried out by means of selection of
           corresponding three- prong stars in nuclear emulsion
           loaded with Li-6 isotope. An intensitive maximum has
           been observed in the obtained excitation function
           sigma(Eg) at an energy Eg=23.7(0.1) MeV; the total
           width at half-maximum is about 1.7 MeV. The integral
           reaction cross section for the gamma-ray energy
           interval from 22 up to 30 MeV amounts to 6.6(0.7)
           MeV*mb. The totality of the data obtained and their
           analysis indicate that the absorption of g-quanta
           with energies below 30 MeV by Li-6 nucleus leading to
           production of proton, deuteron and triton is
           explained mainly in terms of triangular feynman
           graphs with rearrangement of the nuclei at vertices
           including the virtual processes gamma+(H-3) -> n+(H-
           2), or gamma+(H-3) -> -> (He-3)+(H-2) and n+(He-3) ->
           p+(H-3). a suppression of symmetric channel into
           (n+d+He-3) are shown.
