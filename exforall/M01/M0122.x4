COMMENT    Absolute measurements of the cross section have been
            performed for the reaction gamma+(Li-6) -> p+d+t -
            21.29 MeV at energies Eg <= 30 MeV. The measurements
            were carried out by means of selection of
            corresponding three-prong stars in nuclear emulsion
            loaded with Li-6 isotope. An intensitive maximum has
            been observed in the obtained excitation function
            sigma(Eg) at an energy Eg=23.7(0.1) MeV; the total
            width at half-maximum is about 1.7 MeV. The integral
            reaction cross section for the gamma-ray energy
            interval from 22 up to 30 MeV amounts to 6.6(0.7)
            MeV*mb. The totality of the data obtained and their
            analysis indicate that the absorption of g-quanta
            with energies below 30 MeV by Li-6 nucleus leading
            to production of proton, deuteron and triton is
            explained mainly in terms of triangular Feynman
            graphs with rearrangement of the nuclei at vertices
            including the virtual processes gamma+(H-3) -> n+(H-
            2), or gamma+(H-3) -> -> (He-3)+(H-2) and n+(He-3)
            -> p+(H-3). A suppression of symmetric channel into
            (n+d+He-3) is shown.
