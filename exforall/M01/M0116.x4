COMMENT    Energy distributions of photodeuterons from Li-7 are
           measured at various values of the bremsstrahlung
           end-point energy. The difference spectra of deuterons
           show that in the Li-7 giant resonance region an
           intensive (g,d-0) reaction proceeds with production of
           the He-5 nucleus in its ground state. A group of
           deuterons which may be due to the (g,d-1) reaction with
           production of a final nucleus in the first excited
           state is found. The integral cross section of those
           reactions (under an assumption that the (g,d
           reaction really proceeds) are obtained to be
           correspondingly 4.0(0.5) and 3.2(0.7) MeV*mb for
           Eg=16.5-:30 MeV. Besides, there was observed an
           emission of deuterons which fact should be due to the
           decay of the 7-Li states with 25-30 MeV energies into
           n+d+(he-4) (5(2) MeV*mb) as well as due to some
           complicated decays of li-7(=5. MeV*mb) induced by
           37-50 MeV g-quanta.
           The contribution of various channels to the yield of
           photodeutrons from the Li-7 nucleus were obtained by
           means of comparison of these spectra.
