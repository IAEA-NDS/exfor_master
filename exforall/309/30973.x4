SAMPLE     Gaseous deuterium target 10 mg/cm**2
FACILITY   (VDGT,3DDRROS)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 25 MeV collimated beam of neutrons produced by
           bombarding a Ti-T target with a 8 MeV pulsed deuteron
           beam.
DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,MWPC,TELES)
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)
           Two MWPC's, one placed behind the entrance- and one
           before the exit-window of the deuterium gas cell, pro-
           vided anticoincidence and coincidence signals respec-
           tively to the telescope scintillators as to ensure
           that all signals have their origin within the gas cell.
           The distance (flight path) between the two telescope
           scintillation counters (delta-E and stop-detector) was
           42.3 cm.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The tritons are distinguished from other
           particles by time-of flight between both scintillator
           detectors and by the energy deposit in the stop-
           detector.
MONITOR    In order to separate the 25 MeV neutrons from the
           prompt gamma-rays and the continuum part of the neutron
           spectrum the time between the signal of the pulsing
           system and that of the delta-E-scintillator was
           measured. By setting a time window the 25 MeV neutrons
           were selected.
ANALYSIS   The area of the tritons in the TOF versus energy spec-
           trum overlaps sligthly that of the deuterons. In order
           to evaluate the number of measured tritons the events
           of equal-time distance to the deuteron band were
           summed up. The number of tritons was evaluated from
           a 6-parameter fit for the resulting triton and deu-
           teron distributions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error is evaluated from the
           uncertainties of:
           (ERR-1) No.of tritons (+-8.9%),
           (ERR-2) No.of deuterons (+-2.3%) and
           (ERR-3) The ratio of the efficiencies for registrating
                   elastically scattered deuterons and
                                  captured tritons (+-2%).
