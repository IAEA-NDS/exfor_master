SAMPLE     GASEOUS DEUTERIUM TARGET 10 MG/CM**2
FACILITY   (VDGT)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 25 MEV COLLIMATED BEAM OF NEUTRONS PRODUCED BY
           BOMBARDING A TI-T TARGET WITH A 8 MEV PULSED DEUTERON
           BEAM.
DETECTOR   (COIN,MWPC,MWPC,TELES)
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)
           TWO MWPC'S, ONE PLACED BEHIND THE ENTRANCE- AND ONE
           BEFORE THE EXIT-WINDOW OF THE DEUTERIUM GAS CELL, PRO-
           VIDED ANTICOINCIDENCE AND COINCIDENCE SIGNALS RESPEC-
           TIVELY TO THE TELESCOPE SCINTILLATORS AS TO ENSURE
           THAT ALL SIGNALS HAVE THEIR ORIGIN WITHIN THE GAS CELL.
           THE DISTANCE ( FLIGHT PATH) BETWEEN THE TWO TELESCOPE
           SCINTILLATION COUNTERS ( DELTA-E AND STOP-DETECTOR) WAS
           42.3 CM.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) THE TRITONS ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER
           PARTICLES BY TIME-OF FLIGHT BETWEEN BOTH SCINTILLATOR
           DETECTORS AND BY THE ENERGY DEPOSIT IN THE STOP-
           DETECTOR.
MONITOR    IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE 25 MEV NEUTRONS FROM THE
           PROMPT G-RAYS AND THE CONTINUUM PART OF THE NEUTRON
           SPECTRUM THE TIME BETWEEN THE SIGNAL OF THE PULSING
           SYSTEM AND THAT OF THE DELTA-E-SCINTILLATOR WAS
           MEASURED. BY SETTING A TIME WINDOW THE 25 NEUTRONS WERE
           SELECTED.
ANALYSIS   THE AREA OF THE TRITONS IN THE TOF VERSUS ENERGY SPEC-
           TRUM OVERLAPS SLIGTHLY THAT OF THE DEUTERONS. IN ORDER
           TO EVALUATE THE NUMBER OF MEASURED TRITONS THE EVENTS
           OF EQUAL-TIME DISTANCE TO THE DEUTERON BAND WERE
           SUMMED UP. THE NUMBER OF TRITONS WAS EVALUATED FROM
           A 6-PARAMETER FIT FOR THE RESULTING TRITON AND DEU-
           TERON DISTRIBUTIONS.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERROR IS EVALUATED FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF NO.OF
           TRITONS (+-8.9%), NO.OF DEUTERONS (+-2.3%) AND OF THE
           RATIO OF THE EFFICIENCIES FOR REGISTRATING ELASTICALLY
           SCATTERED DEUTERONS AND CAPTURED TRITONS (+-2%).
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM THE TEXT OF J,FBS,1,83,86.
