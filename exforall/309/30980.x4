METHOD     (RCHEM,ABSFY) THS FRAGMENTS WERE COLLECTED ON ALUMINIUM
           CATCHER FOILS (0.0025CM THICK) USING RECOIL CATCHER
           TECHNIQUES. AFTER THE IRRADIATION THE CATCHER FOILS
           WERE DISSOLVED AND THE CADMIUM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE
           SOLUTION RADIOCHEMICALLY AFTER SUITABLE COOLING TIME
           TO ALLOW COMPLETE DECAY OF CADMIUM 117.
