DETECTOR   (PROPC) Gas-flow beta proportional counter.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The beta activity, due to Cd-115-m, Cd-115-g
           and In-115-m in equilibrium with Cd-115-g, as a func-
           tion of time was correlated to the cumulative isomeric
           yields of Cd-115-m and Cd-115-g.

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM)
SAMPLE     Electrodeposited target of U-233 ( about 600 microgram
           covered with 0.0025 cm thick superpure aluminium
           catcher foil.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (INTB,RCHEM,ABSFY) After the irradiation the catcher
           foil, which collected the fission products, was
           dissolved and the cadmium was separated radiochemically
           after suitable cooling time to allow complete decay of
           cadmium 117.

SAMPLE     Electrodeposited Cf-252 source (about 5 micro gram)
METHOD     (RCHEM,ABSFY) The fragments were collected on aluminium
           catcher foils (0.0025cm thick) using recoil catcher
           techniques. After the irradiation the catcher foils
           were dissolved and the cadmium was separated from the
           solution radiochemically after suitable cooling time
           to allow complete decay of cadmium 117.
