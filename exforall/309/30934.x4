MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,INL)49-IN-115-M,,SIG) FOR NEUTRON FLUX
           CALIBRATION
           THE DECAY DATA AND CROSS SECTION VALUES ARE NOT GIVEN
           (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)   FOR TELESCOPE CALIBRATION
FACILITY   (CCW) 400 KEV NEUTRON GENERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-D)THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS  6.0E10 /M2*SEC.
METHOD     (EDE)
           THE ENERGY CALIBRATION HAS BEEN PERFORMED PARTLY WITH
           A-SOURCES AM-241,PU-239 AND RA-226,PARTLY BY LI-6(N,A)T
           REACTION ON THE NEUTRON GENERATOR.
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,SOLST)
           -A GAS PROPORTIONAL TELESCOPE CONSISTING OF :
            1)A GAS PROPORTIONAL CHAMBER EQUIVALENT TO 1 MICRO-M
              THICK SI
              THE CHAMBER WORKS WITH A GAS MIXTURE OF AR + 6% C-O2
              AT 46 KPA PRESSURE AND 500 V VOLTAGE.
            2)A SURFACE-BARRIER SEMICONDUCTOR SI-AU DETECTOR
              HAVING AN EFFECTIVE SURFACE OF 200 MM-2 AND SERVING
              FOR THE ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A-PARTICLES.
           -THE ENERGY RESOLUTION OF THE GAS PROPORTIONAL
            TELESCOPE FOR A-PARTICLES WITH E=5.48 KEV IS 160 KEV.
