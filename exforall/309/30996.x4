TITLE      Cross-section Measurement for the Ag-109(n,2n)Ag-108-m
           reaction.
FACILITY   (CCW) ZF-300-II intense neutron generator at lanzhou
           University.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a T-Ti
           target with 125 keV deuterons. The samples were irra-
           iated simultaneously at six different angular
           positions with respect to the deuteron beam axis. The
           corresponding neutron energies were determined by the
           method of cross-section ratios for Zr and Nb.
SAMPLE     Samples, 0.45 mm thick and with diameter of 20 mm,
           were made of 99.99% pure natural metal foils. The
           samples, together with zirconium foils, were
           sandwiched between niobium foils ( 1 mm thick).
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) CH8403 coaxial high-purity Germanium detector
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (41-NB-92-M,10.15D,DG,934.5,.99)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for gamma-ray self-
           absorption in the samples, the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma rays, and counting geometry.
