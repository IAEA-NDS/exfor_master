COMMENT     by ML:
            1) The fractional yields are given in the data table
               as compiled by Rider, who took them from 73AMI1.
               The original publication (thesis Venezia) gives
               independent yields as the measured data.
            2) In the thesis by Venezia also inedependent yields
               for I-131 to 136 are given.
            3) One line in the original data table (as converted
               from Rider) gave a fractional yield for I-138
               from another work (mistake in the Rider file).
               This line was deleted.
