SAMPLE     THE ENRICHED ISOTOPE OF GD-160 WAS OBTAINED FROM THE
           OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY, TN, IN THE FORM OF
           GD2O3 POWDER WITH AN ISOTOPIC ENRICHMENT OF 98.1
           PER-CENT (GD-155(0.18 PER-CENT), GD-156(0.33 PER-CENT),
           GD-157(0.44 PER-CENT), GD-158(0.94 PER-CENT), GD-160
            (98.1 PER-CENT)). THE SAMPLES WERE PREPARED WITHIN A
           1.6 CM DIA. PERSPEX RING AND SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO
           THIN CELLULOSE TAPES.

           NEUTRONS OF 0.46, 0.57, AND 0.75 MEV WERE OBTAINED
           FROM THE LI-7(P,N)BE-7 REACTION, AND NEUTRONS OF
           0.97, 1.22, 1.52, 2.22, AND 3.05 MEV WERE OBTAINED
           FROM THE HE-3(P,N)HE-3 REACTION. LITHIUM TARGETS WITH
           A THICKNESS OF 300 MICRO-GRAM/CM**2 WERE PREPARED
           BY VACUUM EVAPORATION ON A THIN TANTALUM BACKING. A
           VERY THIN GOLD LAYER, A FEW MICRO-GRAM/CM**2, WAS
           DEPOSITED ON THE TOP OF LITHIUM. THE TRITIUM TARGETS
           WERE COMPRISED OF 12 AND 16 CURIE TRITIUM ABSORBED
           IN A TITANIUM LAYER ON A THIN COPPER BACKING HAVING
           A THICKNESS OF 0.25 MM.
METHOD     (ACTIV) SAMPLE WAS PLACED BETWEEN TWO STANDARD
            SAMPLES OF K-I OF SIMILAR SIZE. NEUTRON FLUX AT THE
            PLACE OF IRRADIATION WAS FOUND TO BE IN THE ORDER OF
            10E+7 NEUTRONS/CM**2/SEC.

             AND 3 MEV. THE CORRESPONDING NEUTRON-ENERGY SPREAD
             LIES BETWEEN 190 AND 130 KEV.

           -SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
           1.FLUCTUATION IN THE PROTON-BEAM CURRENT +-6 PERCENT
           2.DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF GE(LI) DETECTOR 2-6 PERCENT
           3.SELF-ABSORPTION OF GAMMA-RAYS IN THE SAMPLES BETWEEN
             0.5 AND 2 PERCENT.
           4.ESTIMATION OF THE NUMBER OF NUCLEI, LESS THAN
             +-0.3 PERCENT. THE WEIGHING WAS DONE UP TO AN
             ACCURACY OF 0.01 MG.
           5.NON-REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE GEOMETRIES AT THE TIMES
             OF IRRADIATION AND COUNTING +-2 PERCENT.
           6.INTEGRATION OF THE PULSE-HEIGHT SPECTRUM, +-1 TO
             +-5 PERCENT.
           7.PULSE-SUMMING EFFECT LESS THAN 0.2 PERCENT.
           8.VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE STANDARD REACTION
             CROSS-SECTION HAD AN UNCERTAINTY OF ABOUT 7 PERCENT
           -STATISTICAL ERRORS IN THE COUNTS UNDER THE PHOTOPEAKS
            BETWEEN +-1 AND +-10 PERCENT.
           -ERROR IN THE DECAY PROPERTIES WERE NOT TAKEN INTO
            ACCOUNT.
           THE CROSS-SECTION ERRORS CONTAIN STATISTICAL AND
           SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY
           IN THE CROSS SECTION OF THE STANDARD REACTION.
           THERE ARE THREE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED
           IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED
           WITH THE GIVEN NEUTRON ENERGY. ONE OF THEM IS THE
           FINITE ENERGY SPREAD IN THE PROTON ENERGY BEFORE IT
           STRIKES THE TARGET. THE SECOND MAIN FACTOR IS THE
           DEGRADATION OF THE INCIDENT PROTON-BEAM ENERGY IN
           THE TARGET. THE THIRD FACTOR IS THE SOLID ANGLE
           SUBTENDED BY THE SAMPLE OF THE NEUTRON SOURCE.
