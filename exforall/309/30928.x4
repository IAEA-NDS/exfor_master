SAMPLE     The enriched isotope of Gd-160 was obtained from the
            Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA, in the form of
            Gd2O3 powder with an isotopic enrichment of 98.1%.
           The samples were prepared within a 1.6 cm dia. perspex
            ring and sandwiched between two thin cellulose tapes.
           The weighing was done up to an accuracy of 0.01 mg.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T)
           Neutrons of 0.46, 0.57, and 0.75 MeV were obtained
            from the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction, and neutrons of
            0.97, 1.22, 1.52, 2.22, and 3.05 MeV were obtained
            from the He-3(p,n)He-3 reaction.
           Lithium targets with a thickness of 300 ug/cm**2 were
            prepared by vacuum evaporation on a thin tantalum
            backing.
           A very thin gold layer, a few ug/cm**2, was deposited
            on the top of lithium. The tritium targets were
            comprised of 12 and 16 Curie tritium absorbed in a
            titanium layer on a thin copper backing having a
            thickness of 0.25 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample was placed between two standard
            samples of K-I of similar size.
           Neutron flux at the place of irradiation was found to
            be in the order of 10E+7 neutrons/cm**2/sec.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100 cm**3 ORTEC Ge(Li) detector
           (BF3) Neutron flux was monitored using 4pi BF3 neutron
            counter
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) There are three factors that have been
            considered in order to determine the uncertainty
            associated with the given neutron energy.
           One of them is the finite energy spread in the proton
            energy before it strikes the target.
           The second main factor is the degradation of the
            incident proton-beam energy in the target.
           The third factor is the solid angle subtended by the
            sample of the neutron source.
           Total neutron-energy spread 200-150 keV from
            1. Energy spread in the proton beam 20 keV.
            2. Degradation of incident beam in the T target 210
               to 140 keV for a proton-beam energy of between 1
               and 3 MeV. The corresponding neutron-energy spread
               lies between 190 and 130 keV.
            3. Angle subtended by the sample at the neutron
               source 22 - 55 keV.
           (ERR-T) The cross-section errors contain statistical
            and systematic uncertainties, including the
            uncertainty in the cross section of the standard
            reaction.
           Error in the decay properties were not taken into
            account.
