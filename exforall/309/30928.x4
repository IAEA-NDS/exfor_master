SAMPLE     160Gd2O3 powder with an isotopic enrichment of 98.1%.
           The samples were prepared within a 1.6 cm dia. perspex
            ring and sandwiched between two thin cellulose tapes.
           The weighing was done up to an accuracy of 0.01 mg.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T)
           Neutrons of 0.46, 0.57, and 0.75 MeV were obtained
            from the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction, and neutrons of
            0.97, 1.22, 1.52, 2.22, and 3.05 MeV were obtained
            from the He-3(p,n)He-3 reaction.
           Lithium targets with a thickness of 300 ug/cm**2 were
            prepared by vacuum evaporation on a thin tantalum
            backing.
           A very thin gold layer, a few ug/cm**2, was deposited
            on the top of lithium. The tritium targets were
            comprised of 12 and 16 Curie tritium absorbed in a
            titanium layer on a thin copper backing having a
            thickness of 0.25 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample was placed between two standard
            samples of K-I of similar size.
           Neutron flux at the place of irradiation was found to
            be in the order of 10E+7 neutrons/cm**2/sec.

INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) Total neutron-energy spread from
            1. Energy spread in the proton beam 20 keV.
            2. Degradation of incident beam in the T target 210
               to 140 keV for a proton-beam energy of between 1
               and 3 MeV. The corresponding neutron-energy spread
               lies between 190 and 130 keV.
            3. Angle subtended by the sample at the neutron
               source 22 - 55 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The cross-section errors contain
            statistical and systematic uncertainties, including
            the uncertainty in the cross section of the standard
            reaction.
COMMENT    See EXFOR 30678.002 and 30692.002 for similar
            experiment at different energies.

            which mentions that the error analysis is the same as
            in EXFOR 30678.
