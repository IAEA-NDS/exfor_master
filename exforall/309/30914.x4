TITLE      Thermal neutron absorption cross section measurement
           for gold.
FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) Heavy-water reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beams from the heavy-water reactor were
           first collimated and then reached a NaCl(200) mono-
           chromator. Through bragg diffraction in NaCl(200) the
           monoenergetic 0.0253 eV neutrons were selected. Between
           the NaCl(200) monochromator and the measured sample a
           mechanical monochromator was inserted in order to cut
           off the neutrons with high energy.
SAMPLE     Gold foils, purity 99.9%, diameter 4.2 cm, thickness
           1.527g/cm2.
METHOD     (MANGB)
DETECTOR   (BF3) Using 80% enriched boron-10.
           (D4PI) using manganese sulphate solution as detector
           medium.
CORRECTION For the total cross section corrections have been made
           for the secondary-neutron effect and dead time of
           detecting system. For the absorption cross section
           of gold corrections have been made for the reflected-
           neutron effect, secondary-neutron effect, escaped-
           neutron effect and the boundary effect of the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors have been considered for:
             * counting statistics,
             * energy resolution and
             * energy calibration of the crystal spectrometer.
