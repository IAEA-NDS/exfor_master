TITLE      Measurement of fission yields far from the center of
           isotopic distributions in the thermal neutron fission
           of 235U

ADD-RES    Independent yields are compiled in Exfor30960
COMMENT    The Kr and Xe precursors of Rb and Cs isotopes are
             retained within the target and decay there. Therefore
             the yields measured for Rb and Cs isotopes are cumu-
             lative. Since independent yields of Rb isotopes below
             A=93 and of Cs isotopes below A=143 (see Exfor30960)
             are a small fraction of their cumulative yields, it
             was not possible to calculate them with reasonable
             accuracy. Instead, the obtained cumulative yields are
             presented here.
           Comments by compiler:
             The independent yields from this experiment and more
             details are given in exfor30960. The information on
             the cumulative yields is very brief and in Hebrew. It
             is assumed that the sample and method were the same
             as in Exfor30960 and are partly reproduced here.
           No information is given on analysis, error analysis and
             how absolute yields were obtained (monitor).
             However, the yields (not the errors]) for Rb-91 and
             Cs-139 are identical to literature values shown in
             Table 9 of IA-1345.
