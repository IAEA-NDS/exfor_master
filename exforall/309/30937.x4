TITLE      THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS
AUTHOR     (K.SRIRAMAMURTY,CH.SURYANARAYANA,D.L.SASTRY,
           SWAMI JNANANANDA)
INSTITUTE  (3INDAUW)
MONITOR    THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS ESTIMATED,EMPLOYING THE GOLD FOIL
           ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) 40 MW CIRUS REACTOR
INC-SOURCE *THE NEUTRON BEAM:COLLIMATED TO 1 INCH IN DIAM. AND
            INTENSITY OF 10E6 NEUTRONS/SEC/CM**2.
           *THE BEAM IS FILTERED FOR GAMMA-RAYS AND FAST NEUTRONS
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (COINC) FAST-SLOW COINCIDENCE SPECTOMETER USED
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           *1.5 X 1.5 INCH NAI(TL) CRYSTAL,COUPLED TO RCA 6810A
            PHOTOMULTIPLIER.
           *NAI(TL) CRYSTAL WAS COVERED ON ALL ITS OPEN
            SURFACES WITH LITHIUM CARBONATE TO PREVENT THE ENTRY
            OF THE SCATTERED NEUTRONS.
           *RESOLUTION : 8.4 % FOR THE 662. KEV 137-CS PEAK.

REACTION   (58-CE-140(N,G)58-CE-141,,SPC,,REL)
           INTENSITIES ARE RELATIVE TO THE INTENSITY OF 668 KEV
           GAMMA RAY.
REFERENCE  (J,IPA,7,(8),542,69) DETAILED INFORMATION.DATA TABLES.
           (C,67KANPUR,,416,67) EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP.
SAMPLE     NATURAL SAMPLE OF 99.99 %. CE-OXIDE
ERR-ANALYS THE OVERALL ERROR IN THE ENERGY VALUES IS OF:
           -IN THE REGION BELOW 200 KEV :   2 %
           -IN THE REGION ABOVE 200 KEV :   1 %
           THE LARGER ERROR IN THE LOW ENERGY REGION MAY BE
           ATTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHT NONLINEARITY IN THAT REGION.
COMMENT    THE CONTRIBUTION OF CE-142(N,G)CE-143 (WITH SIMILAR
           GAMMA LINES, BUT QUITE DIFF. HALF-LIFE) HAS BEEN
           CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND FOUND TO BE ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE
STATUS     DATA TAKEN FROM  J,IPA,VOL 7,PAG 544.TABLE 3, 1969.
