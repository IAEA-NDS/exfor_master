           (C,67KANPUR,,416,1967) Experimental set-up.
MONITOR    The neutron flux was estimated, employing the gold foil
           activation technique.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) 40 MW CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE *The neutron beam: collimated to 1 inch in diam. and
            intensity of 10**6 neutrons/sec/cm**2.
           *The beam is filtered for gamma-rays and fast neutrons
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (COINC) Fast-slow coincidence spectometer used
DETECTOR   (NAICR) *1.5 x 1.5 inch NaI(Tl) crystal,coupled to
                     RCA 6810A photomultiplier.
           *Nai(Tl) crystal was covered on all its open
            surfaces with lithium carbonate to prevent the entry
            of the scattered neutrons.
           *Resolution : 8.4 % for the 662. keV 137-Cs peak.

REACTION   (58-CE-140(N,G)58-CE-141,,SPC,,REL)
           Intensities are relative to the intensity of 668 keV
           gamma-ray.
SAMPLE     Natural sample of 99.99%. Ce-oxide
ERR-ANALYS The overall error in the energy values is of:
           -in the region below 200 keV :   2 %
           -in the region above 200 keV :   1 %
           The larger error in the low energy region may be
           attributed to the slight nonlinearity in that region.
COMMENT    The contribution of Ce-142(n,g)Ce-143 (with similar
           gamma lines, but quite diff. half-life) has been
           carefully examined and found to be almost negligible
