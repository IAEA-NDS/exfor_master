TITLE      Fission fragment angular momentum: independent isomeric

           fission of U-233, Pu-239 and Pu-241.

SAMPLE     Encapsulated solutions containing approximately 10
           microg. of U-233, Pu-239 and Pu-241.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron flux of 1 x 10**13 n/cm2s
METHOD     (RCHEM)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector coupled to a series-80 Canberra
           4k analyzer.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Separation time activities for Cs-138-m and
           Cs-138-g were evaluated from least square fitting of
           the time dependent activity profile, using standard
           decay-growth equations, and were correlated to the
           corresponding independent isomeric yields and the
           fractional cumulative yield of Xe-138, of which the
           values for U-233, Pu-239 and Pu-241 were taken from
           literature.
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The values reported are the means of three
           measurements. The error on an individual measurement
           is the compounded error due to:
              * counting statistics,
              * abundances of gamma lines,
              * the FCY value of Xe-138,
              * decay constants,
              * irradiation and separation times.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Table 1 of Radiochimica
           Acta, vol. 39, 1-3 (1985).
