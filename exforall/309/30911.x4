TITLE      FISSION FRAGMENT ANGULAR MOMENTUM: INDEPENDENT ISOMERIC

SAMPLE     ENCAPSULATED SOLUTIONS CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 10
           MICROG. OF U-233, PU-239 AND PU-241.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) SEPARATION TIME ACTIVITIES FOR CS-138-M AND
           CS-138-G WERE EVALUATED FROM LEAST SQUARE FITTING OF
           THE TIME DEPENDENT ACTIVITY PROFILE, USING STANDARD
           DECAY-GROWTH EQUATIONS, AND WERE CORRELATED TO THE
           CORRESPONDING INDEPENDENT ISOMERIC YIELDS AND THE
           FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE YIELD OF XE-138, OF WHICH THE
           VALUES FOR U-233, PU-239 AND PU-241 WERE TAKEN FROM
           LITERATURE.
INC-SPECT  THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
ERR-ANALYS THE VALUES REPORTED ARE THE MEANS OF THREE
           MEASUREMENTS. THE ERROR ON AN INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENT
           IS THE COMPOUNDED ERROR DUE TO COUNTING STATISTICS,
           ABUNDANCES OF GAMMA LINES, THE FCY VALUE OF XE-138,
           DECAY CONSTANTS, IRRADIATION AND SEPARATION TIMES.
