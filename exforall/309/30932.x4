TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF CAPTURE REACTION H(N,D)G AT 25.6 MEV
FACILITY   (VDGT,3DDRROS)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 9.5 MEV PULSED DEUTERON BEAM ON TI-T TARGET
           -THE INTENSITY OF THE COLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM WAS
            4 X 10E5 N/SEC AT 2 MICRO-A DEUTERON CURRENT.
SAMPLE     GASEOUS HYDROGEN TARGET AT PRESSURE OF 0.4 MPA.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,EDE,OLMS)
           -TO RECONSTRUCT,THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE NEUTRON AND
            OUTGOING CHARGED PARTICLE WERE INSTALLED IN THE
            TELESCOPE TWO POSITION-SENSITIVE MULTISTEP CHAMBERS.
           -DEUTERONS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LOW-ENERGY CHARGED PART.
            WERE SEPARATED FROM THE ELASTICALLY SCATTERED PROTONS
            ONLINE AND DATA WERE RECORDED EVENT-BY-EVENT.
            IN AN OFFLINE D WERE SEPARATED FROM OTHER CHARGED
            PARTICLES.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)
           TWO SCINTILLATION COUNTERS, WHICH SERVED FOR ENERGY
           DETERMINATION (EDE METHOD) AND PARTICLE SEPARATION(TOF)
           (PROPC)2 MULTIWIRE PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS.
           THE FIRST OPERATED AS VETO DETECTOR AND THE SECOND ONE
           PROVIDED A COINCIDENCE SIGNAL WHICH ENSURED THAT ALL
           DETECTED PARTICLES WERE PRODUCED WITHIN THE GAS CELL.
           THE HYDROGEN GAS TARGET IS USED AS COUNTER GAS.
           * TWO POSITION-SENSITIVE MULTISTEP CHAMBERS WERE USED
           FOR DETERMINATION OF THE TRACK COORDINATES IN ORDER TO
           RECONSTRUCT THE NEUTRON-DEUTERON ANGLE.
PART-DET   (D)
           (P) ELASTICALLY SCATTERED PROTONS.

ANALYSIS   CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED FROM RATIO OF THE
           NUMBER OF MEASURED DEUTERONS TO THE NUMBER OF
           ELASTICALLY SCATTERED PROTONS USING A MONTE CARLO
           SIMULATION.

REACTION   (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,DA,D,,DERIV)
ANALYSIS   *THE DIFF. CROSS SECTION OF DEUTERONS PRODUCED WAS
           DETERMINED BY COMPARISON OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION WITH THE RESULT OF A MONTE CARLO SIMULA-
           TION INCLUDING ENERGY AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF IN-
           COMING NEUTRONS, MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND ENERGY LOSS
           OF DEUTERONS, DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES AND RESOLUTIONS,
           AND GEOMETRICAL EFFECTS.-
ERR-ANALYS THE LARGE ERROR IS MAINLY CAUSED BY COUNTING STATIS-
           STICS.-
