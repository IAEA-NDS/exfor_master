TITLE      Measurement of capture reaction H(n,d)g at 25.6 MeV
FACILITY   (VDGT,3DDRROS)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 9.5 MeV pulsed deuteron beam on Ti-T target
           -the intensity of the colimated neutron beam was
            4 x 10**5 n/sec at 2 micro-a deuteron current.
SAMPLE     Gaseous hydrogen target at pressure of 0.4 mpA.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,EDE,OLMS)
           -To reconstruct the angle between the neutron and
            outgoing charged particle, in the telescope two
            position-sensitive multistep chambers were installed.
           -Deuterons together with other low-energy charged part.
            were separated from the elastically scattered protons
            online and data were recorded event-by-event.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)
           Two scintillation counters, which served for energy
           determination (ede method) and particle separation(TOF)
           (MWPC) 2 multiwire proportional counters.
           The first operated as veto detector and the second one
           provided a coincidence signal which ensured that all
           detected particles were produced within the gas cell.
           The hydrogen gas target is used as counter gas.
           * Two position-sensitive multistep chambers were used
           for determination of the track coordinates in order to
           reconstruct the neutron-deuteron angle.
PART-DET   (D)
           (P) Elastically scattered protons.

REACTION   (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined from ratio of the
           number of measured deuterons to the number of
           elastically scattered protons using a Monte Carlo
           simulation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-S) Statistical part       :   1.5 %
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic  part       :   2.6 %
            a)Background corr.( 2 % )
            b)Uncertainty of n-p elast. cross section   ( 1 % )
COMMENT    The measured total cross section for n-p capture
           reaction (24.2+-0.7) micro-barn correspond to total
           cross section (870.+-26) micro-barn for the
           photo-disintegration of the deuteron at 15.0 MeV
           gamma's energy in lab. system.

REACTION   (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,DA,D,,DERIV)
ANALYSIS   *The diff. cross section of deuterons produced was
           determined by comparison of the experimental angular
           distribution with the result of a Monte Carlo simula-
           tion including energy and angular distribution of in-
           coming neutrons, multiple scattering and energy loss
           of deuterons, detector efficiencies and resolutions,
           and geometrical effects.-
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty includes:
             * The large error is mainly caused by counting
                                                     statistics.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic  part     :   0.9 micro-b/sr
COMMENT    The measured data corresponds to the value of
           5.8 +- 2.3 micro-barn/sr for the forward differential
           cross section of the photo-disintegration reaction
           under 15.03 MeV gammas.
