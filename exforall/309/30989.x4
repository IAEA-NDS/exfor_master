           Cf-252 neutron spectrum.

SAMPLE     Natural and depleted uranium foils of 9 mm diameter
           and 0.1 to 0.32 mm thick. Purity was determined to be
           92.5% by neutron activation, using standard uranium
           foil, and chemical analysis.
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Neutron flux was determined from the informa-
           tion provided by the manufacturer. The contribution of
           spontaneous fission neutrons of Cm-248 to the neutron
           flux density was estimated to be 0.13%.
INC-SPECT  Cf-252 fission neutron spectrum
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Cross section was calculated from the pure
           activity of Te-132 which was determined from the net
           area under the 228.2 keV photopeak.
CORRECTION The net area of the 228.2 keV photopeak of Te-132 was
           corrected for branching ratio, gamma-ray self
           absorption, fission yield, detector efficiency,
           irradiation time, decay time, counting time and
           interferences from neighbouring photopeaks of Np-239
           and Pa-234. The relative contributions from these
           photopeaks to the 228.20 keV peak of Te-132 were
           determined by measuring the net areas under 278.0 keV
           and 1001.0 keV of Np-239 and Pa-234 respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main sources of errors are due to
           inaccuracy of:
             * location of foils,
             * neutron flux,
             * counting statistics,
             * weight of foils and
             * interferences form neighbouring photopeak
