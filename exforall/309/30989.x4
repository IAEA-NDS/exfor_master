TITLE      AVERAGED U-238 FISSION CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT IN
           CF-252 NEUTRON SPECTRUM.

SAMPLE     NATURAL AND DEPLETED URANIUM FOILS OF 9 MM DIAMETER
           AND 0.1 TO 0.32 MM THICK. PURITY WAS DETERMINED TO BE
           92.5% BY NEUTRON ACTIVATION, USING STANDARD URANIUM
           FOIL, AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.
INC-SOURCE (CF252) NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED FROM THE INFORMA-
           TION PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE CONTRIBUTION OF
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION NEUTRONS OF CM-248 TO THE NEUTRON
           FLUX DENSITY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 0.13%.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) CROSS SECTION WAS CALCULATED FROM THE PURE
           ACTIVITY OF TE-132 WHICH WAS DETERMINED FROM THE NET
           AREA UNDER THE 228.2 KEV PHOTOPEAK.
CORRECTION THE NET AREA OF THE 228.2 KEV PHOTOPEAK OF TE-132 WAS
           CORRECTED FOR BRANCHING RATIO, GAMMA-RAY SELF
           ABSORPTION, FISSION YIELD, DETECTOR EFFICIENCY,
           IRRADIATION TIME, DECAY TIME, COUNTING TIME AND
           INTERFERENCES FROM NEIGHBOURING PHOTOPEAKS OF NP-239
           AND PA-234. THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THESE
           PHOTOPEAKS TO THE 228.20 KEV PEAK OF TE-132 WERE
           DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE NET AREAS UNDER 278.0 KEV
           AND 1001.0 KEV OF NP-239 AND PA-234 RESPECTIVELY.
ERR-ANALYS MAIN SOURCES OF ERRORS ARE DUE TO INACCURACY OF LOCA-
           TION OF FOILS, NEUTRON FLUX, COUNTING STATISTICS, WEIG
           OF FOILS AND INTERFERENCES FORM NEIGHBOURING PHOTOPEAK
