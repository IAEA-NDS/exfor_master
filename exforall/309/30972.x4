TITLE      Measurement of the cross sections for the reactions
           Cr-52(n,2n)Cr-51, Zn-66(n,2n)Zn-65, Y-89(n,2n)Y-88
           and Zr-96(n,2n)Zr-95 from 13.5 to 14.8 MeV.
FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a 0.5 mm
           thick Al-backed Ti-T target with a 190 +- 10 keV
           deuteron beam. Neutron energy was selected by the
           angular position of the sample with respect to the
           deuteron beam axis. The neutron-energy scale was
           verified by measuring the ratios of the Zr-89 to
           Nb-92-m specific activities induced in sandwiched Zr
           and Nb foils at 12.5 and 97.5 degrees and comparing
           them to expected ones based on existing cross section
           data.
SAMPLE     Yttrium-oxide powder samples and high-purity metallic
           samples of natural Cr,Zn and Zr.
METHOD     (ACTIV) For the yttrium-oxide samples, sandwiched
           between two Nb foils, the mean of the fluences at both
           monitor foils was taken. In all other cases the fluence
           at the sample position was calculated from the fluence
           at the monitor foil position using a 1/r**2 dependence
           and accounting for neutron absorption in the sample
           and monitor foil.
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG) Neutron fluence.
           Nb foils with the same shape as the samples were placed
           back-to-back behind each sample. The yttrium-oxide
           samples were sandwiched between two fluence monitor
           foils.

CORRECTION Activation enhancement due to elastic neutron scat-
           tering in the sample and monitor foils and due to
           inscattering by neighbouring material was estimated.
           In all cases where applicable, the corrections for
           this and for relating the measured cross sections to
           the average neutron energy were negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Nonnegligible uncertainties involve
           uncertainties in:
             * counting statistics,
             * relative gamma counts-to-activity convers. factors,
             * mass and purity of samples,
             * isotopic abundance,
             * survival factor of Nb-92-m,
             * detector efficiencies,
             * average neutron energies,
             * monitor reference cross section and
             * irradiation geometry.
           Total uncertainties in cross sections were obtained
           by adding the uncertainty components (standard
           deviations) in quadrature.
           Detailed information on the size of all sources of
           uncertainties is given in Tables 3 and 4 of the
           reference.

           When measuring the Zr-95 activity produced in the
           nat. Zr(n,x) reaction,
           one measures the sum of the following cross sections:
           a) the Zr-96(n,2n) reaction, providing by far
              the main contribution;
           b) the Zr-96 (n,d)+(n,np)+(n,pn) Y-95 reaction,
