TITLE      Prompt Neutrons from 236U Fission Fragments
AUTHOR     (J.W.Boldeman,A.R.de L.Musgrove,R.L.Walsh)
INSTITUTE  (3AULAUA)
REFERENCE  (J,AUJ,24,821,1971)
SAMPLE     The 235U targets were prepared by electrospraying
           235U nitrate in  ethanol solution onto gold-plated
           VYNS films. The 235U target,  gold layer, and VYNS
           film thickness were respectively 30, 15,  and 20
           mu-g/cm2. The 235U target was placed at 45.degr. to
           the  axis of the fragment detectors and the neutron
           beam.
FACILITY   (REAC,3AULAUA) A highly collimated beam of thermal
           neutrons was obtained from  the 10 MW reactor HIFAR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The thermal neutron flux at the experiment was
           1.5 x 10**7  neutrons/cm2/s and the beam diameter was
           1.5 cm.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The two fission fragment detectors were
           typical surface barrier diodes  made of n-type
           silicon and operated at 90 V reverse bias. Both
           detectors were  collimated to active areas of 3 cm2.
           (STANK) The neutron detector was a large liquid
           scintillator tank containing  approximately 60 l. of
           NE323, a trimethyl benzene scintillator containing a
           loading of 0.5% by weight gadolinium.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for scintillator geometry and
           backscatter  from the complementary fragment.  The
           detector geometry and backscatter correction assumed
           that:
             (l)  the excitation energies of the two
                  fragments were correlated, and
             (2) the detection efficiency of the scintillator was
           constant with  neutron energy.
           The remaining contributions (i.e. from neutrons
           correlated with the fragment direction) were corrected
           for detector geometry and backscatter.
           It was assumed that, for a particular mass division,the
           scission neutrons were emitted from each fragment in
           the same proportions as those from the moving fragments
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,1.) dead time losses was less than 1%
ADD-RES    Additionally in the article (Austr.J. of Phys.,24,821,
           1971) on figures are given:
             * neutron emission per fragment plotted against
               fragment mass for the six indicated ranges of total
               fragment kinetic energy.
             * Total neutron emission from both fragments per
               fission plotted against total fragment kin. energy
             * Neutron emission per fragment plotted against total
               fragment kinetic energy for the eight indicated
               mass groups.
