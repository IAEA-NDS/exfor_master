           (J,NP/A,402,247,83)THE EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES
                              DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
SAMPLE     TERBIUM METAL TARGET 11.2 G IN WEIGHT,4.8 CM-2 AREA AND
           3MM THICKNESS.
FACILITY   (REAC,3IRQNRI)5MW LIGHT-WATER-MODERATED RESEARCH
            REACTOR
INC-SPECT  FAST NEUTRON SPECTRA FROM REACTOR
METHOD     TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS WERE USED,NAMELY THE ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTIONS SET-UP AND THE TOF FACILITY
STATUS     DATA WERE TAKEN FROM J,JP/G,13,677,1983,TAB1 FOR
           LEGENDRE COEFF.NUMERICAL DATA OF INTEGRAL CROSS
           SECTIONS WERE REQUESTED FROM AUTHOR,880823.

           THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION DATA WERE NORMALISED TO THE
           581 KEV ISOTROPIC TRANSITION.
METHOD     GAMMA-RAY SINGLES SPECTRA WERE DETECTED AT SIX ANGLES:
           90,100,110,125,135 AND 148 DEG. WITH RESPECT TO THE
           INCIDENT NEUTRON BEAM.THE TARGET WAS POSITIONED AT 45
           DEG. RELATIVE TO THE NEUTRON BEAM DIRECTION.
ANALYSIS   GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA WERE ANALYSED BY FITTING A GAUSSIAN
           DISTRIBUTION TO THE PEAK AND A SIMPLE POLYNOMIAL
           FUNCTION TO THE BACKGROUND USING THE COMPUTER CODE
           BABIL. THE MEASURED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENTS
           FOR THE MOST INTENSE G-TRANSITIONS WERE COMPARED WITH
           THE THEORETICAL VALUES CALCULATED USING THE HAUSER-
           FESHBACH-MOLDAUER FORMALISM IN THE PROGRAM CINDY.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 40 CM-3 COAXIAL DETECTOR.THE EFFICIENCY WAS 6%
                  AND ITS RESOLUTION WAS 3KEV AT 1332KEV.
