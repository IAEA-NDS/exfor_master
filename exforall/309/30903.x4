TITLE      EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENT OF THE RATIO OF THE REACTION
           CROSS SECTION (N,2N) FOR THE NATURAL MIXTURES OF LEAD
           AND IRON ISOTOPES WITH 14 MEV NEUTRONS BY THE METHOD OF
           MODERATED NEUTRON-NEUTRON COINCIDENCES

SAMPLE     WERE USED FE AND PB SAMPLES IN ISOTOPES NATURAL
           MIXTURES THE SAMPLE DIAMETER WAS 22 MM.
MONITOR    THE MONITORING OF NEUTRON BEAM WAS DONE BY A SCREENED
           SI-AU DETECTOR WITH ACTIVE SURFACE LIMITED TO 0,8 MM-2.
           THE MONITORING WAS ALSO CARRIED OUT BY ONE-CHANNEL
           ANALYZER IN WHOSE WINDOW WAS THE ALFA-PEAK.
           CONTINOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE ALFA PARTICLES HAVE BEEN
           CARRIED OUT FOR CONTROLLING THE TARGET STATE.
FACILITY   (CCW,3BULBLA) NEUTRON GENERATOR OF 140 KEV, TYPE
                         SAMES-150 D.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) WAS USED TI-T TARGET
METHOD     THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MODERATED
           NEUTRON-NEUTRON COINCIDENCES.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) TWELVE NEUTRON DETECTORS OF CHM-17 TYPE WORKING
                   IN COINCIDENCE.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE DETERMINED BY THE SUM OF THE STATISTICAL
           ERRORS OF THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED DOUBLE COINCIDENCES
           AND THE ERROR FROM CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF INCIDENT
           COINCIDENCES. FOR MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF ERROR
