TITLE      Experimental measurement of the ratio of the reaction
           cross section (n,2n) for the natural mixtures of lead
           and iron isotopes with 14 MeV neutrons by the method of
           moderated neutron-neutron coincidences

SAMPLE     Fe and Pb samples in natural isotopix
           mixtures.  The sample diameter was 22 mm.
MONITOR    The monitoring of neutron beam was done by a screened
           Si-Au detector with active surface limited to 0.8 mm2.
           The monitoring was also carried out by one-channel
           analyzer in whose window was the alpha-peak.
           Continous measurements of the alpha particles have
           been arried out for controlling the target state.
FACILITY   (CCW,3BULBLA) Neutron generator of 140 keV, type
                         SAMES-150D.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Ti-T target
METHOD     (COINC) The method is based on the principle of
           moderated neutron-neutron coincidences.
DETECTOR   (COIN,PROPC) Twelve neutron detectors of CHM-17 type
            working in coincidence.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are determined by:
             * the sum of the statistical errors of the number of
               registered double coincidences and
             * the error from calculating the number of incident
               coincidences. For more detailed explanation of
               error analysis see INDC(BUL)-10 report
