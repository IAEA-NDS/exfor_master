TITLE      Neutron-induced fission of actinium-227,
           protactinium-231, and neptunium-237: mass distribution

INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
REFERENCE  (C,65SALZBURG,1,439,196503)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Apsara, fixed irradiation position
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum with essentially the
             (degraded) fission spectrum part causing fissions in
             Ac-227, Pa-231 and Np-237.
           Irradiation times: 8 to 48 hrs.
METHOD     (RVAL).Relative to U-235 thermal fission (monitor).
           Samples and monitor are irradiated and counted (almost)
             simultaneously and mounted in the same way in order
             to avoid corrections and minimize uncertainties.

DETECTOR   (PROPC).Sugarman type methane flow beta p.c. with
           plastic scintillator cosmic-ray guard.
ANALYSIS   Measured R-values were converted to relative yields
           using U-235 yields from literature and assumed values
           for the reference yields of the respective fission
           reactions. They could not be converted to absolute
           yields due to insufficient number of yield points.
           Numerical values of measured R-values were not
           published. Relative yields were calculated from
           measuered R-values (=R(x)) according to:
              Y(x,Ac) = R(x) * Y(x,U) * Y(91,Ac) / Y(91,U)
           equivalent to:
              Data = R(x) * Monit2 * Assum / Monit1
CORRECTION Several corrections are mentioned but were not applied:
           1. Contribution of U-238 fast fissions in the natural
              uranium sample, which would require corrections in
              the form of an increase of relative yields in the
              mass range 103-125 by 3-15%.
           2. Differences in genetic relationships and the charge
              distributions between U-235 and the other reactions.
ERR-ANALYS Error contributions are mentioned but individual errors
           are not assessed:
           1. Errors of U-235 reference yields
           2. U-238 fast fissions not corrected for (see:
              'CORRECTION')
           3. Sample mounting, counting geometry
           4. Counting statistics
           5. Differences in genetic relationships and charge
              distributions (see: 'CORRECTION') are considered to
              lead to minor errors only.
           The total errors of yield values are estimated to be
              about 20%, although the internal consistency of the
              data is reported to be much better (see: analysis).
           no individual errors given by authors.
DECAY-DATA No information given as it is assumed that for this
           method no decay corrections are required.
COMMENT    by compiler (ML): No isomeric states are indicated in
           the publication. In the data Table the ground state is
           assumed in all cases where isomeric states exist.
           However, if existing isomeric states were unknown at
           the time of the experiment or ignored, additional
           uncertainties have to be taken into account.
