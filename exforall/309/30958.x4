TITLE      The radiochemical yield in the spontaneous fission of
           238U
SAMPLE     natural uranium as reactor-grade U3O8, dissolved in
           nitric acid (2N HNO3)
METHOD     (ABSFY).The number of fissions were determined using
            the uranium weight and the U-238 spontaneous fission
            half life. For calculating the yields, the 8.04E+15
            year half life by E.Segre, Phys.Rev.86(1959)21 was
            used, as the yields agreed better with other published
            values.
            COMMENT: The fission yields calculated using the
            1.01E+16 yrs half life by R.L.Fleischer and P.B.Price,
            Phys.Rev.133(1964)B63 are also given in Table 1 of
            J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem.35(1973)1793 but were found to be
            discrepant with other data and therefore discarded by
            the authors.

REACTION   (92-U-238(0,F)42-MO-99,CUM,FY)
SAMPLE     6 l solution containing 3.067 kg of uranium was used.
           Mo carrier was added and all molybdenum in the sample
           removed chemically.
METHOD     (RCHEM).The solution stood for 21 days to accumulate
           fission product molybdenum. Then again Mo carrier was
           added and Mo precipitated and purified.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curve for the molybdenum activity was
           measured for 15 days and found to follow the 67 hr half
           life of Mo-99.
CORRECTION A standardised Mo-99 source was used to determine the
           counter geometry and required corrections for back-
           scattering and the finite shape of the measured source.
COMMENT    The MO-99 yield given in the DATA table is based on the
           U-238 spontaneous fission half life of 8.04E+15 years.
           The 1.01E+16 years half life would have given a fission
           yield for Mo-99 of 7.2+-0.4.

REACTION   (92-U-238(0,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY)
SAMPLE     4 l solution containing 4.015 kg of uranium was used.
           Chemical procedures were applied and the solution
           distilled to remove all iodine already present in the
           sample.
METHOD     (RCHEM).The solution stood for 8 days to accumulate
           fission product iodine. The procedure for purification
           from iodine (see SAMPLE above) was repeated. The
           extracted solution stood for 2 more days to allow the
           short lived iodine isotopes to decay. Then the iodine
           was further purified, precipitate as AgI and prepared
           for beta counting.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curve was decomposed into a 20.8 hr
           component (I-133) and an 8 day component (I-131).
CORRECTION The counter was calibrated using K2SO4 (as beta
           energies of natural potassium are similar to those of
           I-133). For self-absorption and backscattering
           corrections, a source containing I-133 was produced.
COMMENT    The authors state that their I-131 yield is lower than
           that reported by other authors. The reason could be
           that their experiment was designed to measure the I-133
           yield and they did not allow sufficient time to produce
           enough I-131. The discrepancy was probably due to
           low counts and poor statistics.
           The iodine yields given in the DATA table are based on
           the U-238 spontaneous fission half life of 8.04E+15
           years. The 1.01E+16 years half life would have given th
           following fission yields:
                I-131       0.35+-0.20
                I-133       7.0+-0.5
