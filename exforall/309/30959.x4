COMMENT    by M.Lammer: This entry is for the time being left as
           converted from the Rider file. The data, obtained by
           B.F.Rider as private communication (and not available
           to the compiler), were published in different places,
           revised later and are partially included in other EXFOR
           entries.
STATUS     (RIDER).Reference 71RAM1
           (NCHKD).Only partially checked (see comment).
           (SPSDD) .All values were revised later by the authors
             in Radiochimica Acta 37 (1984) 63, on the basis of
             the critique and corrections by M.Lammer (73Paris).

COMMENT    Absolute Mo-99 values reduced 9.1% per Lammer (73LAM1)
           to adjust authors 2200 m/s fission cross sections to
            effective fission cross sections at an assumed 40
            degrees C. Neutron temperature and epithermal index =
            .0022. data now published in 71JAI1.
           *** Not superseded in Rider file
           Comment by M.Lammer: Contrary to the comment above
             (from the automatic conversion from the Rider file),
             the values given in the data Table are the author's
             values (as published in BARC-584, 1971) not those
             recalculated by M.Lammer (see Exfor30504).
           The monitor may not be common (see FLAG,not checked).
FLAG       (1.) Absolute method (according to BARC-584)
           (2.) Modified comparison method (according BARC-584)
STATUS     Added by ML: Data are identical to those in BARC-584
             (1971) and included in Exfor30504 (see FLAG), but:
           (SPSDD,30504004) where the BARC-584 value is replaced
             by the revised value from Radiochim.Acta 19(1973)90.

HISTORY    (19911127A).ML: Monitor: Reaction product changed (from

                which suggests that R-values have been measured.
