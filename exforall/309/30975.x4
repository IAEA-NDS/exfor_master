SAMPLE     A sandwich of 100 mg/cm**2 thick thorium and depleted
           uranium (99% U-238) discs with a 0.1mm thick Lexan
           plastic in between.

INC-SOURCE (P-T)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Lexan plastic
METHOD     The lexan pieces were etched to reveal fission
           tracks on both surfaces of the lexan. In counting
           the tracks only those having diameters larger than
           a background discriminating value were included.
           From the ratio of track densities on both sides of
           the lexan the ratio of neutron-induced fission
           cross sections of Th-232 to U-238 was determined.
           Using the U-238 cross sections from the monitor
           reference the ratios were converted to Th-232 cross
           sections.
           The resulting Th-232 fission cross sections were avera-
           ged over the neutron-energy resolution (about 100 keV)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical error of each measurement is
           estimated to be about 10%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Table 1 of
                                         BARC-1297 (1986), p1.
