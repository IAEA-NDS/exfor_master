TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF FAST NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION CROSS
           SECTION OF TH-232 RELATIVE TO U-238

REFERENCE  (C,85JAIPUR,2,350,8512)

SAMPLE     A SANDWICH OF 100 MG/CM**2 THICK THORIUM AND DEPLETED
           URANIUM (99% U-238) DISCS WITH A 0.1MM THICK LEXAN
           PLASTIC IN BETWEEN.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,,R,INDC-36,8105)
FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
DETECTOR   (TRD) LEXAN PLASTIC
METHOD     THE LEXAN PIECES WERE ETCHED TO REVEAL FISSION
           TRACKS ON BOTH SURFACES OF THE LEXAN. IN COUNTING
           THE TRACKS ONLY THOSE HAVING DIAMETERS LARGER THAN
           A BACKGROUND DISCRIMINATING VALUE WERE INCLUDED.
           FROM THE RATIO OF TRACK DENSITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF
           THE LEXAN THE RATIO OF NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION
           CROSS SECTIONS OF TH-232 TO U-238 WAS DETERMINED.
           USING THE U-238 CROSS SECTIONS FROM THE MONITOR
           REFERENCE THE RATIO'S WERE CONVERTED TO TH-232 CROSS
           SECTIONS.
CORRECTION THE RESULTING TH-232 FISSION CROSS SECTIONS WERE AVERA
           GED OVER THE NEUTRON-ENERGY RESOLUTION (ABOUT 100 KEV)
ERR-ANALYS THE STATISTICAL ERROR OF EACH MEASUREMENT IS ESTIMATED
           TO BE ABOUT 10%.
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM TABLE 1 OF BARC-1297 (1986), PP1.
