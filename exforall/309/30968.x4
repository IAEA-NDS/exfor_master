TITLE      PROMPT GAMMA-RAY MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252

INC-SOURCE (CF252) SOURCE WITH STRENGTH OF 4*10**5 FISSIONS/MIN
           ON AN ALUMINUM BACKING
DETECTOR   (COIN,SOLST,HPGE)
           (COIN,SOLST,HPGE,NAICR)
           (COIN,SOLST,HPGE,NAICR,NAICR)
           THE SOLID-STATE DETECTOR, A SILICON-SURFACE-BARRIER
           DETECTOR, DETECTED THE FISSION FRAGMENTS, THE HPGE
           THE K X-RAYS, AND THE NAI(TL) DETECTORS THE GAMMAS
           LOW-ENERGY THRESHOLD OF BOTH NAI(TL) WAS 80 KEV
           THE FISSION DETECTOR AND THE HPGE DETECTOR WERE KEPT
           AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER. TWO NAI(TL) DETECTORS
           WERE KEPT IN A PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION
           OF THE HPGE AND PLACED SYMMETRICALLY WITH RESPECT TO
           DIRECTION OF FRAGMENT MOTION
METHOD     (COINC) DOUBLE-, TRIPLE- AND FOURFOLD-
           COINCIDENCES (SEE ABOVE)
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) TO OBTAIN K X-RAY YIELDS PER FISSION
           FROM FRAGMENTS OF SPECIFIC CHARGE TAKING
           INTO ACCOUNT RESPONSE OF HPGE AND A POLYNOMIAL
