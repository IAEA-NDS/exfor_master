TITLE      Prompt gamma-ray multiplicity distributions in
           spontaneous fission of Cf-252

            S.S.Kapoor+, K X-ray yields per fission from
            fragments of specific charge on graph.
SAMPLE      Cf-252 source with strength of 4*10**5 fissions/min
           on an aluminum backing
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,HPGE,NAICR) A silicon-surface-barrier
           detector, detected the fission fragments, the HPGe
           the K X-rays, and the NaI(Tl) detectors the gammas
           low-energy threshold of both NaI(Tl) was 80 keV
           the fission detector and the HPGe detector were kept
           at right angles to each other. Two NaI(Tl) detectors
           were kept in a plane perpendicular to the direction
           of the HPGe and placed symmetrically with respect to
           direction of fragment motion
METHOD     (COINC) Double-, triple- and fourfold-
           coincidences
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) To obtain K X-ray yields per fission
           from fragments of specific charge taking
           into account response of hpge and a polynomial
           background from compton-scattered gamma rays in
           coincidence with fission
