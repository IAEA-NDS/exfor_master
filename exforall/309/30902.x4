TITLE      The measurement of neutron scattering cross sections at
           small angles
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRCNI)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Solid cylinders of analytically pure lead,2.8 cm
           diameter .2cm and 3cm high
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP,PSD) The TOF and pulse shape discrimination
                      were used for identifying scattered neutrons
                       from the random background. The TOF was
                       based on the associated particle method.
                       By the single channel analyzer 14.7 +-2 MeV
                       neutrons were extracted, in this way the
                       neutrons of different energies and gamma-
                       ray produced near the target and impinging
                       on the liquid scintillator were excluded.
                       The resolving time of the system is 404 ns
                       average corresponding to position
                       resolution (FWHM)3.13 cm or the standard
                       deviation +-1.33 cm.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detector consists of a liquid scintillator
           encapsulated in a quartz cylinder,55 cm in length and
           3.8 cm in diameter. Both endfaces in optical contact
           with GDB-49 photomultipliers.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement. Smaller liquid scintillator was
           used to monitor the associated neutron yields.
CORRECTION The data were corrected for multiple scattering and
           attenuation in the scattering sample,finite geometry of
           sample and detector by Monte Carlo method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are due to statistical
                                      uncertainties only.
