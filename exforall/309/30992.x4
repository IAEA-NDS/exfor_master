SAMPLE     NATURAL NAF POWDER PRESSED INTO CYLINDERS 1 CM THICK
           AND 2 CM IN DIAMETER.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 2.65
           MG/CM**2 THICK T-TI TARGET, MOUNTED ON A THIN (0.1 MM)
           COPPER TUBE, WITH 2.3 MEV DEUTERONS. NINE SAMPLES, SUS-
           PENDED ON A RING OF 70 MM IN RADIUS, WERE IRRADIATED
           SIMULTANEOUSLY AT DIFFERENT ANGLES WITH RESPECT TO THE
           DEUTERON BEAM.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) THE INDUCED SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WAS DETER-
           MINED BY GAMMA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE SPECTROMETRY.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) TWO NAI(TL) CRYSTAL DETECTORS USED
           IN GAMMA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE MEASUREMENT.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR NEUTRON FLUX ATTENUATION
           WITHIN THE SAMPLE, SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLE,
           ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENCES.
ERR-ANALYS THE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS IN THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE
           CALCULATED BY COMPOUNDING QUADRATICALLY THE UNCERTAIN-
           TIES OF:
            - SAMPLE POSITION                               1.5%
            - NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENT                        6%
            - NEUTRON ATTENUATION CORRECTION                  5%
            - GAMMA COINCIDENCE COUNTING EFFICIENCY           5%
            - NEUTRON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION CALCULATION        2%
            - MASS OF SAMPLE                              <0.01%
            - STATISTICAL ERRORS OF COUNTING                  7%
