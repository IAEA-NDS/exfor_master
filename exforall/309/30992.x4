FACILITY   (VDG)
SAMPLE     Natural NaF powder pressed into cylinders 1 cm thick
           and 2 cm in diameter.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a
           2.65 mg/cm2 thick T-Ti target, mounted on a
           thin (0.1 mm) copper tube, with 2.3 MeV deuterons.
           Nine samples, suspended on a ring of 70 mm in radius,
           were irradiated simultaneously at different angles
           with respect to the deuteron beam.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The induced specific activity was deter-
           mined by gamma-gamma coincidence spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) crystal detectors used
           in gamma-gamma coincidence measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for neutron flux attenuation
           within the sample, self-absorption in the sample,
           accidental coincidences.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The experimental errors in the cross sections
           were calculated by compounding quadratically the
            uncertainties of:
           (ERR-1) Sample position                           1.5%
           (ERR-2) Neutron flux measurement                    6%
           (ERR-3) Neutron attenuation correction              5%
           (ERR-4) Gamma coincidence counting efficiency       5%
           (ERR-5) Neutron angular distribution calculation    2%
           (ERR-6,,0.01) Mass of sample                    <0.01%
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors of counting             7%
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Table 1 of Conf. on Nucl.
           Data for  Sci. and Technol., Juelich 1991, page 666.
