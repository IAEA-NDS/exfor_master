DETECTOR   (IOCH) The fission fragment and alpha particles were
           detected by a double ionization chamber.
           Distance between the electrodes
             in the alpha-particle ditection chamger: 8 cm
             in the fragment ditection chamber: 1.5 cm.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on uncertainity.

           fissions to the nuber of ternary fissions.
SAMPLE     Fissile materials were deposited on Al and steel foils
           with thickness 6.8 and 9.7 mg/cm**2.
           Fissile materials were deposited on the foils by means
