TITLE      Analyzing-power in neutron-proton scattering
           at 21.6 MeV

SAMPLE     Anthracene scintillation crystal as neutron scatterer
FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a tritium
           target with 5.5 MeV pulsed deuterons. For the analyzing
           power measurements the neutron reaction angle selected
           was 20 deg, providing an incident beam of polarized
           neutrons
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Anthracene scintillation crystal(same as sample)
PART-DET   (P) Recoil protons
METHOD     (REC,PSD,PHD) The sensitivity of the pulse height and
           pulse shape outputs to the direction of the recoil
           proton relative to the axes of the anthracene crystal
           was utilized to measure left-right asymmetries of the
           recoil protons.
ANALYSIS   The asymmetry and the associated neutron C.M.
           scattering angle were determined from the pulse height
           and pulse shape outputs of the detected recoil protons.
           An additional scintillator detector was placed at
           different laboratory angles with respect to the beam
           axis to detect scattered neutrons coincident with the
           anthracene crystal signals. Coincident events, which
           formed a small part of the scatters recorded by the an-
           thracene were tagged out throughout the experiment and
           formed the basis for the calibration of the measurement
           of the neutron scattering angle from the pulse height
           and pulse shape data.
           The final asymmetry values are weighted averages of
           results from four independent experimental runs.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for the effects of recoil
           proton escape from the crystal on the measurements,
           and for instrumental asymmetries which were determined
           from null polarization data collected using the
           unpolarized 22 MeV neutron beam emitted at 0 deg.
