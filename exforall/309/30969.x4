TITLE      The Cf-252(sf) neutron spectrum in the 5- to 20-MeV
           energy range

METHOD     (TOF,PHD,PSD) The fission fragment signals obtained
           by constant-fraction discriminators were used as
           stop signal in the time-of-flight measurement.
           Two-dimensional spectra of tof versus scintillator
           pulse height from both neutron detectors were measured
           simultaneously. Background was suppressed by applying
           pulse shape discrimination.
           Measurements were carried out with the two neutron
           detectors under different experimental conditions.
           The main differences are the scintillator size,
           length of flight path and detector position (0 and 60
           deg. With respect to the axis perpendicular to the
           Cf-252 backing plane).
           the optimum bias of the neutron detector to ensure
           a reliable foreground/background ratio, was determined
           with the sliding bias method
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,IOCH) Two independent Ne-213 scintillators
           for neutron detection, a miniature ionization chamber
           for fast fission fragment detection.
           Parameters of Ne-213 scintillators are:
           1. 12.7 cm diameter by 12.7 cm thick, positioned
               at 0 degrees with respect to the normal of the
               Cf sample plane, at a distance of 5.905 m from
               the sample. The time resolution was 1.5 ns FWHM.
           2.  12.7 cm diameter by 3.81 cm thick, positioned at
               60 degrees with respect to the normal of the
               Cf sample plane, at a distance of 3.275 m from
               the sample. The time resolution was 1.3 ns FWHM.
PART-DET   (N,FF)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for neutron attenuation,
           TOF channel-dependent background due to noncorrelated
           stop signals, influence of scattered neutrons, time
           resolution, anisotropic fragment losses in fragment
           detection efficiency
