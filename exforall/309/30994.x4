SAMPLE     NATURAL METAL DISKS OF 0.8 MM THICKNESS AND WITH A DIA-
           METER OF 20 MM. CHEMICAL PURITY WAS 99.9%.
FACILITY   (VDG)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T) NEUTRONS, WITH AN ENERGY BETWEEN 29 AND 23
           KEV, AND 215 AND 1100 KEV RESPECTIVELY, WERE PRODUCED
           BY BOMBARDING THE TARGETS WITH 2.5 MEV PROTONS. NEUTRON
           ENERGY WAS FURTHER SELECTED BY CHOICE OF ANGLE OF
           NEUTRON EMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT PROTON
           BEAM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) CROSS-SECTION FROM
           ENDF/B-V. THE SAMPLES WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO GOLD
           FOILS WITH THE SAME DIAMETER AND A THICKNESS OF 0.1 MM.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS MADE FOR NEUTRONS WITH SPURIOUS TARGET
           MATERIALS, SAMPLE HOLDER AND SAMPLE ITSELF, AND
           CORRECTIONS FOR FLUX ATTENUATION DUE TO TARGET AND
           SAMPLE WERE ESTIMATED USING A MONTE-CARLO PROGRAM.
ERR-ANALYS THE MAIN UNCERTAINTIES CAME FROM:
           - THE AU STANDARD CROSS SECTION             5.0 - 7.0%
           - DECAY SCHEME                                    4.0%

           - GAMMA SELF ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLE       0.5 - 1.0%
           - WEIGHING OF SAMPLE                              0.5%
