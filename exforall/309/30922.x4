           (C,86DUBROV,,271,8605) ABSTRACT ONLY
SAMPLE     METALLIC BERYLLIUM FOIL ON A GOLD BACKING. TARGET WAS
           1.6 X 1.9 CM-2,2.3 MG/CM-2 THICK FOIL
MONITOR    (4-BE-9(N,A)2-HE-6,,SIG)
           THE ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED BY
           SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF 2-HE-6 FROM 9-BE(N,6-HE)A
           REACTION AT FORWARD ANGLES AND BY NORMALIZATION TO
           THE PREVIOUSLY MEASURED DATA
           - NEUTRON YIELD WAS MONITORED BY DETECTION OF RECOIL
           ALPHA PARTICLES.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
PART-DET   (T)
METHOD     DIRECT DETECTION OF PRODUCED TRITONS
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,SOLST)
            TELESCOPE CONSISTS OF THREE PROPORTIONAL GAS COUNTERS
            AND SURFACE-BARRIER SILICON DETECTOR. THE PROPORTIONAL
            COUNTERS WERE FILLED WITH PURE HYDROGEN.
INC-SPECT  THE NEUTRON YIELD WAS 2X10E9 N/S IN 4 PI.
ERR-ANALYS INDICATED ERRORS ARE DUE TO THE STATISTICS AND
           UNCERTAINTY IN THE CROSS SECTION USED FOR NORMALIZATION
STATUS     THE DATA WERE TAKEN FROM NUCL.SCI.AND ENG.VOL95,79,1987

REACTION   (4-BE-9(N,T)3-LI-7,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   DATA WERE MEASURED ONLY FROM 0 TO 90 DEGREES. TO GET
           THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION IS SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO 90 DEGREES.

            DATA ARE A SUM OF T0 AND T1 CHANNELS
COMMENT    DUE TO LOW TRITON ENERGY AND THICK TARGET,IT WAS
           POSSIBLE TO MEASURE ONLY THE SUM OF THE CROSS SECTIONS
           FOR THE 9-BE(N,T0) AND 9-BE(N,T1) REACTIONS,THE
           THRESHOLDS OF WICH ARE 11.6 AND 12.1 MEV RESPECTIVELY.
