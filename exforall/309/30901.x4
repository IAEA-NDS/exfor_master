FACILITY   (CCW,3PAKNIL)
SAMPLE     Natural targets each of 5.1 cm diameter and 5.1 cm long
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Using 120 keV deuterons
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213 liquid scintillator of 12.7 cm diameter
           and 12.7 thickness was coupled to XP1040 PHM The bias
           of the detector was set at 2 MeV neutron energy
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) Flight path of 2.3 m forward of 90 degrees
           and 3.3 m beyond 90 degrees.
ANALYSIS   (INTED) The original measured double differential
           U-emission data are not available but only some
           integrated results, integrated in the E-range
           6 to 11 MeV
CORRECTION Flux attenuation corrections for incident and exit
           channels as well as those for in-scattering were
           computed on the basis of monte carlo.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
