           (C,86DUBROV,,285,1986) Brief report. Data for Pb and Cu
SAMPLE     Natural targets each of 5.1 cm diameter and 5.1 cm long
FACILITY   (CCW,3PAKNIL)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Using 120 keV deuterons
MONITOR    Absolute measurement
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) Flight path of 2.3m forward of 90 degrees
                       and 3.3 m beyond 90 degrees.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213 liquid scintillator of 12.7 cm diameter
                  and 12.7 thickness was coupled to XP1040  PHM
                  The bias of the detector was set at 2MeV neutron
                  energy
ANALYSIS   (INTED) The original measured double differential
                   U-emission data are not available but only some
                   integrated results,integrated in the E-range
                   6 to 11 MeV
CORRECTION Flux attenuation corrections for incident and exit
           channels as well as those for in-scattering were
           computed on the basis of monte carlo.

ANALYSIS   (INTED) For obtaining angular distribution information,
                   double differential cross section data were
                   integrated at each angle in the 6-11 MeV
                   energy range and then the angle integrated
                   value was obtained through Legendre polynomial
                   least squares fit using:
