TITLE      Separation and determination of the independent yield
           of 90Y in thermal fission of 233U and 235U
AUTHOR     (T.Isak,E.Yellin)
INSTITUTE  (3ISLSOR)
REFERENCE  (P,IA-1190,101,196907) Very little information
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutrons
METHOD     (RCHEM).2 Step separation and purification of yttrium.
              The product was 'very pure'.
COMMENT    by compiler: The progress report contains very little
              information. Only the chemical separation and
              purification are described. No information is given
              on the measurement method, analysis, etc.
