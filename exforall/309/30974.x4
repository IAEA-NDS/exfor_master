SAMPLE     100 - 200 MICROGRAM/CM**2 THIN DEPOSITS OF NATURAL-
           AND DEPLETED-URANIUM-(23PPM U-235) OXIDE (U3O8) AND
           THORIUM-232 OXIDE (THO2) WERE PREPARED BY MOLECULAR
           PLATING ON POLISHED ALUMINIUM DISKS AS TO ENSURE
           ADEQUATE DEPOSIT UNIFORMITY. THE MASSES WERE DETER-
           MINED BY ALPHA-COUNTING ASSAY (URANIUM) AND GAMMA-
           COUNTING ASSAY (THORIUM).
           INDIUM-115, NO FURTHER DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THIS
           SAMPLE.
DETECTOR   (FISCH,SOLST,D4PI,GELI) A MINIATURE FISSION CHAMBER
           AND A SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTOR (SSNTD) FOR
           FISSION FRAGMENT COUNTING, A 4PIBETA PROPORTIONAL
           GAS FLOW COUNTER FOR DETERMINING THE BETA ACTIVITY OF
           MN-56 AND A GELI DETECTOR FOR MEASURING THE GAMMA
           ACTIVITIES OF MN-56 AND IN-115-M. THE ALUMINIUM
           ELECTROPLATED DEPOSIT IS THE GROUNDED KATHODE PLATE OF
           THE FISSION CHAMBER. IN THE SSNTD MEASUREMENTS THE
           DEPOSITS ARE PLACED IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE MICA
           DISKS BETWEEN A ALUMINIUM BACK PLATE AND A RING HOLDER.
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) EXTERNAL BEAM IRRADIATION OF SSNTD AND
           FISSION CHAMBER, ACTIVATION MEASUREMENT OF THE
           IN-115(N,N)IN115-M REACTION RELATIVE TO MN MONITOR.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) FOR IN-115(N,N)IN-115-M REACTION.
           FROM THE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED FISSION-RATE
           RATIOS: DEPLETED URANIUM/NATURAL URANIUM AND
           THORIUM-232/DEPLETED URANIUM, AND THE IN-115-M/MN-56
           CROSS SECTION RATIOS THE RATIOS PRESENTED IN SUBENTS
           002 - 005 WERE OBTAINED.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FISSION FRAGMENT SELF-
           ABSORPTION IN THE DEPOSITS, FLUX PERTURBATION IN
           THE NEUTRON BEAM AND SSNTD STACK ABSORPTION.
ERR-ANALYS ERRORS ARE OBTAINED BY QUADRATURE SUM OF INDEPENDENT
           ERROR COMPONENTS:
           1) STATISTICS OF FISSION PRODUCT COUNTING AND
           SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN FISSION FRAGMENT ABSORPTION
           CORRECTIONS, THE SAME FOR ALPHAS IN URANIUM MASS
           ASSAY.
           2) STATISTICS OF GAMMA COUNTING UNCERTAINTY
           AND SELFABSORPTION FOR THORIUM MASS ASSAY.
           3) STATISTICS OF GAMMA COUNTING ERRORS AND GAMMA
           EFFICIENCY CALIBRATIONS FOR IN-115-M/MN56 RATIO.
