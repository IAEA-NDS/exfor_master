           depleted uranium and thorium and microscopic cross

SAMPLE     100 - 200 microgram/cm**2 thin deposits of natural-
           and depleted-uranium-(23ppm U-235) oxide (U3O8) and
           thorium-232 oxide (ThO2) were prepared by molecular
           plating on polished aluminium disks as to ensure
           adequate deposit uniformity. The masses were deter-
           mined by alpha-counting assay (uranium) and gamma-
           counting assay (thorium).
           Indium-115: no further details are given of this
           sample.
DETECTOR   (FISCH,TRD,D4PI,GELI) A miniature fission chamber
           and a solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) for
           fission fragment counting, a 4Pi-beta proportional
           gas flow counter for determining the beta activity of
           Mn-56 and a GeLi detector for measuring the gamma
           activities of Mn-56 and In-115-m. The aluminium
           electroplated deposit is the grounded kathode plate of
           the fission chamber. In the SSNTD measurements the
           deposits are placed in close contact with the mica
           disks between a aluminium back plate and a ring holder.
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) External beam irradiation of SSNTD and
           fission chamber, activation measurement of the
           In-115(n,n)In-115-m reaction relative to Mn monitor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Radial neutron beam of the RA3 research reactor
PART-DET   (FF)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) For In-115(n,n)In-115-m reaction.
           From the experimentally determined fission-rate
           ratios: depleted uranium/natural uranium and
           thorium-232/depleted uranium, and the In-115-m/Mn-56
           cross section ratios the ratios presented in subents
           002 - 005 were obtained.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for fission fragment self-
           absorption in the deposits, flux perturbation in
           the neutron beam and ssntd stack absorption.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors are obtained by quadrature sum of
           independent error components:
           1) Statistics of fission product counting and
           systematic errors in fission fragment absorption
           corrections, the same for alphas in uranium mass
           assay.
           2) Statistics of gamma counting uncertainty
           and self-absorption for thorium mass assay.
           3) Statistics of gamma counting errors and gamma
           efficiency calibrations for In-115-m/Mn56 ratio.

INC-SPECT  The neutron beam was assumed to have a Maxwellian
           thermal component, a 1/E epithermal region and a fast
           region with a neutron fission shape (200keV<E<14MeV).
           The thermal/epithermal part of the spectrum does not
           apply to the higher threshold reaction In-155(n,inl).
