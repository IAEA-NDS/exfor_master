TITLE      Fission fragment angular momentum: ratios of
           independent yields of isomers of Nb-95 and I-132
           in thermal-neutron-induced fission of U-233.

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Apsara swimming pool type reactor
SAMPLE     Electrodeposited target of U-233 ( about 600 microgram)
           covered with 0.0025 cm thick superpure aluminium
           catcher foil.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum.
METHOD     (INTB,RCHEM,ABSFY) After the irradiation,the catcher
           foil, which collected the fission products, was
           dissolved and the fission products were separated using
           standard radiochemical procedures.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted errors refer to the scatter of
           yield-ratio values determined from five independent
           measurements.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The separation-time activities of Nb-95-m and
           Nb-95-g were determined from a least-square fit of the
           observed Nb-95-g activity as function of cooling time,
           using standard decay-growth equations. In order to
           calculate the independent isomeric yield ratio also
           knowledge of the contribution of the decay of the
           precursor Zr-95 to the Nb-95-g activity was required.
           This was determined, in a similar way, from a separate
           measurement ( 72-76%).

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The separation-time activities of I-132-m and

           observed I-132-g activity as function of cooling time,
           using standard decay-growth equations, and were
           correlated to the corresponding fractional independent
           yield ratio. The contribution of the decay of the
           precursor Te-132 to the I-132-g activity, which was
           found to be 6-7% from a calculation, was neglected.
