TITLE      FISSION FRAGMENT ANGULAR MOMENTUM: RATIOS OF INDEPEN-
           DENT YIELDS OF ISOMERS OF NB-95 AND I-132 IN THERMAL-
           NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION OF U-233.

INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
FACILITY   (REAC) APSARA SWIMMING POOL TYPE REACTOR
SAMPLE     ELECTRODEPOSITED TARGET OF U-233 ( ABOUT 600 MICROGRAM)
           COVERED WITH 0.0025 CM THICK SUPERPURE ALUMINIUM
           CATCHER FOIL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  THERMAL REACTOR SPECTRUM.
METHOD     (INTB,RCHEM,ABSFY) AFTER THE IRRADIATION,THE CATCHER
           FOIL, WHICH COLLECTED THE FISSION PRODUCTS, WAS
           DISSOLVED AND THE FISSION PRODUCTS WERE SEPARATED USING
           STANDARD RADIOCHEMICAL PROCEDURES.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) THE SEPARATION-TIME ACTIVITIES OF NB-95-M AND
           NB-95-G WERE DETERMINED FROM A LEAST-SQUARE FIT OF THE
           OBSERVED NB-95-G ACTIVITY AS FUNCTION OF COOLING TIME,
           USING STANDARD DECAY-GROWTH EQUATIONS. IN ORDER TO CAL
           CULATE THE INDEPENDENT ISOMERIC YIELD RATIO ALSO KNOW-
           LEDGE OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE DECAY OF THE PRECURSOR
           ZR-95 TO THE NB-95-G ACTIVITY WAS REQUIRED. THIS WAS
           DETERMINED, IN A SIMILAR WAY, FROM A SEPARATE
           MEASUREMENT ( 72-76%).
ERR-ANALYS QUOTED ERRORS REFER TO THE SCATTER OF YIELD-RATIO
           VALUES DETERMINED FROM FIVE INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS.
