FACILITY   (CCW) CIAE 600 KV COCKROFT-WALTON GENERATOR.-
SAMPLE     ALUMINIUM AND IRON SAMPLES, 0.2 MM THICK, PURITY
           99.99%, HELD BY CIRCLES OF VERY THIN COPPER WIRE, WERE
           PLACED 80 - 130 CM FROM THE TI-T TARGET.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 0.5
           MG/CM**2 THICK T-TI TARGET ON A MO BACKING WITH 200
           KEV DEUTERONS. THE NEUTRON ENERGY AT THE POSITION OF
           THE SAMPLES WAS OBTAINED WITH A MONTE-CARLO CALCULATION
           CONSIDERING THE THICKNESS AND THE SIZE OF BOTH THE
           TARGET SPOT AND THE SAMPLE.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC,ASSOP) THE INDUCED SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WAS
           DETERMINED BY BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE SPECTROMETRY.
           THE NEUTRON FLUENCE WAS DETERMINED BY COUNTING ASSOCIA-
           TED ALPHA PARTICLES FROM THE D(T,N)HE-4 REACTION.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,PROPC) A 4PI-BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE
           DEVICE CONSISTING OF A METHANE GAS FLOW PROPORTIONAL
           BETA COUNTER POSITIONED BETWEEN TWO NAI(TL) SCINTILLA-
           TOR GAMMA COUNTERS.
CORRECTION IN ADDITION TO THE ROUTINE DECAY CORRECTIONS, CORREC-
           TIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR:
            - THE ROOM BACKGROUND, 0.3 - 1.3%.
            - THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHARGED PARTICLES HE-3, P AND
              T FROM D+D REACTION, WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN
              0.2% WITHIN A 15 HR IRRADIATION PERIOD.
            - SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLE WAS 0.1 PERCENT FOR
              ALUMINIUM AND 0.2 PERCENT FOR IRON;
            - ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING OF THE NEUTRON TARGET
              ASSEMBLY, 1.1% AND 0.5% RESPECTIVELY.
            - DEAD TIME OF ALPHA-PARTICLE DETECTION SYSTEM,
              0.4%-0.7%.
            - INFLUENCE OF FE-57(N,NP+D+PN)MN-56 REACTION, 0.2%.
