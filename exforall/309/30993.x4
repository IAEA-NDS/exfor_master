FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP) CIAE 600 kV Cockroft-Walton generator.-
SAMPLE     Aluminium and iron samples, 0.2 mm thick, purity
           99.99%, held by circles of very thin copper wire, were
           placed 80 - 130 cm from the Ti-T target.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a 0.5
           mg/cm**2 thick T-Ti target on a Mo backing with 200
           keV deuterons. The neutron energy at the position of
           the samples was obtained with a Monte-Carlo calculation
           considering the thickness and the size of both the
           target spot and the sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC,ASSOP) The induced specific activity was
           determined by beta-gamma coincidence spectrometry.
           The neutron fluence was determined by counting associa-
           ted alpha particles from the D(t,n)He-4 reaction.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,PROPC) A 4Pi-beta-gamma coincidence
           device consisting of a methane gas flow proportional
           beta counter positioned between two NaI(Tl) scintilla-
           tor gamma counters.
CORRECTION In addition to the routine decay corrections, correc-
           tions have been made for:
            - The room background, 0.3 - 1.3%.
            - The influence of the charged particles He-3, p and
              t from d+d reaction, which was found to Be less than
              0.2% within a 15 hr irradiation period.
            - Self-absorption in the sample was 0.1 percent for
              aluminium and 0.2 percent for iron;
            - Absorption and scattering of the neutron target
              assembly, 1.1% and 0.5% respectively.
            - Dead time of alpha-particle detection system,
              0.4%-0.7%.
            - Influence of Fe-57(n,np+d+pn)Mn-56 reaction, 0.2%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main uncertainties of the measurement
                   correspond to:

           (ERR-3) Anisotropy of neutron beam
           (ERR-4) Solid angle of sample
           (ERR-5) Room background correction
           (ERR-6) Absorption correction of target assembly
           (ERR-7) Scattering correction of target assembly
           (ERR-8) Absorption and scattering of the sample'S
           frame
           (ERR-9) Self-absorption and scattering of sample
           (ERR-10) Neutron energy
