SAMPLE     Spectrographically pure oxides of Mn-55 and In-115.
           The samples, along with two standard samples, were
           placed in zero degree forward direction with respect
           to the proton beam.
MONITOR    (53-I-127(N,G)53-I-128,,SIG) The standard was put in
           the same geometry as the sample during irradiation and
           counting.

FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) For O.46, 0.58, 0.76 MeV neutrons.
           Lithium targets of thickness 300mu-g/cm2 were prepared
           by vacuum evaporation on a thin tantalum backing
           (P-T) For neutron energy >= 0.76 MeV.
           The tritium targets were of 8,12 and 16 Ci.
           Neutron flux was estimated of the order of
                                                  10**7 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Precalibrated, lead shielded
           (BF3) Neutron flux was monitored
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the neutron energy was
           determined from the degradation of the incident-proton
           energy in the target and the solid angle subtended by
           the sample at the neutron source.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty in the cross section include
           the uncertainties ( see Ann. Nucl. Energy, vol. 11,
           No. 4, p. 173-176, 1984):
           -   in counting statistics.
           (ERR-1) in proton-beam current during irradiation.
           (ERR-2) in detector efficiency.
           (ERR-3,0.5,2.) in self-absorption of gamma rays in
                                                     the sample.
           (ERR-4,,0.3) in estimation of the number of nuclei of
                        the isotope under investigation.
           (ERR-5) Due to non-reproducibility of geometry at the
                   times of irradiation and counting.
           (ERR-6,1.,5.) in the integration of the pulse-height
                         spectrum.
           (ERR-7,,0.2) Due to the pulse-summing effect.
