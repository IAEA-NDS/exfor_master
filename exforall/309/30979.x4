SAMPLE     Samples of natural titanium, chromium, iron, cobalt,
           nickel and zinc, in the form of pure metallic or oxide
           powder.
           Al was in the form of aluminium oxide powder in order
           to ensure uniform mixing with the sample powder.
FACILITY   (CCW,3MORMOH)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a 0.6mg/
           cm**2 thick Ti-T layer with 150 and 300 keV deuterons,
           the first ones originating from (D2)+ molecules in the
           deuteron beam which were accellerated by the same high
           voltage as the atomic D+. Neutron energy was selected
           by the angular position of the sample with respect to
           the deuteron beam axis. The calculated neutron-energy
           scale was verified by measuring the energy dependence
           of the Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92-m and Zr-90(n,2n)Zr-89-m+g
           cross sections.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for self-absorption of
           gamma rays in the sample and for gamma-gamma coin-
           cidence summing effects.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors in the measured cross sections involve
           uncertainties in:
           (ERR-S,1.,4.) counting statistics (1 t0 4%),
           (MONIT-ERR) monitor reaction cross sections(1%),
           (ERR-1,1.,10.) corrections for gamma-ray
                                      self absorption(1 t0 10%)
           (ERR-2,1.,10.) coincidence summing effect (1 to 10%),
           (ERR-3) sample chemical composition(0.1%),
           (ERR-4,1.5,2.) Ge(Li) detector efficiency(1.5 to 2%)
           (ERR-5) neutron flux time variation(0.1%).
           Total uncertaianties in cross sections were obtained
           by adding the uncertainty components in quadrature.
           The total neutron energy spread was estimated taking
           into account the kinetics of the neutron-producing
           reaction, the deuteron energy loss in the Ti-T layer,
           the D+/(D2)+ ratio as deduced from the angle dependence
           of the neutron energy, and the solid angle sustained
           by the sample.
