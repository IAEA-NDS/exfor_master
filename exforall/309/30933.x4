TITLE      Study of the excitation functions of Al-27(n,a),
           Al-27(n,p) and Si-28(n,p) reactions.
FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS)
           -Neutron generator at the Institute of Experimental
            Physics,Kossuth Univ.,Debrecen; using:
           -210 keV analysed d-beam
           -Liquid nitrogen-jet cooled TiT target of low-mass
            constructions.
           -5 mm diam of beam spot
           (CCW,3TAICHM)
           Measurements were repeated in the range of
           13.84-14.70 MeV by J25 neut.generator at Chiang Mai
           University,employing :
           -a nonanalysed d-beam of 150 keV
           -10 mm diam of beam spot
           -cold water cooled TiT target of low-mass constructions
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
           Several neutron emission angles have been used to vary
           the neutron energy between 13.5 and 14.8 MeV.
           The neutron energy as a function of emission angle has
           been determined(both for analysed and nonanalysed
           d-beams)using the ratio of the specific activities of
           Zr,Au,Ta and Nb foils
SAMPLE     Rectangular-shaped al,si samples of 15*10*0.5 mm-3.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           (SCIN) NaI(Tl) detector
            The energy-efficiency curve of the detectors was
            determined by standard g-sources.
PART-DET   (DG)
ANALYSIS    The measured data were compared with evaluated data
             and Hauser-Feshbach model calculation. See figures
             in Z.Phys.A.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) at 14.1 MeV
           During the irradiation the total neutron fluence and
           the time distribution of neutron yield were measured
           by:
             * U-238 fission chamber in Debrecen
             * NE-213 scintillator in Chiang Mai
             * Activation of Al and Nb foils
DECAY-DATA No information given
CORRECTION  -The efficiency of the detectors were corrected for:
              * Geometry
              * Self-absorption
              * Energetic beta particles
              * Dead time
              * Random pile-up
              * True coincidence losses
ERR-ANALYS No error analysis given
COMMENT    The neutron energy as a function of emission angle
           has been determined (both for analysed and nonanalysed
           deuteron beams) using the ratio of the specific
           activities of Zr,Au,Ta and Nb foils.

METHOD     For determination of the relative cross section curve
           the Al samples were packed together with Nb sandwich
           foils to measure the neutron fluence at different
           angles using the flat shape of the Nb-93(n,2n) sigma(e)
           function.
