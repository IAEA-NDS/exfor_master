TITLE      Cross sections of In-113(n,n')In-113-m and

SAMPLE     High-purity indium metal samples, 15*15*0.25 mm.
FACILITY   (CCW)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR)
           (BF3) Flux-variation in time measured by BF3
CORRECTION Corrections were carried out for the following effects:
           - Self-absorption
           - Dead time
           - Fluctuation of neutron yield as a function of time
           - Contribution of room scattered fast neutrons
           - Contribution of d-d neutrons to the (n,n') reaction
             in the 14 MeV region.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes statistical and
           systematic components. The principal sources of
           systematic uncertainty were:
           (ERR-1) Neutron flux determination               (2%)
           (ERR-2) Uncertainties in half-lifes              (1%)
           (ERR-3) Uncertainties in standard cross sections (1%)
             * detector efficiencies    ( Ge(Li) 1%, NaI 5%)
             * correction for D-D contribution (Subent 002) to the
             (n,n') reaction in the 14 MeV region    (<2%)
