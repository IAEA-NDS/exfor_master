SAMPLE     HIGH-PURITY INDIUM METAL SAMPLES, 15*15*0.25 MM.
FACILITY   (CCW)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR)
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT FOR THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS
           - SELF-ABSORPTION
           - DEAD TIME
           - FLUCTUATION OF NEUTRON YIELD AS A FUNCTION OF TIME
           - CONTRIBUTION OF ROOM SCATTERED FAST NEUTRONS
           - CONTRIBUTION OF D-D NEUTRONS TO THE (N,N') REACTION
             IN THE 14 MEV REGION.
ERR-ANALYS ERRORS (TWO SIGMA) ARE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING SOURCES:
           - NEUTRON FLUX DETERMINATION               (2%)
           - UNCERTAINTIES IN HALF-LIFES              (1%)
           - UNCERTAINTIES IN STANDARD CROSS SECTIONS (1%)
           - DETECTOR EFFICIENCIES    ( GE(LI) 1%, NAI 5%)
           - CORRECTION FOR D-D CONTRIBUTION TO THE
             (N,N') REACTION IN THE 14 MEV REGION    (<2%)

INC-SOURCE (D-D) TID TARGET COOLED BY AN AIR-JET SYSTEM IN ORDER
           TO DECREASE THE ENERGY SPREAD OF THE NEUTRONS.
           NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING THE TARGETS WITH
           A 200 KEV ANALYZED DEUTERON BEAM. NEUTRON ENERGY WAS
