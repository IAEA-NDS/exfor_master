TITLE      Cumulative yields of Mo99,Rh105 and Te132 in the
           spontaneous fission of U238
SAMPLE     natural uranium in the form of pure ammonium diuranate
METHOD     (RCHEM) For spontaneous fission measurements, large
           amounts of uranium are required. Initial separation:
           by sulphide precipitation from a UO2Cl2 solution in 3 M
           HCl. Further purification was carried out using
           standard radiochemical procedures.
           (ABSFY) Absolute fission yields were obtained from the
           fission product activities in equilibrium with the
           spontaneous fission rate. The latter was determined
           from the sample weight and the spontaneous fission half
           life of U-238.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Flat circular gas-flow Geiger Mueller counter,
            1.12% ethylene in argon; background: 0.7+-0.1 cpm.
CORRECTION Since natural uranium was used, the contribution from
           U-235 fission induced by U-238 spontaneous fission
           neutrons was calculated to be about 5%, and it was
           concluded that no correction was necessary.

REACTION   (92-U-238(0,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY)
ANALYSIS   Each nuclide was determined 3 times.
           (DECAY) The decay curves were analysed and the half
            lives obtained were 66,36 and 78 hrs for Mo-99,Rh-105
            and Te-132 respectively, in good agreement with the
            recommended values in the Nuclear Data Sheets.
            The latter were used for least squares analysis of the
            counting data to obtain the equilibrium count rate.
ASSUMED    The spontaneous fission half life of U-238 used in the
           calculation of fission yields was (8.04+-0.3)10**15 yr,
           taken from E.Segre,Phys.Rev.86(1952)21.
STATUS     Data taken from the table in Nukleonik 9(1967)43.
