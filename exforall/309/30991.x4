TITLE      Progress in the measurement of gamma-ray production
           cross sections induced by 14.9 MeV neutrons.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRBNU)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Average neutron yield is about 5.x10**8 n/s
SAMPLE     Hollow cylindrical Si samples, 3 cm high and 3 cm in
           diameter, with the natural abundance and high chemical
           purity.
METHOD     (TOF,GSPEC,ASSOP) The pulsed-beam time-of-flight
           technique was used for reducing background caused by
           primary and scattered neutrons. Absolute neutron flux
           was determined by counting the associated alpha par-
           ticles produced in the T(d,n)He-4 reaction.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 110.7 cm3
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Experimental data were analyzed by a peak-
           fitting program which is capable of resolving multi-
           plets.
CORRECTION Corrections for neutron flux attenuation and gamma
           ray self-absorption in the sample were calculated with
           Monte Carlo simulation. Also multiple scattering,
           absorption of neutrons by target backing and cooling
           water and size and anisotropy of the neutron source
           were taken into account in the determination of the
           cross sections.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty was about 5% for the
           main gamma lines, including:
           (ERR-1,,2.5)  Error of neutron flux determination
           was not more than 2.5%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Table 1 of Conf. on Nucl.
           Data for Sci. and Technol., Juelich 1991, page 332.
