TITLE      Ruthenium and rhodium isotopes in spontaneous fission
           of uranium-238
SAMPLE     8 kg of ammonium diuranate
METHOD     (RCHEM).The separation procedures took 4 hrs for Ru
            and 15 hrs for Rh.
            For the Ru-105 measurement the activity was allowed to
            grow into the mother uranium solution for 30 hrs
            before chemical sepapartion. For Rh-105 the grow-in
            time was 10 days. The grow-in times correspond to
            about 7 times the rspective half-lives, and it was
            was assumed that equilibrium activity was reached.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Rectangular perspex gas flow Geiger Mueller
            counter with background rate of 1 cpm.
ANALYSIS   The fission yield was calculated from the fission
           product equilibrium activity and the U-238 spontaneous
           fission rate.
