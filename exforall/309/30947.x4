TITLE      Fission of 232Th by reactor neutrons: mass-yield curve

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Apsara swimming pool reactor
INC-SPECT  Pile neutrons from core of Apsara reactor; samples
           irradiated in the same position for 15 min to 40 hrs.
           Fluctuations of reactor power level during irradiations
             were small and did not affect results.
           Compiler's comment (ML): for the coding of reaction and
             neutron energy, the spectrum of neutrons fissioning
             Th-232 (fission threshold about 1.1 MeV) was assumed
             to be (close to) a fission spectrum.
SAMPLE     For irradiation:
              Thorium: pure oxide, hydrocarbonate, or metal foils:
                       <0.5 ppm uranium, <0.8 ppm cerium,
                       <0.2 ppm samarium, <0.08 ppm iron.
                       Th oxide: 10 g samples
              Uranium: metal foils, 0.5 g samples
              Samples in separate pure aluminium foils, enclosed
                in the same pure aluminium containers.
           For counting:
              Separated fission products centred on aluminium
              plates and covered with 3 mg/cm2 cellophane paper.
METHOD     (RVAL).Relative U-235 thermal fission, standard: Mo-99;
              Simultaneous irradiation of Th and U samples;
              counting of samples under identical conditions.
           (RCHEM). Samples were dissolved, fission products
              chemically separated and mounted for counting.
           (BSPEC,GSPEC).Counted long enough to keep statistical
              error below 1%; if possible, until complete decay.
DETECTOR   (PROPC).Betas: Sugarman-type methane flow counter, end
              window covered with 1.1 mg/cm2 aluminised mylar
           (NAICR).Gammas: 1.5x1 inch, single channel or 100
              channel pulse hight analyser.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION 1) For aliquot and chemical yield
           2) For decay after irradiation
           3) Counting: for self-absorption and scattering;
           Corrections for decay during irradiation cancelled out
              in the R-value because of simultaneous irradiation
              of samples. The authors assumed that the genetic
              relationships are the same in Th-232 fast and U-235
              thermal neutron fission under the conditions of the
              experiment and for the fission products considered.
              They discussed the complicated decay schemes and
              existing isomers for the isotopes of Ag, Cd, In and
              Sn, which they could not correct for, and concluded
              that the corresponding errors in R-values should
              have been small.
           Corrections for U-235 fast fission were negligible.
           Contributions from secondary noutron fission in large
              thorium targets were estimated to be less than 1%
              and could be neglected.
           No corrections were applied for neutron capture.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Errors are statistical, given as 1 standard
           deviation.
           Compilers comment (ML): No detailed information;
              obviously, errors were calculated as standard
              deviations from the mean of the results of different
              determinations (no error given for value obtained
              from one determination).
COMMENT    by compiler (ML): In-117 is given as the ground state
              by the authors in the table, although the metastable
              state has a longer half life.

ANALYSIS   The fission product yields from Th-232 (=Y(fp,2)) are
              calculated from the measured R-values (=R) and the
              U-235 fission yields (=Y(fp,5)) according to:
                  Y(fp,2) = R * Y(99,2) * Y(fp,5)/Y(99,5)
              where Y(99,2) and Y(99,5) are the corresponding
              Mo-99 yields.
MONITOR    ((MONIT1)90-TH-232(N,F)42-MO-99,CUM,FY,,FIS) = Y(99,2)
              obtained by normalising the relative Th-232 yields
              (including estimated yields) to a total of 200%.

MONIT-REF  (,S.KATCOFF,J,NUC,18,(11),201,1960) All U-235 yields
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors in the data Table correspond to the
              statistical errors of the R-values, to which the
              following errors have to be added:
           Errors of U-235 thermal yields;
           Additional uncertainties from complicated decay schemes
              in the valley region (see: correction);
           The largest error contribution comes from the Th-232
              yield curve normalisation.
           The total error is estimated to be about 10-20%.
COMMENT    by compiler (ML):
           1) The final Th-232 yields as given by the authors are
              included to give an idea of the absolute yield
              values. However, the U-235 reference yields are
              superseded, and absolute yields will change
              considerably, especially in the valley region, if
              up-to-date U-235 yields are used.
           2) 2 Misprints in Table 1 of the publication for Ba-139
              (corrected in data Table)
              - The U-235 reference yield is given as 5.55;
              - The error of the Th-232 yield is given as 0.033.
           3) Differences in U-235 reference yields compared to
              those given by Katcoff (Monit-ref):
              - Rh-105: Value in Monit-ref is for Ru-105
              - Ag-113: No value given in Monit-ref for A=113
              - In-117: Value in Monit-ref is for Cd-117m (3 hr)
              - Sn-125: Value in Monit-ref is for Sb-125
              - Pr-143: Not given in Monit-ref;does not agree
                        with values for Ce-143 or Nd-143.
