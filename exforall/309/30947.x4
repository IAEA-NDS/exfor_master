TITLE      FISSION OF 232TH BY REACTOR NEUTRONS: MASS-YIELD CURVE
AUTHOR     (R.H.IYER,C.K.MATHEWS,N.RAVINDRAN,K.RENGAN, D.V.SINGH,

INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,25,465,63)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) APSARA SWIMMING POOL REACTOR
INC-SPECT  PILE NEUTRONS FROM CORE OF APSARA REACTOR; SAMPLES
           IRRADIATED IN THE SAME POSITION FOR 15 MIN TO 40 HRS.
           FLUCTUATIONS OF REACTOR POWER LEVEL DURING IRRADIATIONS
             WERE SMALL AND DID NOT AFFECT RESULTS.
           COMPILERS COMMENT (ML): FOR THE CODING OF REACTION AND
             NEUTRON ENERGY, THE SPECTRUM OF NEUTRONS FISSIONING
             TH-232 (FISSION THRESHOLD ABOUT 1.1 MEV) WAS ASSUMED
             TO BE (CLOSE TO) A FISSION SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     FOR IRRADIATION:
              THORIUM: PURE OXIDE, HYDROCARBONATE, OR METAL FOILS:
                       <0.5 PPM URANIUM, <0.8 PPM CERIUM,
                       <0.2 PPM SAMARIUM, <0.08 PPM IRON.
                       TH OXIDE: 10 G SAMPLES
              URANIUM: METAL FOILS, 0.5 G SAMPLES
              SAMPLES IN SEPARATE PURE ALUMINIUM FOILS, ENCLOSED
                IN THE SAME PURE ALUMINIUM CONTAINERS.
           FOR COUNTING:
              SEPARATED FISSION PRODUCTS CENTRED ON ALUMINIUM
              PLATES AND COVERED WITH 3 MG/CM2 CELLOPHANE PAPER.
METHOD     (RVAL).RELATIVE U-235 THERMAL FISSION, STANDARD: MO-99;
              SIMULTANEOUS IRRADIATION OF TH AND U SAMPLES;
              COUNTING OF SAMPLES UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS.
           (RCHEM). SAMPLES WERE DISSOLVED, FISSION PRODUCTS
              CHEMICALLY SEPARATED AND MOUNTED FOR COUNTING.
           (BSPEC,GSPEC).COUNTED LONG ENOUGH TO KEEP STATISTICAL
              ERROR BELOW 1%; IF POSSIBLE, UNTIL COMPLETE DECAY.
DETECTOR   (PROPC).BETAS: SUGARMAN-TYPE METHANE FLOW COUNTER, END
              WINDOW COVERED WITH 1.1 MG/CM2 ALUMINISED MYLAR
           (NAICR).GAMMAS: 1.5X1 INCH, SINGLE CHANNEL OR 100

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION 1) FOR ALIQUOT AND CHEMICAL YIELD
           2) FOR DECAY AFTER IRRADIATION
           3) COUNTING: FOR SELF-ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING;
           CORRECTIONS FOR DECAY DURING IRRADIATION CANCELLED OUT
              IN THE R-VALUE BECAUSE OF SIMULTANEOUS IRRADIATION
              OF SAMPLES. THE AUTHORS ASSUMED THAT THE GENETIC
              RELATIONSHIPS ARE THE SAME IN TH-232 FAST AND U-235
              THERMAL NEUTRON FISSION UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE
              EXPERIMENT AND FOR THE FISSION PRODUCTS CONSIDERED.
              THEY DISCUSSED THE COMPLICATED DECAY SCHEMES AND
              EXISTING ISOMERS FOR THE ISOTOPES OF AG, CD, IN AND
              SN, WHICH THEY COULD NOT CORRECT FOR, AND CONCLUDED
              THAT THE CORRESPONDING ERRORS IN R-VALUES SHOULD
              HAVE BEEN SMALL.
           CORRECTIONS FOR U-235 FAST FISSION WERE NEGLIGIBLE.
           CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SECONDARY NOUTRON FISSION IN LARGE
              THORIUM TARGETS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 1%
              AND COULD BE NEGLECTED.
           NO CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR NEUTRON CAPTURE.

COMMENT    BY COMPILER (ML):
           1) THE FINAL TH-232 YIELDS AS GIVEN BY THE AUTHORS ARE
              INCLUDED TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE ABSOLUTE YIELD
              VALUES. HOWEVER, THE U-235 REFERENCE YIELDS ARE
              SUPERSEDED, AND ABSOLUTE YIELDS WILL CHANGE
              CONSIDERABLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY REGION, IF
              UP-TO-DATE U-235 YIELDS ARE USED.

              - IN-117: VALUE IN MONIT-REF IS FOR CD-117M (3 HR)
