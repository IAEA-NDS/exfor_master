FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (PSSCN) A CYLINDRICAL LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TUBE OF 100
           CM IN LENGTH AND 5.3 CM IN INNER DIAMETER WITH TWO
           PHOTOMULTIPLIERS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE TUBE. THE POSITION
           INFORMATION OF THE INCIDENT NEUTRONS WAS OBTAINED FROM
           THE TIME DIFFERENCE OF BOTH PHOTOMULTIPLIER SIGNALS.
MONITOR    THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS MONITORED BY COUNTING ASSOCIATED
           ALPHA'S PRODUCED IN THE T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION
METHOD     (TOF,PSD,ASSOP) THE ASSOCIATED ( ALPHA-)PARTICLE TOF
           TECHNIQUE AND PULSE SHAPE (N-GAMMA) DISCRIMINATION
           WERE USED TO REDUCE THE BACKGROUND.
CORRECTION THE RESULTS WERE CORRECTED FOR THE NEUTRON FLUX
           ATTENUATION, MULTIPLE NEUTRON SCATTERING AND FINITE
           GEOMETRY BY THE MONTE-CARLO METHOD.
ERR-ANALYS ONLY STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE GIVEN. THE UNCERTAINTY IN
           THE CROSS SECTION CAUSED BY THE ASYMMETRY OF THE
           COLLIMATED NEUTRON-BEAM PROFILE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
           ABOUT 3%. THE SUM OF ERRORS CAUSED BY MONTE CARLO
           CORRECTIONS, CORRECTION FOR DEAD TIME OF ALPHA COUNTING
           AND UNCERTAINTY OF THE NUMBER OF NUCLEI IN THE SAMPLES
           WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 3%.
           THE ANGULAR UNCERTAINTY IS +- 0.8 DEG. THE ENERGY
           RESOLUTION OF THE MEASURING SYSTEM IS 1 MEV SO THE
           DATA INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NEUTRONS SCATTERED
           INELASTICALLY FROM LOW-LYING EXCITED LEVELS.
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM TABLE 2 OF NUCL. SCI. AND ENGIN.,
           VOL. 111, PAGE 309(1992).
