INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (PS,SCIN) A cylindrical liquid scintillator tube of
           100 cm in length and 5.3 cm in inner diameter with two
           photomultipliers at both ends of the tube. The position
           information of the incident neutrons was obtained from
           the time difference of both photomultiplier signals.
MONITOR    The neutron beam was monitored by counting associated
           alpha's produced in the T(d,n)He-4 reaction
METHOD     (TOF,PSD,ASSOP) The associated (alpha-)particle TOF
           technique and pulse shape (n-gamma) discrimination
           were used to reduce the background.
            EN-RSL: The energy resolution of the measuring
           system is 1 MeV so the data include contributions
           from neutrons scattered inelastically from low-lying
           excited levels.
CORRECTION The results were corrected for the neutron flux
           attenuation, multiple neutron scattering and finite
           geometry by the monte-carlo method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty in the cross section caused
               by the asymmetry of the collimated neutron-beam
               profile was estimated to be about 3%.
           (ERR-2,,3.) The sum of errors caused by Monte Carlo
           corrections, correction for dead time of alpha counting
           and uncertainty of the number of nuclei in the samples
           was estimated to be less than 3%.
           (ANG-ERR) The angular uncertainty is +- 0.8 deg.
           (ERR-T,7.,10.) Total error varies from 7 till 10%
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Table 2 of Nucl. Sci.
            and Engin., Vol. 111, p. 309(1992).
