SAMPLE     HIGH-PURITY NATURAL IN, THICKNESS 375MG/CM2
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING AL-BACKED
           TI-T TARGET WITH 200 KEV DEUTERONS. NEUTRON ENERGY
           WAS SELECTED BY THE ANGULAR POSITION OF THE SAMPLE.
           THE NEUTRON ENERGY VERSUS EMISSION ANGLE HAS BEEN
           DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE ACTIVITY RATIO OF ZR-89
           AND NB-92M PRODUCED IN THE ZR AND NB FOILS BY (N,2N)
           REACTION USING CROSS SECTION DATA FROM LITERATURE.
           NEUTRON ENERGY SPREADS (1/2FWHM) AT EN=14.8, 14.4,
           14.0 AND 13.5 MEV ARE FOUND TO BE 210, 130, 40 AND
           130 KEV RESP. FROM LITERATURE
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ERR-ANALYS UNCERTAINTIES COMBINED BY QUADRATURE HAVE BEEN
           ESTIMATED AT THE 1SIGMA LEVEL
