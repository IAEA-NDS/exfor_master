TITLE      Neutron induced cross section of In-115 around 14 MeV

SAMPLE     High-purity natural In, thickness 375mg/cm2
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding Al-backed
           Ti-T target with 200 keV deuterons. Neutron energy
           was selected by the angular position of the sample.
           The neutron energy versus emission angle has been
           determined by measuring the activity ratio of Zr-89
           and Nb-92m produced in the Zr and Nb foils by (n,2n)
           reaction using cross section data from literature.
           Neutron energy spreads (1/2FWHM) at En=14.8, 14.4,
           14.0 and 13.5 MeV are found to be 210, 130, 40 and
           130 keV resp. from literature
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ADD-RES    The total nonelastic cross section, and with it the
           partial inelastic cross section leading to the ground
           state, are estimated and given in Table 2 as well.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties combined by quadrature have
                      been estimated at the 1sigma level

           (,V.N.Manokhin+,B,OKAMOTO,,305,1987) The cross-section
            for this reaction between 13.0 and 15.0 MeV from
            Manokhin et al. was normalized to the recommended data
            of  Ryves at 14.6 MeV

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
CORRECTION Corrections for efficiency of GM counter and self-
           absorption in the samples as a function of max beta
           energy and the contribution of the In-113(n,g)
           reaction to the In-114 activities (<1%), have been
           determined experimentally
