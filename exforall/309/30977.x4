SAMPLE     NB-93 FOILS.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS THE TOTAL ERRORS IN THE CROSS SECTIONS INCLUDE ERRORS
           INVOLVED IN FLUX MEASUREMENT, COUNTING STATISTICS,
           DECAY DATA, DETECTOR EFFICIENCY ETC, AND WERE DETER-
           MINED BY SUMMING THE INDIVIDUAL ERRORS IN QUADRATURE.
STATUS     DATA ARE TAKEN FROM TABLES 4 AND 5 OF RADIOCHEMICAL
           ACTA, VOL. 51 (1990), PP49.
