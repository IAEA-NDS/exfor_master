SAMPLE     Nb-93 foils.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross sections
           include errors involved in:
             * flux measurement,
             * counting statistics,
             * decay data,
             * detector efficiency etc,
           and were determined by summing the individual errors
           in quadrature.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data are taken from Tables 4 and 5 of
                      Radiochemica  Acta, vol. 51 (1990), p49.
