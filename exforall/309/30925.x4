MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) THE FISSION CHAMBER SERVED TO
                                MEASURE THE NEUTRON FLUENCE,
                                WAS OPERATED AS AN IONIZATION
                                CHAMBER WITH A VOLTAGE GRADIENT
                                OF 600 V/CM AND A CONTINUOUS GAS
                                FLOW OF PURE AR AS COUNTING GAS.

            THE RATIO OF THE 238-U(N,F)AND 27-AL(N,A) CROSS SECT-

           -THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION 93-NB(N,INL)NB-93-M
            WAS MEASURED BY FOIL ACTIVATION AT THE NEUTRON ENERGY
            OF 2.83 MEV RELATIVE TO THE 238-U(N,F) CROSS SECTION
            EMPLOYING A SMALL IONIZATION CHAMBER AS FLUENCE
            MONITOR.
           -THE INDUCED M-93-NB ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED BY
            MEASURING THE K-SHELL X-RAYS FROM THE 30.7KEV ISOMERIC
            TRANSITION.
           -THE MASS OF THE FISSIONABLE DEPOSIT WAS CALIBRATED
            RELATIVE TO THE MASS OF AN AL FOIL BY MEANS OF AN
            IRRADIATION EXPERIMENT AT 14.8 MEV USING THE RATIO OF
            THE 238-U(N,F) AND 27-AL(N,A)NA-24 CROSS SECTION.
           -THE NI FOILS SERVED TO MEASURE THE FLUENCE GRADIENT
            VIA THE 58-CO ACTIVITY INDUCED.

                 CURRENT OF X250 MICRO-AMP.
INC-SPECT  THE EFFECTIVE MEAN NEUTRON ENERGY WAS ADOPTED TO BE:
             2.83+-0.04 MEV FOR THE NB AND NI FOILS WITH 20MM DIA.
             2.87+-0.04 MEV FOR THE 238-U LAYER AND NI FOILS WITH
             10MM DIA.
             THE EFFECTS OF THE VARIOUS UNCERTAINTY COMPONENTS
             ARE MENTIONED IN TAB I  AT THE PRESENT WORK.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)THE CHARACTERISTIC NB K-SHELL X-RAYS EMITTED
                  AFTER INTERNAL CONVERSION OF THE 30.7KEV
                  TRANSITION TO THE GROUND STATE,WAS DETECTED BY
                  SI-LI DETECTOR,WITH DIAMETER OF THE ACTIVE VOL.:
                  25MM, THICKNESS:5MM,BE WINDOW:0.0125MM AND
                  RESOLUTION:APPROX. 400 EV AT 17 KEV.
                  IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE 93M-NB ACTI-
                  VITY THE EMPLOYED X-RAY DETECTOR WAS CALIBRATED
                  WITH RESPECT TO ITS EFFICIENCY FOR THE NB
                  K-SHELL X-RAYS.

CORRECTION 1.-THE CONVERSION FACTOR FOR THE FLUENCE IN THE FOILS
              WITH 20-MM DIA TO THE FLUENCE IN THE U-LAYER WITH
              10 MM DIA WAS EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED BY MEASURING
              THE ACTIVITY OF THE RING-SHAPED PART AND THE CENTRAL
              PART (DIA 10MM)OF THE INNER NI FOIL SEPARATELY,THUS
              TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DECREASE OF THE NEUTRON FLUX
              WITH INCREASING ANGLE
           2.-IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE COUNT
              RATE IN THE NB K-SHELL X-RAY PEAKS DUE TO THE
              INFLUENCE OF THE TA INPURITIES IN THE NB SAMPLE, A
              0.1MM THICK TA FOIL(20MM DIA)WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY
              IRRADIATED,AND THE INDUCED 182-TA ACTIVITY MEASURED
              AFTERWARDS.
           3.-CORRECTIONS HAD TO BE APPLIED TO THE RECORDED
              FISSION FRAGMENT SPECTRA FOR THE EXTRAPOLATION FROM
              THE BIAS LEVEL TO ZERO PULSE HEIGHT AND FOR SELF
              ABSORPTION OF THE FISSION FRAGMENTS CONSIDERING
              REACTION KINEMATICS AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
              FRAGMENTS.
           4.-CORRECTION FOR THE BACKGROUND EFFECT.IT WAS ESSENT-
              IAL TO MEASURE THE BACKGROUND SPECTRUM USING A NB
              FOIL OF THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS THE IRRADIATED FOIL,
              BUT NOT ACTIVATED BY NEUTRONS.

              ELASTICALLY SCATTERED BY THE NB FOIL AND UNSCATTERED
              BY ADJACENT MATERIAL WAS ESTIMATED
           6.-SOURCE EFFECTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT DETERMINING
              EXPERIMENTALLY THE SELF-ATTENUATION OF THE MEASURED
              X-RADIATION AND CONSIDERING THE EXTENSION AND
