TITLE      Mass distribution in the reactor neutron fission of
           231Pa and 237Np
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Swimming pool reactor "Apsara"
INC-SPECT  Reactor pile spectrum, but the samples were covered
           with cadmium foils thick enough to cut off the thermal
           neutron flux almost completely.
           Irradiation times varied from 6 to 24 hrs.
METHOD     (RCHEM).using standard procedures
           (RVAL).relative to U-235 thermal fission with Ba-140 as
           internal standard. Absolute yields were obtained by
           normalization of the mass yield distribution to 200%,
           which was generated by drawing a smooth curve through
           the measured points and extrapolating it at the light
           and heavy mass wing of the distribution.
           The measured R-values are not given.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Sugarman type methane flow proportional counter
ANALYSIS   The values given are averages of all determinations.
ERR-ANALYS The errors given are the mean quare deviations of the
           respective number of determinations.
           Compiler's comments:
           - Apparantly only statistical errors are given as one
             standard deviation.
           - A general statement is made that probably refers to
             the estimated maximum overall error: "The maximum
             expected error in the values in the region of high
             yields is about 10% and in the region of low yields
             about 20%."

           yields are not given. They were taken from 3 sources:

SAMPLE     About 1 mg of Np-237 as nitrate solution, evaporated on
