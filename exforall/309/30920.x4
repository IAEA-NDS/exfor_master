SAMPLE     Solutions containing approx. 10 microg. of U-233,
           Pu-239 and Pu-241.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) neutron flux 2.x 10**13 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (RCHEM)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector coupled to a 4k MCA
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors were computed from those due to:
             * peak area statistics,
             * precursor yield,
             * detecting efficiency and
             * abundance of the gamma lines followed, and
             * from the fitting error in the least-square analysis

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Separation time activities for I-134-m and
           I-134-g were evaluated from least-square fitting of
           the corresponding time dependent activity profiles,
           and were correlated to the corresponding independent
           isomeric yields and the fractional cumulative yield
           of the precursor Te-134, the latter being taken from
           literature.

RESULT     (FRCUM) Fractional cumulative yield for Te-134
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from Table 1 of Radiochim.Acta 39,127.
           Compiler's comment: Authors mention in text (top of
           p.128) that they measured this value as part of
           another experiment (see REL-REF and EXFOR 30910).
           However this result is not mentioned in that
           publication.
