            134Te fractional cumulative yield (0.655+-0.016) given
SAMPLE      Solutions containing approx. 10 microg. of U-233,
            Pu-239 and Pu-241.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) neutron flux 2.x 10**13 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (RCHEM)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector coupled to a 4k MCA
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors were computed from those due to:
            - peak area statistics;
            - precursor yield;
            - detecting efficiency;
            - abundance of the gamma lines followed;
            - fitting error in the least-square analysis

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Separation time activities for I-134-m and
            I-134-g were evaluated from least-square fitting of
            the corresponding time dependent activity profiles,
            and were correlated to the corresponding independent
            isomeric yields and the fractional cumulative yield
            of the precursor Te-134, the latter being taken from
            literature.
