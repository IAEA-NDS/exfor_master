TITLE      Investigation of thermal-neutron capture gamma-rays on
           Ni-58(n,g)Ni-59

INSTITUTE  (3BZLIPE)
REFERENCE  (C,88MITO,,133,198806)
           (R,IEA-78,,1978)the basic features of the internal
                            target facility are described in more
                            details.
SAMPLE     a well mixed sample of natural nickel and melamine
            (C3-H6-n6) contained within a reactor grade graphite
           capsule.
FACILITY   (REAC,3BZLIPE)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) the neutron flux was about 5.2x10**11 n/sec/cm
METHOD     The gamma-ray spectrum of thermal neutron capture on
           58Ni was measured in the energy range of 3.7 To 9.3MeV
           The experiment was carried out at the tangential
           reactor channel.The gamma-rays were detected by Ge(Li)
           -NaI(Tl) pair spectrometer.The partial cross sections
           for several gamma-ray transitions have been calculated
           and by summing all of them,was determined the total
           thermal neutron capture cross section for 58-Ni(n,g).
INC-SPECT  (THS) thermal neutron spectrum.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR).-Ge(Li)and NaI(Tl) pair spectrometer consisting
                  of a 45.5 Cc true coaxial Ge(Li) detector which
                  fits into a cylindrical opening in the common
                  housing of 2 optically separated(5x6)inc.Nai(Tl)
                  crystals.-
CORRECTION The determination of the efficiency curve as a function
           the gamma-ray energies was made experimentally, by
           measuring a set of gamma-rays with very well known
           energy and intensity values.For this purpose was used
           gamma-rays from 14-N(n,g)N-15 and 35-Cl(n,g)Cl-36
           reactions in the region of 1.8 To 11 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS Nno error analysis given.

           was used the 5297,5592,7298 and 8310 keV gamma-ray
           transitions from 14-N(n,g) reaction as standards in
           order to evaluate the partial cross section of the
           primary g-rays of the 58-Ni(n,g) reaction.

           given as a average sigma data from exfor 12718.002 and
           12718.003
ANALYSIS   The area of the double escape peak of the measured
           gamma-rays was obtained by a gaussian fitting in the
           computer code.
