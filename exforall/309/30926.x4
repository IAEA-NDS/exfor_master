           (R,IEA-78,,78)THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL
                            TARGET FACILITY ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE
                            DETAILS.
SAMPLE     A WELL MIXED SAMPLE OF NATURAL NICKEL AND MELAMINE
            (C3-H6-N6) CONTAINED WITHIN A REACTOR GRADE GRAPHITE
           CAPSULE.
FACILITY   (REAC,3BZLIPE)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS ABOUT 5.2E11 N/(SEC.CM-2)
METHOD     WAS MEASURED THE GAMMA-RAY SPECTRUM OF THERMAL NEUTRON
           CAPTURE ON 58-NI IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 3.7 TO 9.3 MEV
           THE EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE TANGENTIAL
           REACTOR CHANNEL.THE GAMMA-RAYS WERE DETECTED BY GE(LI)
           -NAI(TL) PAIR SPECTROMETER.THE PARTIAL CROSS SECTIONS
           FOR SEVERAL GAMMA-RAY TRANSITIONS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED
           AND BY SUMMING ALL OF THEM,WAS DETERMINED THE TOTAL
           THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION FOR 58-NI(N,G).
INC-SPECT  THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
DETECTOR   (BPAIR).-GE(LI)AND NAI(TL) PAIR SPECTROMETER CONSISTING
                  OF A 45.5 CC TRUE COAXIAL GE(LI) DETECTOR WHICH
                  FITS INTO A CYLINDRICAL OPENING IN THE COMMON
                  HOUSING OF 2 OPTICALLY SEPARATED(5X6)INC.NAI(TL)
                  CRYSTALS.-
CORRECTION THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFICIENCY CURVE AS A FUNCTION
           THE GAMMA-RAY ENERGIES WAS MADE EXPERIMENTALLY, BY
           MEASURING A SET OF GAMMA-RAYS WITH VERY WELL KNOWN
           ENERGY AND INTENSITY VALUES.FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS USED
           GAMMA-RAYS FROM 14-N(N,G)N-15 AND 35-CL(N,G)CL-36
           REACTIONS IN THE REGION OF 1.8 TO 11 MEV.
