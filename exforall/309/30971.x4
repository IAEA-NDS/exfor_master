TITLE      DETERMINATION OF THE RATIO OF THE HYDROGEN AND
           MANGANESE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS BY THE MANGANESE
           BATH TECHNIQUE

SAMPLE     AQUEOUS MANGANESE SULFATE SOLUTION IN A SPHERICAL
           BATH WITH AN INNER DIAMETER OF 125 CM
INC-SOURCE (CF252) PLACED IN THE CENTER OF THE MANGANESE BATH
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (MANGB,ACTIV) THE MN-56 GAMMA ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED AND
           THE NAI DETECTOR EFFICIENCY DETERMINED AT SIX DIFFERENT
           VALUES FOR THE CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE AQUEOUS
           MANGANESE SULFATE SOLUTION. THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
           WAS DETERMINED FROM THE ABSOLUTE DESINTEGRATION RATE
           OF THE MN-56 SOLUTION, WHICH WAS MEASURED WITH THE
           4-PI BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE COUNTING METHOD.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) THE NEUTRON SOURCE STRENGTH AND THE NEUTRON AB-
           SORPTION CROSS SECTION RATIO HYDROGEN/MANGANESE WERE
           DETERMINED FROM THE HYDROGEN AND MANGANESE CONCENTRA-
           TION RATIO'S, THE CORRESPONDING EFFICIENCIES AND MN-56
           ACTIVITIES WITH THE STRAIGHT-LINE FIT METHOD.
