TITLE      Fine structure in the neutron emission nu(A) from
           252Cf spontaneous fission fragments

METHOD     the double-energy method and low energy neutron
           detection geometry
SAMPLE     The 252Cf spontaneous fission source was deposited on
            a 110 mu-g/cm2 nickel backing foil. The source
           activity was 1.2 x  10**3 fission/s for the first
           series of measurements (6 x 10**5  two-fragment
           coincidence events analyzed and 5 x l0**2 fission/s
           for the second series (1.2 x 10**6 coincidences
           analyzed.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The two fission fragment surface barrier
           detectors were used in the  first series of
           measurements collimated to 1 cm2 active area. For the
           second  series ORTEC surface barrier detectors were
           used, collimated to 3 cm2 active  area.
           (STANK) The scintillator tank was operated with a 4-Pi
            neutron detection  efficiency of ~ 45%, giving
           typical count rates of 0.2 genuine fission neutron
           per gate and 0.15 background counts per gate.
CORRECTION Following corrections were made for the scintillator
           tank geometry and efficiency.
           The data were not corrected for dead time losses, as
           this correction was negligible.

           The final  nu(A) results are a weighted sum
           of the two series (1.8 xl0**6  total events). The
           nu(A) behaviour observed in each series,  however,
           was very similar.
