TITLE      Determination of independent yields of I131 and I133
           in thermal neutron fission of 235U by selective recoil
           labelling
FACILITY   No information given, but the compiler assumes that the
           irradiations were done at the IRR-1 swimming pool type
           reactor at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center.
METHOD     (RCHEM) 2 methods were employed:
            1) The apparent direct yields of I-133,I-134 and I-135
               were obtained by selective labelling;
            2) the respective cumulative yields by conventional
               wet radiochemistry.
           (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   The amounts obtained by method 1) were expressed as
           fractions of those obtained by method 2), giving the
           apparent fractional independent yield. The real
           independent yields were obtained by extrapolation of
           the apparent fractional yields to zero time after
           irradiation.

ANALYSIS   The assumed values were used for conversion of the
           measured values to independent fission yields.
           Compilers note: since the yields were obtained from
           relative activities of iodine fission product isotopes,
           all assumed values were used for the complete
           analysis of raw data.
COMMENT    by commpiler: apparently was the independent yield of
           I-134 used to normalize the measured relative direct
           yields obtained by method 1). It was calculated from
           the fractional independent yield given by Wahl
            (ASSUM3) and the I-134 cumulative yield by Katcoff.
STATUS     Data from text on page 64 of progress report IA-1128.
