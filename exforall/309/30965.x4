REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,11,(3),845,197503) same value as in Rider file,

TITLE      Odd-even systematics in neutron fission yields of 233U
            and 235U
INC-SPECT  Phys.Rev.C 11(1975)845: for bulk of data in Table IV:
           fission spectrum with average energy of 1.9 MeV.
METHOD     no information as original source of data is unknown
COMMENT    Compiler's (ML) comment: the origin of the yield value
           compiled by B.F.Rider and included here is not clear:
           - The Rider file contains the value given in the data
             table (Subentry 2) associated with the reference
             74AMI2.
           - The Rider reference files gives under 74AMI2: 'Amiel,
             S., Izak-Biran,T., To be published (1974). Cited in
             74AMI1.'
           - For 74AMI1 the Rider reference file states: 'Amiel,
             S., Feldstein, H., "Odd-Even Systematics in Neutron
             Fission Yields of Uranium Isotopes 233 and 235",
             submitted to Phys.Rev.C (July 1974). See 75AMI1'.
           - For 75AMI1 the Rider reference file gives Phys.Rev.C
             11(1975)845 (which is taken as the main reference for
             this entry).
           Compiler (ML) assumes that 74AMI1 and 75AMI1 are the
           same reference.
           - Table IV of Phys.Rev.C 11(1975)845 contains the same
             value as the Rider file; therefore it is used as the
             main reference for this entry.
           - This table contains a footnote b) to the fractional
             yield value giving 'Reference 31' as its origin.
             Reference 31 is given as: 'S.Amiel and T.Izak-Biran,
             Nucl.Sci.Eng. (to be published)'.
           The compiler (ML) identified this reference as:
           T.Izak-Biran and S.Amiel, "Reevaluation of the Emission
           Probabilities of Delayed Neutrons from Fission
           Products", Nucl.Sci.Eng. 57(1975)117. (There is no
           other paper by these authors in Nucl.Sci.Eng. during
           the years 1974-1976). However:
           - this reference presents an evaluation of delayed
             neutron yields. All data presented are evaluated or
             taken from another source.
           - It contains for fast fission only delayed neutron
             group yields (Table III) but no yields for individual
             precursors and hence none for Br-87.
           - Even if one assumes that the group 1 consists only of
             Br-87, the delayed neutron yield (for 10% odd-even
             effect) of 4.8, divided by the given Pn-value of 2.35
             for Br-87, gives a cumulative yield of 2.04, which,
             divided by the chain yield of 2.55 (given in Table IV
             of Phys.Rev.C 11(1975)845 along with the fractional
             cumulative yield of 0.87), gives a fractional
             cumulative yield of 0.80.
           Conclusions:
           - Nucl.Sci.Eng. 57(1975)117 is not the source of the
             compiled value.
           - It is even not known whether the value is the result
             of an experiment and whether it originates from this
             laboratory.
           Therefore it is recommended not to use that value in an
           evaluation without any further information on, or
           confirmation of, its origin and nature.
