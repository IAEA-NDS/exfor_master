            11 MeV
COMMENT    By compiler:
            Data are plotted by smooth curves with a few
            representative points by symbols. Only these symbols
            were digitized and compiled.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on the source of uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Target thickness variation and possible
            insufficient collection of charge by Faraday cup  (7%)
