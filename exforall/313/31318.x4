TITLE      Total cross-section measurements with 14 MeV neutrons.
AUTHOR     (B.Mitra)

INSTITUTE  (3INDBOS)
FACILITY   (NGEN,3INDBOS) The neutron generator has a vertical
           constrnction, with the target earthed, and the target
           end has been projected through a (4.in. x 4.in.) hole
           into a large basement room.
METHOD     (TRN) Conventional transmission measurement with sample
           once in the direct beam and then reading vhen sample is
           out of the direct beam.
SAMPLE     The samples are pure elements in the form of cylinders
           of diam. 2.54 cms and length kept different for
           different samples so as to keep transmission
                                           nearly 50-60%.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Directional counter has been employed as fast
           neutron detector, along with conventional plastic
           scintillator detectors
           (BF3,SCIN) Scintillator and BF3 long counter
              are used as a monitor
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Nothing said about uncertainties
