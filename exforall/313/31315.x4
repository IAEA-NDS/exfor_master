SAMPLE     A cylindrical brass chamber, 19 cm in diam. and 6.6 cm
           in height was filled with the gas under study at
           atmospheric pressure. Natural neon gas consits of
           90.92% 20Ne, 0.26% 2lNe and 8.82% 22Ne.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
METHOD     Three exposures were made:
             a) wlth neon gas at atmospheric pressure,
             b) with vacuum in the chamber which served as the
                background for hydrogen as well as neon,
             c) with hydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure which
                served as the standard for determination of the
                neon cross-section; this was also used as a check
                on the geometry employed, by studying the known
                energy and angular distributions of the recoil
                protons.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford K2 emulsions of 400 mu-m thickness were
                      used as detectors.
           (SCIN) The neutron flux was monitored with a gamma-
            insensitive boron-plastic zinc-sulphide scintillator.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-S) The statistical errors in the total number of
               tracks in the hydrogen and neon spectra used for
               the eross-section measurement are 8.4% and 16.4%
                respectively.
           (ERR-1) Error in the standard hydrogen cross-section
           (ERR-2) Error due to the neutron monitor fluetuation,
           gave a root mean square error of 18.5%, that is, <20%.

COMMENT    Author's comment:"22Ne is only 9 % abundant and its
           cross-section is expected to be only l/4th that of 20Ne
           hence its contribution to the cross-section given above
           is expected to be less than 2%. As such, the measured
           cross-section is almost entirely for the 20Ne isotope."
