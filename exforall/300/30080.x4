TITLE      NI-58(N,2N) CROSS-SECTION IN THE ENERGY RANGE FROM
           13 TO 16 MEV
REACTION   (28-NI-58(N,2N)28-NI-57,,SIG)
FACILITY   (VDG) VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION
INC-SPECT  THE ENERGY SPREADS WERE DETERMINED BY CALCULATING THE
           EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INCIDENT NEUTRONS ON THE
           SAMPLES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE IRRADIATION GEOMETRY,
           THE NEUTRON ENERGY ANGULAR DEPENDENCE, THE DEUTERON
           ENERGY LOSS IN THE TITANIUM-TRITIUM TARGET.
           THE EFFECTIVE ENERGY CORRESPONDS TO THE MIDDLE POINT OF
           THE FWHM AND IS GIVEN UNDER  EN
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(N,2N)29-CU-64,,SIG)
           DATA FROM PRESTWOOD ET AL.,PHYS.REV.121,1438(1961)
           THE CU SAMPLE WAS PLACED AT 90 DEG WITH
           RESPECT TO THE DEUTERON BEAM. NEUTRON FLUX VARIATIONS
           DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE OF EMISSION WERE MONITORED BY
           THE FE-56(N,P) REACTION, THE CROSS-SECTION OF WHICH WAS
           TAKEN FROM SANTRY ET AL.,CAN.J.PHYS.42(1964)1030
