TITLE      ISOMERIC CROSS-SECTION RATIOS AND TOTAL CROSS-SECTIONS

INC-SPECT  THE ENERGY SPREADS WERE DETERMINED BY CALCULATING THE
           EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INCIDENT NEUTRONS ON THE
           SAMPLES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE IRRADIATION GEOMETRY,
           THE NEUTRON ENERGY ANGULAR DEPENDENCE, THE DEUTERON
           ENERGY LOSS IN THE TITANIUM-TRITIUM OR TITANIUM-
           DEUTERIUM TARGET.
           THE EFFECTIVE NEUTRON ENERGY SPREADS WERE, BY
           DEFINITION, THE HALF-MAXIMUM WIDTHS OF THE DISTRIBUTNS
           OBTAINED. EFFECTIVE ENERGIES CORRESPOND TO THE MIDDLE
           POINTS OF THE HALF-MAXIMUM WIDTHS.
           71.54+-0.75 DAYS
SAMPLE     NATURAL TARGETS
METHOD     EACH SAMPLE (AS WELL AS THE REFERENCE, CU OR ZN)
           WAS PLACED BETWEEN TWO IRON DISKS. THE RELATIVE
           ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED
           BY MEASURING THE BETA+ ACTIVITY OF MN-56 WITH A GM
           COUNTER.
           (ACTIV) BETA DECAY OF CO-58 WAS MEASURED BY COUNTING
           THE COINCIDENCES OF TWO CORRELATED ANNIHILATION GAMMA
           RAYS BY MEANS OF A SLOW-FAST COINCIDENCE SPECTROMETER.

             .ABOVE 12 MEV, BY COUNTING THE PROTON RECOILS FROM A
              POLYETHYLENE FOIL IN A CSI SCINTILLATION COUNTER
