TITLE      ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF ALPHA PARTICLES FROM THE
           REACTION O16(N,ALFA)C13 AT EN=14.1 MEV
FACILITY   (CCW)      COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR WORKING AS A
           PULSED NEUTRON SOURCE SYNCHRONIZED TO THE DETECTOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T)      H3(D,N)HE4 REACTION WITH 150 KEV DEUTERONS
SAMPLE     SEE DETECTOR
METHOD     STEREOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE TRACKS WITH 2 CAMERAS.
           TRACK LENGTHS AND ANGLES MEASURED OPTICALLY.
           EVALUATION OF ALPHA-PARTICLE ENERGY MADE BY MEANS OF
           RANGE-ENERGY TABLE OF WHALING.(ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHYSICS
           XXXIV,193,1958) AND CHECKED  EXPERIMENTALLY WITH PO-210
           ALPHA SOURCE
DETECTOR   (TRD)      EXPANSION CLOUD CHAMBER 40 CM DIAMETER AND
           20 CM HEIGHT FILLED WITH OXYGEN GAS AT 1 ATM.
ANALYSIS   THEORETICAL FITS TO OBSERVED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
           ATTEMPTED IN TERMS OF HEAVY-PARTICLE STRIPPING PROCESS
           FOR BACKWARD ANGLES AND OF KNOCK-ON PROCESS FOR FORWARD
           ANGLES USING SIMPLE BUTLER FORMULA. REASONABLY WELL FIT
           EXCEPT IN MOST BACKWARD ANGLES.
