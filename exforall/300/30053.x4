REACTION   (25-MN-55(N,TOT),,SIG)
FACILITY   (VDG)      3 MEV DACCA VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      T(P,N)HE3 REACTION. SOLID TI(T) TARGET WITH
           A THICKNESS OF 460 MICROG/SQCM,I.E. ABOUT 40 KEV
SAMPLE     PURE MN-55 IN POWDERED FORM SEALED IN AN AIR-
           TIGHT GLASS CYLINDER.DIAMETER=2.57 CM. HEIGHT=2.97 CM.
           LENGTH CHOSEN TO HAVE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN 50-70 PC.
METHOD     TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT
           DISTANCE TARGET-SAMPLE=25 CM.DISTANCE TARGET-DET=44 CM.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     ZNS-PLASTICS SCINTILLATION DETECTOR PLACED
           AT 0 DEGREES TO THE DIRECTION OF INCIDENT PROTON BEAM.
           (LONGC)    BF3 LONG COUNTER USED AS MONITOR.
PART-DET   (N)        NEUTRONS
COMMENT    SEARCH FOR DOORWAY STATES CARRIED OUT BY AVERAGING OVER
           SUCCESSIVELY LARGER ENERGY INTERVALS, BUT THEIR
           EXISTENCE COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED.
STATUS     DATA TAKEN FROM PPA 3,84,1966,TABLE 1
HISTORY    (671130C)  DATA COMPILED INTO DASTAR
           (701222T)  CONVERTED FROM DASTAR-00435
CORRECTION TRANSMISSION CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND NEUTRONS. EFFECT
           OF IN-SCATTERING WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT USING STANDARD
           TECHNIQUES.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) ERROR IN CROSS SECTION IS STANDARD DEVIATION
