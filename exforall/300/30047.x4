TITLE      PROMPT NUBAR MEASUREMENTS FOR THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION
           OF PU240 AND PU242
EXP-YEAR   (66)
METHOD     GADOLINIUM BATH IN COINCIDENCE WITH PULSES FROM FISSION
           COUNTER. FISSION NEUTRONS RECORDED FOR 40 MICROSEC AND
           STORED IN TEMPORARY STORE. AFTER 100 MICROSEC.WAITING
           PERIOD BACKGROUND RECORDED FOR ANOTHER 40 MICROSEC. AT
           END OF ENTIRE COUNTING CYCLE CONTENTS OF TEMPORARY
           STORE TRANSFERRED TO MULTIPLE EVENT COUNTER PROVIDED
           SECOND DETECTABLE FISSION EVENT HAD NOT OCCURRED.IF SO
           CONTENTS OF TEMPORARY STORE WERE ERASED.
DETECTOR   (STANK)    LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TANK 76 CM IN DIAMETER,
           CONTAINING 240 LITRES OF GADOLINIUM LOADED NE323,VIEWED
           BY 12 PHOTOMULTIPLIERS CONNECTED IN 3 COINCIDENT BANKS
           OF FOUR.ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND REDUCED BY 3 FEET OF
           HEAVY CONCRETE.
           (FISCH)    FAST IONISATION CHAMBER TO RECORD FISSIONS,
           WITH HIGH DETECTION EFFICIENCY(97.5 PC FOR PU240 AND
           PU242,98 PC FOR CF252),HIGH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
           AMPLIFIER NOISE AND COMPLETE FREEDOM FROM ALPHA PILE-UP
           EFFECTS
