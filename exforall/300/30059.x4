TITLE      Determination of thermal neutron capture cross section
           of Samarium-148
FACILITY   (REAC) Hole C1 in rig x6 of Hifar reactor
           (SPECM) A.E.I.Ltd. Mass spectrometer type MS5
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor
INC-SPECT  =Pile spectrum characterized by Westcott r=0.0004 As
           measured by Boldeman,et.Al.,AAEC/Tm151 (1962)
SAMPLE     12 Silica ampules each containing
           1-12 mu-gram samarium deposited on wall as nitrate of
           unknown hydration were irradiated in an aluminum can.
           Two isotopic compositions were prepared from Oak Ridge
           oxides of known isotopic composition. 1)Sm148 +
           0.032%Sm149. 2)Sm148/Sm149 ratio equal to about unity
METHOD     Reactor irradiation with cobalt monitor. Changes in the
           ratios Sm149/Sm148 and (Sm149+Sm150)/Sm148 were measur-
           ed with a mass spectrometer.
DETECTOR   Mass spectrometer
           (IOCH) Calibrated ionization chamber for Co-59(n,g)
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
            Sample.Aluminum wire containing 0.5% cobalt as flux
           monitor using cobalt data recommended by Wade+Bailey
            (AERE-R-5314) of which the 2200 m/s value
           is given below
PART-DET   (RSD) Product nuclei Sm-149,150 and unreacted Sm-148
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from AAEC/TM-443
HISTORY    (20080423A) Part of data restored, subentry 3 deleted.
CORRECTION Self-shielding and mass spectrometry background errors
           are discussed and considered negligible.
