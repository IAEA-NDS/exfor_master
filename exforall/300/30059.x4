TITLE      DETERMINATION OF THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION
           OF SAMARIUM-148
FACILITY   (REAC) HOLE C1 IN RIG X6 OF HIFAR REACTOR
           (SPECM) A.E.I.LTD. MASS SPECTROMETER TYPE MS5
INC-SOURCE (REAC) REACTOR
INC-SPECT  PILE SPECTRUM CHARACTERIZED BY WESTCOTT R=0.0004 AS
           MEASURED BY BOLDEMAN,ET.AL.,AAEC/TM151 (1962)
SAMPLE     12 SILICA AMPULES EACH CONTAINING
           1-12 MU-GRAM SAMARIUM DEPOSITED ON WALL AS NITRATE OF
           UNKNOWN HYDRATION WERE IRRADIATED IN AN ALUMINUM CAN.
           TWO ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS WERE PREPARED FROM OAK RIDGE
           OXIDES OF KNOWN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION. 1)SM148+0.032
           PERCENT SM149. 2)SM148/SM149 RATIO EQUAL TO ABOUT UNITY
METHOD     REACTOR IRRADIATION WITH COBALT MONITOR. CHANGES IN THE
           RATIOS SM149/SM148 AND (SM149+SM150)/SM148 WERE MEASUR-
           ED WITH A MASS SPECTROMETER.
