TITLE      A study of protons from In-115 and Au-197 with 14.8 MeV
           incident neutrons
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) D(t,n)He4.
METHOD     (COINC) Triple coincidence method
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,CSICR) Telescope consisted of two propor-
           tional counters in coincidence with a CsI(Tl) scintil-
           lation counter plus a proportional counter in antico-
           incidence.
           (HORBU) Neutron intensity monitored with Hornyak button
MONITOR     Energy calibration from recoil proton spectrum
           from elastic scattering of neutrons in polyethylene.
PART-DET   (P) Protons
CORRECTION Proton spectra corrected for absorption losses due to
           target thickness.

SAMPLE     Metal In-115 target was 32.8 mg/cm2 thick and
           3cm in diameter.
METHOD     Target was 12cm from neutron source.
COMMENT    Data given is from private communication and is incon-
           sistent with Nucl.Phys.47,473(1963),Fig.3 and data
           derived by compiler from fig.1. However data from all
           sources fall within error bars of fig.3

HISTORY    (19670830C) Compiled into Dastar-00228
           (19710526T) Transformed from Dastar to EXFOR
CORRECTION No correction in addition to use of an electronic
           blocking circuit was made for possible contamination
           of spectrum by (n,d) deuterons below 8 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS Estimated angular spread is +- 17 degrees
           errors vary from 10-20% in the measured values
           from forward to back angles.

REACTION   (49-IN-115(N,X)1-H-1,,DA/DE)
SAMPLE     Metal In-115 target was 32.8 mg/cm2 thick and 3 cm
           in diameter.
METHOD     Target was 12 cm from neutron source.
COMMENT    Numerical data requested from author.
STATUS     (CURVE)Data read from fig 1.B in Nucl.Phys.47,473(1963)
           fig.1.
CORRECTION No correction in addition to use of an electronic
           blocking circuit was made for possible contamination
           of spectrum by (n,d) deuterons below 8 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS Estimated angular spread is +-17. degrees.
           (DATA-ERR) It was read from graph by compiler and was
           assumed symmetric within reading uncertainty.
HISTORY    (19711125C) Read from graphs by JRL
           In 2008 data were digitized once more, but not changed
           in the Entry, they are in the range of uncertainties.
