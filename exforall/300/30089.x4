REACTION   (94-PU-239(N,F),,SIG)
FACILITY   (REAC) VVR-S reactor at Bucuresti
INC-SOURCE (REAC) horizontal channel with thermal neutron chopper
SAMPLE     99.88% Pu-239, 0.12% Pu-240.
           Electrospraying of Pu-acetate on a 20-micron Al-foil,
           radius= 10. mm, uniformity tested by collimated alfa
           counting. Density =  2.543x10**16 atoms/cm2 +- 0.4%
METHOD     (TOF) 2200 m/s neutrons selected by time-of-flight,
               flight-path = 5.057 m for the Pu-target
                             5.378 m for the boron-target
               channel-width = 16. micro-sec
           N-flux determined absolutely with a thick B-10
               target (transmission = 10**(-6)). Assuming the
               B-10(n,alfa) branching-ratio as known, the absorbed
               neutrons were counted through the 477.4 keV gamma-
               line of Li-7, using a Na-I spectrometer which was
               calibrated with the 412. keV line of a gold-foil at
               the same position as the B-10 target.
           Fragments were detected by counting the pulses from a
               gaseous scintillation-chamber with a thick Pu-
               this was calibrated against an ionization-chamber
               with a thin Pu-target. Both chambers were set up
               behind each other in the neutron-beam. The
               efficiency of the ionization-chamber was assumed
               = 1.+-0., after correcting for losses.
           Density of Pu-nuclei in the thin target
               was determined by measuring the alfa-activity in
               low geometry using a silicon spectrometer which was
               calibrated using a standard point Pu-239 source in
               a 2-pi geometry.
ANALYSIS   The result of the experiment is
           sigma =(2408.9+-0.92%) * eta * (1.E4 yrs)/hl *
                  * (1 - 0.002982 dge/keV) barns
           where 2408.9 corresponds to the result reported in
                      IFA-NR-33, but increased by 0.3% for
                      losses due to threshold fission detection
                      (priv.com. Petrascu 71/5/17)
                 eta is the B-10(n,alfa) branching ratio
                 hl is the Pu-239 alfa-decay half-life
                 dge is the difference between the gamma-energies
                      of Li-7* and activated gold.
           assuming
                 eta = 0.93692+-0.00006 from Deruytter+Pelfer
                      (J.Nucl.En. AB 21,833,1967)
                 hl = 2.4390E+4 years assumed in IFA-NR-33
                 dge = 67.3+-1.5 keV from Elliott+Bell (Phys.Rev.
                      74,1869,1948)
           yields sigma = 740. +- 8. barns
           Note= This result follows from correspondence between
                 A.J.Deruytter, H.D.Lemmel, and M.Petrascu.
                 The error does not include the half-life error,
                 and the half-life value requires updating after
                 a more reliable half-life of Pu-239 has been
                 established.
