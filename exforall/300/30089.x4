REACTION   (94-PU-239(N,F),,SIG)
FACILITY   (REAC) VVR-S REACTOR AT BUCURESTI
INC-SOURCE (REAC) HORIZONTAL CHANNEL WITH THERMAL NEUTRON CHOPPER
SAMPLE     99.88 PERCENT PU-239, 0.12 PERCENT PU-240.
           ELECTROSPRAYING OF PU-ACETATE ON A 20-MICRON AL-FOIL,
           RADIUS= 10. MM, UNIFORMITY TESTED BY COLLIMATED ALFA
           COUNTING. DENSITY =  2.543 10**16 ATOMS/CM2 +- 0.4
           PERCENT.
METHOD     (TOF) 2200 M/S NEUTRONS SELECTED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT,
               FLIGHT-PATH = 5.057 M FOR THE PU-TARGET
                             5.378 M FOR THE BORON-TARGET
               CHANNEL-WIDTH = 16. MICRO-SEC
           N-FLUX DETERMINED ABSOLUTELY WITH A THICK B-10
               TARGET (TRANSMISSION = 10**(-6)). ASSUMING THE
               B-10(N,ALFA) BRANCHING-RATIO AS KNOWN, THE ABSORBED
               NEUTRONS WERE COUNTED THROUGH THE 477.4 KEV GAMMA-
               LINE OF LI-7, USING A NA-I SPECTROMETER WHICH WAS
               CALIBRATED WITH THE 412. KEV LINE OF A GOLD-FOIL AT
               THE SAME POSITION AS THE B-10 TARGET.
           FRAGMENTS WERE DETECTED BY COUNTING THE PULSES FROM A
               GASEOUS SCINTILLATION-CHAMBER WITH A THICK PU-
               THIS WAS CALIBRATED AGAINST AN IONIZATION-CHAMBER
               WITH A THIN PU-TARGET. BOTH CHAMBERS WERE SET UP
               BEHIND EACH OTHER IN THE NEUTRON-BEAM. THE
               EFFICIENCY OF THE IONIZATION-CHAMBER WAS ASSUMED
               = 1.+-0., AFTER CORRECTING FOR LOSSES.
           DENSITY OF PU-NUCLEI IN THE THIN TARGET
               WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE ALFA-ACTIVITY IN
               LOW GEOMETRY USING A SILICON SPECTROMETER WHICH WAS
               CALIBRATED USING A STANDARD POINT PU-239 SOURCE IN
               A 2-PI GEOMETRY.
ANALYSIS   THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT IS
           SIGMA =(2408.9+-0.92PERCENT) * ETA * (1.E4 YRS)/HL *
                  * (1 - 0.002982 DGE/KEV) BARNS
           WHERE 2408.9 CORRESPONDS TO THE RESULT REPORTED IN
                      IFA-NR-33, BUT INCREASED BY 0.3 PERCENT FOR
                      LOSSES DUE TO THRESHOLD FISSION DETECTION
                      (PRIV.COM. PETRASCU 71/5/17)
                 ETA IS THE B-10(N,ALFA) BRANCHING RATIO
                 HL IS THE PU-239 ALFA-DECAY HALF-LIFE
                 DGE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GAMMA-ENERGIES
                      OF LI-7* AND ACTIVATED GOLD.

                 HL = 2.4390E+4 YEARS ASSUMED IN IFA-NR-33
                 DGE = 67.3+-1.5 KEV FROM ELLIOTT+BELL (PHYS.REV.
                      74,1869,1948)
           YIELDS SIGMA = 740. +- 8. BARNS
           NOTE= THIS RESULT FOLLOWS FROM CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN
                 A.J.DERUYTTER, H.D.LEMMEL, AND M.PETRASCU.
                 THE ERROR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE HALF-LIFE ERROR,
                 AND THE HALF-LIFE VALUE REQUIRES UPDATING AFTER
                 A MORE RELIABLE HALF-LIFE OF PU-239 HAS BEEN
                 ESTABLISHED.
