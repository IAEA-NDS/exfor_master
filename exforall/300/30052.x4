INC-SOURCE (D-D)      D(D,N)HE3 REACTION. BUILT-IN DEUTERIUM TAR-
           GET OBTAINED BY BOMBARDING A WATER COOLED GOLD TARGET
SAMPLE     SINGLE CRYSTAL IN THE FORM OF KI(TL)
           NUMBER OF K39 ATOMS/SQCM=1.175X10E22
METHOD     (COINC)    COINCIDENCE BETWEEN SCINTILLATIONS FROM
           NEUTRON-BOMBARDED KI(TL) CRYSTAL WITH PULSES FROM A HE3
           DETECTOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     KI(TL) CRYSTAL 17 CM IN DIAMETER AND 0.12 CM

ANALYSIS   CROSS SECTIONS DERIVED FROM THE SPECTRUM OF PULSES FROM
           THE SCINTILLATION DETECTOR.
COMMENT    THE ENERGY RESOLUTION GIVEN IN COMMON MEANS TOTAL
           SPREAD IN ENERGY OF NEUTRONS IN THE TAGGED NEUTRON BEAM
            THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD(FWHM) WAS ESTIMATED=+-25 KEV

CORRECTION CORRECTION MADE TO ALLOW FOR ATTENUATION AND INELASTIC
           SCATTERING OF THE TAGGED NEUTRON BEAM =+2.7 PERCENT.
           CORRECTION OF -1.5 PERCENT MADE TO ALLOW FOR INCREASE
           IN NEUTRON PATH LENGTH RESULTING FROM ELASTIC SCATTER.
           WITHIN THE CRYSTAL AND ANGULAR DIVERGENCE OF THE TAGGED
           NEUTRON BEAM. OTHER CORRECTIONS CONSIDERED NEGLIGIBLE.
ERR-ANALYS QUOTED ERROR INCLUDES A COUNTING ERROR OF +-1 STANDARD
           DEVIATION TOGETHER WITH ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE ERROR IN
           ASSESSING AREA UNDER PEAK
