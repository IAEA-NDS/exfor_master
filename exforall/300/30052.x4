TITLE      The absolute cross sections of the 39K(n,p)39Ar and
           39K(n,a)36Cl reactions for 2.46 MeV neutrons.
FACILITY   (VDG)      Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-D)      D(d,n)He3 reaction. Built-in deuterium tar-
           get obtained by bombarding a water cooled gold target
SAMPLE     Single crystal in the form of KI(Tl)
           number of 39K atoms/sqcm=1.175x10**22
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence between scintillations from
           neutron-bombarded ki(Tl) crystal with pulses from a He3
           detector
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     KI(Tl) crystal 17 cm in diameter and 0.12 cm
           deep which acted also as sample
           (SIBAR) silicon surface barrier detector of resistivity
           5300 ohms x cm and alpha energy resolution of 20 keV
ANALYSIS   Cross sections derived from the spectrum of pulses from
           the scintillation detector.
COMMENT    The energy resolution given in common means total
           spread in energy of neutrons in the tagged neutron beam
            the neutron energy spread(FWHM) was estimated=+-25 keV

HISTORY    (19680518R)  Data received from B.P.Johnson
           (19681218C)  Data compiled into Dastar
           (19701215T)  Previously Dastar-00620
           (20080305A) BIB section updated
CORRECTION Correction made to allow for attenuation and inelastic
           scattering of the tagged neutron beam =+2.7%,
           correction of -1.5% made to allow for increase
           in neutron path length resulting from elastic scatter.
           within the crystal and angular divergence of the tagged
           neutron beam. Other corrections considered negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted error includes a counting error of
           +-1 standard deviation together with estimate of
           possible error in assessing area under peak

PART-DET   (A)        Alpha particles.  Alpha energy= 3.4+-0.1 MeV
COMMENT    Area under alpha peak estimated by fitting experimental
           data with a curve based on the known spectrum shape of
           the scintillation detector for alpha particles having
           energy of 3.4 MeV in order to correct for tail of
           proton peak
