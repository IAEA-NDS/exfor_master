TITLE      Prompt Nubar measurements for thermal neutron fission
EXP-YEAR   (1972)
FACILITY   10 KW UTR-10 reactor
METHOD     Gadolinium bath in coincidence with pulses from fission
           counter. Coincidence resolving time 21 nsec. Gated
           neutron recording time 40 microsec. After 100 microsec
           waiting period background recorded for 40 microsec.
           At end of entire counting cycle contents of temporary
           store transferred to multiple event counter provided
           second detectable fission event had not occurred. If so
           contents temporary store were erased.
DETECTOR   (STANK)    Liquid scintillator tank 76 cm in diameter
           with 240 litres of Ne323 loaded with 0.5% by weight
           gadolinium. Scintillations viewed by 12 photo-
           multipliers connected in 3 coincident banks of four to
           minimize spurious counts. Axial tube 3 inch in diameter
           through tank allowed passage of neutron beam and held
           fission counter. Efficiency measured with Cf252 source.
           analysed influence on efficiency of Pm-gain, fission
           counter position, neutron energy, fission counter bias
           level and dead time.
           Fast parallel plate ionization chamber to
           record fissions
ANALYSIS   Probabilities of emission of nu neutrons per fission
           event were calculated with formula of given et al
           PR 101 1012 1956, for nu values in the range 0 to 10.
           for each distribution first and second moments about
           the origin, second moment about mean and shape
           dependent parameter were calculated.
MONITOR    Absolute
PART-DET   (PN)       prompt neutrons
COMMENT    The data given here represent a consistent set of
           correlated absolute nu-bar values for the 5 nuclides
           considered, as resulting from the experiments and
           analysis of corrections at lucas heights. Other
           publications by same authors give different values
           which are related to different values of Nu(Cf-252).

CORRECTION The following corrections were taken in consideration,
           counter drifts, fission by fast neutrons, impurities,
           counter location, false gates, preferential detection
           anisotropy, fission spectra differences,dead time,
           double fission inhibit, delayed gamma rays, electronic
           errors and varying background. Actual values to be

COMMENT    Assumed value of nu is the weighted mean of two liquid
           scintillator measurements as explained in subent 1
           determined neutron emission probabilities and relevant
           parameters as follows,
           second moment of nu about origin =15.925+-0.007
           second moment about nubar=1.268+-0.002
           shape dependent parameter =0.8479+-0.0005
               neutrons emitted    probabilities
                      0            0.00197+-0.00008

                      5            0.1884 +-0.0007
                      6            0.0677 +-0.0006
                      7            0.0160 +-0.0003
                      8            0.0021 +-0.0002
           error in neutron probabilities is statistical error
           author gives for total nu(Cf-252) the value of 3.744
