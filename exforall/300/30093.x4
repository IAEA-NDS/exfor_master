TITLE      Angular anisotropy of fission fragments in ternary
           fission of U-235 induced by 3 MeV neutrons
EXP-YEAR   (1967)
FACILITY   (VDG)      5.5 MeV Van de Graaff for 3 MeV neutrons
           (REAC) Reactor for some thermal neutron measurement
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      H3(p,n)He3 reaction. Neutron energy spread
           about 200 keV,calculated from tritium target thickness
SAMPLE     Metallic U-235 of about 1.5 cm2 area and 1 milli-g/cm2
           thickness was coated on a 10 millig/cm2 Al backing
METHOD     Two independent methods. In the first method a gridded
           ionisation chamber was used to measure the direction of
           emission of fission fragments and a CsI(Tl) crystal for
           detecting long range alphas. In the second one semicon-
           ductor detectors were used for detecting both fission
           fragments and long-range alphas,using coincidence and
           anticoincidence set-up
DETECTOR   (CSICR)    CsI(Tl) crystal for detecting LRA
           gridded ionization chamber for fragments
           (SOLST)    semi-conductor detectors for LRA and fragms.
ANALYSIS   Angular anisotropies expressed by ratio of two measured
           intensities n(ang). Ratio at 3 MeV obtained on the
           basis of isotropy for the case of thermal neutron
           binary fission
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,DE,FF) calibration of collector pulse
           heights into fragment energies done using known
           energies of the light and heavy fragments peaks.

             converted to reaction formalism. The following
             subentries were deleted for reasons given below
             subent 8 = contained a quantity and value in the data
               table which was not measured but taken from liter-
               ature. The original contents of subent 8 were re-
               placed by data originally included in subent 6.
             subent 9 = contained no data table, but in a comment
               some qualitative description of the energy spectrum
               of alpha particles in 3 MeV neutron fission, taken
               from a progress report (AEET-228,page 4).
               Furthermore,in the final publication no information
               on any measurement of alpha-spectra is given.
             subent 10 = contained a deduced value related to the
               data in subent 11. It is now included in a comment
               of subent 11 (refer to it for details).
