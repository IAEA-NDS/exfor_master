TITLE      ANGULAR ANISOTROPY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS IN TERNARY
           FISSION OF U-235 INDUCED BY 3 MEV NEUTRONS
EXP-YEAR   (67)
FACILITY   (VDG)      5.5 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF FOR 3 MEV NEUTRONS
           REACTOR FOR SOME THERMAL NEUTRON MEASUREMENT
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      H3(P,N)HE3 REACTION. NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD
           ABOUT 200 KEV,CALCULATED FROM TRITIUM TARGET THICKNESS
SAMPLE     METALLIC U-235 OF ABOUT 1.5 CM2 AREA AND 1 MILLI-G/CM2
           THICKNESS WAS COATED ON A 10 MILLIG/CM2 AL BACKING
METHOD     TWO INDEPENDENT METHODS. IN THE FIRST METHOD A GRIDDED
           IONISATION CHAMBER WAS USED TO MEASURE THE DIRECTION OF
           EMISSION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS AND A CSI(TL) CRYSTAL FOR
           DETECTING LONG RANGE ALPHAS. IN THE SECOND ONE SEMICON-
           DUCTOR DETECTORS WERE USED FOR DETECTING BOTH FISSION
           FRAGMENTS AND LONG-RANGE ALPHAS,USING COINCIDENCE AND
           ANTICOINCIDENCE SET-UP
