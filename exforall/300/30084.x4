TITLE      FISSION CROSS-SECTION OF PU-239 AT 13.1 TO 15.4 MEV
FACILITY   (VDG) NEUTRONS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE T(D,N)HE-4 REAC-
            TION BY BOMBARDING WITH DEUTERONS ACCELERATED TO AN
            ENERGY OF 440 KEV IN VAN-DE-GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T),A THIN TITANIUM TARGET (0.280 MG/CM2) IN WHICH
            TRITIUM GAS WAS ABSORBED.
SAMPLE     SAMPLES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF LAYERS ON DISKS OF A
            DIAMETER OF 6MM WITH THE THICKNESS OF PLUTONIUM =
             0.26 MG/CM-2.
METHOD     COUNTER RATIO OF U-238 AND PU-239 SAMPLES WAS
            USED.PLUTONIUM SAMPLES WERE PLACED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT
            VARIOUS ANGLES OF NEUTRON EMISSION. PLUTONIUM SAMPLES
            ALONG WITH THE URANIUM SAMPLES WERE PLACED IN SHIELDS
            MADE FROM CADMIUM FOIL OF A THICKNESS OF 0.5 MM.
DETECTOR   (TRD) PIECES OF MICA WERE USED TO DETECT FISSION
            FRAGMENTS.
ANALYSIS    THE RATIO OF THE QUANTITIES OF PU-239 TO THOSE OF
            U-238 IN THE TARGETS WAS OBTAINED BY MEASURING THE
            ALPHA-ACTIVITY BY SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR.THE OVERALL
            ERROR IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE QUANTITY OF PU-239 WAS
            2 PER CENT, U-238 3 PER CENT.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            PLUTONIUM SIGMA FISSION  WAS  MEASURED
            RELATIVELY TO THAT OF U-238 AND NORMALIZED TO SIGMA
            FISSION OF U-238 FROM K.PARKER,AWRE-0-79/63.
