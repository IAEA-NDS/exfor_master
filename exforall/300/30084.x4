TITLE      Fission cross-section of Pu-239 at 13.1 To 15.4 MeV
FACILITY   (VDG) neutrons were obtained from the T(d,n)He-4 reac-
            tion by bombarding with deuterons accelerated to an
            energy of 440 keV in Van-de-Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T),a thin titanium target (0.280 mg/cm2) in which
            tritium gas was absorbed.
SAMPLE     Samples were made in the form of layers on disks of a
            diameter of 6mm with the thickness of plutonium =
             0.26 mg/cm2.
METHOD     Counter ratio of U-238 and Pu-239 samples was
            used.Plutonium samples were placed simultaneously at
            various angles of neutron emission. Plutonium samples
            along with the uranium samples were placed in shields
            made from cadmium foil of a thickness of 0.5 mm.
DETECTOR   (TRD) pieces of mica were used to detect fission
            fragments.
ANALYSIS    The ratio of the quantities of Pu-239 to those of
            U-238 in the targets was obtained by measuring the
            alpha-activity by semiconductor detector.The overall
            error in the measurement of the quantity of Pu-239 was
            2 per cent, U-238 3 per cent.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            Plutonium sigma fission  was  measured
            relatively to that of U-238 and normalized to sigma
            fission of U-238 from K.Parker,AWRE-0-79/1963.
