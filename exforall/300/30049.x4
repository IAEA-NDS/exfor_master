TITLE      TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS OF CARBON AND LEAD BETWEEN
           5.3 AND 6.3 MEV
FACILITY   (VDG)      3 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF PULSED BY MEANS OF A SET
           OF DEFLECTING PLATES ACTING UPON THE BEAM
INC-SOURCE (D-D)      D(D,N)HE3 REACTION. GASEOUS.2.22CM IN LENGTH
           WITH A NI WINDOW 1CM IN DIAMETER AND 0.0001 INCH THICK.

CORRECTION MEASURED TRANSMISSION CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND.
           AN INSCATTERING CORRECTION WAS APPLIED TO SIGMA.
           CORRECTION LESS THAN 7.5 PC FOR C  AND LESS THAN 5.8 PC
           FOR PB.
ERR-ANALYS TOTAL ERROR ABOUT 11 PERCENT,COMPOUNDED OF STATISTICAL
           ERROR (3.7 PC FOR C AND 5.1 PC FOR PB) AND INSCATTERING

ANALYSIS   MEASURED SIGMA VALUES AT 5.36 MEV RESONANCE PEAK WERE
           FITTED BY THEORETICAL CURVE CALCULATED BY BREIT-WIGNER
           SINGLE LEVEL DISPERSION FORMULA USING THE PEAK VALUE OF
           2 BARNS GIVEN BY FOSSAN ET AL.(PR 123 209,1961).THE
           SPIN VALUES OF J=3/2 AND L=2 WERE DEDUCED FOR THIS
           RESONANCE LEVEL.NUCLEAR RADIUS OF 3.2 FM AND CORRESPON-
           DING R0 VALUE OF 1.40 FM WERE ALSO DEDUCED.
