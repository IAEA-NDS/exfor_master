CORRECTION measured transmission corrected for background.
           an inscattering correction was applied to sigma.
           correction less than 7.5% for C  and less than 5.8%
           for Pb.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) total error about 11 percent,compounded of
           statistical error (3.7% for C and 5.1% for Pb) and in
           scattering correction

ANALYSIS   measured sigma values at 5.36 MeV resonance peak were
           fitted by theoretical curve calculated by Breit-Wigner
           single level dispersion formula using the peak value of
           2 barns given by Fossan et al.(PR 123 209,1961).The
           spin values of j=3/2 and l=2 were deduced for this
           resonance level.nuclear radius of 3.2 fm and correspon-
           ding r0 value of 1.40 fm were also deduced.
