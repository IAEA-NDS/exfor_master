FACILITY   (CYCLO,3RUMBUC) Cyclotron providing protons with
           energies of 4.5, 7.5 And 9.8 MeV, beam current
           10-15 micro Amp
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 Reaction, Li foils from 100 - 500
           micrometer thick were held between Ta plates, neutron
           energy varied through incoming proton beam energy
           variation using Ta absorbers
INC-SPECT  Energy spread due to target thickness and solid angle
           was about 450 keV for energy 0.3 MeV and 1.3 MeV for
           energies 3-6.5 MeV
DETECTOR   12 fission fragment mica detectors were placed on
           rotating disc in front of sample. Neutron flux was
           monitored through gamma activity of Li target, gamma
           activity of Cu foil placed near sample and Mg monitor
           for energies over 5 MeV
PART-DET   (FF) fission fragments
MONITOR    absolute measurement
METHOD     (FISCT) fission fragment counting
CORRECTION Numerical data given are higher than published values
           due to improved estimate of geometrical factors
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on data errors
