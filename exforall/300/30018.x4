             DATA GIVEN IS 1/V PORTION OF
            (N,GAMMA) CROSS-SECTION ASSUMING A RESONANCE PORTION
            OF (1.70 BARN)/(WAVE-LENGTH IN ANGSTROM)
FACILITY   (REAC,CHOPS) CHOPPER WITH CURVED SLITS
INC-SOURCE (REAC) REACTOR, CD COLLIMATOR GAVE 2.5 BY 2.5CM BEAM
SAMPLE     TWO AU FOILS OF 99.99 PERCENT PURITY WERE
           PLACED ON EACH OTHER TO FORM PLATE OF 3X3 CM AND
           AVERAGE THICKNESS OF 0.757 GRAMS/SQCM
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT, ROTATING SPEED OF CHOPPER WAS
                 3115 +- 15 REVS PER MINUTE
           FLIGHT PATH WAS 3 METERS, COUNTER PERPENDIUCLAR TO THE
           BEAM
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 COUNTER OF 35 MM DIAMETER
PART-DET   (N) NEUTRON
STATUS     DATA FROM H.TEUTSCH 1970
CORRECTION AFTER CORRECTIONS TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA THE TOTAL
           CROSS-SECTION WAS FOUND, TO OBTAIN THE 1/V ABSORPTION
           CROSS-SECTION FROM THIS THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE
           APPLIED

ANALYSIS   A FIT TO THE MEASURED DATA IN ENERGY RANGE 1.1-2.5
            MILLI-EV WAS MADE USING THE LEAST SQUARE METHOD WITH
            WEIGHTED POINTS. THE FUNCTION CHOSEN WAS OF THE FORM
            SIGMA=A+B*LAMBDA, WHERE LAMBDA=WAVE-LENGTH OF NEUTRONS
            IN ANGSTROMS. B WAS FOUND TO BE 54.47+-0.10 BARN/
            ANGSTROM. FROM THIS THE SIGMA VALUE AT 2200 M/SEC WAS
            CALCULATED.
