           Data were eliminated from set because they are  given
           in 1/V portion of  (n,gamma) cross-section assuming a
           resonance portion of (1.70 Barn)/(wave-length in
           angstrom).

             data given is 1/V portion of
            (n,gamma) cross-section assuming a resonance portion
            of (1.70 Barn)/(wave-length in angstrom)
FACILITY   (REAC,CHOPS) chopper with curved slits
INC-SOURCE (REAC) reactor, Cd collimator gave 2.5 x 2.5 cm beam
SAMPLE     Two Au foils of 99.99% purity were placed on
           each other to form plate of 3x3 cm and  average
           thickness of 0.757 grams/cm2
METHOD     (TOF) time of flight, rotating speed of chopper was
                 3115 +- 15 revs per minute
           flight path was 3 meters, counter perpendiuclar to the
           beam
DETECTOR   (BF3) bf3 counter of 35 mm diameter
PART-DET   (N) neutron
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from H.Teutsch 1970
CORRECTION After corrections to the experimental data the total
           cross-section was found, to obtain the 1/V absorption
           cross-section from this the following corrections were
           applied
           Spin dependent incoherent scattering taken=.5+-.26 Barn
           thermal inelastic scattering=(.03+-.02)Lambda barn
           contribution of resonance at 4.906eV (1.70)/Lambda barn

             Data given is 1/V portion of
            (n,gamma) cross-section assuming a resonance portion

ANALYSIS   A fit to the measured data in energy range 1.1-2.5
            milli-eV was made using the least square method with
            weighted points. The function chosen was of the form
            sigma=a+B*lambda, where lambda=wave-length of neutrons
            in angstroms. B was found to be 54.47+-0.10 Barn/
            angstrom. From this the sigma value at 2200 m/sec was
            calculated.
MONITOR    Absolute. Energy range 1.1-2.5 milli-eV.
PART-DET   (N) neutrons
STATUS     Extrapolation from data in energy range 1.1-2.5
