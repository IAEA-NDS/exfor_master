TITLE      ISOMERIC CROSS SECTION RATIOS AND TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS
                       FOR THE IN-115(N,2N) REACTION
FACILITY   (VDG) 3MEV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(D,N)ALPHA REACTION
INC-SPECT  THE ENERGY SPREADS WERE DETERMINED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
            .THE EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENT NEUTRONS
            .THE IRRADIATION GEOMETRY
            .THE NEUTRON ENERGY DEPENDENCE ON THE EMISSION ANGLE
            .THE DEUTERON ENERGY LOSS IN THE TRITIUM TARGET
SAMPLE     SPECTRALLY PURE INDIUM
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE CROSS SECTION POPULATING THE GROUND STATE
           WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING ITS 72 SEC BETA- ACTIVITY
           REFERING TO THE 51 DAYS BETA- ACTIVITY RESULTING FROM
           THE DECAY OF THE METASTABLE STATE.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) SCINTILLATION SPECTROMETER WITH A 3X3 INCH
           NAI CRYSTAL. THE PHOTO-PEAK EFFICIENCIES WERE TAKEN
           FROM C.E CROUTHAMEL(APPLIED GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY,
           PERGAMON PRESS(1960))
           (GEMUC) THE BETA- WERE MEASURED USING A GM COUNTER
MONITOR    (82-PB-204(N,2N)82-PB-203,,SIG)
            STANDARD USED FOR THE RELATIVE MEASURMT
           OF THE CROSS SECTION POPULATING THE METASTABLE STATE
PART-DET   (G) GAMMAS
           (B-)BETA-
           (B+)BETA+
STATUS            DATA TAKEN FROM TABLE 1,PAGE 13 (INR-1197)
HISTORY    (720117C) CA.
CORRECTION THE MONITORING OF THE NEUTRON FLUX IS MADE BY COUNTING
           IN A CSI SCINTILLATOR THE PROTONS RECOILED FROM A
           POLYETHYLENE FOIL
           THE ATTENUATION OF GAMMAS IN THE SAMPLE WAS TAKEN INTO
           ACCOUNT
ERR-ANALYS THE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY
