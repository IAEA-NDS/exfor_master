TITLE      Neutron-proton radiative capture at 14.4 MeV
FACILITY   (CCW,3CRORBZ) 200 keV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n)He-4
SAMPLE     (CH2,Au) The target was a 4.3 mg/cm2 polyethylene foil
           of 24 mm diam. mounted on a gold backing inside a
           counter telescope. The background was measured with a
           blank gold foil of the same size.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE) Energy-spectrum of deuterons measured, from
           this the   center-of-mass angular distribution was
           deduced, from this a least-squares-fit yielded the
            (n,gamma) cross-section.
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,SCIN) Telescope counter
PART-DET   (D) Deuterons
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) The n-p scattering cross
           section at 0 degree was  taken from R.Nakamura, J.
           Phys. Soc. Japan 15 (1960) 1359.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA,,AV) The average elastic n-p
           cross section for the detection angle from 0 to 13
           degree was determined by multiplying the value at 0
           degree by a factor of 0.973 to take into account the
           energy dependence of the n-p cross section and by the
           average value of cos(theta) = 0.994 in lab system.)
STATUS     (TABLE) data from Nucl.Phys.A 92. (N,gamma)-value con-
           firmed by Tudoric letter 19670717.

COMMENT    The value of 31.6 +- 1.8 Microbarns reported in
           EANDC-50 vol.2 Paper 136 is superseded.
           The value of 36.4 +- 2.9 Microbarns quoted in
           Phys.Rev.Letters 14, 444  is superseded.
           The measured H-1(n,gamma) value corresponds to a
           deuteron photodisintegration cross-section of
           1550. +- 91. Microbarns at e-gamma = 9.43 MeV.
