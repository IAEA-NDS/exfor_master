SAMPLE     The target was of (thick. 4.3 mg/cm2) polyethylene
           foil of (diam. 24 mm) mounted on a gold backing
           inside a counter telescope.
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,SCIN) Telescope counter
METHOD     (EDE) Energy-spectrum of deuterons measured, the
           center-of-mass angular distribution was deduced, a
           least-squares-fit yielded (n,gamma) cross-section.

           For n-p scattering cross section at 0 degree.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA,,AV)
           The average elastic n-p cross section for the detection
           angle from 0 to 13 degree was determined by multiplying
           the value at 0 degree by a factor of 0.973 to take into
           account the energy dependence of the n-p cross section
           and by the average value of cos(theta) = 0.994 in lab
           system.)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error is mainly due to counter
           statistics.
STATUS     (TABLE) data from Nucl. Phys. A 92 (1967) 233
            (N,gamma)-value confirmed by Tudoric letter 19670717.

COMMENT    The value of 31.6 +- 1.8 Microbarns reported in
           EANDC-50 vol.2 Paper 136 is superseded.
           The value of 36.4 +- 2.9 Microbarns quoted in
           Phys.Rev.Letters 14, 444  is superseded.
           The measured H-1(n,gamma) value corresponds to a
           deuteron photodisintegration cross-section of
           1550. +- 91. Microbarns at e-gamma = 9.43 MeV.
HISTORY    (20080215S) Dataset was restored.
