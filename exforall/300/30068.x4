TITLE      Investigations on the angular distribution of neutron-
           induced 238-U fission using solid state track detectors
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuterium tritium reaction
SAMPLE     Uranium layers of 1 mg/cm2 thick and 5mm diam deposited
           on 0.1 mm thick Al foil through electrolysis
METHOD     Fission fragment detection
           sample placed at 45 degrees with n-beam, 15 cm from
           target. Angular dist from 0-90 and 90-180 degrees was
           measured on independent samples(both sides of Al foil)
           detectors were placed on circle of 10cm diam around the
           sample in a vacuum chamber
DETECTOR   (GLASD) solid-state track detector (Zeiss glass
           microscope cover slides).
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            Data normalized to sigma(n,f) = 1.22 barn
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments
COMMENT    In all 7500 tracks were measured in forward and back-
           ward directions. A curve of form
               sigma(theta) = A + B*(cos(theta))**2
           was fitted to the data giving A= 84.9 and B= 36.3 mb/sr
           anisotropy W(0)/W(90) was 1.43 +- 0.05 in agreement
           with previous results
