AUTHOR     (J.CSIKAI,S.NAGY)
TITLE      INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRON-
           INDUCED 238-U FISSION USING SOLID STATE TRACK DETECTORS
REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),,DA,FF)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) DEUTERIUM TRITIUM REACTION
SAMPLE     URANIUM LAYERS OF 1MG/SQCM THICK AND 5MM DIAM DEPOSITED
           ON 0.1 MM THICK AL FOIL THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS
METHOD     FISSION FRAGMENT DETECTION
           SAMPLE PLACED AT 45 DEGREES WITH N-BEAM, 15 CM FROM
           TARGET. ANGULAR DIST FROM 0-90 AND 90-180 DEGREES WAS
           MEASURED ON INDEPENDENT SAMPLES(BOTH SIDES OF AL FOIL)
           DETECTORS WERE PLACED ON CIRCLE OF 10CM DIAM AROUND THE
           SAMPLE IN A VACUUM CHAMBER
DETECTOR   (GLASD) SOLID-STATE TRACK DETECTOR (ZEISS GLASS
           MICROSCOPE COVER SLIDES).
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            DATA NORMALIZED TO SIGMA(N,F) = 1.22 BARN
PART-DET   (FF) FISSION FRAGMENTS
COMMENT    IN ALL 7500 TRACKS WERE MEASURED IN FORWARD AND BACK-
           WARD DIRECTIONS. A CURVE OF FORM
               SIGMA(THETA) = A + B*(COS(THETA))**2
           WAS FITTED TO THE DATA GIVING A= 84.9 AND B= 36.3 MB/SR
           ANISOTROPY W(0)/W(90) WAS 1.43 +- 0.05 IN AGREEMENT
           WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS
