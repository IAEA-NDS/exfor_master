TITLE       Examination of the dependence of the effective cross
            section from the neutron temperature, measurements
            of the neutron temperature and determination of some
            cross sections for neutron capture and neutron
            fission
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Pneumatic positions,reflector and rotating
            disk facility of FRM-reactor in Munich.
INC-SPECT  . Reactor fast neutron spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li)-detectors coupled to a ND4420 analyzer.
           (SCIN)  The alpha activity of alpha emitters was
            measured with a home-made liquid scintillation
            counter.
MONITOR    3 reactions used for incident fission neutron spectrum:
           (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG,,FIS)
            Average fission spectrum cross
            section = 113+-7 mb.
           (12-MG-24(N,P)11-NA-24,,SIG,,FIS)
            Average fission spectrum cross
            section = 1.53+-0.09 mb.
           (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG,,FIS)
            Average fission spectrum cross
            section = 0.725+-0.045 mb.
ANALYSIS   .For the threshold reactions the aver. fis. spectrum
            cross section (acs) was determined from the relation
            acs = R/F where R is the absolute reaction rate and
            F the equivalent fission flux.
            R was measured with a calibrated Ge(Li)-detector.
            F was determined using the standard threshold
            reactions 58-Ni(n,p) , 24-Mg(n,p) and 27-Al(n,alpha).
CORRECTION  Because of the thin samples no correction for self
            shielding and self absorption is needed.
            For the distinction of the fission spectrum of the
            irradiation positions from the theoretical fission
            spectrum (Watt-spectrum).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Standard deviation
           (DATA-ERR) Absolute total error
            include :
            * Uncertainties in the half lives and the intensities
            of the measured  gamma rays.
            * Uncertainties in the g-factors.
            * Difference of the true fission spectrum from the
            theoretical one.
