METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (TOF)   For neutron spectrum determination
SAMPLE       Natural, metallic lanthanum disks of 15 mm diameter,
             1 mm thickness .
             Sandwiched between two 0.06 mm thick gold foils of
             the same diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) System of two Clover type HPGe detectors placed
           face-to-face in close geometry- to measure induced
           activities.

             1. Movable Li-6 glass detector for neutron
              angular distribution from 0 to 80 in steps 10 deg;
              located at 222mm distance from the O-18 target;
              covered 9.8 deg angle.
             2. A stationary neutron monitor was positioned 300mm
             from the O-18 target at an angle of 40 deg, served
             for normalizing the individual spectra taken with
             the movable detector.
             3. Throughout the irradiations the neutron flux was
             monitored in steps of 60 s by means of a 6Li glass
             detector at 1 m distance from the target.
CORRECTION  For the neutron efficiency of the 6Li glass detector
            assuming a 1/v behavior of the efficiency in the
            considered energy range below 40 keV.
            For solid angle.
            Corrections due to variations in the neutron flux
            and for the decay of activated nuclei during the
            irradiations.
