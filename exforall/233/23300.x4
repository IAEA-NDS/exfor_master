FACILITY   (NGEN,2TUKSTU) SAMES T-400 neutron generator with
           Fast Sample Transfer System(FSTS), delivering a
           sample from irradiation position to HPGe detector
           within 0.5 sec.
           Beam current is kept at about 300 microA with
           accelerator voltage of 250 kV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron beam current 350 microA.
           The irradiation positions at the angles to the deuteron
           beam were 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, corresponding to the
           neutron energies 14.83, 14.75, 14.52, 14.15, 13.75 MeV.
INC-SPECT   The effective energy of incident neutron at each
           irradiation position were determined by the ratio of
           90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+,1982)
           and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway,1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis and
           Zieba, 1980) and are given in detail in Subasi+,1996.
           Neutron fluxes are measured in each irradiation place
            (70mm from the neutron source )from 7.0+7 to 1.0E+
           n/cm2*s, depending on the neutron target condition.

SAMPLE      Sample pellets(13mm diameter,8.5mm thickness, about 2g
           weight) were pressed from the high-purity (99.9%) Sm2O3
           and Al2O3 powders. Water contents were removed by
           heating up to 105 deg C, then 0.5h cooled down to the
           room temperature, were filled in dry stainless steel
           capsules, pressed to form a dense pellet, were tightly
           packed into thin polyethylene(PE) boxes and sealed-of.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cyclic irradiation. 10 cycles.
           Al standard sample irradiation - 30 min.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) During irradiation of Al, the neutron flux was
           monitored with plastic scintillation detector NE102A,
           placed under the neutron-producing target. The monitor
           was calibrated with the standard reaction irradiating
           Al2O3 sample placed in the same irradiation position.
           During irradiation of Sm, the neutrons were monitored
           by NE102E detector (MCS mode).
           (HPGE) HPGe Detector (Canberra, 82 cm3, 1.79 keV(FWHM)
           resolution at 1.333 MeV) at 160 mm from detector - to
            measure gamma activities induced in Al and Sm samples.
           An acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front
           of the detector in order to eliminate the beta-gamma
           summing effect.
           The total efficiency was determined using the
           single-line nuclides of 241Am (60 keV), 109Cd (88 keV),
           57Co (122+136 keV), 137Cs (662 keV), 54Mn (835 keV),
           60Co (1173+1332 keV) with 3% error.
PART-DET   (DG)  Decay gamma-rays.
CORRECTION For dead time and the self-absorption of the gamma ray
           in the pellet(4%).
           Neutron flux was corrected for the neutron flux
           variations.
           The effects of coincidence summing and random
           coincidences were neglected because the measurements
           were carried out at a long distance 160 mm from the
           detector.
           For the self-absorption of gamma rays in the sample
           and monitor as well as the beta absorber;  gamma-ray
           attenuations determined experimentally were found to be
           up to 1% and 2% for all the pellets and the beta
           absorber, respectively.
           For low energy neutron contribution to the investigated
           reactions - up to 10% of the total neutron spectrum.
           The effect of low energy neutron in sample pellets
           packed in thin polyethylene boxes was performed by the
           MCNP5 Monte Carlo code (X-5MonteCarloTeam,2003) and
           found less than 1% that can be neglected.

ANALYSIS   Full energy peak (FEP) area, mass of sample,
           the concentration of the element, Avogadro number,the
           atomic weight of the element, isotopic abundance, the
           relative gamma-ray intensity, effective flux measured
           by calibrated Al foil monitor, counting solid angle
           with self-absorption correction, FEP efficiency of the
           gamma-ray detector, decay constant, the number of
           cycles were used to cross-section calculation by the
           cyclic activation formula using the one-cycle time as
           sum of irradiation, delay, counting, return times.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty.
             Sources of uncertainty:
           (ERR-1) Sample weight.
           (ERR-2) Concentration of the element.
           (ERR-3) Isotopic abundance.
           (ERR-4) Counting solid angle and
                intrinsic efficiency of the gamma detector.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty ( full energy
            photo-peak area).
           (ERR-5) Neutron flux fluctuation.
           (ERR-6) Effective neutron flux
              (reference cross-section).
           (ERR-7,0.,4.0) Coincidence summing
           (ERR-8) irradiation, cooling and measuring times.
            Uncertainties were assumed to be uncorrelated.
           The total uncertainty could be determined by adding the
           experimental errors and the uncertainties of nuclear
           data in the quadratic form.
