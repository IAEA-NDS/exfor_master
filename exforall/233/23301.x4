INC-SOURCE (D-T) Ti-3H target of 2.293mg cm-2. The 3H/Ti ratio was
           calculated to be 1.4 at the start of the irradiation.

            U-238 mass 0.861+-0.016 mg .
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiation of several (6 in this study)
           metal disks in different wide-energy neutron beams.
           One further disk was irradiated at a well-defined
           incident neutron energy and measured - for normalizing.
           Each disk was irradiated at one neutron energy and in
           an interval from 0deg to 80deg relative to the
           direction of the beam at 41 different positions, in
           steps of 2deg.

DETECTOR   (BF3,IOCH,IOCH)
            During irradiation, the neutron fluence rate was
           monitored by a BF3 long counter and an ionization
           chambers loaded with a 235U and 238U targets.
           The 238U chamber was placed at the same position as
           the Re disk and measurement was done before each disk
           irradiation.
           The 235U chamber was calibrated against the 238U
           chamber and used as neutron fluence monitor during
           the Re disk activation; was placed 111 cm away from
           the neutron-producing target and at 50DEG relative to
           the ion beam.
           (HPGE) Low-background HPGe-detectors were used for
           high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy:
           - coaxial HPGe-detector with a 40% relative efficiency
           at first measurement of each sample started after
           around 20 min cooling time;
           - planar point contact HPGe-detector (so-called BEGe)
           with 50% relative efficiency at subsequent measurements
           after 2 days in the ultra-low background underground
           laboratory HADES;
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The neutron cross-sections were calculated
           using an unfolding procedure, where the known spectra
           of the neutron beams and the activity of the
           radionuclides are input parameters.

ANALYSIS   The average cross-section was calculated for each

           Ak - measured activity for k-th disc,

           Average neutron energies for k-th disc was defined as:

           A linear interpolation of the energy dependence of the
           obtained cross-section values on energy <E>k was used.
           The obtained interpolated functions are normalized to

MISC-COL   (MISC) Average neutron fluence rate, 1/(cm2*sec)
ANALYSIS   The average cross-section was calculated for each
           irradiation in different neutron fields as :
           <SIGk)=Ak/SUM(Fki), where
           Ak - measured activity for k-th disc,
           Fki - neutron fluence for energy bin Ei .
           Average neutron energies for k-th disc was defined as:
           <E>k = SUM(Fki * Ei)/SUM(Fki).
           A linear interpolation of the energy dependence of the
           obtained cross-section values on energy <E>k was used.
           The obtained interpolated functions are normalized to
           the cross-section values determined for the 18.1MeV
           neutron energy.

COMMENT    Of author. CS was not corrected for isomeric transition
           contribution (N.Jovancevic, 20017-02-03, via N.Otsuka).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Include uncertainties coming from
           - the calculation of the neutron fields,
           - the measurement of the induced gamma ray activity,
           - the measurements of the distance between the
           neutron-producing target and the irradiated disks,
           - the weighting of the disks,
           - the measurements of the beam current.
