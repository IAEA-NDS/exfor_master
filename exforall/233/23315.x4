FACILITY   (OLMS,2SF JYV) Penning trap coupled to the IGISOL mass
           separator .
METHOD     (MASSP) Fission fragments were produced by 25-MeV
           protons on a thin Th target inside the ion guide source
           of the IGISOL mass separator.
           Implantation rates varied between 6 ions/s for 85Ge and
           1430 ions/s for 88Br.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Neutrons were detected in the BELEN 4PI neutron
           counter, consisting of 20 3He proportional tubes with
           a gas volume of 2.5cm diameter*60cm at pressure 20 atm.
           Eight tubes were placed at a radius of 9.5 cm and the
           remaining twelve at a radius of 14.5 cm.
           The detection efficiency EPSn for this disposition,
           as calculated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations,
           is close to 50% for neutron energies up to 1 MeV.
           (SI) A 1-mm thick Si detector for beta counting was
           placed in front of the implantation point, behind the
           tape, and achieved a beta detection efficiency EPSbeta
           of about 25%.
           (HPGE) Large volume HPGe detector was placed behind the
           Si detector to monitor source activity.
            The ratio EPSbeta/EPSn was determined from calibration
           runs performed for isotopes with well known Pn values,
           88Br, 94Rb, 95Rb, 137I .
ANALYSIS   Pn values were determined from the ratio of neutrons
           emitted Nn to the number of decays, measured by the
           number of beta-particles emitted Nbeta :
           Pn= (EPSbeta/EPSn)/(Nn/Nbeta)
ADD-RES    (COMP) Two different theoretical calculations performed
           in the framework of the quasiparticle random phase
           approximation (QRPA) - Fig.4 of J,NDS,120,74,2014 :
           -  The beta-strength calculations of P.Moeller+ are
           built on macroscopic-microscopic mass models and
           include first-forbidden (FF) transitions, calculated
           within the phenomenological gross theory, in addition
           to the ordinary Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions;
           - The calculations of I.N.Borzov are based on energy
           density functionals to obtain ground state properties,
           and both GT and FF transitions are treated in a
           consistent microscopic way.
