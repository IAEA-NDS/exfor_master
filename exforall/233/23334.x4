            Neutron fluence measurement procedure.
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK NPL) 3.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator .
            JRC-Geel data acquisition system DAQ2000.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)   for neutrons of 1. - 3. MeV.
            Target - layer of 1000 microg/cm2 Ti(T) of 2.54-cm
           diameter evaporated on a 0.5 mm gold backing disk.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) The neutron fluence is measured using either
           the NPL standard Long Counter, or the DePangher
            precision long counter.
           (IOCH) An ionization chamber with back-to-back 238U and
           242Pu targets. The counting gas - P-10 (90% Ar + 10%
           CH4) continuously flowing at a rate of ~50 ml/min,
           pressure 1.020 bar.
SAMPLE      Pu-242 sample :
            Production method           Molecular plating
            Chemical composition        Pu(OH)4
            Diameter (mm)               29.95 +- 0.03
            Activity (MBq)              0.0915 +- 0.0003
            Mass (microg)               625 +- 5
            Areal density (microg/cm2)  88.7 +- 0.8
            Isotopic purity             99.96518(45)%
             The mass and areal density were deduced using the
            242Pu alpha half-life 3.73E+5 yr.
            The isotopic composition was measured by mass
            spectroscopy.
            239Pu, 241Pu, and 244Pu contribute < 0.06% to the
            activity.
            Distance neutron source - IOCH front wall was 44-50 mm
            with a 0.5 mm uncertainty.
            The activity of the Pu deposit was measured to be
            0.0915 +- 0.0003 MBq on April 7, 2011.
            The mass of the deposit 0.625 +- 0.005 mg was
            calculated from the activity measurement.
            The isotopic composition was determined by mass
            spectroscopy on May 12, 2011.
            There was insignificant loss of 242Pu, 0.0003%, due to
            alpha decay in the time from activity measurement to
            the experiment date.
METHOD     (FISCT)
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Pu-242 spontaneous fission half -life was
           measured to be (6.72+-0.09stat.)*10**10 yr;
           systematic uncertainties :
            the measured alpha activity with 0.3%,
            the 242Pu alpha half-life with 0.8%,
            the detection efficiency with 1%,
            the fitting procedure with 0.5%;
            from the experimentally determined branching ratio
            Asf / Aalpha = 5.55*10**6, which has a relative
            uncertainty of only 1%.

MONITOR     The current integrator system which measures the
           charged particle beam current on the neutron producing
           target, was used as monitoring device at neutron
           fluence measurement.
ANALYSIS    Fission cross section SIG was defined:
            SIG=R(En)/(N*F(En)), where
            N - the number of 242Pu nuclei in the sample,
            F(En) - the neutron fluence,
            R(En)=(Y(En)-Ysf)/EPS(En), where
            Y(En) - the observed number of counts,
            Ysf - counts due to spontaneous fission,
            EPS(Evn) - the detection efficiency.
           The derivation of the neutron fluence was performed
           with the use of a dedicated NPL computer program FLUCAL
CORRECTION   For multiple scattering.
             For neutron beam attenuation.
             For spontaneous fission.
