FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL) 7MV Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 2 MEV deuteron beam on T/Ti target. Ti layer
            areal density 2157 mug/cm2, T/Ti atomic ratio 1.0 .
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam.
            The incident neutron spectra were determined using
           the TARGET code [12].
            14.3 MeV ( 182 keV FWHM) at 98 deg.
            17.0 MeV (379 keV FWHM) at 45 deg.
SAMPLE       Diamond detector was served also as carbon sample.
             Isotopic composition:
            C-12 - 98.892+-0.003 %, C-13 - 1.108+-0.003 % .
DETECTOR    A CIVIDEC B1 Single-Crystal Diamond Detector (sCVD)
           of thickness of 500 mum, with electrodes of 4mm x 4mm
           area. Installed at 50mm distance from the target.
           Measurements were performed at two angles 98 deg and
           45 deg relative to the deuteron beam direction.
           Coupled to a CIVIDEC C2 Broadband Amplifier with 2 GHz
           analogue bandwidth, 40 dB gain, an equivalent input
           current noise of 0.4 muA.
ANALYSIS    Pulse shape analysis.

ANALYSIS    CS ratio was defined as
           SIG13/SIG12= (I13/I12)*(N12/N13), where
           I13 - C-13 net peak area,
           I12 - C-12 net peak area,
           N12 -  fraction of C-12 in the diamond,
           N13 -  fraction of C-13 in the diamond.

            8.6 MeV and 10.5 MeV for 14.3 MeV .
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty ( < 11.%) includes :
           (ERR-1) the uncertainty of the abundance of 13C in
           diamond (N13/N12) -  0.3% ;
           Uncertainty of the net peak area ratio
            (I13/I12) which includes:
           (ERR-S) the statistical uncertainty dominated by the
           13C(n,alpha0)10Be statistics, 5.9% at 14.3MeV with
            291 counts, 4.0% at 17.0MeV with 635 counts;
           (ERR-2) the uncertainty introduced by the analysis
           method, dominated by the pulse width selection,
           estimated as a ratio of the 0.1 ns sampling period of
           the data acquisition system to the smallest recorded
           pulse baseline width of 1.2 ns, - 8.3%;
             the energy resolution of the detector system which
            is 168 keV FWHM, that is 1.6% in the measurement at
            14.3MeV and 1.3% in the measurement at 17.0MeV.
