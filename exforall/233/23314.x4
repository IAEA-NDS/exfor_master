FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) The high-flux reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux of ~5*10**14 n/cm2/s
METHOD     Separation of the produced fission fragments
           according to their ratios mass A over ionic charge q
           and kinetic energy Ek over ionic charge.
           (COINC) Ion-gated gamma spectra recorded within a time
           gate of about 10xTisomer1/2 after an IC signal.
           Beamcut method - measurements when beam is on and off;
           the combination of two measurements permits to
           determine the feeding from both states.

SAMPLE      The fission target of 91 ug/cm2 235U is covered by a
            sputtered Ta layer of 195 ug/cm2 to reduce the
            self-sputtering of the actinide target.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) LOHENGRIN mass spectrometer
           (IOCH) An ionization chamber to detect the incoming
            ions before being implanted into an aluminum foil.
           (HPGE) Two clover detectors consisting of four
           high purity Ge crystals, placed at the focal position
           of the spectrometer.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Isomeric ratio determined by the Batemen
            equation. Corrected for the decay losses during the
           flight time through the 23 m long spectrometer.
ERR-ANALYS Total Monte Carlo propagation of uncertainties was
           applied. All independent parameters used in the
           analysis were sampled simultaneously. The correlation
           matrix reveals the weight of the systematic
           uncertainty compared to the standard deviation of
           each measurement.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty including the correlation
           terms.
