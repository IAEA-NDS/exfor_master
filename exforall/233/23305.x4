             Thin targets of 240Pu and 242Pu were placed
           back-to-back at the central cathode position inside a
           cylindrical twin Frisch grid ionization chamber.
           The fission rates were 0.044/s and 0.54/s for 240Pu and
           242Pu, respectively.
METHOD     (COINC) Gamma-Fis.Fragments coincidence.
            Achieved timing resolution 7. ns (FWHM).
            Number of fission events and number of gamma rays
            detected in coincidence with a fission fragment:
                                         240Pu       242Pu

           Background gammas(normalized) 1.5         17.6
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Cylindrical twin Frisch grid ionization chamber.
           The counting gas was methane at a pressure of
           1.08*10**5 Pa at a flow-rate of about 90 ml/min,
           providing a detection efficiency for fission fragments
           close to 100%. To detect fis.fragments.
           (SCIN) Cylindrical LaBr3:Ce scintillation detector
            (serial number A2987) of 76.2 mm diameter, 76.2 mm
            length; mounted onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT)
            from Hamamatsu (R10233-100-02) with a 89 mm diameter
            quartz window. To detect gamma rays.
           The pulse height of the gamma rays was calibrated with
           standard radioactive sources with energies between
           81 keV and 4.44 MeV, using 133Ba (81-356 keV), 137Cs
            (662 keV), 60Co (1173 keV, 1333 keV), 232Th (583 keV,
           2614 keV) and AmBe (decay of the first excited state in
           12C;Egamma = 4.44 MeV).
           The low-energy threshold during the PFGS measurements
           was set to 100 keV.
           Placed at a distance of 408(2) mm relative to the
           fission source.
