FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL) 7 MV Van-de-Graaff
INC-SOURCE (D-T) TiT target (Ti layer of 4.42 mg/cm2 thick, 3 cm
            diam.) backed by Ag sheet (0.25 mm thick) and glued
            in a cylindrical Al target holder (1 mm wall thick)
            irradiated by deuteron beams (9.1 uA in average) at
            3.00+/-0.02 MeV
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for ~24 hrs
SAMPLE     Fine-grained NaCl powder (purity > 99.5%, dried in a
            desiccator at 120 deg-C immediately before weighing)
            contained in an Al box (wall thick of 1.0 mm, inner
            diameter of 12.0 mm, inner height of 10.00 mm).
           The sample was sandwiched between two Ni foils
            (0.125 mm thick, 12.0 mm diam.), and positioned at
            12.3 deg relative to the deuteron beam.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) Intrinsig Ge gamma-ray detector
CORRECTION Corrected for
           - Self-attenuation of 22Na gammas in NaCl powder
             (3.4+/-0.3%) and 57Co gammas in Ni foils (1.7+/-0.2%)
           - Scattering by NaCl sample (~2.6%) and Ni foil
             (~0.15%) as well as Al sample container walls

           57Co measurements were not started before complete
            decay of 57Ni.
           58Ni(n,2n)57Ni contribution was taken into account and
            corrected by using evaluated (n,2n) cross section.
