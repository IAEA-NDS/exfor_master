FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux was measured by:
            - separating fission product Ba-140 to be
            (4.62+-0.22)*10**10 n/cm2/sec.;
            - average flux outside - 16 % higher.
METHOD     (CHSEP) high-speed chemical technique .
           Hydrides were formed by Zn+H(2)SO(4)
           Total time for chemical operations 5.4sec.
DETECTOR           Neutron detector re-calibrated.
           Efficiency 1.18+-0.05 % for delayed neutrons.
