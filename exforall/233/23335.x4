           data processing/data acquisition/mbs.htm (2006).
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERZFK)  Neutron time-of-flight facility nELBE.
           The electrons are produced in pulses of 5ps width(FWHM)
           , kinetic energy up to 40 MeV; the repetition rate
            101 kHz .
            The data acquisition (DAQ) system was based on
            commercially available VME modules read out by a
            CES RIO4 VME Power-PC running the real time operating
            system LynxOS and the DAQ software MBS developed by
            GSI Darmstadt.
INC-SOURCE (BRST,PHOTO) Neutrons are produced by an electron beam
            impacting on a liquid lead target, via (gamma,n)
            reactions induced by bremsstrahlung.
INC-SPECT   The neutron beam is defined by a collimator:
            a steel tube with lead and polyethylene inserts,
            installed at 95deg with respect to the primary
            electron beam, with 3 cm of lead as absorber.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Eight cylindrical Li glass detectors enriched
           in Li-6 from Scionix(model 51 B 12,7/2M-O-E1-LiG-Neg-X)
           were mounted on an Al frame, in two groups of four,
            at 165deg and 15deg to the beam axis;
            diameter -50.8 mm,
            thickness 12.7 mm,
            Li-6 content  - 7.4% weight,
            density      - 2.5 - 2.7 g/cm3.

            SiO(2)      56.%
            MgO          4.%
