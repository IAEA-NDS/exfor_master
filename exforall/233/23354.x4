FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) LIDO reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Rapid radiochemical method based on isotopic
           exchange with H(2)Se gas.
            Chemical yields were determined by Se-75 tracer.
           -Preliminary experiments were carried out in the
           absence of radiation to study the effects of Se and U
           concentration, reducing agent and reaction time on the
           chemical yield of Se.
           - 12 sec irradiation.
           - Blank experiments to measure Rb-93 contribution
            ( < 5%);
            Kr-93 HL was found to be 1.3 sec.
DETECTOR    See rel-refs.
           Neutron detection efficiency 1.62 %, calibration by
           241Am/Li standard source (average neutron energy
           ~0.6MeV).
SAMPLE      In exchange vessel: 2.0 ml of 0.5N HCl solution,
           containing 200 mg 93% U-235 as uranil chloride,
           22 microg Se as selenite, 0.5 microg each KI and KBr,
           reducing agent ( typically 0.7 mg K2S2O5 ).
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F)56-BA-140,CUM,FY)
             Neutron flux was measured by separating Ba-140.
           Cobalt wires were also used as an additional check on
           the neutron flux.
