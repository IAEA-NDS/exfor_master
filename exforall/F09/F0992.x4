TITLE      The O-16(t,pg)O-18 reaction.

FACILITY   (VDG,2UK MAN) The 6MV Van de Graaff Generator
DETECTOR   (CSICR) A CsI scintillator was used as the proton
           detector. The CsI crystal was approximately 1 mm thick
           and was covered with 30 mg/cm2 of aluminium foil so as
           to absorb scattered tritons and other particles of
           short range.
           (NAICR) A 3.8 cm * 5.1 cm NaI(Tl) scintillator as the
           gamma ray detector was used.
SAMPLE     A quartz target of thickness 2.5 mg/cm2 was used and
           this was inclined at 45 degr. to the direction of the
           incident beam.

ANALYSIS   The results have been analysed in terms of the plane
           wave Born approximation "lump" theory of two nucleon
           stripping.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1)  Absolute error of cross sections. Error is
           due to uncertainties in the target thickness presented
           to be beam because of non-uniformities in the target
           and errors in estimating the mean target thickness.
           (ANG-ERR-D)  Angle digitizing error
           (ERR-DIG)    Data digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR2)  Error from the graphic bars
