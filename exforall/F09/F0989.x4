FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB) The six-meter synchrocyclotron.
INC-SOURCE On its way to the collimators an unpolarized proton
           beam is deflected in an auxiliary magnetic field by an
           angle of 14.2 degr. Thus the beam was purified of
           neutral and low energy particle admixture.
           Geometrically, the collimation was such that at the
           place of the scatterer the following conditions were
           fulfilled: a) the beam image on the autograph was 20 mm
           high and 10 mm wide and b) the horizontal plane beam
           divergence was equal to +-0.15 degr. Due care was taken
           to reduce the proton scattering effect in the
           collimator walls.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,CEREN) The scattered protons were
           registered by a telescope of 3 scintillation counters
           and one Cerenkov counter with a plexiglass radiator.
MONITOR    The averaged results of the measurements of the
           counting rate were used to plot the angular
           distribution of charged secondaries. The corresponding
           curve   was  then  normalized to  values of the
           differential cross sections for the emission of
           charged secondaries in p+C collisions, which were
           obtained earlier in L.Azhgirey,J,JETP,36,1631,1959,
           under conditions identical with those of the present
           experiments. The total energy spectrum of charged
           secondaries, measured at 7 degr., was also normalized
           to a value of the differential cross section for
           the same angles and equal to 1.1+-0.055 b/sr.
