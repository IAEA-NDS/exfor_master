METHOD     (ACTIV)

           efficiency and an energy resolution of 2.1 keV FWHM
           at 1.33 MeV

SAMPLE      Monitor samples were wires of Co/Al alloy (Co:0.46wt%,
            0.381 mm in diameter) and Au/Al alloy (Au: 0.112 wt%,
            0.510 mm in diameter)
            Six samples were prepared - three for irradiation
            within Cd capsule and other three without Cd.
            Standardized solution of 129I including stable
            nuclide 127I was used to prepare samples. With Cd
            60 ml of solution was poured into polyethylene
            capsule (0.7 mm wall thickness, 1 mm outer diam.,
            40 mm outer length), which in turn was set in cylin-
            drical Cd capsule (1 mm wall thickness, 22 mm outer
            diam, 63 mm outer length). Without Cd the solution
            was diluted 1/10 with distilled water and poured into
            another polyethilene capsule.
            Two additional potassium-iodine samples were used to
            measure the quantity of 127I atoms in 127I-129I
            solution.
