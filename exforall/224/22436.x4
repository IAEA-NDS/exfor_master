STATUS     (DEP,22436004) Considering only the resonances from
            22436004 for which a firm l-assignment was given in

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The data were analysed with the R-matrix
           shape-fitting code REFIT taking as a fixed input the
           neutron width values Gn determined in a recent
           transmission measurement (see P.E.Koehler et al.)
           When a resonance was not observed in transmission, a
           fixed value of the capture width Gn = 196 meV was
           taken and Fn was determined. Up to 10 keV the data
           were also analysed with the code FANAC. The results
           for the largest s-waves were also corrected for the
           background induced by the prompt detection of scattered
           neutrons using the table of neutron sensitivity vs
           energy values given in ref. (see F.Corvi et al.).
           For the resonance at E0=7229 eV, with a very large Gn,
           this correction reduces by a factor of two the original
           value. Above 35 keV, where no more transmission data
           exist, our capture curves were fitted using arbitrary
           values of Gn: in view of the sample thickness used and
           of the energy range under scrutiny, it is believed that
           such an uncertainty does not appreciably influence the
           results.

MONITOR    The data were normalized to silver capture at 5.19 eV
           using the saturated resonance method. Such a
           normalization was cross-checked by determining
           the area of the 648 eV resonance of 138Ba which was
           present in the sample with an abundance of 4.56%. The
           obtained value of the capture area g*Gn*Ggamma/G =
            = 4.89 + 0.21 meV is in excellent agreement with the
           value 4.91 + 0.14 meV given in ref. (see H.Beer et al.)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)   The given errors are only the statistical.
           To those one should add the following relative
           systematic contributions
           (ERR-1) uncertainty of the normalization procedure;
           (ERR-2,0.,3.) an error in the energy dependence of the
            neutron flux ranging from 0 at 0.51 keV to 3% at
            100 keV, with log(E) interpolation.
