SAMPLE     .Water-cooled Hafnium foil of 1 mm thickness and 1 cm
            diameter was irradiated for 12 hr at beam current
            30 micro-A. Proton energy 27 MeV was adjusted at the
            maximum of 180Hf(n,2n)179Ta reaction cross section.
            A number of short-lived by-products were allowed to
            decay during storage time of 6 months.
           .Approximately 1.4 microgram of 179Ta was obtained and
            two samples were prepared by electrospraying on Al
            backing.
           - 1st having mass 3.71 nano-gram, 179Ta atoms number
            (1.25+-0.02) x 10**13, diameter 8 mm, activity
