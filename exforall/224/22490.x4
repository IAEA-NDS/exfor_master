SAMPLE     .Water-Cooled Hafnium Foil of 1 mm Thickness and 1 Cm
            Diameter was Irradiated For 12 Hr at Beam Current
            30 Micro-A. Proton Ebergy 27 MeV was Adjusted at the
            Maximum of 180Hf(N,2N)179Ta Reaction Cross Section.
            A Number of Short-Lived by-Products were Allowed to
            Decay During Storage Time of 6 Months.
           .Approximately 1.4 Microgram of 179Ta was Obtained and
            Two Samples were Prepared by Electrospraying on Al
            Backing.
