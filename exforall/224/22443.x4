INC-SOURCE (D-D)  D2 gas target was used
INC-SPECT  .By varying the primary deutron beam energy between
            3 and 8 MeV neutron energy varies between 5.4 and
            10.5 MeV
SAMPLE     .Disk pressed from metal powder, weight near 5 g,
            diameter 2 cm. Thickness 0.5 cm. Monitor foils of
            Fe and Al were attached at the back and in front
            of the sample
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation
           (STTA)   Stacked target of titanum disk and two
                    monitor foils was used
DETECTOR   (GELI)  The efficiency of detector was was determined
                   using standard gamma-source
