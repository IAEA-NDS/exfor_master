TITLE       Measurement of (n,alpha) cross-sections for
            short-lived products by 13.4 - 14.9 MeV neutrons

REFERENCE  (J,ANE,25,(18),1485,1998) Main reference, data given
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNOSA) The intense 14 MeV neutron source
                         OKTAVIAN at Osaka university.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The d-beam energy was 300 keV and the intensity
            was 5 milliamps. a sample transport system of six
            pneumatic tubes provided irradiation positions giving
            monochromatic neutrons of 13.4-14.9 MeV. Another tube
            was put at -105 deg to check the symmetry of the
            system. The irradiation positions was about 15 cm
            from the tritium target. An additional tube set at
            -22.5 deg and at 1.5 cm distance was used when strong
            activities were required. The transfer time was about
            2 sec.
INC-SPECT   Neutron energies cover range from 14.9 to 13.7 MeV
            angles of irradiation are 0, 55, 75, 105, 125, 155
            deg.  Distance between tritium target and sample is
            15 cm. The effective energy of incident neutrons at
            irradiation position was determined by the ratio of
            90-Zr(n,2n) and 93-Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb cross section
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  Two Ge detectors with efficiencies of 12 and
            16%, having resolution of 1.75 and 2.00 keV,
            respectively, were used to measure the induced acti-
            vities. Each detector was covered with a 5 mm acrylic
            absorber to reduce beta-rays. The efficiency calibra-
            tion was performed at a distance of 5 cm using 24Na,
            56Co, 133Ba, 152Eu AND 241Am sources.

SAMPLE      The samples of mass-separated isotopes and samples
            of natural abundance were used. Powder samples were
            wrapped in powder paper. Sample sizes were (10mm*

            70 mg.  Isotopic abundance is given in each Subent
