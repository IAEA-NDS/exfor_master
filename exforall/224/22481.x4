DETECTOR   (SCIN)  Liquid Scintillation Detector Ne213, 14 Cm in
            Diameter, 10 Cm Thick Coupled to a R1250 Photomultipli
            Tube Placed in a Large Shield Made of Paraffin Contai-
            Ning Li2-C-O3. Detector was Placed at 90 Degrees Rela-
            Tive to Uncident Neutron Beam
SAMPLE      .Np-O2 Oxide Powder of 19.99 Gram in Np Enclosed in
             Cylindrical-Shaped Two-Layer Stainless-Steel Containe
             Chemical Purity is 99.2%, Isotopic Abundance 100%
           .A Lead Sample 2 Cm in Diameter and 5 Cm Long was Used
            To Estimate the Sample-Dependent Background
CORRECTION  .Corrections were Made For Contribution of Impurities
             In Sample, For Background, Detector Efficiency,
             Neutron Attenuation by the Lead Slab, Neutron Spectru
