           (J,NST,24,423,1987)       EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
FACILITY   (DYNAM)   4.5 MV Dynamitron accelerator of 2JPNTOH
                     Proton current was 8 micro-Amp, proton
                     energy 1.92 MeV, repetition rate 0.5 MHz,
                     pulse width 2.2 ns
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,SPA) monitor value was taken from
                                     JENDL-3.2 evaluated file
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
METHOD     (TOF)   TIME-OF-FLIGHT
ANALYSIS   .Because exact energy spectrum is not necessary an
            assumption of flat spectrum in each energy bin was
            made. Two measurement runs were made, final results
            represent arithmetic average of both runs
DETECTOR   (FISCH)  Coupled back-to-back ionization chamber for
                    fission rate measurements
           (GLASD,BF3)  6Li glass scintillator NE912 detector
                    AND BF3 COUNTERS were used for measuring
                    and monitoring of neutron spectrum
INC-SPECT   Neutron energy spectrum was divided into five energy
            bins with central energy 8.4, 15, 25, 42, 87 keV
CORRECTION  .corrections were made for (1) backgrounds by room
             returned neutrons, (2) fission events discriminated
             in the pulse height spectrum, (3) self-absorption
             in the fission sample, (4) fission events by the
             neutrons by the chamber and the target
SAMPLE     .Both 237Np and 235U samples were thin-layer electro-
            deposited on a 0.3 mm thick and 36 mm diameter
            platinum plate. Diameter of deposite was 25 mm.
            Total 237Np mass was 1.051 mg, purity 99.999%,
            nonuniformity 1%. Total 235U mass was 0.406 mg,
            U-235 content 99.9%, U-234 content 0.030%, U-236
            content 0.017%, U-238 content 0.041%, non-uniformity
            4%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)   Data-error is not specified, assumed
                     total by compiler
           (ERR-1)   Total error of 237Np sample
           (ERR-2)   Total error of 235U  sample
