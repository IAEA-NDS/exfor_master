SAMPLE     .The Target Material of the 178-Hf-M2 was Produced at
            The Irradiation of Highly Enriched Isotope 176Yb
            (99.998%) On the Dubna U-200 Cyclotron at the End of
            1991. To the Moment of Neutron Irradiation the 25-Day
            Activity of 179Hf was Fully Decayed. High Chemical
            Purification was Achieved. About 10.E12 Atoms of
            178-Hf-M2 were Put on Each of Every 4 Samples. Every
            Sample was Placed Between Neutron Filters Together
            With Gold Standard Sample
