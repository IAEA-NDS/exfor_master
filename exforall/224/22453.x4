INC-SPECT  .Neutron spectrum was shaped with the help of cadmium,
            erbium, rhodium and boron filters for the capture
            resonance integral measurement. Neutron flux is
            2.E+14 N/cm2/sec. A metal foil of natural rhodium,
            natural Er2-O3 oxide, metal powder of enriched to 81%
            10-boron was used as filter material

SAMPLE     .The target material of the 178-Hf-m2 was produced at
            the irradiation of highly enriched isotope 176Yb
            (99.998%) on the dubna U-200 cyclotron at the end of
            1991. To the moment of neutron irradiation the 25-day
            activity of 179Hf was fully decayed. High chemical
            purification was achieved. About 10.E12 atoms of
            178-Hf-m2 were put on each of every 4 samples. Every
            sample was placed between neutron filters together
            with gold standard sample
