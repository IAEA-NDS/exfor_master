METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation

INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  .Angles of irradiation of the target by deuterium ion
            beam are 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 130 degrees. Effective
            mean neutron energy at each sample position had been
            previously determined by the ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr
            and 93Nb(n,2n)92M-Nb cross sections
           .Neutron fluxes ranged from 1.E+7 to 6.E+7 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     .Model sample as a disk pellets 13 mm diameter, 8.5 mm
            thickness  pressed from high-purity (99.99%) oxides
            Al2-O3, weight 1.5 gram, sandwiched between two 1-mm
            thick aluminium foils.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for gamma-ray attenuation in
            samples and for neutron flux attenuation using the
            activity difference between the front and back
            aluminium foils.
