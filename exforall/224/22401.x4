REL-REF    (C,22171004,M.Wiescher+,J,AJ,344,464,1989) -
             value of CS at 25 keV measured in Subent 22171.004
           by ionization chamber was re-analyzed to be 57+-9 mu-b
           - discrepancy was mainly due to miscalculation of the
           total efficiency the ionization chamber; new analysis
           of the activation with Li-glass detector of this Entry
           was impossible,because the original data could no
           longer be retrieved.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG,,SPA)  For neutron flux.
            Obtained by folding the differential CS with the
           experimental neutron spectrum.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton energy 1912 keV.
INC-SPECT   Angle-integrated neutron spectrum is well approximated
           with Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for kT=25 keV.
           Because sample was positioned as 35 mm distance, it did
           not cover the entire ( 120deg) neutron cone, resulting
           in an effective neutron acceptance angle of 50 deg.
           The resulting neutron spectrum was distorted, showing
           a rather flat distribution ranging from 5 keV up to
           110 keV, with an average value 54 keV. See Fig.2 in
           AJ,507,997,1998 .
METHOD      Activation cycles. Irradiation time 1.576 s, waiting
           time 0.012 s, measurement time 2.238 s. 102506 cycles.
