METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation
           (ASSOP)  Associated Alpha-particles
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG,,SPA)  For neutron flux.
            Obtained by folding the differential CS with the
           experimental neutron spectrum.

DETECTOR   (IOCH)  Gridded twin ionization chamber with argon-
           methane gas at 4.5 bar constant pressure. Efficiency of
           alpha-particles detection 99+-1 % and energy resolution
           1.7% for 5.1 MeV were determined with calibrated
           alpha-source.
SAMPLE     Natural lithium fluoride Li-F layer of 210 mug/cm2
           thickness, 36 mm diameter, evaporated on 20+-2 mug/cm2
           C backing with a fine W mesh, with 88% transmission.
            Li-6/Li-7 ratio was determined by mass spectroscopy
           to be 0.082219+- (13%) .

            In AJ,507,997,1998, page 1002, value of CS at 25 keV
           measured in Entry 22171 by ionization chamber was
           re-analyzed to be 57+-9 microbarn - discrepancy was
           mainly due to miscalculation of the total efficiency of
           the ionization chamber; new analysis of the activation
           with Li-glass detector of this Entry was impossible,
           because the original data could no longer be retrieved.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton energy 1912 keV.
INC-SPECT   Angle-integrated neutron spectrum is well approximated
           with Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for kT=25 keV.
           Because sample was positioned as 35 mm distance, it did
           not cover the entire ( 120deg) neutron cone, resulting
           in an effective neutron acceptance angle of 50 deg.
           The resulting neutron spectrum was distorted, showing
           a rather flat distribution ranging from 5 keV up to
           110 keV, with an average value 54 keV. See Fig.2 in
           AJ,507,997,1998 .
