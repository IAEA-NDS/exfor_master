ANALYSIS   .The amount of 135Cs was estimated by the activity
            measurement of the 136Cs induced from 135Cs(n,g)136Cs
            reaction, since 135Cs decays by a beta-transition,
            it does not emit gamma-rays
           .gamma-rays with energies of  796, 802, 819, 1039,
            1048, 1168 and 1235 originated from 134Cs and 136Cs
            nuclides induced by one- and triple-neutron capture
            of 133Cs were used in this experiment

SAMPLE     .Natural CsCl sample, purity 99.99% in 133Cs was used
            as target, weight Near 2 microgram sealed in a quartz
            tube 4 mm inner diameter, 50 mm length. Then the 134Cs
            nuclei were obtained by triple neutron irradiation of
            133Cs to make the amount of 134Cs nuclei definite.
            These 134Cs nuclei were used as sample for the
            134Cs(n,g)135Cs reaction.
