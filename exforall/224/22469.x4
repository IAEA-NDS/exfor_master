SAMPLE      High purity (99.99%) cesium chloride powder packed in
            quartz cases 7 * 8 * 1 mm were used as samples.
            Six samples were prepared.
           .Au/Al alloy wire (0.510 mm diam., 0.112wt% of Au)
            And Co/Al alloy wire (0.381 mm diam., 0.46wt% of Co)
            were used as activation detectors for neutron flux
