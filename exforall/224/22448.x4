SAMPLE     .About 2.E+15 135Cs atoms were implanted into a
            graphite disk of 6 mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness.
            The number of 135Cs atoms was determined by a
            reactor irradiation
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-Maxwellian spectrum with temperature 30 keV
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The uncertainty is dominated by the thermal
           cross section value of 135Cs and the reactor
            flux normalization via the Re isotopes.

            To determine the neutron exposure and in order to
            correct for the epithermal part as well as for a
            possible spatial flux distribution two natural Re
            foils were used as reference samples
