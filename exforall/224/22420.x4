FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)High-Flux Reactor at the ILL in Grenoble
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The end of the Curved Neutron Guide H22d
INC-SPECT   Nearly Maxwellian with maximum at about 36 MeV and
            average neutron energy 18 MeV (T=210K)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)  Two suited surface-barrier Si detectors
SAMPLE      Monitor sample was a natural air with 14-N content
            77.8%,16-O content 20.9%, 17-O content 0.008%, 18-O
            content 0.04%.
            Two oxygen gaseous samples were used. 1-st contained
            5.6% of 16-O, 85.5% of 17-O, 8.9% of 18-O.
            2-nd contained 38.5% of 16-O, 58.2% of 17-O,
            3.3% of 18-O.
