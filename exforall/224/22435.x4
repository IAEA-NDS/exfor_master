TITLE       Investigation of the 238U(n,f)-process at incident
            neutron energies between 1.6 and 3.5 MeV

MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL) 7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator
DETECTOR   (IOCH)  Frisch gridded ionization chamber
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
ADD-RES    (THEO)  Theoretical calculations based on the multi-
                   modal random neck-rupture model of Brosa
CORRECTION  Corrections were made for the inefficiency of the
            Frisch grid, for the pulse-height defect in the
            counter and the energy loss in the fissioning target
COMMENT    From P.Jaffke: "Reaction code was wrong in Subent 003.
           This data set gives an alternative result of 002
            (002: nu(A) of 233,235U(n,f) used;
             003: nu(A) of 239Pu(n,f) used for correction for
             prompt neutron emission), and could be merged to 002
             with the multiple reaction formalism.
