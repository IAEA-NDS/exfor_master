FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) Pulsed Linear Accelerator - GELINA.
                  Beam energy is 100 mev, averaged current is
                  70 microAmpere. Electron bursts width is 2 ns
                  repetition rate 800 Hz
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight distance is 59.4  m
DETECTOR   (STANK) Four C6-D6 liquid scintillators were placed
           at angle of 90 deg relative to the neutron beam for
           Bi209 measurement, at angle of 135 deg - for Pb-207
           measurement.
           (IOCH)  For neutron flux measurement
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutrons produced inside of uranium target by
                   bremsstrahlung gamma and moderated in two 4-cm
                   thick water slabs canned in beryllium
CORRECTION  Background was subtracted.
            For neutron flux shape.
ANALYSIS    Capture yields were analyzed by R-matrix shape fitting
           code REFIT. For Bi-209 82 resonances were identified in
           the energy range 0.2-80 keV, for Pb-207 - 62 resonances
           in 0.2 - 299 keV energy range.
           Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections were
           calculated from the obtained values of the capture
           areas.
