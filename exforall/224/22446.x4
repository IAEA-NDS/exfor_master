INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal Spectrum of the Reactor BR1
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
MONITOR    Neutron flux and efficiency of the detector were
           determined in a calibration run on 35Cl.
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA)   Activation method for Single-Target
                          irradiation
SAMPLE      Sample of elemental sulfur, total weight 313.6 mg,
            contained in a teflon cylinder of 6 mm inner diam.
            was enriched in 34S by 93.26% and in 36S by 5.933%.
