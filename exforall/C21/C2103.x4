SAMPLE     A polystyrene layer 8000 A thick spun onto a silicon
           substrate was used for the hydrogen elastic recoil
           cross section measurement.
METHOD     The hydrogen recoil cross sections were measured at
           scattering angle of 30 degrees with a target tilt of
           75 degrees. The cross section in the energy region of
           interest was obtained by first measuring the yield
           from the sample at 2.5 MeV, where the cross section
           is known. At both high and low energies the target
           was thin enough that the yield could be determined by
           peak integration. This removes the uncertainties
           associated with stopping cross sections. The yield
           obtained in the region of 5-6 MeV was then scaled by
           the 2.5 MeV cross section to determine the cross
           section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainty in the elastic recoil ratios
           is 6%.
CORRECTION The hydrogen cross section was corrected for hydrogen
           loss.

SAMPLE     The boron sample was deposited on a 5 mm thick carbon
           substrate. The boron in the sample was separated from
           the substrate by a 4000 A layer of Mo. This separates,
           in energy, the boron signal from the carbon
           substrate signal. The boron layer was a
           sputter-coated layer of B4C, 500 A thick.
METHOD     A standard procedure for measuring backscattering
           cross sections is the ratio method. The ratio method
           can be derived from the equation for the experimental
           cross section for a given element sigma = Y / Q(Nt)
           deltaOmega, where sigma is the cross section, Y is the
           integrated yield, Q is the number of incident
           particles, (Nt) is the atoms/cm2 in the target and
           deltaOmega is the solid angle of the detector. While
           Y can be measured to arbitrarily good statistical
           uncertainty, the other parameters have higher
           systematic uncertainties.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical uncertainties in the
           backscattering ratio measurements are 4%.

SAMPLE     The carbon sample was deposited on a 5 mm thick

           layer of Au was used followed by a plasma-coated 400

           on the elements expected in the sample. If boron is
           present in a relatively thin film, the best energy is
           = 5.625 MeV. At this energy silicon has relatively
           few resonances in the region of the light element
           signals and can be used as a substrate material.

SAMPLE     The carbon sample was deposited on a 5 mm thick carbon
           substrate.
METHOD     A standard procedure for measuring backscattering
           cross sections is the ratio method. The ratio method
           can be derived from the equation for the experimental
           cross section for a given element sigma = Y / Q(Nt)
           deltaOmega, where sigma is the cross section, Y is the
           integrated yield, Q is the number of incident
           particles, (Nt) is the atoms/cm2 in the target and
           deltaOmega is the solid angle of the detector. While
           Y can be measured to arbitrarily good statistical
           uncertainty, the other parameters have higher
           systematic uncertainties.
ANALYSIS   Choosing the analysis energy in this region depends
           on the elements expected in the sample.
CORRECTION The carbon cross section was corrected for carbon gain.

SAMPLE     The same target was used for both the oxygen and
           nitrogen measurements. A 2000 A layer of ZrN2/ZrO2
           was applied to the carbon substrate. An intermediate
           layer was not needed because the oxygen and nitrogen
           signals are naturally separated from the substrate
           signal.
