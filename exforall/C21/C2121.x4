TITLE      Interactions of Cadmium-106 with alpha particles
AUTHOR     (R.L.Hahn)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,137,1491,1965)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABNL) Irradiations were performed in the
           external alpha-particle beam of the Brookhaven 60-in.
           cyclotron.
SAMPLE     (48-CD-106,ENR=0.779)
           (48-CD-108,ENR=0.009)

           Targets were prepared by electroplating enriched 106Cd
           from alkaline cyanide solution onto 0.00025 in. gold
           foil. Cadmium deposits were uniform in thickness
           < 0.600 mg/cm2 to within 3%.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two matched NaI(T1) crystals, each 2 mm thick
           by 1.5 in. in diameter, were used in almost 4Pi
           geometry. The effective solid angle subtended by a
           point source placed between two crystals was
           determined to be 98% of 4Pi.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,STTA) Anion exchange techniques were
           utilized in order to separate the tin, indium, and
           cadmium. For the isolation of silver and palladium,
           techniques involving precipitation of AgCl and
           palladiumdimethyl glyoxime were employed.
           Several targets were bombarded concurrently by means
           of the stacked-foil method. Each target was placed in
           the stack so that the gold foil intercepted the alpha
           beam before the Cd deposit. Aluminum foils, placed.
           behind the cadmium, served both to catch recoil nuclei
           and to degrade the energy of the beam. The range-energy
           relations of Bichsel for aluminum and gold were
           used to determine the energy of the alpha particles
           incident upon each cadmium target in the stack.
