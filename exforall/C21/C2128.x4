FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           Coupled-Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State
           University
SAMPLE     Liquid Hydrogen Target. The liquid hydrogen was
           contained in a 30-mm-thick cylindrical aluminum target
           cell with 125 mu-m Kapton entrance and exit windows.
           The cell was surrounded by a 1-mm-thick aluminum
           radiation shield with entrance and exit windows
           covered by 5 mu-m aluminized Mylar foil. The
           temperature and pressure of the target cell were
           maintained at 16.0 K and 868 Torr throughout the
           experiment.The liquefied gas in target cell placed at
           the center of a gamma-ray detector array.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The GRETINA gamma-ray tracking array was used
           for gamma ray measurement. The array, consisting of 28
           36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals
           packaged in seven clusters of four crystals each, was
           installed at the pivot point of the S800 in a
           configuration designed to accommodate the liquid
           hydrogen target. Two of the seven modules were mounted
           at 58deg, four at 90deg, and one at 122deg with
           respect to the beam axis.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
INC-SOURCE A cocktail beam was produced by the fragmentation of a
           130-MeV/u 76Ge primary beam in a 376-mg/cm2 9Be
           production target. The secondary products were
           separated by the A1900 fragment separator. A 45-mg/cm2
           aluminum achromatic wedge was used to enhance
           separation of the cocktail by Z. A total of 4.3E+8
           secondary beam particles traversed the reaction target
           in 114 h. Of these, 3.0E+7 particles were tagged as
           50Ca particles in both incoming and outgoing particle
           identification gates, and 4.0E+6 particles were tagged
           as 48Ca, corresponding to 73 particles per second and
           9.3 particles per second, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
CORRECTION Correction for Doppler shift of gamma rays energies was
           made. The corresponding beam velocities, v/c = 0.43 and
           v/c = 0.41 were used for 48Ca and 50Ca, respectively.
