FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) The experiment was performed using FN
           tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at the John D. Fox
           superconducting linear accelerator facility at Florida
           State University.
SAMPLE     Several 6Li targets of thicknesses of about 50mu-g/cm2
           were used in experiment.The 6Li targets were prepared
           under vacuum and transported to the chamber in a
           vacuum container to prevent oxidation. Measurements of
           target thickness was performed in situ by using 16O +
           6Li elastic scattering data.
DETECTOR   (TELES,MWPC,SI) The identification of the reaction
           products was performed using two dE-E telescopes.Each
           dE-E telescope was composed of four pin diode 2x2 cm2
           silicon detectors and one position-sensitive
           proportional counter in front of them. These
           components are contained in a box filled with P10 gas
           A Kapton foil of 7.5 mu-m thickness was used to
           separate the gas filled volume of the box from the
           vacuum of the scattering chamber.
