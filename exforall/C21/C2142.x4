FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) Experiment performed using the FN
           tandem at Florida State University's John D.Fox
           accelerator center.
SAMPLE     Natural Carbon target with thickness of 93 mg/cm2
           thick 12C foil which. The 12C target foil also served
           as a secondary emission foil for a microchannel plate
           detector.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Microchannel plate detector with 12C target
           foil served as start detector for time of flight
           measurement
           (SI) Reaction products were detected in the angular
           range 4.3 deg < theta-lab < 11.0deg using a segmented,
           annular silicon detector which provided both an energy
           and a fast timing signal
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used with reaction products
            energy information to identify the reaction products
INC-SOURCE Incident 18-O beam was pulsed at a frequency
            of 12.125 MHz.
