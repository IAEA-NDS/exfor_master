FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the LBNL 88-
           Inch Cyclotron

           The 242Pu targets were produced by molecular deposition
           from isopropanol solutions.Target backings were
           composed of 99.995% pure Ti foils with thickness
           of (2.2 +- 0.4) mu-m. Five target stacks composed of a
           2 mu-m natNi foil, a 25.4 mu-m Al foil containment
           envelope, and the 242PuO2 target deposited on Ti foil
           were used. 242Pu target thickness was between
           150-500 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Four HPGe gamma ray spectrometers, three
           manufactured by Ortec and one by Oxford Instruments
           were used.
