REACTION   (11-NA-23(D,P)11-NA-24,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Sodium-fluoride targets were prepared by vacuum
           evaporation of reagent grade NaF from a nickel
           crucible to a thickness of =5 mg/cm2 on 1.8 mg/cm2
           aluminum foil. A layer of shellac =0.1 mg/cm2 was
           first sprayed over the backing foil to prevent Raking
           of the salt during subsequent handling.  The
           evaporation was carried out slowly in both cases to
           prevent cracking of the evaporated layer. Punched
           circles about 1.4 cm in diameter were weighed
           individually and stacked between aluminum spacers of
           1.8 mg/cm2 for NaF  for the excitation function runs.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,CHSEP) Individual foil measurement. For
           measurements of absolute cross sections at the
           maximum deuteron energy, single foils were bombarded
           in a Faraday cup.
DECAY-DATA (11-NA-24,15.0HR,B-)
CORRECTION By counting aluminum spacers foils, a correction
           factor with a maximum value of 6% of the total 24Na
           was obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are standard deviations in the
           cross sections obtained from duplicate runs.
           Consideration of errors involved in energy
           determination, beam measurement, foil thickness, and
           counter calibrations, together with the
           reproducibility of runs under various conditions,
           leads to an estimate of about 10% error in the
           absolute cross sections for all reactions studied
           except 75As(d,t)74As, which may be given in error by
           twice as much, due to difficulty involved in the 74As
           calibration.

REACTION   (33-AS-75(D,P)33-AS-76,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Arsenic targets of =10 mg/cm2 were prepared in a
           similar manner as NaF from purified crystalline
           metal. The evaporation was carried out slowly in both
           cases to prevent cracking of the evaporated layer.
           Punched circles about 1.4 cm in diameter were weighed
           individually and stacked between aluminum spacers of
           5 mg/cm2 for As for the excitation function runs.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,CHSEP) A stack of 16 arsenic foils
           separated by aluminum spacers was bombarded for 20
           min at 0.05 pA with 15.4-MeV deuterons. The arsenic
           was dissolved off the aluminum backing with H202 and
           NH4OH. The individual foil measurement was used for
           cross sections normalization.
