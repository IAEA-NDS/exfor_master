REL-REF    (I,,J.W.Weidner+,J,ARI,70,2602,2012) Detailed
            description of experimental irradiations
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Irradiations were performed at the
           Los Alamos National Laboratory's Neutron Science
           Center (LANSCE), proton beams of approximately 90-120
           nA intensities with incident energies of 100 and
           200MeV.
SAMPLE     Thorium foil stacks were used as a sample. Each stack
           contained two sets of six thin thorium foils
           separated by aluminum energy degraders.

METHOD     Amount of reduced 227Ac was determined from its decay
           product 215Po. To reach equilibrium with 215Po parents
           to facilitate spectroscopic measurement required
           approximately 100-day waiting period following
           chemical separation
