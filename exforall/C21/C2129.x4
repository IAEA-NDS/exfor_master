FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed at the University
           of Notre Dame FN tandem accelerator using the TwinSol
           facility
SAMPLE     Several samples of natural Ni or enriched 58Ni were
           used during experiment. The thickness of natural
           samples varied between 1.36 and 5.60 mg/cm2.
           Thickness of enriched 58Ni samples varied between
           0.725 and 0.924 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Several dE-E silicon surface-
           barrier telescopes were used at backward angles to
           detect protons evaporated from the fused system.
           Either three telescopes at 120,135 and 150 deg or
           four telescopes at 112.5, 127.5,142.5 and 157.5 deg
           were used in various experimental runs.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
INC-SOURCE 7Be isotope was generated by means of the one proton
           transfer reaction 3He (6Li,7Be). Mixed secondary beam
           consisting of 8B, 7Be, and 6Li with rates of
           0.5-1.2E+5 particles/s were produced using primary
           6Li3+ beams  with energies between 31 and 38 MeV.

ANALYSIS   Fusion cross section was obtained as ratio of measured
           proton emission cross section and multiplicity which
           was calculated by PACE2.
