FACILITY   (VDG,1USATNL) Experiment performed using JN Van de
           Graaff accelerator at the Laboratory for Experimental
           Nuclear Astrophysics (LENA), which is part of the
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory
           (CCW,1USATNL) At low energies LENA ECRIS electron
           cyclotron resonance ion source was used for
           measurements.
SAMPLE     (8-O-16,ENR=0.116)
           (8-O-17,ENR=0.877)
           (8-O-18,ENR=0.007) Targets of 17-O were prepared by
           anodizing 0.5-mm-thick tantalum backings in 17-O
           enriched water.The targets withstood beam charge
           accumulations up to 55 C at a beam intensity of 2.0
           mA without any degradation in the maximum height of
           the yield curves. The width of the yield curves (i.e.,
           the target thickness) reduced noticeably because of
           target sputtering (at a rate of 0.07-0.22 keV/C,
           depending on the target and the beam intensity).
           Targets were discarded when the thickness degraded by
           more than 25%, which typically occurred at charge
           accumulations of 30 C.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The LENA gamma-gamma coincidence spectrometer
           consists of an 135% HPGe detector oriented at 0deg
           with respect to the beam axis. The distance between
           the HPGe detector and the target midpoint was 1.1 cm
           and covered a large solid angle.
           (NAICR) HPGe detector was surrounded by a 16-segment
           NaI(Tl) annulus, which provided almost 4Pi solid
           angle coverage.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator paddles of 5 cm thickness
           covered the two counters on five sides and suppressed
           cosmic-ray muon events.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between HPGe and NaI(Tl) crystal
           was required. Timing gate was set sufficiently wide
           to 500 ns  because of the long mean lifetime of the
           Ex = 1121-keV level in 18F.
CORRECTION Data corrected for degradation of target thickness
           caused by intense proton beam.
