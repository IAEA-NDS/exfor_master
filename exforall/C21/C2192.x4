FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USANAL) Proton irradiation at 120 GeV was
           performed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
           (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) Proton irradiation at 392 MeV was
           performed at Ring Cyclotron of Research Center for
           Nuclear Physics, Osaka University,
METHOD     (CHSEP,AMS) After irradiation, the target samples
           were prepared chemically for the AMS measurements.
           Samples were dissolved in HNO3 after adding 200 mu-g
           of Be and 500 mu-g of Al carriers. The Y was firstly
           precipitated from its solutions as Y2(C2O4)3 by
           adding oxalic acid. The Be and Al were separated by
           cation exchange (Dowex 50WX8,100 - 200 mesh) using 1 M
           HCl and 1.5 M HCl, respectively. The isotopic ratios
           of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27Al in the Y and Tb target
           foils were determined by AMS at MALT (Micro Analysis
           Laboratory, Tandem accelerator), University of Tokyo
           From the Cu sample, the target element was removed by
           anion exchange.Isotopic ratio of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27Al
           was determined by atomic mass spectroscopy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The uncertainties (+-1sigma) quoted in the
           production cross sections were obtained by adding
           quadratically the uncertainties in the AMS and proton
           fluence measurements.
