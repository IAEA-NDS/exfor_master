REFERENCE  (J,PRL,112,172701,2014)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment performed at HRIBF facility
           at ORNL
SAMPLE     Monoisotopic 9Be target with thickness of 1.57+-0.08
           mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Recoiling target nuclei were detected in the
           "bare" HyBall (BareBall) CsI(Tl) array, using the first
           four rings at laboratory angles 7-14deg, 14-28deg,
           28-44deg, and 44-60deg relative to the beam direction.
           (HPGE) Coincident gamma rays were detected in the
           CLARION array of 11 Compton suppressed, segmented
           HPGe Clover detectors, which was configured with five
           detectors at 90deg, four at 132deg, and two at
           154deg. The Clover detectors were at a distance of
           21.75 cm from the target
INC-SOURCE Doubly closed-shell 132Sn and 208Pb beams were provided
           by HRIBF facility at sub-Coulomb energies of 3 MeV
           per nucleon.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between recoiling nuclei and gamma
           rays was required. Recoiling nuclei were detected
           at laboratory angles 7 deg to 44 deg with respect
           to beam axis. Cross sections are given for events with
           detected recoiling nuclei. 8Be nucleus is unbound and
           two correlated alpha paricles were detected in
           coincidence with discrete gamma ray to identify the
           reaction channel. 10Be was identified in CsI array.
ANALYSIS   The experimental cross sections were determined from
           a gamma-ray intensity balance, i.e., the difference
           between the total intensity out of a state and the
           total intensity feeding that state, which included a
           kinematic correction to the solid angle.
CORRECTION Doppler correction for gamma ray energy was applied
