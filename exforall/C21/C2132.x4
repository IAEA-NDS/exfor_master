FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility of Michigan State
           University.
SAMPLE     Polyethylene (CH2)n target with thickness of 9.6 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detection systems,
           10cm and 60cm upstream of target, determined the
           positions and angles of the incoming projectile on
           the target
           (TELES,SISD,SISD,SCIN) Sixteen telescopes of the High
           Resolution Array HiRA measured the energies and
           angles of the deuterons. Telescopes were located 35
           cm from the target and covered polar angles of 4deg -
           45deg in the laboratory frame. Each telescope
           contained one 65 mu-m thick dE and one 1500 mu-m
           thick E silicon strip detector that were backed by
           four 3.9cm thick CsI(Tl) crystals.
           (MAGSP) The HiRA, MCP and reaction targets were
           placed in a scattering chamber in front of the S800
           spectrometer, which detected the 55Ni residues.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Coincidence between 55Ni residues and
                       deuterons was required.
INC-SOURCE Secondary 56Ni beam was produced by fragmentation of
           140 MeV/A primary beam of 58Ni on a 1269 mg/cm2
           beryllium production target. The A1900 fragment
           separator filtered 56Ni nuclei from the resulting
           fragmentation products to a purity of 72% and
           degraded their energies to 37 MeV/nucleon.
