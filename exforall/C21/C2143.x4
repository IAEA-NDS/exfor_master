FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the coupled
           cyclotron facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), Michigan State University.
SAMPLE     9Be secondary target with thickness of 9 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analysed in
           S800 high-resolution magnetic spectrograph. Reaction
           residues were identified by detectors located in the
           spectrometer focal plane
           (IOCH,SCIN) Reaction residues were identified by an
           energy-loss measurement in an ionization chamber and
           time of flight measurement using one plastic
           scintillator before the target and one in the focal
           plane.
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE The 28Mg beam was produced by fragmentation of an
           40Ar primary beam with an energy of 140 MeV/A on a
           846 mg/cm2 9Be production target. The desired
           fragment with an energy of 93 MeV/u was selected with
           the A1900 fragment separator and impinged on a
           9mg/cm2 9Be secondary target at the target position
           of the S800 high-resolution magnetic
           spectrograph.Incoming beam particles were identified
           event by event by their time of flight between two
           plastic scintillators before the target. The average
           rate on target was 5E+5 28Mg/s. The largest
           contaminant, 29Al, amounted to only 1.5% of the total
           beam intensity.
