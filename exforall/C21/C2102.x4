INC-SOURCE The beam used was a proton microbeam running at
           50-100 pA with a spot size of about 50 microm.
SAMPLE     The target combination selected was an evaporated CuS
           sample purchased from MicroMatter Co. The
           nonstoichiometric sample is deposited on
           0.25-mil-thick Mylar and has an areal density of 58.5
           microg/cm2.
DETECTOR   Particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) detector, the
           backscattering particle counter.

METHOD     (ASSOP) Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and particle-
           induced x-ray emission data were taken simultaneously.
ANALYSIS   These cross sections can be related via the solid
           angle ratio OmegaS/OmegaX that is determined entirely
           from quantities associated with element target A. In
           other words, in this system the differential
           non-Rutherford scattering cross section can be
           determined just from a single element target, and
           furthermore, it is not necessary to know the total
           number of incident particles, the solid angles, or
           the number of target atoms. Applying the theoretical
           formalism, the differential Rutherford cross section
           is readily calculated because the x-ray production
           cross sections may be obtained from a variety of
           sources.
