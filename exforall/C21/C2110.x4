TITLE      Nuclear reactions of V with 300-GeV protons and Co
           with 11.5-, 200-, and 300-GeV protons

FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USANAL) The 200- and 300-GeV irradiations
           were performed in an external proton beam in the
           neutrino hall at the National Accelerator Laboratory
             (now Fermi Lab - FNAL).
           (SYNCH,1USAANL) Two irradiations of Co were at 11.5-
           GeV were made using the circulating beam of the ANL
           zero-gradient synchrotron
DETECTOR   (GELI) After irradiation samples were counted without
           any chemical separation with ca1ibrated Ge(Li)
           spectrometers
METHOD     (ACTIV)Reaction products were produced by spallation
                  reaction
PART-DET   (DG)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           It was assumed, that cross section is constant at all
           measured energies i.e. at 10, 28 and 300 GeV
HISTORY    (20140605C) Compiled by S.H.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties quoted represent
              estimates of the precision based on the fit of the
              decay curves with half-lives literature. The
              data of tab.1 are based on three independent runs.

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab. 2 of the reference
SAMPLE     51V sample with dimensions 6x6 cm2. The target foils
           were irradiated together with aluminum monitor foils,
           and each was sandwiched between guard foils to avoid
           cross contamination. Total thickness of V stack was
           150mg/cm2 and 30mg/cm2
