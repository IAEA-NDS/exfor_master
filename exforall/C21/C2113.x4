TITLE      Inclusive pi- production with 200 MeV protons:

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABNL) Experiment performed using 200-MeV
           proton Chemistry LINAC Irradiation Facility at the
           Brookhaven National Laboratory
SAMPLE     The bismuth targets used in the proton irradiations
           were prepared by one of two techniques. Thin targets
           (2 mg/cm2 to 35 mg/cm2) were made by the evaporation
           of high purity bismuth metal onto aluminum backings.
           Thicker selfsupporting targets ( 1g/cm2 ) were
           prepared by pressing.Data presented are measured
           with target thickness of 32.77 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method was used. Following
           the chemical separation, At production cross sections
           were determined through the use of alpha and gamma
           spectroscopic techniques.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For gamma counting a Ge(Li) detector was used.
           (SIBAR) Si surface barrier detector was used for alpha
                   particle counting
