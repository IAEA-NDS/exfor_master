SAMPLE     Stack of NaBr films obtained by evaporation in vacuum
           on aluminum foil. Each foil was covered above and
           below by 1.7 mg/cm2 aluminum foils, so that the
           thickness of the sodium bromide layer was about 5
           mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   Mica window beta ray counters. Platinum screen
           cathode ray gamma ray counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,TTM,CHSEP) Deuteron energy determinations were
           made by measurement of range in aluminum. Detection
           by means of beta-ray emission was chosen as the means
           for obtaining the relative excitation curves of the
           bromine and sodium isotopes. The activities of each
           isotope were measured on a calibrated gamma-ray
           counter which yielded three excitation curves and the
           known absolute disintegration rates and scheme of
           24Na and 82Br. When a volatile or gaseous product is
           formed in a solid target it generally is retained in
           the structure of the solid material. In order to
           liberate the krypton after bombardment had been
           completed, it was necessary only to dissolve the
           foils in water.

COMMENT    Original article does not identify 79Kr as a product,
           it simply states Kr. 79Kr was deduced using half life
           and decay mode information. Authors mention also
           Kr-81 as (possible) product, but this could not
           possibly be measured here, as Kr-81g has half-life of
           229000 yr, and Kr-81m has 13 sec. The production of
           Kr-79 from Br-81 is also excluded, as this would be
           the (d,4n) reaction which has a much higher threshold.
