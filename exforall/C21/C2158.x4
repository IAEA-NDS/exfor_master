TITLE      New measurement of the alpha asymptotic normalization
           coefficient of the 1/2+ state in 17-O at 6.356 MeV
           that dominates the 13C(alpha,n)16-O reaction rate at
           temperatures relevant for the s process

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) Experiment performed using FN Tandem
           Van de Graaff accelerator with cesium-sputter ion
           source at the John D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator
           Laboratory at Florida State University
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.99) Enriched 6Li sample on 5 mu-m Formvar
           Several 6Li targets of thicknesses of about 50mu-g/cm2
           were used in experiment.The 6Li targets were prepared
           under vacuum and transported to the chamber in a
           vacuum container to prevent oxidation. Measurements of
           target thickness was performed in situ by using 16O +
           6Li elastic scattering data.
DETECTOR   (TELES,MWPC,SI) The identification of the reaction
           products was performed using two dE-E telescopes.Each
           dE-E telescope was composed of four pin diode 2x2 cm2
           silicon detectors and one position-sensitive
           proportional counter in front of them. These
           components are contained in a box filled with P10 gas
           A Kapton foil of 7.5 mu-m thickness was used to
           separate the gas filled volume of the box from the
           vacuum of the scattering chamber.
