FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Cyclotron
           Facility at NSCL.
SAMPLE     9Be secondary target with thickness of 376 mg/cm2 was
           located at the target position of the S800
           spectrograph.
INC-SOURCE The 61V ions were produced from a 140MeV/u primary
           82Se beam impinging on a 423 mg/cm2 9Be production
           target, and were separated using a 240 mg/cm2 Al
           degrader in the A1900 fragment separator Typical
           target rates were
           Ion type   fraction
           61V         10%
           62Cr        32%
           64Mn        45%
           Absolute intensity of 61V secondary beam
              was 15 ions/sec

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Array of 36-fold segmented high-purity Ge
           detectors GRETINA was used to measure the prompt
           gamma rays emitted by the reaction residues. The
           seven GRETINA modules with four crystals each, were
           arranged in two rings. Four modules were located at
           58deg and three at 90deg with respect to the beam
           axis. Online signal decomposition provided gamma ray
           interaction points for event-by-event Doppler
           reconstruction of the photons emitted in flight at
           v/c = 0.4.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between reaction residues
           detected in S800 spectrograph and gamma rays detected
           GRETINA array was required.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections for discrete level population was
           determined from gamma ray spectra.
CORRECTION Correction for Doppler shift using the gamma ray
           interaction points deduced from online signal
           decomposition was made
FLAG       (1.) Ground state population was determined by
           subtraction of excited states cross section from
           inclusive cross section
