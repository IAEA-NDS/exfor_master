INC-SPECT  The energies of the deuterons inducing fission varied
           from 8.5 to 9.9 MeV, one-half of the fissions being
           produced by deuterons with energies above 9.5 MeV.
           Less than 0.5 per cent of the fissions were induced
           by neutrons.
SAMPLE     2 mil target foils.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A flow-type beta-proportional counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) Uranium with normal isotopic
           composition was irradiated in the Los Alamos
           Homogeneous Reactor in a thermal flux of 5x10 11
           cm-2sec-1, while thorium stacked target foils were
           irradiated with a deuteron beam of the Washington
           University Cyclotron. Relative yields were determined
           by comparison of fission-product radioactivities from
           232Th fission induced by 9.5 MeV deuterons with those
           from 235U thermal neutron fission, for which fission
           yields are known. Irradiated targets were dissolved
           in hydrochloric acid, and aliquots of the solutions
           were taken for radiochemical analysis.

RESULT     (RVAL)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Many sources of uncertainties are
           inherited in this treatment: probably the largest is
           contributes by the assumption of a smooth,
           symmetrical yield-mass curve. Another possible source
           of uncertainty is the assumption that the generic
           history of fission product is the same for two
           fission reactions.

ANALYSIS   Obtained yield-mass curve is symmetrical about A=115,
           which implies an average loss of 4 neutrons during or
           prior to fission. Shifts in the symmetry point of >1
           mass unit give curves with appreciable deviations
           from the experimental data. We conclude, therefore,
           that neutron multiplicity is 4+-1.

ANALYSIS   Relative values of fission yields for the 232Th(d,f)
           reaction were obtained by multiplying the R values by
           the known fission yields from the 235U(n,f) reaction.
           These relative yields were then used to construct a
           smooth, symmetrical yield-mass curve. The curve was
           normalized to give a total yield of 200 per cent.
COMMENT    Authors give fission yields in %, which are compiled
           in EXFOR as PC/FIS, without change in the numerical
           values.
