FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment was carried out at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, East
           Lansing,MI
SAMPLE     Natural Ni target with thickness of 580 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SI) The time of flight of each fragment was
           measured between a plastic scintillator, positioned
           at the middle focal plane of the A1900 separator, and
           a Si detector placed at the end of beam line before
           time projection chamber, used to detect rare decay of
           reaction product. Si detector was used to measure
           energy loss of reaction products.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) Reaction products were identified by (time
           of flight) x (energy loss) method. Time of flight is
           related to the total energy of particles and the ion
           identification is equivalent to the well known E-dE
           method.
