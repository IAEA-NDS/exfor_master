FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the Los
           Alamos Isotope Production Facility (LANL-IPF), which
           uses 100 MeV proton beam, extracted from the main 800
           MeV LANSCE proton linear accelerator.
SAMPLE     Target stack configuration consisting of WO3 target
           in degrader assembly with cooling water. The stack

           The natWO3 powder target, 25.19 g original mass,
           5.1 cm dia x 2.54 mm thick, encapsulated in Nb shell
           windows with thicknesses of 0.6 mm front and 1.4 mm
           back.
           The tungsten oxide puck was prepared by pressing (force
           200 kN or 20.4 t of weight) and sintering (heating in
           air at 1000deg C) of the powder and then sealing it
           inside the capsule under vacuum by means of electron
           beam welding.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Ortec Model GMX-35200-S HPGe detector. The
           detector diameter was 50.0 mm, detector length 53.5
           mm, resolution at 1333 keV was 1.99 keV, the relative
           efficiency at 1333 keV was about 10%.
INC-SOURCE Stack target geometry configuration was used to to
           degrade the beam energy, the roughly Gaussian shaped
           proton energy distribution at the target is expected
           to be significantly broadened (up to +-6MeV FWHM).
           Mean proton energies within a target stack was
           determined from radioisotope formation ratios,
           assuming that the excitation function for those
           isotopes is well known. The beam current was chosen
           conservatively and had an average of 18.50+-0.02 mu-A.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) WO3 mass was weighed and dissolved in
           NaOH solution.The filtered Na2WO4 solution was then
           loaded onto an anion exchange column  (Bio-Rad
            AG 1 x 8, resin bed column of 1.2 cm
           diameter x 13.3 cm length, pre-equilibrated with NaOH,
           1 mol dm-3). The isotope 187W was used as a tracer
           for tungsten throughout the separation experiment.
           Rhenium isotopes were quantitatively retained, while
           the Na2WO4 matrix solution eluted. This final product
           was assayed for W, Ta, Hf and Re concentration via
           ICP-AES. An aliquot (2.29 g of solution out of 20.0 g
           total mass) was diluted with HCl (up to a
           total of 5.0 g, 0.1 mol dm-3) for analyses.
           Raw instrument results were corrected for dilution
           and total target mass. Final product activities
           measured by gamma ray spectroscopy.
