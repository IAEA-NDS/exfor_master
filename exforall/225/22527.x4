METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight with an 11.5 m flight path and
           0.17 microsec/m resolution for capture or
           0.035 microsec/m resolution for transmission
DETECTOR   (NAICR,BF3)
SAMPLE     Three samples of metallic niobium of thicknesses
           9.82E20, 247.E20, and 912.E20 atoms/cm2 with
           approximately 0.5% tantalum were used
ANALYSIS   Resonance parameters determined on the basis of two
           capture runs and the total cross section run
            (transmission), and interference analysis

ANALYSIS   (AREA) assumed that G(n) >> G(alpha).
METHOD     (TRN) The method of investigation was that of
           transmission over a flight-path of 31.8 meters,
           and using timing channels of 2 mu-sec duration
            (resolution 0.063 mu-sec/meter).
DETECTOR   (NAICR,BF3)
SAMPLE     Four samples of metallic niobium of thicknesses
           12.7E20, 47.9E20, and 2430.E20 atoms/cm2. The
           two thinner samples were in the form of sodium
           nitrate, and the thicker ones of metallic sodium.
