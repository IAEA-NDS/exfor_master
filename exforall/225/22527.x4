TITLE      A NOTE ON THE ANALYSIS OF NEUTRON RESONANCE DATA
           INCLUDING EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM REACTOR MATERIALS
FACILITY   (LINAC) HARWELL LINEAR ELECTRON ACCELERATOR
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT
DETECTOR   (BF3,NAICR,IOCH)
ANALYSIS   TRANSMISSION, SCATTERING, GAMMA-RAY YIELD, AND FISSION
           YIELD MEASURMENTS WERE USED. THE CONCURRENCE OF THE
           PARAMETERS FROM THE VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS YIELDS THE
           RESONANCE PARAMETERS
ERR-ANALYS NO DISCUSSION
ADD-RES    (TRCS) GRAPH OF THE NIOBIUM TOTAL CROSS SECTION
           NORMALIZED TO A POTENTIAL SCATTERING LEVEL OF 6.2 B
           FROM AECU-2040,(SUPPT 3) (1954).

SAMPLE     THREE SAMPLES OF METALLIC NIOBIUM OF THICKNESSES
           9.82E20, 247.E20, AND 912.E20 ATOMS/CM-SQ WITH
           APPROXIMATELY 0.5 PER-CENT TANTALUM WERE USED
ANALYSIS   RESONANCE PARAMETERS DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF TWO
