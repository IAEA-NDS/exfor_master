TITLE      -New Measurement of activation cross section for the
            Cu-63(n,2n)Cu-62 and Cu-64(n,2n)Cu-63 Reactions at
            Energy Range of 13.3 to 14.9 MeV.

FACILITY    JAERI FNS facility.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) D+ beam of 2mA and 350 keV bombarded 3T target.
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux at sample was monitored with Al foils.
SAMPLE      1. Natural copper samples of 10mm diameter and 0.2mm
            thick were deployed at 100mm radius at angles of 0.deg
            to 165.deg to incident d+ beam.
            2. Pneumatic sample transfer system was used. Eight
            tubes were set around d-t source from 0deg to 165deg.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 1.Irradiation time 3 m.Each sample was measured
           at least three times at different cooling times.
            2.Irradiation and cooling time was 1min,and 2 to 3 min
            respectively.
RAD-DET    (29-CU-62,AR) Annihilation gamma-rays from Cu samples,
            encapsuled in 0.8mm thick lead, were counting by
            Ge detector immediately after irradiation.

CORRECTION  Corrections were applied for count loss due to
            Summation of cascade gammas, self absorption in the
            Samples, fluctuation of the neutron flux during
            Irradiation, and for contribution of low energy
            Neutrons to the reaction rate.
