DETECTOR   (PROPC)  Proportional counters of nearly identical
               design. Walls made of carbon
            these are commercially available LET-1/2 counters
            with cavity diameter 12.7 mm. Counters are operating
            with propan-based tissue-equivalent gas mixture
            at 90 hPa pressure
