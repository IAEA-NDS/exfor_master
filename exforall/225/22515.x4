TITLE       The cross section of the reaction 6Li(n,p)6He
            in the neutron energy range 3.5 to 14.8 MeV

INC-SOURCE (D-D) For the neutron energy range 3.5 to 8.6 MeV a gas
           target was employed which was 2.5 cm long and was
           filled with deuterium at approximately 1 atm pressure.
           (D-T) Neutrons of energy 14.8 MeV were obtained by
           bombarding a thick titanium tritide target with
           300 keV deuterons.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) The spread in neutron energy was calculated
           from the target thickness and the angle subtended by
           the sample at the target using the reaction data of
           Fowler and Brolley (see REL-REF).

MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) for neutron flux
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.93) The lithium sample, enriched to 93%
           6Li and of 99.8% chemical purity, was in the form of
           a disk 1.6 cm dia. by 0.125 cm thick in an aluminium
           can with a wall thickness of O.025 cm.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Beta particles from the decay of 6He were
           counted in an end-window, gas-flow, proportional
           counter.
REL-REF    (R,,J.L.Fowler+,J,RMP,28,103,1956)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include:
             * the counting statistics error and
             * the estimated error in the neutron flux
               determinations and Beta-particle counter
               calibration.
