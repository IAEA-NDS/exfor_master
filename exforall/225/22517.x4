TITLE      The radiative capture cross section of Sc-45 for fast
           neutrons
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK ALD) AWRE 3 MeV Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons of the lowest three energies were
           produced using the 7Li(p,n) reaction;
           (P-T) Next two energies were produced from the p-T
           reaction
           (D-D)  At 4.5 MeV were produced using the d-D reaction
           (D-T) At 14.65 MeV were produced using the d-T reaction
SAMPLE     Samples for neutron irradiation consisted of 0.8 gr of
            spectroscopically pure scandium oxide in flat
            thin-walled Perspex pill boxes about 0.1 cm deep
            and 3 cm diam.
            The neutron flux through the samples was determined
            by sandwiching them between two parallel plate ion
            chambers each containing about 3 mg of 235-U extending
            over an area similar to that of the scandium samples.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 6-cm diam. 6-cm long NaI scintillation
            gamma-ray spectrometer
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation errors
STATUS     (SCSRS) Data are given on fig.1 of JNE/AB,17,349

            The fission counting rate in the counters was
            calibrated in terms of neutron flux by calculations
            based on: the amount of 235-U present as determined
            by low geometry alpha-particle assay, published
            values for the fission cross section, and
            experimentally determined corrections for fission
            fragment counting losses due to the thickness and
            non-uniformity of the 235-U foil. This calibration
            was verified at 14.65 MeV by making an absolute
             measurement using the usual method of counting
            the associated alpha-particles from the d-T reaction.
