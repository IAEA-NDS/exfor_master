ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,20.) 10-20% include ERR-S
            Systematic errors in the determination of the
            scattering cross-sections may arise from hydrogen
            impurities, mainly in the form of water or occluded
            hydrogen, and from strongly absorbing impurities in
            the scatterers. The latter source of error was usually
            small, since comparatively pure chemicals were used
            in most cases.
           (ERR-S,5.,10.) Statistical error
ANALYSIS   The cross-sections were calculated by assuming the
           scattering cross-section of carbon to be equal to the
           total cross section determined previously (Subent 002)
