REL-REF    (O,20029001,L.Breitenhuber+,J,AKE,15,83,1970) - final
            results for iodine, manganese, aluminum.
INSTITUTE  (2AUSGFK)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation measurement. Cd-ratios
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Epithermal index of 0.0520 +- 0.001 in a
           certain channel
ANALYSIS   Resonance integrals measured with cadmium-ratios
           referenced to gold as standard, 1/v included
           variation of thin foils eliminated selfshielding
           effects
