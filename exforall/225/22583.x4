REACTION   (28-NI-60(N,2N)28-NI-59,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .Natural nickel foil irradiated with fluence
            5.2 x 10**17 n/cm2 at RTNS-II neutron facility and
            diluted 10 times after irradiation by natural nickel
DECAY-DATA (28-NI-59,1.08E+05YR)
ANALYSIS   By comparing with a standard of known 59Ni/58Ni ratio
           of (1.04+-0.21) x 10**(-8) it was derived a ratio of
           59Ni/60Ni= (8.1+-2.0) x 10**(-9) in the sample (the
           relative uncertainties of current measurement, standard
           and statistics were added quadratically).
           After correcting for the dilution factor, a cross-
           section for the reaction 60Ni(n,2n)59Ni was deduced.
CORRECTION .Correction was made for sample dilution
