FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL) The Geel CN-type Van de Graaff machine.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Monoenergetic neutrons in the energy range of
             16.32 to 19.02-MeV were produced via the
             H-3(d,N)He-4 reaction.
INC-SPECT    Monoenergetic neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 55.39 hr.
           (CHSEP)
             Radiated sample was dissolved in 350-ml of
            2M HCl acid containing 240-mg of Cs carrier. After
            chemical separation radiocesium sample was counted for
            several weeks periodically over several years.
           Chemical yield ~80%, the decontamination factor >10**6.

ADD-RES    (COMP).Hauser-Feshbach calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall error was obtained by combining
                      all the individual errors in quadrature and
            amounted to between 45 to 80%. The major sources of
            errors in the present measurements were weak count
            rates of  Cs-137, error up to 70%.
           (EN-ERR).The deviations do not give errors, they show
            energy spreads due to angle emission and deuteron
            energy loss in the Ti(t)-target.
           (MONIT-ERR).The uncertainty in the excitation function
            of the monitor reaction is 8%, which was used for
            neutron flux measurements.

REACTION   (57-LA-139(N,X)55-CS-137,,SIG)  This is the major
            contributing process, however, small contribution,
            less than 20% from the (N,dp) and (N,2Np) processes
            may also occur.
DECAY-DATA (55-CS-137,30.17YR,DG,662.,0.935)
SAMPLE     .The La-segment, 20 to 28-g. Purity 99.6% .
            1.  The weight La-segment is 20.04 g, angular range
                is 0 - 40 degree, for EN=19.02 MeV
            2.  The weight La-segment is 28.70 g, angular range
                is 40 - 65 degree, for EN=17.68 MeV
            3.  The weight La-segment is 21.88 g, angular range
                is 65 - 62 degree, for EN=16.32 MeV
ANALYSIS    La-139(N,HE3)La-137 is major contributing process,
            however, small contribution, < 20% from the (n,dp) and
            (n,2np) processes on La-139 ( Q-values  -7.53, -13.03,
            -15.25 MeV,respectively) may also occur.
