INC-SOURCE (D-T) Monoenergetic neutrons in the energy range of
             16.32 to 19.02-MeV were produced via the
             H-3(d,N)He-4 reaction.
SAMPLE     .The La-segment, 20 to 28-g, was dissolved in 350-ml of
            2 Mol HCl acid containing 240-mg of Cs carrier. After
            chemical separation radiocesium sample was counted for
            several weeks periodically over several years.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Hauser-feshbach calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall error was obtained by combining
                      all the individual errors in quadrature and
            amounted to between 45 to 80%. The major sources of
            errors in the present measurements were weak count
            rates of  Cs-137, error up to 70%.
           (EN-ERR).The deviations do not give errors, they show
            energy spreads due to angle emission and deuteron
            energy loss in the Ti(t)-target.
           (MONIT-ERR).The uncertainty in the excitation function
            of the monitor reaction is 8%, which was used for
            neutron flux measurements.

REACTION   (57-LA-139(N,HE3)55-CS-137,,SIG)  This is the major
            contributing process, however, small contribution,
            less than 20% from the (N,dp) and (N,2Np) processes
            may also occur.
