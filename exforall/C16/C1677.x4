SAMPLE     A 209(4) mg/cm2 197Au target.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,MAGSP) SeGA (segmented germanium array).
METHOD     (EDE,GSPEC) The secondary beam 76.4 MeV/nucleon 46Ar
           was obtained by fragmentation of 110 MeV/nucleon 48Ca
           primary beam impinging on a 376 mg/cm2 9Be
           fragmentation target located at the midacceptance
           target position of the A1900 fragment separator. The
           secondary 197Au target was placed at the target
           position of the S800 spectrograph and surrounded by
           SeGA. Fifteen 32-fold segmented HPGe detectors were
           arranged at a distance of 20 cm from the target in
           two rings with central angles of 90 and 37 degrees
           relative to the beam axis.
           (COINC) 46Ar and gamma detected in coincidence
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) Scattered particles were integrated from 0 to
           theta max degrees.
