FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The experiment was carried out at
           the 88-Inch Cyclotron of the Lawrence Berkeley
           National Laboratory and used the Berkeley Gas-filled
           Separator
SAMPLE     0.5 mb/cm2 thick 208Pb targets with 25 mu-m/cm2
           carbon fronting, mounted on a rotating target wheel.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Evaporation residues were collected by the
           BGS and separated from the beam and other reaction
           products by their differing magnetic rigidities in
           the He gas.
           (MWPC,SISD) The evaporation residues passed through
           a Multi-Wire Proportional Counter (MWPC) before being
           implanted into a 1 mm thick, 16 x 16 pixel,
           double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with
           dimensions of 5 x 5 cm.
METHOD     (COINC) Evaporation residues were identified by
           observation of a signal in the MWPC coincident
           with a recoil implant in the DSSD, which decays,
           within the same pixel, by the characteristic
           ground-state fission of 256Rf
