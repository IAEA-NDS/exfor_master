FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Berkeley gas-filled separator (BGS) at
           the LBNL 88-inch cyclotron facility.
SAMPLE     The 208Pb target consisted of nine arc shaped segments,
           each with a 500-microg/cm2 thick lead layer
           sandwiched between layers of carbon with thicknesses
           of 40 microg/cm2 (facing the beam) and 2 microg/cm2.
           These segments were mounted around the periphery of a
           14-inch diameter wheel which was rotated to minimize
           thermal stress on the target from beam heating.
DETECTOR   (SISD,PGAC) Two silicon p-i-n detectors (mounted at
           ~27 degrees with respect to the incident beam)
           monitored the product of beam intensity and target
           thickness by detecting beam particles that were
           elastically scattered from the target. Parallel Plate
           Avalanche Counters (PPACs) were provided by Michigan
           State University.
METHOD     (ASPEC,ASEP,TOF) The beam energies at the center of
           the target were 306.7, 309.2, and 312.8 MeV. The BGS
           spatially separated the recoiling fusion evaporation
           residues (EVR's, E~70 MeV) in flight from both beam
           particles and transfer reaction products on the basis
           of their differing magnetic rigidities within the
           separator's 0.88-torr helium atmosphere. At the BGS
           focal plane, the EVR's were deposited into a
           300-microm thick passivated ion implanted silicon
           detector with an active area of 116 mm (horizontal) x
           58 mm (vertical). Two chains of time- and position-
           correlated events were observed. Each chain consisted
           of the implantation of an evaporation residue
           followed by the emission of alpha particles.
ANALYSIS   (PES) The cross sections were calculated assuming
           their values to be constant for all beam energies
           throughout the target thickness.
