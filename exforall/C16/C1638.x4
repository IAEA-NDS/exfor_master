FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Primary beam of 76Ge was accelerated to
           an energy of 130 MeV/nucleon by the Coupled Cyclotron
           Facility (CCF)
           (PRJFS,1USAMSU) Primary beam of 76Ge was fragmented
           in a 470-mg/cm2-thick 9Be target. Projectile fragments
           were separated in the A1900 fragment separator
SAMPLE     Secondary 9Be target located at the target position
           of the S800 spectrograph. The secondary reaction
           target thickness was 376 mg/cm2 for the 66Fe run and
           188 mg/cm2 for all other runs
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Prompt gamma-ray emission from excited
           reaction residues was measured with SeGA, an array
           of 32-fold segmented high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           detectors. The array was set up around the target in
           two rings with seven detectors at 37deg and nine
           detectors at 90deg relative to the beam axis.
           (MAGSP,IOCH,SCIN) Projectile-like residues produced
           from reactions in the secondary target were
           transported to the S800 focal plane, where they were
           identified event by event from the energy loss
           measured in an ionization chamber and the
           time-of-flight measured with plastic scintillators
           between the object position and the focal plane of
           the S800
METHOD     (COINC)Inclusive cross sections for two-proton
           knockout reactions were derived from the yields of
           projectile-like residues detected at the S800 focal
           plane and the number of incoming projectile ions,
           taking into account the thickness of the secondary
           target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty consisting of statistical
           uncertainty and systematic uncertainties arising from
           (ERR-1) particle identification 5%
           (ERR-2) stability and purity of the beam 5%
           (ERR-3) homogeneity of the target thickness 0.5%
           added in quadrature.
