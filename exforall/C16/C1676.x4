FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNIPC) Experiment was performed at RIKEN
           Accelerator Research Facility. Primary beam of 18-O
           was accelerated by a  cyclotron to 100 MeV/nucleon.
INC-SOURCE (KINDT)  The secondary beam of 15C was produced by
           fragmentation of 18-O on a 1.1 g/cm2 thick Be target.
           The secondary beam was separated using the RIPS
           fragment separator.
SAMPLE     224 mg/cm2-thick Pb target located at the focal point
           of the fragment separator.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,MWPC) Used for incident beam characterization.
           Energy of incident 15C ion was determined by time of
           flight using pair of plastic scintillation detectors.
           Trajectory of 15C ions was determined by four sets of
           multiwire proportional counters.
           (SCIN) Neutrons were detected by two layers of neutron
           hodoscope arrays with an effective area of
           2.14(W) x 0.92(H) m2 placed at 4.60 m and 4.99 m,
           respectively, downstream of the target. Each array
           consisted of 15 plastic scintillator rods with 6.1 cm
           thickness. The angular coverage ranged from -7.0deg to
           19.0deg in the horizontal direction, and from -5.5deg
           to 5.5deg in the vertical direction. The neutron
           momentum vector was determined from the time of flight
           and hit position information in the arrays.
           (MAGSP,DRFTC,SCIN) 14C ions were analyzed by a magnetic
           spectrometer equipped with a drift chamber and plastic
           scintillator hodoscopes. Particle identification was
           performed by combining dE, time of flight data from
           the hodoscopes, and magnetic rigidity information from
           the tracking of the particle.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) Experiment performed in inverse knematics
