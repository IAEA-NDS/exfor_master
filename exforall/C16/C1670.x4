FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK)Experiments were conducted at the
           Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) 88-Inch
           Cyclotron using the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS)
SAMPLE      (470+-60) mu-g/cm2-thick Pb targets (isotopic
           composition 98.4% 208Pb, 1.1% 207Pb, 0.5% 206Pb) on
           35 mu-m/cm2 natural C target backing.A 5 mu-g/cm2
           natural C layer covered the target material to
           prevent sputtering and enhance cooling. The nine
           arc-shaped targets were mounted on the periphery of
           a 14-inch-diameter wheel that rotated at approx. 7
           Hz to prevent excessive target heating.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SISD)Gas filled separator with silicon strip
           detectors in focal plane. Two p-i-n detectors located
           at +-27 deg were used to monitor luminosity and primary
           beam energy. Reaction product was identified by
           decay chain detected in a single strip.
METHOD     (ASEP)
ERR-ANALYS (+ERR-T) Total positive unsymetric uncertainty
           (-ERR-T) Total negative unsymetric uncertainty
HISTORY    (20090213C)
           (20120706U) SD: Small correction in SAMPLE.
