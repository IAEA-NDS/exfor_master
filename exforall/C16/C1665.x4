FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNIPC) experiment was performed at the RI
           Beam Factory operated by RIKEN Nishina Center.
           Secondary beams of 18C and 19C were produced via
           projectile fragmentation of a primary 22Ne beam at
           110 MeV/nucleon on a Be target. The secondary beams
           were purified by RIPS and transported to a cell of a
           cryogenic liquid hydrogen target, which is part of
           CRYPTA (cryogenic proton and alpha target system).
SAMPLE     Cryogenic liquid hydrogen target cell has two round
           3-cm-diameter beam windows, each sealed by a 6-mum
           thick Havar foil. The average thickness of the liquid
           hydrogen was 120 mg/cm2.
INC-SOURCE Incident ions were produced by projectile
           fragmentation and were identified by measurement
           of energy loss (dE) and time of flight
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWDC,SCIN) The outgoing charged fragments
           were analyzed by a large acceptance spectrometer
           equipped with a dipole magnet, two multiwire drift
           chambers located at the entrance and exit of the
           magnet, and a plastic scintillator hodoscope placed
           downstream of the second multi wire drift chamber.
           Particle identification of the outgoing charged
           fragment was performed by the d E and time of flight
           (NAICR) Gamma -ray detector array DALI was installed
           surrounding the liquid hydrogen target to detect
           prompt gamma rays emitted from the outgoing excited
           core fragments. In the present setup, 48 blocks of
           NaI(Tl) scintillators were employed.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) E-dE method was used for particle
           identification. Coincidence with gamma ray detector
           was required to determine the cross section
CORRECTION Correction of gamma ray energy for Doppler shift
           caused by high velocity of fragments (v/c = 0.3-0.4)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty originates mainly from
           uncertainty of gamma ray detection
