INSTITUTE  (1USACAL)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USACAL) California Institute of Technology 3-
           MeV electrostatic accelerator.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The NaI(Tl) crystals used were 1.5 inches in
           diameter by 1.5 inches long.
SAMPLE     (6-C-13,ENR=0.60) The two targets used were 7 and 16
           keV thick at 1.7 MeV and were composed of carbon,
           enriched to 60 percent C13, deposited on a tantalum
           backing.
METHOD     The gamma rays were produced by bombarding C13
           targets with protons. The protons were analyzed by
           either an electrostatic or a magnetic analyzer set to
           give an energy resolution of 0.1 to 0.2 percent. At
           each resonance, before observing the pulse-height
           spectrum, an excitation curve was run in order to
           obtain the maximum intensity and also to be sure that
           the observed radiation was characteristic of the
           resonance.
COMMENT    With the exception of the 8.90(1.47)- and 8.98(1.55)-
           MeV resonance levels and the recalculated reduced
           widths, the table is essentially Table III in
           reference C1645 (J,PR,85,197,1952). Consequently,
           only these two data points were compiled in order to
           avoid duplication.
