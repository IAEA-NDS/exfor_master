FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed at K500
           superconducting cyclotron, which delivered primary
           beam of 12C. Secondary beam 12N was produced by (p,n)
           reaction on cryogenic H2 gas cell, operated at 2.2 atm.
           The resulting 12N beam was separated by the Momentum
           Achromat Recoil Spectrometer (MARS) and had a purity
           of around 99.8% and a rate of around 2E+5 particles/s.
SAMPLE     Composite melamine target (C3H6N6) located at the
           final focal plane of MARS with of a thickness of
           1.58+-0.05 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Four modular dE-E telescopes
           5 x 5 cm2 in area, placed 182 mm downstream
           from the melamine target.The front dE detectors were
           16-strip position-sensitive silicon detectors,
           110 mu-m thick, telescopes 1 and 2, and 65 mu-m thick,
           telescopes 3 and 4). The back E-residual detectors
           had the same area coverage and were all 500 mu-m
           thick.

ANALYSIS   The astrophysical S factor and the reaction rate for
           the radiative proton capture  12N(p,g)13-O was
           obtained from the study of the 14N(12N,13-O)13C
           peripheral transfer reaction using the asymptotic
           normalization coefficient method.
