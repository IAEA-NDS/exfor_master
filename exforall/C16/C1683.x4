FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) SIS synchrotron with fragment
           separator FRS were used in experiment
SAMPLE     Au target with thickness of 2 g/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,CSICR) Particle identification after the
           Au target was performed by a calorimeter placed at
           0deg. It consisted of nine thin position sensitive
           Si detectors in front of four 6 cm thick CsI detectors.
           Opening angle of the array is +- 2.0 deg
           (HPGE,BAF2)Gamma rays were detected at different
           angles - 16deg, 33deg, and 36deg with the 15 HPGe
           clusters of the RISING array, at 51deg and and 88deg
           and with 7 HPGe segmented clusters of the Miniball
           array and at 88deg and 142deg with 8 BaF2 of the
           HECTOR array.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between single gamma ray detected
           in gamma array and 58Ni scattered at an angle <0.43deg
           to select Coulomb excitation
INC-SOURCE (KINDT)The 68Ni beam was produced from the
           fragmentation of 86Kr beam from SIS at GSI at 900
           MeV/nucleon with an intensity of 10.0E+10 particles
           per spill (6 sec duration, 10 sec repetition rate)
           and focused on a 4 g/cm2 thick 9Be target. The 68Ni
           ions were selected together with few other ions
           using the fragment separator FRS.
ANALYSIS   All detected gamma ray energies were corrected for
           Doppler shift on event by event basis using measured
           trajectories and velocity of 58Ni ions. The cross
           section values were deduced by measuring singles events
           in the calorimeter, not requiring gamma detection,
           and by computing the gamma detection efficiency of the
           array taking into account the gamma ray angular
           distributions as given by the Lorentz boost.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted uncertainty consists of statistical
           uncertainty and from Doppler shift correction
           uncertainty.
