FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The experiments were carried out
           at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
           88-Inch Cyclotron. The LBNL Advanced Electron
           Cyclotron Resonance source was used to produce a
           highly ionized (13+) 56Fe ion beam, which was
           accelerated by the cyclotron to an energy of 280 MeV.
SAMPLE     250 mu-g/cm2 thick metallic 208Pb (208Pb-98.4%,
           207Pb-1.1%, and 206Pb-0.5%) targets, which were
           evaporated on 40 mu-g/cm2 carbon backings
           and covered by a 5 mu-g/cm2 carbon layer.
           Incident energy of 276.4 MeV is the ion energy at the
           middle of the target.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,MWPC,SISD) Recoiling evaporation residues
           were separated in BGS. Upstream of the focal plane
           a multiwire proportional chamber allowed separation
           implantation events from radioactive decay events in
           focal plane Si strip detectors.
HISTORY    (20090406C) Compiled by S.H.
METHOD     Evaporation residues were implanted in the Si strip
           detector, located in the focal plane of the
           spectrometer. 263Hs evaporation residues were
           identified by series of alpha decays in Si strip
           detector, located close to the impact of
           evaporation residuum.
