TITLE      Production and Properties of C15

INSTITUTE  (1USAWIS,1USAIOW,3INDTAT)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USAWIS) The electrostatic generator.
SAMPLE     (6-C-14,ENR=0.288) Uniform thin C14 targets on 2500 A
           nickel backings were prepared in a discharge tube
           containing acetylene (enriched to 28.8% C14). C12
           targets were made in the same manner as the Cl4
           targets, both starting from BaCO3.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) A 1.75 in. diameter by 2 in. NaI(Tl)
           crystal was used for gamma detection and a 1% in.
           diameter by 2 in. plastic scintillator for beta
           detection.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB) Since only the C14 targets showed this
           2.25 sec. activity it was concluded that neither the
           C12 nor contaminants on the target were responsible
           for the activity. The identification of the 7.5 +-1.5
           sec activity is not quite as definite as that of the
           2.25 sec component. However, an examination of the
           half lives of nuclides shows that this activity is
           almost certainly N16.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The large uncertainties reflect the
           difficulty of subtracting this weak activity from the
           intense C16 activity.
