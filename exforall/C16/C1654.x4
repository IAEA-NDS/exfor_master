FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK)
           (SYNCY,1USABRK) Samples irradiated in 60-in. cyclotron
           and 184-in. synchrocyclotron
DETECTOR   (NAICR)activity measured with NaI(Tl) crystal
           connected to 100 channel pulse height analyzer
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated samples were dissolved in HCl and
           purified. After purification activity was determined

SAMPLE     About 10mg of Sc2O3 powder mixed with Duco cement
           and placed in platinum capsule for measurement
           at the cyclotron. Similar target was wrapped in
           Al foil with thickness of 2 mils for measurement at
           synchrocyclotron.
