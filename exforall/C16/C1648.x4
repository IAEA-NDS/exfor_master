SAMPLE     Scattering chamber filled with 4He (99.99% pure) up
           to a pressure of 0.85 atm, separated from the high
           vacuum of MARS by a 3 mum Havar foil.
DETECTOR   (SI)The reaction products were observed by a
           detector array which was composed of 4
           quadrant-silicon detectors (QSDs).
           QSD were mounted on a plane 90deg to the beam
           axis and 295 mm from the entrance window. The
           coordinates of the QSDs centers in the plane were
           x,y=(+-42.5,+-37.5)mm. Each QSD consisted of 4 square
           detectors (12.5 x 12.5 x 1 mm**3), and was followed
           by a large size veto detector to liminate events
           that passed through the QSD.
METHOD     Thick target inverse kinematic method
