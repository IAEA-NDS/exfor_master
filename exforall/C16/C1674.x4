SAMPLE     Deuterized polyethylene CD2 foil with thickness of
           1.66 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SISD,SI)The experimental setup used a hybrid
           ion chamber/silicon detector system with 5 x 5 cm
           active area, located 15.8 cm behind the secondary
           target, with its center blocked by a 1 cm2 square
           beam stopper. The silicon double surface strip
           detector (DSSD) with a segmentation of 16 x 16
           strips and a thickness of 491 mu-m was backed up by
           a second 5 x 5 cm unsegmented detector, which served
           as a veto against high-energy protons punching through
           the DSSD.
           (MCPLT) A microchannel plate detector located 2.7 m
           upstream of the final target position was used to
           suppress the majority of beam contaminants off-line
           through a time-of-flight measurement,
METHOD     (EDE) Inverse kinematics proton-transfer reaction
           25Al(d,n)26Si with 25Al beam and CD2 target was used
           to populate states of 26Si.
           (TOF) Time of flight allowed to achieve a beam purity
           of 67% in off line analysis.
INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 24Mg bombarded a gas-cell target
           containing D2 gas, creating the desired 25Al particles
           through the inverse kinematics 24Mg(d,n)25Al reaction.
           The resulting beam of 25Al at energy of 91.5 MeV  was
           selected to a purity of 20% using RESOLUT - a mass
           spectrometer with active beam cooling.
ANALYSIS   Resonance parameters of 26Si were determined using
           inverse kinematics reaction d(25Al,n)26Si
