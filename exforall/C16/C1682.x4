FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) A beam of 25Mg ions was accelerated
           by the UNILAC at the GSI to 7.45 MeV/nucleon
           and impinged on a rotating 248Cm target.
SAMPLE     The target consisted of three arc shaped segments
           with initial average thicknesses of 788 mu-g/cm2,
           743 mu-g/cm2 and 244 mu-g/cm2 of Cm with
           248Cm: 95.8%, 246Cm: 4.2%). One segment contained
           2% in weight of 152Gd (30% isotopic enrichment)
           for the simultaneous production of alpha decaying Os
           isotopes. Os is a chemical homolog of Hs.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Fast chemical separation was used. Products
           of the nuclear reactions recoiled from the target
           and were stopped and thermalized in a He/O2 mixture
           in the recoil chamber (RC), where they were  partially
           oxidized. Species volatile at room temperature were
           transported further through a PTFE (Teflon) capillary
           kept at ambient temperature to the detection system
           COMPACT, which is constructed as a thermochromatography
           column, formed by Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon
           diodes suitable for the detection of alpha particles
           and fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (SI) Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon  diodes.
