           system at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory of the
           University of Notre Dame.
INC-SOURCE Secondary 8Li beam was produced from
           a primary 7Li beam (30 MeV, 1 e mu-A) incident
           on a 12 mu-m thick 9Be target. Secondary 8Li beam
           was selected in flight by two solenoids that act as
           magnetic lenses to separate the reaction products from
           a primary 7Li beam. The two solenoids focused the
           8Li secondary beam onto a 9Be target. The 8Li beam had
           an average intensity of about 5.0E+5 particles per
           second  per 1 e mu-A of primary beam.
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 1.80 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) reaction products were detected
           by an two arrays of dE-E Si telescopes. The telescopes
           consisted of 20 to 25 mu-m Si dE detectors backed
           by 300 mu-m thick Si E detector.

COMMENT    The experimental setup and analysis made, allowed
           to separate various reaction channels. However, only
           cross section for single proton transfer is
           given below.
