FACILITY   (VDG,1USACAL) California Institute of Technology 3-
           MeV electrostatic accelerator.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The thallium-activated sodium iodide crystal
           is 0.040 inch.
SAMPLE     (6-C-13,ENR=0.61) The C13 targets used in the low
           energy work were prepared by cracking enriched methyl
           iodide on clean tantalum strips. Measurements made at
           the sharp 1.76-MeV resonance in C13 indicated that
           the thickness of the targets for protons was 20 keV
           at this energy.
METHOD     The yield can be determined by using the counter
           calibration, assuming the yield as known at 700 keV,
           by comparing the counter yield at the lower voltage
           with the counter yield at 700 keV. When the yield has
           been calculated the cross section can be found by
           using the method of Hall and Fowler.
