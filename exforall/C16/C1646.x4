DETECTOR   (TELES,HPGE,SI) In these two experiments, the emitted
           gamma-radiation and charged-particles were detected
           with the STARS-LIBERACE detector array, which consists
           of large area of segmented annular silicon detectors
            (dE-E telescope) and up to six HPGe Clover detectors.
           Five Clover germanium detectors were placed at
           16.5(+-0.5) cm from the target: two Clovers were
           located at 40., one at 90. and two at 140. degr.,
           relative to the beam direction.
           The charged-particle telescope was comprised of two
           Micron Semiconductor S2-type silicon detectors (22 mm
           active inner diameter and 70 mm active outer diameter):
           a 152 mum as dE detector and a 1003 mum as E detector

METHOD     (EDE) Charged particles identified by the E-dE
           telescope
           (COINC) For identification of reaction product  a
           coincidence between EdE telescope and gamma-ray
           array was required

COMMENT    From the article:' .. experiments were however not
           designed to extract absolute cross-sections in the
           first place and thus preliminary results do not include
           the absolute detection efficiency. In order to avoid
           difficulties in comparing the different yields we did
           so only when the different species where produced
           within the same particle gate. ..'

SAMPLE     11B powder enriched in 11B to 99.65% with thickness of
           450 mug/cm2 baked onto a 100 mum foil of 12C with
           thickness of 100 mum.
DETECTOR   (SI) Additionally, to detector system described in
           Subent 1 a 1001 mu-m E silicon detector was inserted.
           It was done in order to increase the solid angle
           covered by the telescope, described in Subent 1.
