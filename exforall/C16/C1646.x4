SAMPLE     11B powder enriched in 11B to 99.65% with thickness
           of 450 mug/cm2 baked onto a 100 mum foil of 12C with
           thickness of 100 mum.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) STARS-LIBERACE detector array which
           consists of large area of segmented annular silicon
           detectors. The charged-particle telescope was comprised
           of two Micron Semiconductor S2-type silicon detectors
           with 22 mm active inner diameter and 70 mm active
           outer diameter: a 152 mum as AE detector and a 1003 mum
           as E detector The AE detector was mounted 3.0(2) cm
           downstream from the target. The AE-E separation was
           3(1) mm.
           (HPGE) Array of six HPGe Clover detectors. Five Clover
           germanium detectors were placed at 16.5(5) cm from the
           target: two Clovers were located at 40 deg, one at 90
           deg and two at 140 deg, relative to the beam direction.
METHOD     (EDE) Charged particles identified by the E-dE
           telescope
           (COINC) For identification of reaction product  a
           coincidence between EdE telescope and gamma-ray
           array was required
