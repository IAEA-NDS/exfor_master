TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE CROSS SECTION 14N(N,P)14C FOR
            14.7 MEV NEUTRONS BY A MEASUREMENT OF THE ACTIVITY
            OF 14C-
FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT-WALTON TYPE ACCELERATOR (200 KEV) OF
            THE INSTITUT FUER RADIUMFORSCHUNG UND KERNPHYSIK OF
            THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE REACTION  T(D,N)4HE PRODUCES 14.7 MEV
            NEUTRONS IN A TRITIUM-TARGET,BLANKETED ON TITANIUM.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL NITROGEN AS UREA-COMPOUND (NH2CONH2) (15G).
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE ACTIVITY OF THE BETA-DECAY OF C14 TO N14
            WAS MEASURED AFTER IRRADIATION.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) LOW-LEVEL PROPORTIONAL COUNTER WAS USED
            (HOUTERMANS-OESCHGER TYPE TUBE).
           .SUPRESSION OF COSMIC RAY COMPONENT BY SHIELDING
            (24T IRON).
           .SUPRESSION OF MESON COMPONENT BY ANTICOINCIDENCE
            WITH A MULTI-WIRE SHIELDING COUNTER ASSEMBLY.
           .EFFICIENCY WAS DETERMINED BY USING OXALIC ACID
            STANDARD, SUPPLIED BY NBS(10.96+-0.03 COUNTS/MIN.).
MONITOR    .REACTION CROSS SECTION FOR 27AL(N,ALPHA)24NA.

            CALCULATIONS OF CROSS SECTION AND EXCITATION
            FUNCTION CARRIED OUT.REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE
            PRESENTED EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF THE CROSS SECTION.
STATUS     .14N(N,P)14C CROSS SECTION AT 14.7 MEV TAKEN FROM
