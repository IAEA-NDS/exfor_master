TITLE       Small-angle scattering of fast neutrons by Bi and Pb
REFERENCE  (J,NC/A,13,867,1973)
FACILITY   (VDG,2ITYPAD) Legnaro 5.5 MeV Van de Graaff with a
            2 micro-Amp 4.5 MeV proton beam at 1.5 ns pulse-width.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The Li(p,n) reaction was used in a lithium-
            fluoride-tantalum-backed target (1 mg/cm2 thick),to
            produce the 2.45 MeV neutrons.
SAMPLE     .The scatterers were 40mm long cylinders of natural
            isotopic composition.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight technique plus additional
            amplitude and pulse-shape discrimination.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two NE213 liquid scintillators (3.7cm in
            diameter and 4.2cm in length) on 56AVP
            photomultipliers.
           .For monitoring purposes were used-
           .A stilbene-crystal(1.3cm in length x 3.8cm diameter)
            on a 56AVP photomultiplier served as monitor for the
            neutron yield.
           (BF3) A BF3 counter in a plexiglas moderator was used,
            to monitor for beam stability.
MONITOR    .Absolute measurement, details see NC/A,13.
COMMENT    .The accuracy of the measured data was tested by
            measuring the n,p-scattering cross section under the
            same conditions.
           .Optical model calculations of the cross sections was
            carried out.Agreement is not very good.
CORRECTION .Multiple scattering up to second order.
           .Finite angular resolution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviations of the mean from several
            measurements, including statistical uncertainties.
