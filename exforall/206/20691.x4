           Same Maxwellian averaged cross sections given
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO) Kyoto University Research Reactor
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) D2O (1.4 m) and graphite (48 cm) thermal
            neutron column
INC-SPECT  Extremely close to pure Maxwellian distribution
DETECTOR   (GELI) 2 cc Ge(Li) counter
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Samples of known weight and the same
            number of Au samples (3 mm diam., 50 um thick) were
            fixed on a rotating plate, and irradiated for
            ~60 hours.
CORRECTION  Irradiation flux was corrected for self-shielding of
             thermal neutron flux due to the presence of Au foil
             (1% to 2%).
            Flux perturbations due to the Th and Pa samples were
             treated as negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Standard deviation in the results obtained
            from Th and Pa samples. (~2%)
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in detector efficiency (~2%)
           (ERR-3) Standard deviation of the thermal neutron
            fluxes (~1%)

SAMPLE     Mounted on thin Al foil after chemical purification.
           Quantity of 231Pa in each sample was obtained from the

            (T1/2=3.25E+4 years).
