TITLE       Evaluation of the g(Tn)-function and determination
            of cross sections for Eu-isotopes.
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) FRM-reactor by Munich
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Pneumatic positions,reflector and rotating
            disk facility.
SAMPLE     .Natural Eu2-O3 dissolved in HNO3. 20 mu-g Eu was
            dried on a small piece of high purity Al-foil packed
            and fixed at a definite position in an
            irradiation capsule.
           .For the standards Au-Al-alloy wire (Au, 0.132%) and
            Co-Al-alloy wire (Co, 0.564%) have been used.
            The Cd-capsule was a capilar form having the inner
            diameter 3 mm, the length 15 mm, and the thickness
            1 mm.

             analyzer.
ANALYSIS   .Because of the low energy resonances at 0.321 eV
            and 0.461 eV of Eu-151, the contribution of these
            resonances to the resonance integral (it is about
            80%) will be reduced when a cadmium filter
            is used (cadmium-cut-off-energy = 0.55 eV).
           .In order to measure the total resonance integral
            (from an energy greater than about 0.2 eV) a
            new method is developed (see ref. JIN,36(1974)1447)
            which is based on irradiations in two different
            neutron spectra with known neutron temperature
            and epithermal index.
           .The neutron temperature was measured using the
            neutron temperature detector Lu-176 (for these
            measurements see thesis DM-6909).
           .The epithermal component was measured using
            Au-197 and Co-59 as monitors.
           .The S0-factor (Westcott formalism) was calculated
            from the relation S0=(g2*(r1/r2)-g1)/(F1-(r1/r2)*F2)
            where r,g,F are the induced activity,the g-factor and
            the epithermal index of the irradiation positions
            1 and 2, respectively.
           .For comparison the cadmium method  has been also
            used.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
            Thermal cross section = 98.8+-0.3b,
            res.integral including the 1/V-part = 1551 +- 12b.
           (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,RI)
            Thermal cross section = 37.2 +-0.6b,
            res.integral including the 1/V-part = 71.1 +- 4.0 b.
COMMENT    .The g-factors of Eu-isotopes from 0 up to
            2000 deg. Celsius as well as a compilation of thermal
            cross sections and resonance integrals of
            Eu-isotopes are given.
CORRECTION .The spectrum of the irradiation positions has a
            known 1/E form.
           .Because of the thin samples no correction for self
            shielding and self absorption is needed.
