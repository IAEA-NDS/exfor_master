TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF THE RATIO OF THE CROSS SECTIONS OF
            235-U FOR CAPTURE AND FISSION IN THE NEUTRON ENERGY
            RANGE 200 EV TO 20 KEV-
FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT-WALTON-TYPE ACCELERATOR (150 KV,50
            MICROAMP AT A PULSELENGTH OF 0.5 MICROSEC AND
            625 PPS REPETITIONRATE) USED FOR MAIN EXPERIMENT.
           .THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR STARK OF THE INSTITUTE WAS
            USED FOR THE CALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) WITH THE REACTION 3H(D,N)4HE 14 MEV NEUTRONS
            WERE CREATED IN A TRITIUM-TITANIUM TARGET.
           (THCOL) THE THERMAL COLUMN OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
            REACTOR STARK OF THE INSTITUT FUER NEUTRONENPHYSIK
            UND REAKTORTECHIK (5 W CONSTANT POWER) SUPPLIED THE
            FLUX FOR THE CALIBRATION OF THE FISSION DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     .FOR THE SUM-MEASUREMENT U-235 FOILS (3.57,8.92,
            17.84X10E+20 ATOMS/CM2,93.5PC U-235) WERE PLACED AS
            ZYLINDERS AROUND THE PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.
           .SAMPLE AND DETECTOR FOR THE FISSION REACTION WERE
            ONE AND THE SAME.
METHOD     (SLODT) A SLOWING DOWN TIME SPECTROMETER IN THE FORM
            OF A PB-PILE(2X2X2M3,99.99PC PURITY) IN CONNECTION
            WITH THE COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR WAS USED TO
            CREATE A SLOW FLUX (200 EV TO 20 KEV).ENERGY-
            DETERMINATION WAS ACHIEVED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF
            THE SLOWING-DOWN-TIME.
           .DETAILED DESCRIPTION SEE REFERENCE.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A GAMMA-PROPORTIONAL COUNTER WAS USED TO
            MEASURE THE SUM OF FISSION AND CAPTURE EVENTS.
           .IT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE SAMPLES.
           .THE CYLINDRICAL COUNTER CONSISTED OF ALMG3 OF A
            THICKNESS OF 5.5MM WITH A TUNGSTEN ANODE (DIAMETER
            50 MICRON).IT WAS FILLED WITH 1.5 BAR ARGON AND
            0.02 BAR CO2.THE OUTER DIAMETER WAS 27MM, LENGTH
            370MM, HIGHEST OPERATING VOLTAGE 2500V.
           .THE EFFICIENCY WAS DETERMINED BY CALIBRATED GAMMA-
            SOURCES FROM THE RADIOCHEMICAL CENTRE,AMERSHAM,
            ENGLAND,AND WITH THE HELP OF A 24NA-SOURCE, CREATED
            BY IRRADIATION OF 23NA FROM THE THERMAL COLUMN OF
            THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR FR2.
           (FISCH) 2 FISSION CHAMBERS(U-235,ARGON) WERE USED, TO
            DETERMINE THE FISSION EVENT RATE.
           .CALIBRATION IN THE THERMAL FLUX OF STARK.
           .THERMAL FLUX FOR CALIBRATION MONITORED BY A U-235,
            ARGON-FILLED FISSION CHAMBER.
           .U-238 FISSION CHAMBER TO MONITOR THE TIME-DEPENDENT
            BEHAVIOUR OF NEUTRON PRODUCTION.
           .BF3-COUNTOR TO MONITOR THE FLUX IN THE VICINITY OF
            THE SAMPLE.
ANALYSIS   .AS NORMALIZING STANDARD FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE
            FISSION RATE (EFFICIENCY OF FISSION CHAMBER) A
            MEASUREMENT IN THERMAL REACTORFLUX WAS UNDERTAKEN
            AND THE NECESSARY THERMAL FISSION AND CAPTURE CROSS
            SECTIONS TAKEN FROM TABULATIONS (REF. NOT GIVEN).
           .ENERGY SPECTRUM DEDUCED FROM SLOWING DOWN TIME
            SPECTRUM.TIME AND SPACE DEPENDENT NEUTRON FLUX
            DETERMINED VIA INSTATIONARY ENERGY-DEPENDENT
            TRANSPORT THEORY, DIFFUSION THEORY AND FERMI-AGE
            THEORY.
           .THE NECESSARY CONSTANTS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY
            EITHER MONTE-CARLO CALCULATIONS OR EXPERIMENTALLY.
           .FOR DETAILS SEE REFERENCE.
PART-DET   (G    ) GAMMAS DETECTED BY PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS TO
            GIVE THE NUMBER OF FISSION AND CAPTURE EVENTS.
           (N    ) FISSION RATE WAS DETERMINED BY USE OF A
            NEUTRON DETECTING FISSION CHAMBER.
COMMENT    .SYSTEMATIC ERROR POSSIBLE,SINCE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED
            OUT UNDER THE ASSUMPTION, THAT THE MEAN PROMPT
            GAMMA-ENERGY PER FISSION IS INDEPENDENT OF THE
            NEUTRON-ENERGY.
