CORRECTION .BECAUSE OF THE THIN SAMPLE NO CORRECTION IS NEEDED
            FOR SELF-SHIELDING AND SELF-ABSORPTION.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) A 10 PERCENT SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY WAS ATTRIBU
            TO THE MEASURED ACTIVITIES, NOT HOWEVER INCLUDING ANY
            UNCERTAINTY FROM DECAY PARAMETERS OF EITHER REACTION
            PRODUCTS OF XENON OR THE MONITOR. THE STATISTICAL ERRO
            WAS NEGLIGIBLE.
