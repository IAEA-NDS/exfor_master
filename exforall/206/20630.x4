INC-SOURCE (REAC ) ISPRA 1 reactor.
            Irradiation in the graphite reflector for 2 hours.
SAMPLE     .High purity natural xenon.
            Samples contained 0.090% Xe-126 and 8.87%
            Xe-136 in silica ampoules at 1 atmosphere.

STATUS     (TABLE) .Taken from J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem.,27(1965)1175.
CORRECTION .Because of the thin sample no correction is needed
            for self-shielding and self-absorption.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) total uncertainty contains:
           (ERR-SYS) A 10% systematic uncertainty was attribute
            to the measured activities, not however including any
            uncertainty from decay parameters of either reaction
            products of xenon or the monitor.
           The statistical error was negligible.

DECAY-DATA (54-XE-127-G,36.4D,DG,377.,0.204) 377 keV gamma
            measured about 1 month after the irradiation. A small
            correction was made for the 173+204 keV sum peak under
            the 377 keV peak. The metastable state was assumed to
            decay 100% by internal transition.
