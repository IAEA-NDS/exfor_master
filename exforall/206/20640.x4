TITLE      -Absolute measurement of the neutron flux density
            in the a.E.R.E. Reactor  gleep .-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )Sample position of the a.E.R.E. Reactor gleep.
SAMPLE     .Foils with thickness less than 0.002 in.
           .The manganese foil contained 11 per cent nickel
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activity measurements of Au-198 and Mn-56,
            Cd-filter method.
           (COINC) For Mn-56 the absolute activity was
            determined by 4pi-beta-gamma coincidence technique.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4pi-beta gas flow proportional counter
           (NAICR) 1 in. * 1.5 in. NaI(Tl) crystal
ANALYSIS   .For calculation of the flux density and the  so-
            factor of Mn-55 the westcott-formalism has been used
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
            Thermal cross section=98.8 B, S0-
            factor = 17.3 (it amounts  to a resonance integral
            of 1558 B including the 1/V-contribution)
           .Assumed thermal cross section of manganese = 13.25B
           .Assumed g-factors for neutron temperature of 80 deg.,
            Mn-55 = 1.000 and Au-197 = 1.0086.
COMMENT    .The 4pi-beta-gamma coincidence technique is shown
            to be suitable for absolute measurement of Mn-56.
STATUS     .Taken from j.Nucl. Energy, 17(1963)125.
CORRECTION .For the efficiencies of beta and gamma-detectors,
            for gamma-gamma coincidences, for decay scheme, for
            internal conversion, for flux depression and for
            self-shielding effects.
           .For Au-197 an additional correction for the deviation
            of the cross section from the 1/V-law in maxwellian
            region (increase of the so-factor by 0.027).
ERR-ANALYS .For flux density standard error +- 3 per cent ,
            systematic error +- 1 per cent, accuracy of the mean
            flux density +- 2 per cent.
           .For the so-factor of Mn-55 no errors is given.
