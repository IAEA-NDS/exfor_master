TITLE      -ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON FLUX DENSITY
            IN THE A.E.R.E. REACTOR  GLEEP .-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )SAMPLE POSITION OF THE A.E.R.E. REACTOR GLEEP.
SAMPLE     .FOILS WITH THICKNESS LESS THAN 0.002 IN.
           .THE MANGANESE FOIL CONTAINED 11 PER CENT NICKEL
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF AU-198 AND MN-56,
            CD-FILTER METHOD.
           (COINC) FOR MN-56 THE ABSOLUTE ACTIVITY WAS
            DETERMINED BY 4PI-BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE TECHNIQUE.

ANALYSIS   .FOR CALCULATION OF THE FLUX DENSITY AND THE  SO-
            FACTOR OF MN-55 THE WESTCOTT-FORMALISM HAS BEEN USED

            THERMAL CROSS SECTION=98.8 B, S0-
            FACTOR = 17.3 (IT AMOUNTS  TO A RESONANCE INTEGRAL
            OF 1558 B INCLUDING THE 1/V-CONTRIBUTION)
           .ASSUMED THERMAL CROSS SECTION OF MANGANESE = 13.25B
           .ASSUMED G-FACTORS FOR NEUTRON TEMPERATURE OF 80 DEG.,
            MN-55 = 1.000 AND AU-197 = 1.0086.
COMMENT    .THE 4PI-BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE TECHNIQUE IS SHOWN
            TO BE SUITABLE FOR ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF MN-56.
