TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL OF MN-55.-
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) PU-BE SOURCE.
SAMPLE     .MANGANESE SULPHATE SOLUTION.
METHOD     (ACTIV) MANGANESE BATH TECHNIQUE, CADMIUM RATIOS.
            THE PRINCIPLE OF THE METHOD HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY
            DE JUREN AND CHIN,J.RES.NAT.BUR.STAND.,55(1963)311.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) THE MN-56 ACTIVITY WAS COUNTED WITH AN ANTI-
            COINCIDENCE SHIELDED G.M.COUNTER.
ANALYSIS   .IN CURVES THE PRODUCT I*R**2 AS FUNCTION OF R FOR
            IRRADIATION WITH AND WITHOUT CD-FILTER IS SHOWN
            (I IS THE COUNTING RATE PER MILLIGRAM OF MANGANESE,
             R IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND THE CENTRE
             OF THE SOURCE.
           .INTEGRATIONS OF THE CURVES WITH AND WITHOUT CD-
            FILTER GIVE A CADMIUM RATIO OF 28+-2.5.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) AVERAGE SCATTERING CROSS SECTIO
            TAKEN AS 20.0 B AT 337 EV, THE PRINCIPAL RESONANCE ENE
            IN MANGANESE.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM1,1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN AS 0.332
           (ASSUM2,16-S-0(N,G),,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN AS 0.52 B.
           (ASSUM3,25-MN-55(N,G)25-MN-56,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE 13.2 B.
