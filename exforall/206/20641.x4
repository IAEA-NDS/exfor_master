AUTHOR     (P.W.F.Louwrier,A.H.W.Aten Jr.)
TITLE      -Determination of the resonance integral of Mn-55.-
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Pu-Be source.
SAMPLE     .Manganese sulphate solution.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Manganese bath technique, cadmium ratios.
            The principle of the method has been described by
            de juren and chin,j.Res.Nat.Bur.Stand.,55(1963)311.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The Mn-56 activity was counted with an anti-
            coincidence shielded g.M.Counter.
ANALYSIS   .In curves the product I*r**2 as function of r for
            irradiation with and without Cd-filter is shown
            (I is the counting rate per milligram of manganese,
             r is the distance between the sample and the centre
             of the source.
           .Integrations of the curves with and without Cd-
            filter give a cadmium ratio of 28+-2.5.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) Average scattering cross sectio
            taken as 20.0 B at 337 eV, the principal resonance ene
            in manganese.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM1,1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG,,MXW) Value taken as 0.332
           (ASSUM2,16-S-0(N,G),,SIG,,MXW) Value taken as 0.52 B.
           (ASSUM3,25-MN-55(N,G)25-MN-56,,SIG,,MXW) Value 13.2 B.
STATUS     .Taken from j.Nucl energy,19(1965)267.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The given error is the standard deviation.
