TITLE       Determination of the resonance integral of Mn-55.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) The Pu-Be source was placed in a Perspex tube,
           external diameter 50 mm.
SAMPLE     The manganese foils weighed 6.31, 4.35 and 1.85 mg/cm2,
           produced by evaporating manganese metal on aluminum
           disks of 0.05 mm thickness and 19 mm diameter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Manganese bath technique, cadmium ratios.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The Mn-56 activity was counted with an anti-
            coincidence shielded G.M.Counter.
ANALYSIS   .In curves the product I*r**2 as function of r for
            irradiation with and without Cd-filter is shown
            (I is the counting rate per milligram of manganese,
             r is the distance between the sample and the centre
             of the source.
           .Integrations of the curves with and without Cd-
            filter give a cadmium ratio of 28+-2.5.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) Average scattering cross sect.
            taken as 20.0 B at 337 eV, the principal resonance ene
            in manganese.
