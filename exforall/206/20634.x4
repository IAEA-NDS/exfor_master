TITLE      -THE THERMAL CROSS SECTION AND THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL
            OF PA-231.ACTIVATION DETERMINATION WITHOUT USING
            A CD-FILTER-.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) PNEUMATIC POSITIONS,REFLECTOR AND ROTATING
            DISK FACILITY OF FRM-REACTOR IN MUNICH.
SAMPLE     .FROM A STOCK SOLUTION OF PA-231 IN 0.05 N HF (AFTER
            PURIFICATION WITH ANION EXCHANGE) AN ALIQUOT
            CONTAINING ABOUT 1 MG PA-231 IS DRIED ON A SMALL
            PIECE OF PURE AL-FOIL.
           .FOR THE STANDARDS AU-AL-ALLOY WIRE (AU, 0.132 PER
            CENT) AND CO-AL-ALLOY WIRE (CO, 0.564 PER CENT)
            HAVE BEEN USED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
           .DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW METHOD WITHOUT USING A CADMIUM
            FILTER (SEE ANALYSIS).
           .CADMIUM FILTER MEASUREMENTS,WESTCOTT FORMALISM.
DETECTOR   (GELI )GE(LI)-DETECTORS COUPLED TO A ND4420 ANALYSER.
           (SCIN ) THE ALPHA ACTIVITY OF PA-231 AND U-232 WAS
            MEASURED WITH A HOME-MADE LIQUID SCINTILLATION
            COUNTER.
ANALYSIS   .BECAUSE OF THE LOW ENERGY RESONANCES AT 0.396 EV AND
            0.494 EV OF PA-231, THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE RESO-
            NANCES TO THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL (IT IS ABOUT 76
            PER CENT) WILL BE REDUCED WHEN A CADMIUM FILTER IS
            USED (CADMIUM-CUT-OFF-ENERGY = 0.55 EV).
           .IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE TOTAL RESONANCE INTEGRAL
            (FROM AN ENERGY GREATER THAN ABOUT 0.2 EV) A
            NEW METHOD IS DEVELOPED WHICH IS BASED ON IRRADIA-
            TIONS IN TWO DIFFERENT NEUTRON SPECTRA WITH KNOWN
            NEUTRON TEMPERATURE AND EPITHERMAL INDEX.
           .THE NEUTRON TEMPERATURE WAS MEASURED USING THE
            NEUTRON TEMPERATURE DETECTOR LU-176 (FOR THESE
            MEASUREMENTS SEE THESIS DM-6909).
           .THE EPITHERMAL COMPONENT WAS MEASURED USING
            AU-197 AND CO-59 AS MONITORS.
           .THE S0-FACTOR (WESTCOTT FORMALISM) WAS CALCULATED
            FROM THE RELATION S0=(G2*(R1/R2)-G1)/(F1-(R1-R2)*F2)
            WHERE R,G,F ARE THE INDUCED ACTIV. (EITHER OF PA-232
            OR OF U-232),THE G-FACTOR AND THE EPITHERMAL INDEX
            OF THE IRRADIATION POSITIONS 1 AND 2,RESPECTIVELY.
           .THE G-FACTORS ARE REPORTED IN REF. RCA,22(1975),128.
           .FOR COMPARISON  THE CADMIUM METHOD  HAS BEEN ALSO
            USED.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
            THERMAL CROSS SECTION = 98.8+-0.3B,
            RES.INTEGRAL INCLUDING THE 1/V-PART = 1551 +-12B.

COMMENT    .NEW METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF THERMAL CROSS SECTION
            AND RES. INTEGRAL OF NUCLIDES WHOSE DIFFERENTIAL
            CROSS SECTIONS DO  NOT OBEY  THE 1/V-LAW BELOW

           .A COMPILATION  OF THE THERMAL CROSS SECTIONS AND
            RESONANCE INTEGRALS OF PA-231 IS ALSO GIVEN.

CORRECTION .THE SPECTRUM OF THE IRRADIATION POSITIONS HAS A
            KNOWN 1/E FORM.
           .BECAUSE OF THE THIN SAMPLES NO CORRECTION FOR
            SELF SHIELDING AND SELF ABSORPTION IS NEEDED.
ERR-ANALYS .THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE G-FACTORS OF PA-231 (ABOUT
            +-2 PER CENT) AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF EPITHERMAL
            INDICES CONTRIBUTE TO THE THERMAL CROSS SECTION
            THE MAXIMUM DEVIATIONS OF 4.1 PER CENT  AND 6.0
            PER CENT,RESPECTIVELY.
           .THE ALPHA MEASUREMENTS WITH THE SCINTILLATION COUNTER
            HAVE AN ACCURACY OF +- 2 PER CENT.
           .THE HALF LIFE OF PA-232 AND THE INTENSITIES OF THE
            MEASURED GAMMA RAYS ARE KNOWN WITH GOOD ACCURACY.
           .STANDARD DEVIATION.
           .UNCERTAINTIES IN THE THERMAL CROSS SECTIONS AND
            RESONANCE INTEGRALS OF THE STANDARDS.
