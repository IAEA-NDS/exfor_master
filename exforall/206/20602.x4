TITLE      -Neutron total cross sections at 18.8 eV-.
FACILITY   (REAC) FRM Research Reactor, Munich.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor.Thin tungsten resonance scatterer near
            reactor core. Cadmium filter.
INC-SPECT  -Energy selection by three resonance scattering in
            tungsten foils. Nearly monoenergetic. Upper bound of
            0.5% for spectral contribution of off-resonance
            neutrons. Total contribution due to double scattering
            from further eV resonances in tungsten (mainly 21.2 eV
            and 46.2 eV) was estimated to less 3%.
SAMPLE     -Metal except fluorine.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission.
           (FNB) Tungsten resonance technique. Tungsten filter
            difference technique.
DETECTOR    No details.
CORRECTION -Corrections for sample impurities.
           -Free scattering x-sections corrected for capture
            x-sections derived from thermal values with
            assumed 1/v dependence, and for the effects of
            nearby resonances.
           -Coherent scattering amplitudes are given after
            correction for incoherent scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Counting statistical uncertainty, errors in
            the sample dimensions and impurities.
