TITLE      -A MEASUREMENT OF THE MANGANESE ACTIVATION RESONANCE
            INTEGRAL USING THE MANGANESE BATH TECHNIQUE.-
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) 1 C SB-BE SOURCE,STRENGTH = 2.0E+6 N/SEC
METHOD     (ACTIV) MANGANESE BATH TECHNIQUE,THE SOURCE WAS
            MOUNTED IN A 9-CM DIAMETER SPHERICAL POLYSTYRENE
            CAVITY OF WALL THICKNESS 1 MM,AT THE CENTRE OF A 50-
            CM DIAMETER SPHERICAL BATH,CONTAINING DILUTE MANGA-
            NESE SULPHATE SOLUTION WITH VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF BORON
            IN FORM OF AMMONIUM HYDROGEN TETRABORATE .
DETECTOR   .SATURATE MN-56 ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED AS DESCRIBED
            BY AXTON ET AL IN REFERENCE JNE,19(1965)409.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) AVERAGE CROSS SECTION TAKEN AS
            20 B AT 337 EV, THE PRINCIPAL RESONANCE ENERGY IN MN.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM1,1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN AS 0.332
           (ASSUM2,16-S-0(N,G),,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN AS 0.52 B.
           (ASSUM3,25-MN-55(N,G)25-MN-56,,SIG,,MXW) VALUE 13.25 B.
           (ASSUM4,5-B-0(N,ABS),,SIG,,MXW) VALUE TAKEN AS 759 B.
COMMENT    .NEW METHOD FOR MEASURING OF RESONANCE INTEGRAL OF
            MANGANESE.
