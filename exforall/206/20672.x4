TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE 237NP(N,2N)236NP CROSS SECTION
            AT 15 MEV NEUTRON ENERGY-
FACILITY   (VDG  ) TYPE K 3000 VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR OF THE
            GESELLSCHAFT FUER STRAHLEN-UND UMWELTFORSCHUNG,
            NEUHERBERG.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE ACCELERATED DEUTERON BEAM OF THE VAN DE
            GRAAFF BOMBARDED A TRITIUM TARGET TO PRODUCE 15 MEV
            NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .THE 237-NP CONTAINED 236-PU,THE ACTIVITY OF WHICH
            WAS LESS THEN 1PC OF THE RESULTANT ACTIVITY OF THE
            PU-236, PRODUCED AFTER IRRADIATION.
           .THE SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED AS NPO2 IN A POLYETHYLENE
            CAPSULE SURROUNDED BY CD.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) TWO INDEPENDENT METHODS WERE EMPLOYED.
           .THE DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF GAMMA RAYS FOLLOWING
            ELECTRON CAPTURE OF 236-NP TO 236-U.
           .THE MEASUREMENT OF ALPHA PARTICLES OF THE 236-PU
            (FROM BETA-DECAY OF 236-NP) AFTER CHEMICAL
            SEPARATION.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE GE(LI) WAS USED IN THE GAMMA MEASUREMENT.
           (SOLST) A SI SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR WAS USED FOR
            ALPHA COUNTING.
MONITOR           .THE REACTION 27AL(N,ALPHA)24NA WAS USED
            AS A NORMALIZING STANDARD FOR THE INCIDENT FLUX.
             SEE H.VONACH ET AL.,Z.PHYS.,237,155(1970),THE DECAY
            -GAMMAS OF THE 24-NA WERE MEASURED BY A GE(LI)
            DETECTOR (FLUX-6.77+-0.24X10E+13 NEUTRONS PER CM2).
           .A SECOND STANDARD WAS PROVIDED BY THE DETERMINATION
            OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE FISSION PRODUCT 97-ZR.
             FLUX-6.40+-0.73X10E+13 NEUTRONS PER CM2.

           .THE STATISTICAL ERROR FOR ALPHA-COUNTING DID NOT
            EXCEED 1.4PC.

HALF-LIFE  (HL,93-NP-236-M1) ONLY THE NP-236 ISOMER WITH A
            HALFLIFE OF 22H WAS CONSIDERED IN THIS EXPERIMENT.

COMMENT    .THE QUOTED DATA REPRESENT, WHAT THE AUTHORS CALL
            THEIR BEST CHOICE OUT OF FOUR DIFFERENT
            DETERMINATIONS(2 DIFFERENT DECAY REACTIONS(SEE
            METHOD) AND 2 DIFFERENT STANDARDS (SEE STANDARD).
           .THE ONE PRESENTED IS DERIVED FROM THE ALPHA-COUNTING
            METHOD IN CONNECTION WITH THE 27AL-STANDARD.
