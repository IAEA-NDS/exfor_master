TITLE      -(N,2N) CROSS SECTIONS FOR NP-237-
FACILITY   (VDG  )  FOR 9.6-MEV NEUTRONS KYOTO UNIVERSITY VAN
            DE GRAAFF WITH A 2.8-MEV HE-3 BEAM WAS USED.
           (CCW  )  FOR 14.2-MEV NEUTRONS A DEUTERON BEAM
            GENERATED IN A COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR WAS
            USED.
INC-SOURCE .FOR 9.6-MEV NEUTRONS, BE-9(HE-3,N)C-11 REACTION IN
            A THICK BERYLIUM TARGET WAS USED.
           .FOR 14.2-MEV NEUTRONS H-3(D,N)HE-4 REACTION WAS
            USED.
SAMPLE     .NEPTUNIUM SAMPLE PURIFIED CHEMICALY FROM
            CONTAMINATING PLUTONIUM AND CONVERTED TO OXIDE.
           .THICKNESS 30 TO 80 MG/CM2.
           .IRRADIATION TIME = 48 TO 70 HOURS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  ACTIVATION OF PU-236.
           .ALPHA-ACTIVITY RATIO OF PU-236/NP-237 WAS MEASURED
            WITH A TWO-STEP MEASUREMENT ADDING A KNOWN AMOUNT
            OF PU-238 OR PU-239 TO THE IRRADIATED NP SAMPLE,
            THE ALPHA-ACTIVITY RATIO OF (PU-238 OR PU-239)/NP-
            237 AND OF PU-236/(PU-238 OR PU-239).
DETECTOR   .NO DETAILS GIVEN ABOUT DETECTION OF ALPHA PARTICLES.
MONITOR    .NEUTRON FLUX MONITORED USING THRESHOLD DETECTORS
            WITH AU-197(N,2N), TL-203(N,2N), U-238(N,2N)
            REACTIONS.
