INC-SOURCE (REAC)
SAMPLE      Disks of dilute alloys with aluminium.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI (Tl)-crystal.
ANALYSIS    Cadmium ratio measurements (thickness of Cd-capsule
            1 mm, Cd-cut-off-energy 0.55 eV).
            The 1/E-dependence was checked with measurements of
            the resonance integral of Co-59.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI)
            cross section=98.8 b,res.
            Integral = 1535 b, g-factor (temper.= 20 C) = 1.005
            assumed values for thermal cross sections,Mn-55 =
            13.3 b, Sb-121 = 6.3 b, Sb-123 = 4.0 b, La-139 =
            8.7 b and In-115 = 160 b.
            Assumed values for g-factors(temper.= 20 C), In-115=
            1.019 and for all others nuclides = 1.
CORRECTION  For the deviation of the cross section of In-115
            from the 1/V-law in Maxwellian region (between
            0.12 eV and 0.55 eV)
            Resonance self-shielding for gold and indium alloys.

           (DATA-ERR2) The overall error includes errors in the
           thermal cross-sections of manganese and gold and in
           the resonance integral of gold and those due to the
           deviation of the neutron spectrum from the 1/E shape
            (0.4 b) and to the uncertainty in the knowledge of
           the cadmium cut-off energy (0.4 b)
