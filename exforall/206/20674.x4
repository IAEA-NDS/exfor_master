TITLE      -TWO-QUANTUM RADIATIVE THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE
            IN H-1.-
FACILITY   (REAC ) REACTOR FRJ-2 (DIDO) OF THE KERNFORSCHUNGS-
            ANLAGE JUELICH.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS BI-FILTERED WITH A
            FLUX OF 2*E+8 NEUTRONS/CM2*SEC.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN FLUX.
SAMPLE     .1.5G DISTILLED WATER IN A THIN LUCITE CONTAINER,
            PLACED INSIDE A CYLINDRICAL SHIELD OF 6LID (7 MM
            THICK).
METHOD     (COINC) GAMMA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE MEASUREMENT WITH
            CONVENTIONAL FAST-SLOW COINCIDENCE EQUIPMENT.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GE(LI) DETECTORS OF 59CM3 AND 62CM3
            ,FWHM=2.3KEV AND 2.7KEV AT 1.33MEV,RESP., WERE USED
            IN THE FIRST MEASUREMENT, WHEREAS TWO GE(LI) DETECTORS
            OF 120 AND 127 CM3 RESPECTIVLY WERE USED IN THE THIRD
            AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS.
           (NAICR) TWO NAI(TL) SCINTILLATORS, 10.2 CM TIMES 10.2
            CM AND 7.6 CM TIMES 7.6 CM, WERE USED IN THE SECOND
            MEASUREMENT.
           .LEAD SHIELDING BETWEEN THE DETECTORS TO SURPRESS
            CROSSTALK.
ANALYSIS   .FOR ANALYSIS OF COINCIDENCE MATRIX SEE REFERENCE.
COMMENT    .FOUR EXPERIMENTS WERE DONE AND THE DATA GIVEN HERE
            ARE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THE RESULTS, FOR MORE
            DETAILS SEE MAIN REFERENCE.

           (830111E)
CORRECTION .SUBTRACTION OF RANDOM COINCIDENCES,CONTINUOUS
            BACKGROUND DUE TO COMPTON EVENTS (FROM HIGH ENERGY
            GAMMA-RAY CASCADES FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL
            ENVIRONMENT).
           .CORRECTION ALSO FOR FULL ENERGY PEAK EFFICIENCY AND
            SOLID ANGLE.
ERR-ANALYS .THE ERRORS QUOTED ARE THE SINGLE STANDARD DEVIATIONS.
