TITLE      -NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS-SECTIONS.-
FACILITY   (LINAC) HARWELL LINEAR ACCELERATOR.
SAMPLE     .IRON AND STAINLESS STEEL.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT SPECTROMETER.
DETECTOR   (MOXR ) MOXON-RAE NEUTRON CAPTURE DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS   .THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS OF IRON FROM 0.02 EV TO
            200 EV HAVE BEEN MEASURED AND ARE SHOWN IN CURVES.
           .FROM THE RESONANCES THE NON 1/V-PART OF THE
            RESONANCE INTEGRAL IS CALCULATED.
COMMENT    .SUGGESTION THAT TWO SMALL RESONANCES AT 5.75 EV
            AND 14.0 EV MAY BE DUE TO IRON.
STATUS     .TAKEN FROM NUCLEAR PHYSICS DIVISION PROGRESS REPORT,
            HARWELL,AERE-PR/NP-14 (1968)P.11.
