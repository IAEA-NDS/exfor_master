DETECTOR   (PROPC,NAICR) The gross amount of activity on the
           foil was determined using windowless flow-
           proportional counting (for betas) and NaI
           scintillation counting (for gammas).
METHOD     (REC) Relative excitation functions were measured for
           Th-232 fissioned by protons by a recoil catching
           technique.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
STATUS     (CURVE) Fig. 1, page 2150.
HISTORY    (20140207A) Part of the points (the junction counter
           data) were moved to new  subentry 6.

SAMPLE     Uranium tetrafluoride vaporized onto thin
           (0.00025 in.) aluminum foil. Their thickness ranged
           from 40 to 200 microg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) p,n junction counters used for fission
           fragment counting.
METHOD     (FISCT,RCHEM) Solid-state p,n junction counters were
           used for fission fragment counting during bombardment
           to measure relative-excitation functions for U-238
           fission by protons and deuterons. Cross
           sections calculated from measured fission product
           yields at 9.25 and 11.45 MeV. Relative data
           normalized at these points.
