           (R,YFI-14,6,1972)  abstract,data given.
DETECTOR   (GLASD)  Glass detector for fission fragments .
            20 mm diameter, located at 12 mm from Th layer.
            Fragment registration efficiency 90%.
           (PROPC) Counter for neutron detection. Sensitivity on
           neutron energy was known.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T,D-D)
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSKUR)    Electrostatic accelerator
CORRECTION  Corrections were made on the neutron distribution
            difference in the sample and neutron detector and
            on the neutron counter walls shielding - 3% .
            Background due to scattered neutrons was measured to
            be 7% of the total count.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors are not specified.
           (ERR-T)    Total error of the absolute value

REACTION   (90-TH-228(N,F),,SIG)
SAMPLE     Th-228 layer of 6 mm diameter, placed at 8 mm from
           neutron source. Amount of Th-228 was determined by
           2.6-MeV gamma-ray yield from Tl-206 (decay product of
           Th-228) to be about 16.5 microg at the beginning of
           measurement.
