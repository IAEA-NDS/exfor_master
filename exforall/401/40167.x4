TITLE      THE  MEASUREMENT  OF  TOTAL  CROSS  SECTION  IN  THE
           RESONANCE  RANGE  OF  ENERGY
FACILITY   (LINAC)    LINEAR  ACCELERATOR  OF  ELECTRONS
SAMPLE                THE SAMPLE DIAMETER 70 MM AND THICKNESS
                      0.045046 ATOM/B.  CAPTURE  SAMPLE  WAS
                      SB-123.
METHOD     (TOF)      TIME-OF-FLIGHT  METHOD, FLIGHT  PATH  37 M.
                      THE  TOTAL  CROSS  SECTIONS  OF  LEAD  WERE
                      OBTAINED  USING  THE  CAPTURE  REACTION  BY
                      MEANS  OF  SB-123-RESONANCE  IN  ENERGY
                      RANGE  WHICH  RESONANCE  STRUCTURE  FOR
                      LEAD  IS  ABSENT.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    TWO  SODIUM-IODIDE  CRYSTAL  200 MM  IN
                      DIAMETER  WERE  SHIELDED  BY  BORON-10.
