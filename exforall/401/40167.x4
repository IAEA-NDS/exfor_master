TITLE      The measurement of lead total cross section in the
           resonance energy range

INSTITUTE  (4RUSKUR)
FACILITY   (LINAC)    Linear accelerator of electrons
SAMPLE     Pb sample diameter 70 mm and thickness 0.045046 atom/b;
           admixtures < 4.E-4 %.
           Capture sample was Sb-123.
METHOD     (TOF)      Flight path 37 m.
            The total cross section of lead was obtained using the
            capture reaction by means of Sb-123-resonance in
            energy range where resonance structure for lead is
            absent.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) crystals of 200 mm in diameter
           were shielded by boron-10.

COMMENT     Background value is in present measurements much
           smaller than in one with unresonance detector.
STATUS     (PRELM)    Data labelled by authors as preliminary.
                      Data will be defined more precisely.
CORRECTION  Corrected on background with great degree of accuracy
