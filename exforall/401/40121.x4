STATUS     (TABLE)  Data from AE,33,(3),782,1972
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI) Electrostatic accelerator with the
                         maximum of energy 5 MeV
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      T(p,n)He-3 reaction
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux was monitored by ionization chamber with
           U-235 layer.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
PART-DET   (G)        Gammas
DETECTOR   (GELI) Germanium-lithium detector for induced activity
            U-239 74-keV gamma-line was measured.
           Recording range of gamma-spectrometer and the
           resolution of spectrometer were checked at measurement
           with the gamma-spectrum of Tm-170.
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber for neutron flux.
ANALYSIS   For energies above U-238 fission threshold the U-238
           fission products were removed by chemical purification
           before measurement of induced activity.
CORRECTION Correction for fluctuation of neutron number
           background of neutrons scattered in target chamber
           was less than 1%
           Neutrons emitting from molybdenum backing made
           following contributions in counting rate of
           fission chamber 30-50%, in induced activity of
           the sample 60-80%.
           Correction for inelastic scattering of neutrons
           on the construction materials and for admixture
           of other fissile  nuclei was 5-8% calculating
           with accuracy 15%
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean-square error of experiment.
           Errors of introduced corrections are taken
                     into account.
           Errors of fission cross-section of U-235 and capture
           cross-section of U-238 were not taken into account
           (EN-ERR)  Sources of this error were accelerator
                      beam attenuation and dependence of neutron
                      energy upon the angle of incidence.
