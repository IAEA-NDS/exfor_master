TITLE      Gamma-ray spectrum from reaction Fe-58(N,G)Fe-59
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Tangent channel of reactor.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron beam of 1.5E+7 n/cm**2/sec at cadmium
            ratio > 50 ( for Mn) .
SAMPLE     2.1 grams of Fe(2)O(3) with isotopic composition =
                      Fe-isotope Abundance(in % )
                      26-Fe-54   2.0
                      26-Fe-56   31.5
                      26-Fe-57   2.4
                      26-Fe-58   64.1
           Also natural Fe sample was used.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Germanium-lithium detector with sensitive
           volume 3 cm**3 . Detector resolution  10 kev at 1 MeV
           gamma-energy, 30 keV at 6 MeV gamma-energy.
           Energy calibration and absolute  efficiency were
           determined by standard sources with accuracy 5%.
PART-DET   (G)        Gammas
MONITOR               Sources of known activity .
                      (accuracy less 5 % )
           Gamma-ray of reactions CL-36(N,G),S-33(N,G),SI-29(N,G)
                      were used.
ERR-ANALYS Energy error of gamma-ray was 3-6 keV.
