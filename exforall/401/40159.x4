TITLE      Mean kinetic energies and angular distributions
           of fission fragments from Pu-238 and Pu-239
METHOD     (FISCT) Direct counting of fission fragments using
           glass detectors
SAMPLE     1. The double target 11 mm in diameter had 150 mu-g of
           Pu-238 on one side and the same amount of Pu-239 on
           the other. Pu-238 targets contained 14.4% Pu-239.
           2. Pu-238 targets contained only 0.3% Pu-239;
           Samples contained 40 mu-g/cm2 of each isotope.
MONITOR     Kinetic energies used for calibration:
            - for spon.fission:
           (98-CF-252(0,F),,AKE,LF)  104. MeV
           (98-CF-252(0,F),,AKE,HF)  79.5 MeV
            - for thermal neutrons fission:
           (92-U-235(N,F),,AKE,LF)   100. MeV
           (92-U-235(N,F),,AKE,HF)   68.5 MeV
            - for reactor neutron fission:
           (94-PU-239(N,F),,AKE,LF) 100. MeV
           (94-PU-239(N,F),,AKE,LF) 73. MeV
DETECTOR   (GLASD)
           1. The 10 x 18 mm detectors were placed on a circle of
           radius 52 mm, eight for each isotope. In front of the
           ring of detectors was a ring bearing 1.5 mg/cm2 Al
           filters, which do not absorb the fragments. The entire
           system was enclosed in a cadmium case.
           2. detectors with 1.85 mg/cm2 Al filters, which were
           sensitive to the shape of the fragment mass
           distribution. Each glass detector had a space free
           from filters that was used to monitor the etching .
           Detector efficiency was calibrated by fragments from
           spontaneous (Cf-252) and thermal-neutron ( U-235)
           fission.
COMMENT    The coefficient of angular anisotropy of fission
           fragments is presented only for Pu-238
