MONITOR      Gamma-rays of background from reaction H(n,gamma)D
            to define gamma energies.
FACILITY   (REAC,3IRQNRI)  Reactor IRT
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)    Thermal column.
METHOD     Direct detection. Spectra were measured in intervals
            600-8000 keV and 30-900 keV . Measurement time 24-36hr
DETECTOR   (GELI)     Germanium-lithium detector with sensible
           volume 10 cm**3 was situated on distance 15cm from
           sample.
           Resolution of detector was 3.5keV at 1 MeV and
           8 keV at 7 MeV.
ANALYSIS    Gamma intensities were obtained using the relation:
           sum(Igamma*Ei)=Bn, were Ei - i-th gamma energy,
           Bn - neutron binding energy.
           It's valid, if all lines were taken into account -
           values of Igamma are somewhat overestimated, not more
           than 12% (checked intensity balance through each level
           and each horizontal section of gamma-transition scheme)
CORRECTION Graphite was used to measure background due to the
           scattering of fast and  thermal neutrons by sample.
           ~ 30 % of total number of counts was due to background.
ADD-RES       Gamma transition schemes for Si-31 and S-35.
