TITLE      Strength functions of U-235 and Pu-239 for S and P
           neutrons .
ANALYSIS   (SLA) Single  level  analysis.  In  energy  region less
                than  50 keV  (fission width + gamma width  much
                larger  than neutron width) reaction  cross
                section calculated by Breit-Wigner formula and
                and compared with sum measured averaged fission
                and  capture  cross  sections.
             Partial wave  analysis. Neutron partial wave
                contributions in reaction cross section have
                different energy law  dependence. Due to that
                contributions distinguished by Least Square Method
STATUS     (TABLE)  Values of  strength  functions  taken  from
            text of YF,13,(5),1039,1971

             Neutron fission and capture cross section data in
             region  0.1-30 keV for U-235 and Pu-239 measured by
             time-of-flight method on IBR-reactor (see reports
             in JINR-P3-5113 - Entry 40024 and JINR-P3-5112 -
             Entry 40025.
CORRECTION   Corrected on compound elastic scat. cross section
             which  is equal  10+-3% relatively average reaction
             cross section
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,0.5) D-wave contribution in value of reaction
            cross section at calculation less than 0.5%
           (ERR-2,,3.) Interference terms at calculation of
            reaction cross section less than 3%
            Experimental error of reaction cross section due to
            number level fluctuation over average interval propor-
            tional 1/number of level on average energy interval
