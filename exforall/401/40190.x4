TITLE      Cross section of the Am-241(n,gamma)Am-242 reaction
           for a neutron spectrum similar to the fission spectrum
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectrum was close to fission spectrum and
           had following energy distribution
              energy (MeV)       per-cent
               0 - 0.1            3.8
               0.1-0.4            19.3
               0.4-0.9            26.9
               0.9-1.4            15.0
               1.4-3.0            23.8
               above 3.0          11.2
SAMPLE     ~ 1 mg of Am-241 chloride, alpha-activity ~7.2E+2
           decay/min, gamma-activity ~2.7E+3 quanta/min.
           In quartz cassettes, placed in Cd sheets of 0.5 mm
           thickness.
           With each Cd sheet Au-197 foil of ~2mg - for neutron
           flux control.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation plastic detector 53 x 1 mm in size
           and an FEU-11B photomultiplier was used to measure
           beta-activity.
           Different registration thresholds, corresponding to
           beta energy ~150-300 keV.
           Calibration by Sr-90 (E-beta 0.54 MeV), Tl( 0.765 MeV),
           Au-198( 0.963 MeV).
           Efficiency for Am-242 was 13.7 and 11 % depending from
           threshold value.
PART-DET   (B-)  Decay beta
CORRECTION For background.
           For decay at activation.
           For decay scheme.
