MONITOR    ((MONIT)98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU) Cf-252 layer was used to
           measure gamma and neutron detection efficiency to be
           0.347+-0.002 and 0.700+-0.003, respectively.
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSKUR)    Electron linear accelerator
METHOD     (TOF) The time-of-flight method (resolution 1 nsec/m)
            Flight path 35 m.
SAMPLE     The U-238 sample consisted of a stack of metal discs
            15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick with a total
            mass of 20 g.
DETECTOR   (STANK)  The liquid scintillation detector, ~400 litre
PART-DET   (G,N) Fission gamma and neutron.
CORRECTION  For background of scattered neutrons ( measured with
           lead sample) - 4-8% .
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The indicated errors are mean square. Following
           errors the following were taken into account:
           (ERR-S,1.5,2.) The statistical accuracy of each set
                           is 1.5 - 2%.
           (ERR-1)  variation of the neutron counting efficiency
                as a result of the instability of the apparatus ;
           (ERR-2) the error due to the inaccuracy in determining
                background;
           (ERR-3) the error arising in the determination of the
                number of cases of radiative capture of neutrons.
COMMENT     In the region of neutron energy below 3 MeV the NU(En)
            dependence is described by a straight line with
            the slope dNU/dEn=0.10 and in the region above 3 MeV
            -by   straight line with the slope dNU/dEn=0.18

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),PR,NU)
            The values of NU are averaged over two sets of
            measurements performed at different times.
ANALYSIS   In calculating of NU, the following were taken into
           account:
           - angular correlation of fission neutrons and incident
           neutrons arising as a consequence of fragments angular
           anisotropy;
           - the variation of mean energy of fission neutrons with
           increasing NU and the difference between Cf-252
           fission-neutron spectrum ( used for calibration) and
           U-238 fission-neutron spectrum;
           - the neutron multiplication in the sample.
