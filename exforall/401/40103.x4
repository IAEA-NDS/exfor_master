TITLE      Ratio of neutron cross-sections of radiative capture
           and fission for Pu-239 in the energy region below
           ~50.0 keV
SAMPLE     PuO2 samples (about 1.8% Pu-240) with effective
           thicknesses (4.4 x 10**21; 4.2 x 10**20 and
            1.7 x 10**20 atom/cm2). The measurements of the
           effect of fission were carried out with ionization
           fission chambers containing 1.6 and 12 mg of
           Pu-239 dioxide.
           For normalization, the measurements in the graphite
           prism were performed, in addition, with samples of
           Ag-107, 109 (4.3 x 10**21 atom/cm2) and
           Au197 (1.8 x 10**21 atom/cm2).
METHOD     (SLODT)         Slowing-down-time in lead.
           Gammas from neutron capture and fissions of Pu-239
           and the number of Pu-239 fissions into sample were
           measured directly.
           Alpha was calculated by means of formula
           alf(E)=(kf/kg)*(ng(t)/nf(t))-beta.
           Measurement constant, kf, kg and beta were determined
           from additional measurement on graphite prism for
           thermal neutrons.
MONITOR    For calculation of measurement constants the thermal
           fission cross-section and alpha of Pu-239 (see Atomic
           Energy Rev.,7,4,Vienna,1969) and thermal capture
           cross-sections of Au-197 and Ag-107,109 (see Neutron
           Cross-Sections,Suppl.2 to BNL-325,second edition,1966)
           were used.
CORRECTION Gamma background and natural radioactivity background
           were measured.
           Sample activation, recycle neutron contribution,
           correction on miscalculations and beam decrease into
           sample were taken into account
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error given except for En=0.47,
           1.47 and 6.0 keV, for which total errors are given.
           (ERR-T) Total error.
           Normalization error was determined also.
