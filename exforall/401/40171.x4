TITLE      The (n,2n) reaction cross-sections of for Tm,Ir,Tl and
           Pb isotopes at 14.8 MeV neutron energy.
REL-REF    (R,,C.M.Lederer,B,LEDERER-6,,1967) Sixth edition .
           Ref. for decay data used.
FACILITY   (LINAC)  Deuteron beam energy is 150. keV
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  The effective neutron flux on the samples for the
           irradiation time ~8 hr was (1-5)x 10**13 neutron/cm2
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation  time 8 hr.
           (CHSEP) for Tm,Tl,Pb.
SAMPLE     Samples were covered by Cd of 0.5 mm thickness;
           placed at 1-3 cm distance from neutron source.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  Crystal NaI(Tl), 40 x 40 cm2 for gammas.
           Detection efficiency was defined by standard sources of
           Ce-141, Au-198, Cs-134, Co-60.
           (FISCH) U-235 and U-238 Fis. chambers placed at 90deg
           to T target were used for neutron beam monitoring.
MONITOR     Zr and Al foils (50 micro-m thickness, 15 mm diameter)
           were used to define effective neutron flux.

COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           In J,YF,14,(4),682,1971 and J,SNP,14,383,1972 there are
           lot of misprints: Tu -> Tm (thulium) .
