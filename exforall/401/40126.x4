TITLE      Average yield of neutrons per spontaneous fission of
           Bk-249.
SAMPLE      About 7.0 microgram of Bk-249, obtained by treating
           curium target irradiated in SM-2 reactor; separation
           and purification were performed by the oxidation -
           reduction extractive-chromatographic method.
           Cf-252 content was no more than 10.E-10;
           Cf-249 content was less or equal to 0.3%
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence between pulses from
           neutron detector and ionization chamber.
           3.6E+4 fissions of Bk-249 , 2.2E+6 fissions of Cf-252
           were registered.
DETECTOR   (FISCH)  Ionization chamber for fissions registration
           (PROPC)  Helium-3 proportional counters (24 counters)
           in paraffin block for neutron registration .
           Efficiency ~25.%.
PART-DET   (N,FF) Neutrons and fission fragments.

            Ref. on Engl.transl. of AE added. MONIT was added in
            COMMON. Data units were corrected (NO-DIM -> PRT/FIS).
           (20150630A) M.M. Article was checked, BIB information
           was updated. DATA 2 were added as primarily measured.
