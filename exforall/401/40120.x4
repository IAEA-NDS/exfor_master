TITLE       Measurement of the cross-section for the reaction
            Kr-80(n,gamma)Kr-81 on thermal neutrons

FACILITY   (REAC)     Reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Reactor
METHOD     (COINC)    Anticoincidences were recorded
           (ACTIV)    Activation .
            Measurement time 2200 min.
PART-DET   (E)        Electrons (other then decay betas)
DETECTOR   (MWPC)   Multi-wire cylindrical proportional counter
            contains main and additional counters connected in
            anticoincidence with the main counter.
            Counter was filled with mixture 90 percent Ar and
            10 percent CH(4) at pressure 760 mm.
            Counter was calibrated with the help of the source
            Fe-55 and characteristic line K alpha of Cu.

REACTION   (36-KR-80(N,G)36-KR-81,,SIG) N-gamma cross-section
MONITOR    (36-KR-84(N,G)36-KR-85,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   Absolute value of Kr80(n,gamma) c-s was defined from
           ratio of decay rates of Kr-81 and Kr-85 and well known
           c-s of Kr-85 production (value is not given in the
           article).
CORRECTION  For counter parameters and Kr-81 K-capture properties.
