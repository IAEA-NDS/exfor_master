            1. CU-0(N,TOT) SIG data are given on
            Fig.2 of J,KSF,,(11),13,1978 - for two temperatures
           297 K and 80 K, as dependence from neutron velocity
           4 - 85 m/sec, En from 8.2E-08 eV to 3.7E-05 eV,
           energy resolution 16.%.
            2. TA-181(N,TOT) SIG data are given on
            Fig.2 of J,KSF,,(11),13,1978, at 297 K temperature as
           dependence from neutron velocity 4 - 85 m/sec,
           En from 8.2E-08 eV to 3.7E-05 eV, energy resolution
           16.%.
            Data corrected for refraction of the neutron wave in
           the medium, for multiple reflection of the neutrons
           from boundaries of the sample - 5% for 10 m/sec
           neutrons.
