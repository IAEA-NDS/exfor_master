TITLE      The investigation of a gamma-rays spectrum from the
           radiation capture of thermal neutrons by nuclei of the
           isotope Zn68
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD)     Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     Direct detection of gamma-rays
DETECTOR   (GELI)     Germanium-lithium detector
           Efficiency of detector 0. 02-0.03 % .
ANALYSIS              Shape analysis
MONITOR    For the energy calibration gamma-rays from Fe-56 and
           Si-28 samples used in the energy range 3.5-6.5 MeV and
           gamma-lines of annihilation radiation and from the
           background D-2 in the range 0.4-3.5 MEV
CORRECTION The intensity of the high energy part of the background
           was more less than one under consideration,that is why
           the background was not taken into account
ERR-ANALYS Energy-error was 1-4 keV depending on energy and
           intensity of gamma-line
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Decay scheme of Zn-69
