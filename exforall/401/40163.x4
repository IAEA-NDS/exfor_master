INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI)
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSRI)  VVR-M reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     VVR-M reactor
INC-SPECT  Neutron flux about 10**14 neutron/cm**2/sec from VVR-M
           reactor. Measured cadmium ratios for Np-237 were equal
           to 7.46 and for Pa-231 - 9.12
           The neutron flux at the sample location was measured
           by means of Np-237 targets
SAMPLE     Samples were prepared by electrolytic deposition of
           microgram amounts of Pa231 (~ 10 mu-g) on a titanium
           backing 0.2 mm thick.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)  Alpha spectrometer with surface-barrier
           gold-silicon detector .
RAD-DET    (91-PA-231,A)
           (92-U-232,A)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)         In general the measurement error
           includes measurement error of neutron flux
           (ERR-1) Error in neutron flux
           (ERR-2) Error in ratios of alpha peak areas.

MONITOR    Neutron flux was measured by Np-237 sample.
ANALYSIS   Thermal neutron capture c-s was determined by
           neutron flux ( measured by Np-237), irradiation time,
           areas under U232 and Pa231 alpha peaks for irradiations
           with and without Cd, ratio of half-lives
           T(Pa231)/T(U232)=439.
