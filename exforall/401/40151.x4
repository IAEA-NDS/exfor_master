AUTHOR     (V.A.Nikolaev)
TITLE      Average kinetic energies of fragments from
           spontaneous fission of Pu-238
SAMPLE     A l50-mu-g plutonium target in the form of a 1-cm2
           disk was placed in the center of an evacuated chamber.
METHOD     Direct detection of fis.fragments .
            The distributions of Cf-252 fragment track diameters
           served as standard for normalization.

            Data used for calibration.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Glass detector. Eight glass plates with
            ~ 1.5-mg/cm2 Al absorbers were irradiated for ten days
ANALYSIS           Shape analysis of fis.fragment distribution
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Errors are statistical
