MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) Fission cross section of U-238
           was used for neutron flux.
REL-REF    (R,A1120002,L.Cranberg+,J,PR,104,1639,1956) - data for
           correction for the neutron background
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
           Irradiation time 0.5 - 1.5 hr.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSRI)    Cyclotron
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4PI proportional gas-flow counter filled with
            methane
           (IOCH) The fast neutron flux was measured using an
            ionization fission chamber with a U-238 layer. The
            amount of uranium in the chamber was found by
            alpha-counting
INC-SOURCE (D-D)      Deuteron-deuterium reaction.
                      Deuteron energy 6.6 MeV.
PART-DET   (B-)       Decay beta- electrons
SAMPLE                Metallic disks 10 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm
                      in width
           Samples were placed at 45 mm distance from the centre
           of neutron source.
CORRECTION At the determination of the flux of neutrons were
           introduced correction for background of scattered
           neutrons 10-60% and correction for neutrons from
           break-up of deuterons 5%  .
           Correction for the counting of the fission from the
           latter neutrons was 5+-1%.
           Correction for the counting of the fission was 5+-1%
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)   Uncertainty in the energy was conditioned by
           breaking of deuterons in target and different angles
           of neutron escape
           (ERR-T) Square root total error arising from :
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of the weight of U-238        1.5%
           (MONIT-ERR) Error of fission cross section U-238   3.%
           (ERR-2) Error of the counting of fission           2.%
           (ERR-3) Error in efficiency of activity counting    3%
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in the background of neutrons   3%
           (ERR-S) Error in the counting rate of the samples   1%
           (ERR-5) Error in the geometry of the experiment     1%
COMMENT    Specific activity were determined by extrapolation of
           the sample to zero width
