MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)FISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-238
MONIT-REF  (,,J,PR,104,1639,56)
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION
FACILITY   (CYCLO)    CYCLOTRON
DETECTOR   (PROPC)    4PI PROPORTIONAL GAS-FLOW COUNTER FILLED
                      WITH       METHAN
INC-SOURCE (D-D)      DEUTERON-DEUTERIUM REACTION
PART-DET   (B-)       DECAY BETA- ELECTRONS
SAMPLE                METALLIC DISKS 10 MM IN DIAMETER AND 0.1 MM
                      IN WIDTH
CORRECTION AT THE DETERMINATION OF THE FLUX OF NEUTRONS WERE
           INIRODUCED CORRECTION FOR BACKGROUND OF SCATTERED
           NEUTRONS 10-60 PERCENT AND CORRECTION FOR NEUTRONS FROM
           BREAK-UP OF DEUTERONS 5 PERCENT
           CORRECTION FOR THE COUNTING OF THE FISSION FROM THE
           LATTER NEUTRONS WAS 5+-1 PERCENT
           CORRECTION FOR THE COUNTING OF THE FISSION WAS 5+-1
           PERCENT
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)   UNCERTAINTY IN THE ENERGY WAS CONDITIONED BY
           BREAKING OF DEUTERONS IN TARGET AND DIFFERENT ANGLES
           OF NEUTRON ESCAPE
           (ERR-T) SQUARE ROOT TOTAL  ERROR ARISED FROM
           1.UNCERTAINTY OF THE WEIGHT OF U-238        1.5 PERCENT
           2.UNCERTAINTY OF FISSION CROSS SECTION U-238 3. PERCENT
           3.ERROR OF THE COUNTING OF FISSION          2.  PERCENT
           4.ERROR IN COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF ACTIVITY 3 PERCENT
           5.UNCERTAINTY IN THE BACKGROUND OF NEUTRONS   3 PERCENT
           6.ERROR IN THE COUNTING RATE OF THE SAMPLES   1 PERCENT
           7.ERROR IN THE GEOMETRY OF THE EXPERIMENT     1 PERCENT
