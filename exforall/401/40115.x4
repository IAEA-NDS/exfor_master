TITLE       Nu-bar   data measurement and evaluation at U-235
           fission by fast neutrons.

INSTITUTE  (4RUSFEI)
REFERENCE  (R,FEI-227,1970)      Data tables and graphs are given
METHOD     (COINC)    Pulses coincidence of neutrons and fission
           fragments detectors
REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),PR,NU)
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU) =3.782
DETECTOR   (IOCH)     Many layers of ionization chamber for
           fission fragments registration
           (HE3SP)    24 He3 counters for neutrons registration
FACILITY   (VDG)      Van De Graaff
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      Proton-tritium
           (P-LI7)    Proton-lithium 7
PART-DET   (N)        Neutrons
           (FF)       Fission fragments
SAMPLE                A few layers of U3O8 (90.0 percent U-235).
           In the middle of uranium layers the chamber with
           Cf-252 layer was placed
CORRECTION Corrections  were introduced on :
           dependence of registration efficiency from neutron
           source position in detector,
           angular anisotropy of neutrons detector sensitivity,
           energy dependence of neutrons detector efficiency,
           discrimination of fissions part,
           pulse miscalculation at coincidence registration,
           admixture of isotopes,
           background.
