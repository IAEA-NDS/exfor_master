TITLE      Angular distributions of fragments in neutron-induced
           fission of Cf-249
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSKUR)      Van de Graaff
SAMPLE     The total amount of Cf-249 was 3.5 mu-g.
           Layer of 6 mm diameter, located at 8mm distance from
           neutron source at 45 deg angle relative to incident
           neutron direction.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    Proton-lithium-7 reaction
           (P-T)      proton-tritium reaction
           (D-D)      deuteron-deuterium reaction
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    Glass detectors.
           Glass disks of 20mm diameter, placed at 0,30,60,90deg
           angles relative to incident neutron beam. The distance
           Cf layer centre - glass disk center was 50 mm.
CORRECTION  Background of spon.fissions ~ 0.5 % of total counts
           did not affect results.
ANALYSIS   Angular anisotropy is found from
                      the least-squares fit to measurements
                      at various angles according to the formula
                      W(phi)=(1+a*cos(phi)**2)*W(90.deg),
                      where phi is the angle between the neutron
                      direction and the fragment direction
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors are not specified , probably
           statistical only.
