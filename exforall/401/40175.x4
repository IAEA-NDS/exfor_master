TITLE       Cross-sections of the reactions Se-76(n,p),Se-77(n,d),
            Se-77(n,n+p) and Se-80(n,alpha) with 14.7 MeV neutrons

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) For neutron beam.
DECAY-DATA (11-NA-24,14.9HR,B) Beta-activity was measured.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activated samples were sealed by glue in
            aluminum foil of 6 mg/cm**2 thickness.
            Aluminum filter of about 220 mg/cm**2 to remove beta-
            particles of energy < 0.7 MeV. Dependence of beta-
            radiation attenuation by filter was measured in energy
            range 0.6 - 3.2 MeV.
            Activation of samples of different isotopic abundance
            allowed to define Se-76 (n,p) and (n,d)+(n,np)
            reactions.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)  Neutron flux is 1.0 x 10**10 neutrons/sec/4pi
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4pi counter
STATUS     (SPSDD,40227001) Superseded by newer publication.
