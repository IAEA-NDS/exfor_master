FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) Fm-256 was synthesized in the internal
           Ne-22 (130 MeV ion energy, about 6E+13 prt/sec
           intensity) ion beam of U-300 cyclotron by reaction
           U-238(Ne-22,p3n)Md-256 -> E.C.(90.%,HL=1.33hr -> Fm-256
           which cross-section is about 2.E-33 cm**2.
METHOD     (COINC)  The coincidences between the impulses from
            neutron detectors and fission fragment detectors.
DETECTOR   (COIN,LONGC,SIBAR)     Long counter for recording of
            neutrons; consists of 36 He-3 counters placed into
           plexiglas block. For recording of fission fragments
           the surface-barrier Si(Au) detectors were used.
           The efficiency of fission-neutron registration
           determined for Cm-244 was 48.5%;
           background < 0.001 n/fis.
ERR-ANALYS  Background due to spontaneous fission of Cf-246 and
           Fm-252 (presented in investigated source) can not
           introduce an error > 0.1 % in measured NU.

MONITOR   1(96-CM-244(0,F),PR,NU)   Average prompt neutron number
