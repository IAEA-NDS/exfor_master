            SELLOTAPE. TWO AREAS PLACED FACE TO FACE, SANDWICHING
            THE AL MONITOR FOIL, USED IN THE IRRADIATION. WEIGHT
            OF OXIDE MEASURED AS 16.7 MG BY ASHING THE SAMPLE AND
            WEIGHING THE RESIDUE.
           .THORIUM OXIDE SAMPLE WAS STRIPPED OF NATURAL
            DAUGHTERS BY CHEMICAL PROCESSING PRIOR TO IRRADIATION.
