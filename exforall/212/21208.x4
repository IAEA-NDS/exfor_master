REACTION   (90-TH-232(N,2N)90-TH-231,,SIG)
SAMPLE      Oxide sample, ground to a fine powder and dusted on
            sellotape. Two areas placed face to face, sandwiching
            the Al monitor foil, used in the irradiation. Weight
            of oxide measured as 16.7 mg by ashing the sample and
            weighing the residue.
            Thorium oxide sample was stripped of natural
            daughters by chemical processing prior to irradiation.
            Th-231 calibration samples extracted from uranium
            metal by similar chemical separation.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 2.25 X 2.25 inch sodium iodide crystal.
           Counter efficiency, calibrated using a known quantity
           of Th-231, was obtained from uranium metal where it was
           in equilibrium with U-235.
