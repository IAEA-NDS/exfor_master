TITLE       Study of the reaction Cl-35(n,p)S-35 by nuclear
            emulsion special silver-chloride
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) Thermal reactor, Harwell.
           (REAC,2FR FAR) Thermal reactor, Chatillon.
           Three irradiations were held, the first two on reactor
           called Bepo from Harwell, the third on one of Chatillon
INC-SOURCE (REAC) neutrons about 10**9 n/cm2
SAMPLE     .Special developed nuclear emulsions (Kodak,England)
            which contains Ag-Cl instead of Ag-Br, thickness
            50 mu, composition of plates is:
                the atomic   composition   Number of cores

             Ag    100.     2.10  (62.2%)   1.17 x 10**22 (16.3%)
METHOD     .Irradiation of nuclear emulsions containing the
            sample. Track counting by microscopy.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Nuclear emulsion plates, type Ilford C2.
            Absolute determination of n-flux by counting the
            proton-tracks of N-14(n,p)C-14.

CORRECTION .Correction applied for the contribution of the
            N-14(n,p)C-14 reaction.
ERR-ANALYS .Mean error of the weighted average of 6 measured
            values is given.

INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectrum from reactor.
           Six measurements being independent and compatible,
           the final result of the weighted average of them.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total error is the mean squared error,
           calculated for each target according to the theory of
           the propagation of errors.
