INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium reaction. Neutron flux was kept
                 constant during particular irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
            Gamma-rays energy measurements were performed in order
            to confirm the presence of radionuclides, whose
            identification was made measuring the half-lives of
            these radionuclides by means of beta-activities
            induced in sample were determined by registrations of
            beta-particles.

            Tracelab type  -for the beta activity.

            associated alpha particles of the D-T reaction, as
            neutron flux monitor.

CRITIQUE   -Of E.Dupont (CEA, Saclay). Data value is about 5 times
            large.
           -Of authors.Large discrepancy is in value of Ca-43(n,p)
            cross section: theoretical value computed by Gardner
            is 92 mb and our experimental value is 501 mb.
            No exp. data of others authors for this reaction was
            found in Literature at that time ( 1966 year).
           -Of compiler. No explanations of discrepancy reason was
            given by authors.
            Probably this discrepancy could be partly explained by
            old decay data values used in analysis.

ANALYSIS   Sc-47 was considered because in Ca-48(n,2n)Ca-47
           reaction Ca-47 decays in Sc-47.Obviously the increase
           of beta-counting due to Sc-47 was calculated by
           equation for a daughter product, in evaluation of
           Ca-48(n,2n)Ca-47 cross-section.
