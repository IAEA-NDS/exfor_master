TITLE       Scattering and polarization effects of 3.27 MeV
            neutrons on deuterons
FACILITY   (CCW,2SWTETH) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) D-D-neutrons, heavy ice target.
            D(+) energy 567 keV, D(+) current 14 to 20 muAmp.
SAMPLE     .Deuterated benzene (99.3% D-content) plus 3 g/l
            para-terphenyl plus 0.1 g/l POPOP in a brass cylinder
            with glass lid (dia 27 mm, length 30 mm, wall thick-
            ness 0.1 mm).
METHOD     (COINC) Detection of scattered neutrons by two equal
            detectors at azimuth-angles of 0 and 180 deg,
            scattering angles (lab) from 36 to 144 deg,
            scattering sample in collimated neutron beam,
            coincidences between recoil deuterons and scattered
            neutrons were measured (low background).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Plastic scintillators, type NE 102,  30 x 16 mm,
            length 40 mm.
           (SCIN ) Scintillation detector with anthracene crystal
            (cross section 25*25 mm*mm, thickness 2.5 mm) as
            neutron monitor for flux determination.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(N,EL)1-H-2,,SIG) Value of the total elastic
            scattering cross section used for normalization not
            given.
COMMENT    .The sample serves likewise as detector for the recoil
            deuterons and is connected with a photomultiplier by
            a conical light conductor.
           .Position of neutron monitor 160 mm from target within
            the collimator. The lead collimator consists of a
            conical channel with quadratic cross section (wall
            thickness 25 mm, length 430 mm) surrounded by blocks
            containing 75% weight paraffin and 25% weight
            boric acid. Total thickness of the shielding 45 cm
            all-around.
STATUS     (NDD) Data taken from NEUDADA.
CORRECTION .Corrections for multiple scattering of neutrons in
            the sample, finite geometry (sample-detector),
            background including random coincidences, dependence
            detector efficiency on neutron energy, anisotropy of
            the neutron source, attenuation of neutron intensity
            in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors are given, the
            statistical errors where considered to be negligible.
