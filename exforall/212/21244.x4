TITLE      -SCATTERING AND POLARIZATION EFFECTS OF 3.27 MEV
            NEUTRONS ON DEUTERONS.- (IN GERMAN).
FACILITY   (CCW  ) COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) D-D-NEUTRONS, HEAVY ICE TARGET.
            D(+) ENERGY 567 KEV, D(+) CURRENT 14 TO 20 MUAMP.
SAMPLE     .DEUTERATED BENZENE (99.3 PC D-CONTENT) PLUS 3 G/L
            PARA-TERPHENYL PLUS 0.1 G/L POPOP IN A BRASS CYLINDER
            WITH GLASS LID (DIA 27 MM, LENGTH 30 MM, WALL THICK-
            NESS 0.1 MM).
METHOD     (COINC) DETECTION OF SCATTERED NEUTRONS BY TWO EQUAL
            DETECTORS AT AZIMUTH-ANGLES OF 0 AND 180 DEG,
            SCATTERING ANGLES (LAB) FROM 36 TO 144 DEG,
            SCATTERING SAMPLE IN COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM,
            COINCIDENCES BETWEEN RECOIL DEUTERONS AND SCATTERED
            NEUTRONS WERE MEASURED (LOW BACKGROUND).
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS, TYPE NE 102, CROSS
            SECTION 30*16 MM*MM, LENGTH 40 MM.
           (SCIN ) SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH ANTHRACENE CRYSTAL
            (CROSS SECTION 25*25 MM*MM, THICKNESS 2.5 MM) AS
            NEUTRON MONITOR FOR FLUX DETERMINATION.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(N,EL)1-H-2,,SIG) VALUE OF THE TOTAL ELASTIC
            SACTTERING CROSS SECTION USED FOR NORMALIZATION NOT
            GIVEN.
COMMENT    .THE SAMPLE SERVES LIKEWISE AS DETECTOR FOR THE RECOIL
            DEUTERONS AND IS CONNECTED WITH A PHOTOMULTIPLIER BY
            A CONICAL LIGHT CONDUCTOR.
           .POSITION OF NEUTRON MONITOR 160 MM FROM TARGET WITHIN
            THE COLLIMATOR. THE LEAD COLLIMATOR CONSISTS OF A
            CONICAL CHANNEL WITH QUADRATIC CROSS SECTION (WALL
            THICKNESS 25 MM, LENGTH 430 MM) SURROUNDED BY BLOCKS
            CONTAINING 75 WEIGHT-PC PARAFFIN AND 25 WEIGHT-PC
            BORIC ACID. TOTAL THICKNESS OF THE SHIELDING 45 CM
            ALL-AROUND.
STATUS     (NDD  ) DATA TAKEN FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (800110T) G.C.
           (800118E)

CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS IN
            THE SAMPLE, FINITE GEOMETRY (SAMPLE-DETECTOR),
            BACKGROUND INCLUDING RANDOM COINCIDENCES, DEPENDENCE
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCY ON NEUTRON ENERGY, ANISOTROPY OF
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE, ATTENUATION OF NEUTRON INTENSITY
            IN THE SAMPLE.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE GIVEN, THE
            STATISTICAL ERRORS WHERE CONSIDERED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
