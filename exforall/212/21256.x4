TITLE      -THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAST FISSION CROSS SECTION
            OF PROTOACTINIUM-233 WITH FISSION NEUTRONS.-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2SWTWUR) RESEARCH REACTOR IN WUERENLINGEN,
            (EIR), THERMAL REACTOR, 20 MW TH, RADIAL BEAM HOLE.
INC-SOURCE .U-233 TARGET AS NEUTRON FLUX CONVERTER.
INC-SPECT  .FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .PA-233 LAYERS ON PLATINUM DISKS, VARIOUS QUANTITIES
            FROM 0.20 TO 1.76 CI (1 CI = 48 MICROGRAMS), DIAM
            15 MM. FOR THE ABSOLUTE FLUX MEASUREMENTS THIN
            THORIUM SAMPLES WERE USED (SAME GEOMETRY). THE
            DETERMINATION OF THE COUNTER EFFICIENCY WAS CARRIED
            OUT WITH U-235 AND (PA-233 + U-235)-MIXTURES, USING
            AN U-235 STANDARD SOLUTION FOR PREPARATION.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF THE FAST FISSION CROSS SECTION OF
            PA-233 BY COMPARING THE FISSION RATE OF A KNOWN
            QUANTITY OF PA-233 TO THAT OF A KNOWN TH-SAMPLE,
            USING BACK-TO-BACK FISSION COUNTERS.
           .PRODUCTION OF PA-233 BY IRRADIATION OF THORIUM METAL
            CHIPS IN THE REACTOR AND SUBSEQUENT CHEMICAL SEPARA-
            TION. THE TARGET CONSISTS OF A 20 MM DIAM CYLINDER
            FILLED WITH 10 G OF U-233 (AS U(3)-O(8)) AND IS
            PLACED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE COUNTERS. THE U-233
            SERVES AS CONVERTER FOR THE NEUTRON FLUX AS WELL AS
            ABSORBER FOR U-233 RESONANCE NEUTRONS. A 0.6 MM THICK
            CADMIUM SHEET BEHIND THE CONVERTER SERVES AS
            SHIELDING AGAINST THERMAL NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) DOUBLE (BACK-TO-BACK) PARALLEL PLATE TYPE
            FISSION CHAMBER (ALUMINIUM) OPERATED AS A GAS FLOW
            CHAMBER WITH AN ARGON(99 PC)-METHANE MIXTURE AT 1 ATM
            PRESSURE. THE FIRST COUNTER CONTAINS ALTERNATIVELY
            SAMPLES OF PA-233, TH-232, U-235, AND PA-233/U-235-
            MIXTURES. THE SECOND COUNTER SERVES AS FAST NEUTRON
            FLUX MONITOR AND CONTAINS UNIFORMLY PLATED DEPOSITS
            ON ITS TWO CATHODES OF 4.47 RESP. 5.10 MG TH-O(2),
            DIA 40 MM. THE CHAMBER IS SURROUNDED BY A SHIELDING
            OF 100 MM LEAD AND 0.3 MM CADMIUM.
