TITLE      -RADIATIVE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENTS FOR
            FAST NEUTRONS USING A LARGE GD-LOADED LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR-.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) 4 MV PULSED VAN DE GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) THE T(P,N)HE-3 REACTION, USING A 0.8 MG/CM2
            THICK TITANIUM-TRITIUM TARGET.
SAMPLE     .CHEMICALLY PURE NATURAL ELEMENTS OF AU-197 AND U-238
            IN FORM OF DISCS, 2 CM IN DIAMETER AND 3 MM THICK.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT TECHNIQUES DISCRIMINATING
            BETWEEN CAPUTRE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS.
DETECTOR   (STANK) A 100 CM DIAMETER SPHERICAL TANK, FILLED
            WITH ORGANIC LIQUID SCINTILLATOR NE323, IN WHICH
            0.5 PERCENT OF GADOLINIUM WAS DESOLVED.
            MEASURED EFFICIENCIES ARE,
            - 80 PERCENT FOR FISSION NEUTRONS,
            - MORE THAN 95 PERCENT FOR 8 MEV GAMMA RAYS.
           .A DIRCTIONAL COUNTER WAS USED TO MONITOR THE NEUTRON
            FLUX.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.
HISTORY    (791214C) CN.
           (800115E)
CORRECTION .THE NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN CORRECTED FOR
            - NEUTRON ABSORPTION IN AIR
            - NEUTRON ATTENUATION IN SAMPLE
            - ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE MONITOR EFFICIENCY.
ERR-ANALYS .THE ERRORS COME MAINLY FROM THE SUBTRACTION OF LARGE
            GAMMA BACKGROUND.

HISTORY    (791214C)
CORRECTION .TO OBTAIN THE NEUTRON MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTION,
            CORRECTIONS ARE APPLIED FOR,
            - TIME-DEPENDENT BACKGROUND
            - TIME-INDIPENDENT BACKGROUND
            - DEAD-TIME LOSSES
            - NON-UNITY NEUTRON DETECTION EFFICIENCY.
           .THE CAPTURE FRACTION WAS OBTAINED BY CORRECTING FOR
            NEUTRON-LESS FISSION EVENTS.
