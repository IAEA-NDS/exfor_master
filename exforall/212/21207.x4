TITLE      -THE RATE OF EMISSION OF SPONTANEOUS NEUTRONS BY
            NATURAL URANIUM-
FACILITY   (REAC ) GLEEP REACTOR AT AERE OPERATED 0.1 PERCENT
                   BELOW CRITICAL.
SAMPLE     .THE KNOWN AMOUNT OF URANIUM ELEMENT (3.462E+04 KG) IN
            THE GLEEP REACTOR CONSTITUTES THE SAMPLE.
METHOD     .MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRON COUNT RATE IN BF-3 COUNTER IN
            PILE AS A FUNCTION OF THE POSITION OF A CALIBRATED
            RA-RE NEUTRON SOURCE ALONG THE PILE AXIS.
           .REVISED SOURCE STRENGTH (9.09+-0.04)E+06, OLD VALUE
            (9.66+-0.44)E+06 N/SEC.
DETECTOR   (BF3  ) 3 INCH DIAMETER, 12 INCH LONG, BF-3 COUNTER
                   CONTAINING 6 TORR BF-3 AND 6 TORR ARGON.
PART-DET   (N    ) REACTOR NEUTRONS.
STATUS     (NDD  ) FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (791207T)
           (800110E)
CORRECTION .CORRECTION FOR ABSORPTION OF PILE NEUTRONS BY THE
            SOURCE BY REPEATING MEASUREMENTS WITH A BRASS
            CYLINDER OF THE SAME EFFECTIVE THERMAL ABSORPTION
            CROSS-SECTION AS THE SOURCE.
           .CORRECTION FOR NEUTRONS GENERATED BY (A,N) REACTIONS
            FROM OXYGEN IN URANIUM OXIDE IN CORE, LESS THAN 2
            PERCENT.
           .ADDITIONAL CORRECTION TO REVISED VALUE FOR FAST
            FISSION FACTOR FOR METAL REGION OF GLEEP, 2 PERCENT.
ERR-ANALYS .STATISTICAL COUNTING ERROR ABOUT 1 PERCENT.
