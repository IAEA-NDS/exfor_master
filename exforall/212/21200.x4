FACILITY   .NONE.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) SB-BE PHOTONEUTRON SOURCE MADE AT AWRE
                   CONSISTING OF SOLID SPHERE OF ANTIMONY
                   1.75 CM IN DIAMETER WITH A CLOSELY FITTING
                   BERYLLIUM SHELL 3.00+-0.02 MM THICK.
                   SOURCE STRENGTH (6.46+-0.04)E+05 N/SEC AT START
                   OF IRRADIATIONS AND CALCULATED USING SB-124
                   HALF-LIFE OF 60.2+-0.3 D THEREAFTER.
SAMPLE     .TWO MATCHED PAIRS OF THIN HEMISPHERICAL SHELLS, ONE
            SET FITTING EXACTLY ROUND THE SOURCE, THE OTHER OF
            RADIUS 10 CM.
           .AFTER IRRADIATION BACKING WAS DISSOLVED AND GOLD
            MELTED TO MAKE DISCS (0.75 INCH DIAMETER, 0.005 INCH
            THICK, OR 1.5 INCH DIAMETER, 0.17 INCH THICK) FOR
            GAMMA COUNTING AND FOILS (0.875 INCH DIAMETER, 0.001
            INCH THICK) FOR BETA COUNTING.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION. ONE WEEK IRRADIATIONS ON ROOF
                   OF NPL.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4-PI BETA PROPORTIONAL COUNTER TO COUNT BETA
                   ACTIVITY OF THIN FOILS. DETECTOR CALIBRATED
                   BY RE-IRRADIATING THE FOILS IN A REACTOR AND
                   COUNTING IN A 4-PI BETA/GAMMA COINCIDENCE
                   ARRANGEMENT.
                   GAMMA SPECTROMETER TO MEASURE GAMMA ACTIVITY
                   OF THICK SAMPLES RELATIVE TO A VERY THIN HIGH
                   ACTIVITY AU-198 SAMPLE WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY
                   CALIBRATED IN A 4-PI BETA/GAMMA COINCIDENCE
                   ARRANGEMENT. ALLOWANCE MADE FOR DIFFERENCES
                   IN SAMPLE GEOMETRIES.
PART-DET   (B)     DECAY BETAS.
           (DG)    DECAY GAMMAS.
CORRECTION .LARGE NUMBER OF CORRECTIONS INCLUDING-
            INCREASE IN NEUTRON PATH LENGTH BY SCATTERING IN THE
            GOLD (1.0 PERCENT FOR SMALL SHELL, 2.0 PC FOR LARGE).
            SCATTERING IN COPPER BACKING (2.8 PC FOR BOTH SMALL
            SHELLS, 11.8 AND 8.4 PC FOR LARGE).
            ROOF SCATTERING BACKGROUND (NEGLIGIBLE FOR SMALL,
            2.9 PERCENT FOR LARGE).
            AIR-SCATTERING BACKGROUND (NEGLIGIBLE FOR SMALL,
            0.5 PERCENT FOR LARGE).
            SCATTERING IN ALUMINIUM CAN ROUND LARGE SHELLS
            (0.5 PERCENT).
            SMALL SHELLS AFFECTED BY CONTAMINATION FROM THE
            SOURCE (3 PERCENT AND 0.7 PERCENT).
            RESONANCE SELF-PROTECTION (LESS THAN 0.1 PERCENT).
            NEUTRON COMPONENT OF ENERGY 380 KEV (3.3 PERCENT).
            NO CORRECTION FOR COMPTON SCATTERING OF 1.69 MEV
            GAMMAS IN THE SOURCE PRODUCING EXTRA NEUTRONS.
            NO CORRECTION FOR INELASTIC SCATTERING OF SOURCE
            NEUTRONS FROM 20 KEV SB LEVEL.
            SMALL CORRECTION FOR SOURCE POSITIONING IN ONE CASE.
