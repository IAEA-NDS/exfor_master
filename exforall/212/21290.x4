ADD-RES    (COMP)The isomeric cross-section ratio and spin cut-off
           were calculated from the spin distribution resulting
           after the emission of 1-st neutron since the excitation
           energy after emission of 2-nd neutron was too low for
           the statistical model to be applicable.
CORRECTION  It was necessary to subtract the disturbing
            activities of Mo-99,Nb-96, Nb-97, Mo-101.
