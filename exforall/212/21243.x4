TITLE      -Reaction mechanism of the (N,2N)-reaction on be-9
            and differential cross section for phi = 90 degrees
            at a neutron energy of 3.7 MeV.- (In German).
FACILITY   (CCW  ) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator (1 mV)
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) D-d-neutrons, rotating heavy ice target,
            d(+) current 100 muamp.
SAMPLE     .Beryllium-cylinder, dia 22 mm, length 43 mm.
METHOD     .The neutrons emitted from the sample are detected
            by nuclear emulsion plates. Track counting by
            microscopy.
DETECTOR   (TRD  ) Track detector. Nuclear emulsion plates,
            ilford C2.
COMMENT    .The given cross section was determined by track
            intensity measurements. The method of neutron flux
            determination and of normalization, resp. Is not
            mentioned.
STATUS     (NDD)   Data taken from neudada.
CORRECTION .Corrected for background and contribution of (N,P)-
            reactions.
ERR-ANALYS .An absolute error of +- 8 millibarns/Sr is given,
            the error-analysis is not described.
