INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE T(D,N)HE-4 REACTION.
SAMPLE     .FIVE SMALL COPPER FOILS WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF 16.5
            TIMES 8.0 MM AND A THICKNESS OF 0.3 MM AND A PURITY
            OF 99.999 PERCENT.
           .SIX SMALL ALUMINUM FOILS OF THE SAME SIZE AND A
            THICKNESS OF 0.1 MM AND A PURITY OF 99.95 PERCENT
            WERE ARRANGED AS A SANDWICH TOGETHER WITH THE COPPER
            FOILS.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 12.7 TIMES 12.7 CM NAI(TL) WELL-TYPE
            DETECTOR, EFFICIENCY CALIBRATED TO AN ACCURACY OF
            0.3 PERCENT FOR MONOENERGETIC GAMMA RADIATION AND

CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS TO THE EFFICIENCIES OF THE DETECTOR HAVE
            BEEN APPLIED FOR,
            -THE EXTENSION OF THE SOURCE (ABOUT 1 PERCENT),
            -FORWARD SCATTERING BY THE ALUMINUM LINING OF THE
             WELL (ABOUT 2 PERCENT),
            -BACKSCATTERING BY THE LEAD SHIELDING (ABOUT 1 PC).
ERR-ANALYS .THE SOURCE OF ERRORS AND THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY
            OF THE CROSS SECTION GIVEN IN TABLE 1 IN REFERENCE
            ARE AS FOLLOWS,
            STATISTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS,
            -ACTIVITY MEASUREMENT OF THE COPPER SAMPLES (2.3 PC),
            -ACTIVITY MEASUREMENT OF THE ALUMINUM SAMPLES
             (0.2 PC),
            SYSTEMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS,

            -DIFFERENCE IN ACTIVATION OF THE COPPER AND ALUMINUM
             SAMPLES BY SELF-SCATTERING (0.2 PC),
            -WEIGHING,TIMING,DEAD-TIME CORRECTION, AND DIFFERENCE
             IN ACTIVATION OF THE COPPER AND ALUMINUM SAMPLES BY

             (0.1 PC),
            -PURITY OF THE COPPER SAMPLES (-0.5 PC).
           .FOR STATISTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, THE ONE SIGMA ERROR
            IS GIVEN, FOR SYSTEMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS THE MAXIMUM
