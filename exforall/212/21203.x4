TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE RATIO OF ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION
            TO FISSION CROSS-SECTION FOR U-233, U-235 AND PU-239
            WITH 0.0011 EV NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   .LEAD-BISMUTH FILTER TO PROVIDE A BEAM OF COLD
            NEUTRONS WITH WAVELENGTH GREATER THAN 6.5 ANGSTROMS
            MEAN WAVELENGTH 8.5 ANGSTROMS, 0.0011 EV.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) BEPO REACTOR AT AERE.
METHOD     .TRANSMISSION METHOD TO ESTABLISH THICKNESS OF A GOLD
            SAMPLE GIVING SAME TRANSMISSION AS FISSION SAMPLE.
            FISSION RATE MEASURED RELATIVE TO ACTIVATION RATE OF
            THE SAME GOLD SAMPLE THROUGH INTERMEDIARY OF BORON
            PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) FISSION CHAMBER IRRADIATED WITH
           (PROPC) BORON PROPORTIONAL COUNTER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND
                   IT (ATTENUATION IN FISCH 4 PERCENT). BIAS IN
                   BORON COUNTER SET AT MINIMUM BETWEEN LI-7 AND
                   ALPHA PEAKS.
                   BORON CHAMBER, WITH SAME BIAS, IRRADIATED WITH
                   GOLD SAMPLE WHOSE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED BY
                   BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE TECHNIQUE.
           (BF3  ) 2 INCH DIAMETER BY 8 INCH LONG BF-3 COUNTER
                   AT 30 TORR PRESSURE USED AS FLUX MONITOR IN
                   TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS.
STATUS     (NDD  ) FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (791205T)
           (800110E)
CORRECTION .EFFECT OF EPI-CADMIUM NEUTRONS SUBTRACTED FROM GOLD
            ACTIVITY (11.8 PERCENT) AND BORON CHAMBER RATE(2.6
            PERCENT) IN MEASUREMENT WITH 0.04 INCH CADMIUM
            FILTER.
           .EFFECT OF U-238 IN U-234 SAMPLE, 0.05 PERCENT.
           .EFFECT OF U-234 AND U-238 IN U-235 SAMPLE 0.1
            PERCENT.
           .EFFECT OF PU-240 IN PU-239 SAMPLE, 0.3 PERCENT.
