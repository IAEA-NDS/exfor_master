TITLE      -THE (N,2N) CROSS-SECTION OF TH-232 FOR FISSION
            NEUTRONS-
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .THORIUM NITRATE. SAMPLE PLACED INSIDE CD CYLINDER
            TO CUT OUT THERMAL NEUTRONS AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT
            OF TH-232 PRODUCED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) IRRADIATIONS OF SAMPLE CARRIED OUT IN HOLLOW
                   FUEL ELEMENT. LOW ENERGY GAMMA ACTIVITY OF TH-
                   231 MEASURED AFTER SEPARATION OF TH-233 AND
                   FISSION PRODUCTS FROM IRRADIATED SAMPLE.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) KRYPTON FILLED PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.
                   EFFICIENCY FOR 25.6 KEV GAMMAS FOUND USING
                   SAMPLE OF KNOWN MASS OF U-235 IN THE SAMPLE
                   POSITION AND COUNTING 25.6 KEV PEAK.
           (GEMUC) LIQUID GEIGER COUNTER TO MEASURE MONITOR
                   ACTIVITY.

MONITOR    (16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG,,FIS) AMMONIUM SULPHATE
                   SOLUTION PLACED IN FUEL CAN WITH SAMPLE AND
                   DISSOLVED IN WATER FOR COUNTING. FISSION

                   AS 60.3 MB.
STATUS     (NDD  ) FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (791206T)
           (800110E)
CORRECTION .CONTRIBUTION OF EPI-CADMIUM NEUTRONS NEGLECTED.
           .DISTORTION OF FISSION SPECTRUM DUE TO ELASTIC
            SCATTERING IN THE MODERATOR AND INELASTIC SCATTERING
            IN FUEL. CORRECTION SMALL FOR TH-232(N,2N) BUT LARGER
            FOR FLUX MONITOR, ABOUT 1.5 PERCENT.
