TITLE      -The (n,2n) cross-section of Th-232 for fission
            neutrons-
INC-SOURCE (REAC) BEPO Reactor.
SAMPLE     Decigram quantities of thorium nitrate. Sample placed
           inside Cd cylinder to cut out thermal neutrons and
           reduced the amount of Th-232 produced.
           Ammonium sulphate was irradiated with thorium nitrate
           to measure total fission neutron flux received.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiations of sample carried out in hollow
                   fuel element. Low energy gamma activity of Th-
           (CHSEP) 231 measured after separation of Th-233 and
                   fission products from irradiated sample.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Krypton filled proportional counter.
                   Efficiency for 25.6 keV gammas found using
                   sample of known mass of U-235 in the sample
                   position and counting 25.6 keV peak.
                   Am-241 sources were also used for calibration.
           (GEMUC) Liquid Geiger counter to measure monitor
                   activity.
DECAY-DATA (90-TH-231,25.6HR,DG,25.6)
MONITOR    ((MONIT)16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG,,FIS)Ammonium sulphate
                   solution placed in fuel can with sample and
                   dissolved in water for counting. FISSION
                   Spectrum average cross-section for S-32 taken
                   as 60.3 mb (R.Richmond and J.A.Phillips,1958).
                   Used as flux monitor.
CORRECTION .Contribution of epi-cadmium neutrons neglected.
           .Distortion of fission spectrum due to elastic
            scattering in the moderator and inelastic scattering
            in fuel. Correction small for Th-232(N,2N) but larger
            for flux monitor, about 1.5 % .

           U-235 deposits.
