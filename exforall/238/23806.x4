METHOD         Sm-149 was produced as
            Nd-149 -> Pm -> 149 -> Sm-149.
            Change in effective cross-section per U-235 atom was
           measured. It's ratio to fission cross section was
           linearly approximated using method of least squares.

COMMENT    Of authors. We obtained really poisoning yield ( i.e.
           the yield of Sm-149 with a cross section of 76700 b)
           and we shown that this is the same as the fission yield
           of the mass 149 chain.

             Mass 149 chain yield 1.3+-0.2 %.
           (A,,M.C.Inghram+,J,PR,79,271,1950)
            1.1 % fission yield at mass number 149.
