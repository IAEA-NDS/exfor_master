INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton (Ep=80 +/- 0.6 MeV, 110 nA beam current)
           Proton beam had 200 ps wide bunches, separated by
           62.5 ns.
SAMPLE     Water in a cylindrical acrylic container
            (20.0 cm diameter, 26.5 cm length), with thickness of
           1.0 cm at ends and 0.5 cm at barrel walls.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CSICR) LaBr3(Ce) scintillator (4.5 cm diameter,
           4.5 cm length) with Hamamatsu H6410 photomultiplier
           tube (PMT) reads gamma-rays from neutron-oxygen
           reactions. Positioned 20.5 cm from acrylic vessel,
           reducing neutron background. Acceptance angle is
           0.038 sr.
           For neutron flux measurement the acrylic container
           replaced with BC-501A organic liquid scintillator
            (5" diameter, 8" length) coupled with Hamamatsu
           H6527 PMT. Neutron scattering background measured with
           OKEN CsI(Tl) crystal (3.5 X 3.5 X 3.5 cm3) and
           H6410 PMT.
           (HPGE) High-purity germanium detector
            (ORTEC GEM 20180-P) used for precise gamma-ray
           detection. The detector consists of a cylindrical
           crystal (55 mm diameter, 46 mm length) with
           9.2 mm diameter hole, 33.4 mm depth.
INC-SPECT  The neutrons in the peak region (72 to 82 MeV) used for
           the measurement.
METHOD     (PSD,TOF)
            -The pulse-shape discrimination technique employed to
            distinguish between neutron-like and gamma-ray-like
            events
            - The kinetic energy of neutron-like events was
           derived from their Time-of-Flight within the
            scintillator.
            - The SCINFUL-QMD simulation is employed to calculate
           and correct for the detector's efficiency, ensuring
           accurate measurements of neutron flux.
            -Convert the detected neutron events into neutron flux
           accounting for both the detector efficiency and the
           cross-sectional area of the target.
CORRECTION The correction factor, which converts the flux measured
           by the BC-501A detector to the flux in the gamma-ray
           measurement with water is 1.09.
           Neutron flux 1.87 X 10**10 /Sr/uC, post-correction.
