COMMENT     Of authors.
            Fe-59 capture cross-section was measured to take it's
           contribution in U-235(N,F)Fe-60 fission yield (FY upper
           limit was determined to be 1.E-10, what was derived
           from measured (2.0+-0.5)*10))-10 value of Fe60/Fe
           concentration, produced in reactor plant fuel).

INC-SPECT   FRM reactor spectrum.
           Neutron flux 1.9E+13 /cm2/sec was determined from Fe-59
           activity.
SAMPLE     1.07 mg of iron enriched to 58.4 % in Fe-58.
METHOD      Fe-59 capture cross section was determined via double
           neutron capture on Fe-58.
           Irradiation time 24 hr in FRM reactor.
           Measured concentration of Fe-60/Fe-58
            (1.0+-0.2)*10**-11.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
           article.
