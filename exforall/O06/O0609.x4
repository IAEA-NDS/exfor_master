TITLE      Fission of W Nuclei by 660-MeV Protons
AUTHOR     (V.S.BYCHENKOV,N.A.PERFILOV)
INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI )
REFERENCE  (J,YF,5,264,1967) In Russian
           (J,SNP,5,186,1967) English Translation
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
METHOD     (EXTB,FISCT).
DETECTOR   (PLATE). Photoplates with Dimensions 6*3*0.0134 Cm.
           The Beam Direction was Parallel to the Emulsion
           Surface.
SAMPLE     Natural Tungsten Nuclei were Loaded Into the
           Emulsion. Natural Silver and Bromine were the
           Constituents of the Emulsion.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION  Performed: a Loss of Fission Events During Scanning
           Of the Emulsions; Depending of the Loss Probability
           On the Track Angle; an Increase of the Amount of
           Planar Events Near the Emulsion Surface.
ADD-RES    (ANGD). Angular Distribution of Fission Fragments.
           (RANGE). Distribution of Range Ratio For the Binary
           Tracks.
           (A-DIS). Deduced Mass Distribution of Fission
           Fragments.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S). The Statistics of Fission Events.
           (ERR-1). The Uncertainty in the Correction Due to
           The Loss of Events During the Scanning of the
           Emulsions.
           (ERR-2). The Uncertainty in Geometric Corrections.
           (ERR-3). The Uncertainty of the Amount of Tungsten
           In the Emulsion.
           (ERR-4). The Uncertainty of the Proton Beam Flux.
           (ERR-T) Comment by Compiler: the Quoted Error Seems
           To be Calculated by Immediate Summation of the
           Mentioned Uncertainties, Instead of Their Squared
           Summation.

MISC-COL   (MISC1). The Number of the Observed Binary Events.
           (MISC2). The Number of the Observed Ternary Events,
           With the Third Fragment Having Z > 2.
           (MISC3). The Average Number of Light Charge
           Particles Accompanying Fission Events. The Upper
           Energy Limit For Protons to be Registered was About
           40 MeV.
