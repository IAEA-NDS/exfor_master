TITLE      The binary and ternary fission of thorium,
           lead and platinum induced by 12.2 GeV protons

SAMPLE     Natural Th,Pb and Pt were evaporated in vacuum
           onto the detector surface. Target thickness was
           300-800 Angstrom. The surface of the sample was
           parallel to the proton beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.
           Detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16.
           Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside the
           Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in
           a 4Pi geometry.
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal
           of the detector material in the course of chemical
           treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individual
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,10.) The errors in determinations of the
                        target thicknesses
           (ERR-2,,10.) the uncertainty in the proton flux
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The range ratio distributions for two-prong events.
           the distributions of the space angle between two
           tracks for three-prong events.
COMMENT    - By Authors - The binary and ternary fission induced
           by high-energy particles is defined as a decay of the
           nucleus into two resp. three fragments of approximately
           equal masses.
