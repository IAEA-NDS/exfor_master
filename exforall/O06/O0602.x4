TITLE      The Binary and Ternary Fission of Thorium,
           Lead and Platinum Induced by 12.2 GeV Protons
COMMENT    - By Authors - The Binary and Ternary Fission Induced
           By High-Energy Particles is Defined As a Decay of the
           Nucleus Into Two Resp. Three Fragments of Approximately
           Equal Masses.

SAMPLE     Natural Th,Pb and Pt were Evaporated in Vacuum
           Onto the Detector Surface.  Target Thickness was
           300-800 Angstrem.   The Surface of the Sample was
           Parallel to the Proton Beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol Polycarbonate Detectors Consisted of
           Two Sheets of a Size of 3*4*0.02 Cm Forming a Sandwich.
           Detector was Sensitive to Fragments with a>=16.
           Heavy Reaction Fragments were Stopped Inside the
           Makrofol Sheets and Could Thus be Detected in
           A 4Pi Geometry.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of  Events of About 2% Due to Removal
           Of  the  Detector  Material  in  the Course of Chemical
           Treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual Coincidences Between Two Individual
           Tracks and an Individual Track with Binary Events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Statistics of the Fission
           Events, the Uncertainties in the Target Thickness
           And the Flux Determinations.
           (ERR-S) Statistics of the Fission Events.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The Range Ratio Distributions For Two-Prong Events.
           The Distributions of the Space Angle Between Two
           Tracks For Three-Prong Events.
