TITLE      The Cross Sections For the Binary and Ternary Fission
           Of Thorium,Induced by 14,18 and 23 GeV Protons
COMMENT    - By Authors- Binary Fission Induced by High-Energy
           Particles is Defined As a Decay of Nucleus Into Two
           Fragments of Approximately Equal Masses with an Angle
           Between Their Emission Directions Larger Than 90
           Degrees. Events with Three Tracks are Defined As
           Ternary Fission Regardless of the Mechanism of Their
           Production.

SAMPLE     Thorium Layers were Evaporated in Vacuum
           Onto the Detector Surface. Target Thickness
           Was 200-500 Angstrem. The Surface of the
           Sample was Normal to the Proton Beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol Polycarbonate Detectors Consisted of
           Two Sheets of a Size of 3*4*0.02 Cm Forming a Sandwich.
           Detector was Sensitive to Fragments with a>=16.
           Heavy Reaction Fragments were Stopped Inside the
           Makrofol Sheets and Could Thus be Detected in a 4Pi
           Geometry.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of  Events of About 2% Due to Removal
           Of the Detector Material in the Course of Chemical
           Treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual Coincidences Between Two Individual
           Tracks and an Individual Track with Binary Events.
