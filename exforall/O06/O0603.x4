           of thorium induced by 14,18 and 23 GeV protons

SAMPLE     Thorium layers were evaporated in vacuum onto the
           detector surface. target thickness was 200-500 Angstrom
           The surface of the sample was normal to the
           proton beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a
           sandwich. Detector was sensitive to fragments with
           A>=16. Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside
           the Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a
           4Pi geometry.
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal
           of the detector material in the course of chemical
           treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individual
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.
COMMENT    - By Authors- Binary fission induced by high-energy
           particles is defined as a decay of nucleus into two
           fragments of approximately equal masses with an angle
           between their emission directions larger than 90 degr.
           Events with three tracks are defined as ternary fission
           regardless of the mechanism of their production.
