TITLE      An analysis of gold fission induced by high-energy
           protons
COMMENT    - By Authors - The high-energy binary and ternary
           fission is defined as a decay of a nucleus into two and
           three fragments of comparable mass, respectively.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAANL) 12.2 GeV
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER) 14, 18 and 23 GeV

SAMPLE     Layers of gold of a thickness of 200-500 Angstrom
           were evaporated in vacuum onto one of the detector
           foils on the inner side.
           The surface of the sample was parallel to the proton
           beam for the irradiation at 12.2 GeV and normal to the
           proton beam for irradiations at the other energies.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.
           Detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16. Heavy
           reaction fragments were stopped inside the Makrofol
           sheets and could thus be detected in a 4pi geometry.
CORRECTION Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal
           of the detector material in the course of chemical
           treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individual
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.

           uncertainties in the flux determination and the target

ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The range of the fragments and the distributions of
           the space angle between two tracks for two- and
           three-prong events.
