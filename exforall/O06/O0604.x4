TITLE      An Analysis of Gold Fission Induced by High-Energy
           Protons
COMMENT    - By Authors - The High-Energy Binary and Ternary
           Fission is Defined As a Decay of a Nucleus Into Two and
           Three Fragments of Comparable Mass, Respectectively.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAANL) 12.2 GeV
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER) 14, 18 and 23 GeV
REFERENCE  (J,NC/A,33,546,1976)
SAMPLE     Layers of Gold of a Thickness of 200-500 Angstrem
           Were Evapourated in Vacuum onto One of
           The Detector Foils on the Inner Side.
           The Surface of the Sample was Parallel
           To the Proton Beam For the Irradiation at 12.2 GeV
           And Normal to the Proton Beam For Irradiations at the
           Other Energies.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol Polycarbonate Detectors Consisted of
           Two Sheets of a Size of 3*4*0.02 Cm Forming a Sandwich.
           Detector was Sensitive to Fragments with a>=16.   Heavy
           Reaction  Fragments  were  Stopped  Inside the Makrofol
           Sheets and Could Thus be Detected in  a  4Pi  Geometry.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION Performed: Loss of  Events of About 2% Due to Removal
           Of the Detector Material in the Course of Chemical
           Treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual Coincidences Between Two Individual
           Tracks and an Individual Track with Binary Events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Statistics of the Fission
           Events and the Uncertainties in the Flux Determination
           And the Target Thickness.
           (ERR-S) Statistics of the Fission Events.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The Range of the Fragments and
           The Distributions of the Space Angle Between Two
           Tracks For Two- And Three-Prong Events.
