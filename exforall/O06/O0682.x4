TITLE       Cl-37(p,n)Ar-37 excitation function up to 24 MeV:
           study of (P,N) reactions.

           (20021205U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Thin NaCl targets, approx. 2 mg/cm**2 thickness, of
           natural isotopic abundances were made by vacuum
           deposition on 0.5-mm thick Al-disks. The target
           thicknesses were determined by weighing and were
           checked in some cases by chemical analysis. The
           agreement between the two methods was better than 2%.
           The targets were enclosed in Al gas cells 2.5-cm diam.,
           2.0-cm deep, having 6.3-mg/cm**2 HAVAR windows.
           In addition, three other NaCl targets were sealed
           between Ag foils under vacuum in order to check the
           reliability of the Ar-37 recovery.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Internal gas proportional counter.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USABNL)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Average beam intensities were of the order of
           a few hundred nanoampers.  Typical irradiation times
           were 30 min, approximately.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Vegas-DFF cascade evaporation calculations.
           (DECAY) Measured half-life of Ar-37 by authors was
           obtained to be 35.02+-0.02 days.  It is weighted mean
           value based on 28 measurements.
INC-SPECT  *En-rsl*.Effective energy resolution varies from
            260-KeV at 2 MeV to 200-KeV at 23.5 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).Energy uncertainty are less or equal 25 KeV.
           (ERR-1).Uncertainties in the thickness measurements.
           (ERR-2).Uncertainties in the beam intensities.
           (ERR-3).Error in the chemical recoveries.
           (ERR-4).Error in the counting efficiencies.
           (ERR-5).The error in the counting statistics.
