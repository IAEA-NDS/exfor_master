TITLE      Fission of Uranium and Tantalum Induced by 156-MeV
           Protons.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR).
SAMPLE     The Thin U Targets were Produced by Vacuum Deposition
           Of U-F4 onto Cellulose Acetate Supporting Films, About
           25 Mugramm/Cm**2 Thick, Mounted in 11*12 Cm Aluminum
           Frames. For Ta Targets the Metal was Deposited in
           Vacuum onto a Glass Surface Previoisly Coated with
           About 5 Mugramm/Cm**2 of Carbon to Facilitate Removal
           Of the Ta by Flotation on Water. The Metal Film Could
           Then be Placed in the Center of a Thin Cellulose
           Acetate Support by Raising the Support Film Under the
           Floating Ta. Target Thicknesses were About 50
           Mugramm/Cm**2 For U and About 300 Mugramm/Cm**2 For Ta.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,COINC,PHD,BCINT).
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Silicon Surface-Barrier Detectors were Used to
           Detect and Measure Energies of the Fission Fragments.
           The Sensitive Volumes were Cylindrical, Mostly About
           24 mm in Diameter and 50 Mu-Meter Thick. Detectors
           Were Mounted on Arms So That the Angles They Subtended
           At the Target Could be Changed. Detector to
           Target Distance was 30 - 40 Cm.
           Discriminators were Set to Cutoff Pulses Smaller Than
           Those Corresponding to 30-MeV Fission Fragments.
