FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR)
SAMPLE     The thin U targets were produced by vacuum deposition
           of U-F4 onto cellulose acetate supporting films, about
           25 um/cm2 thick, mounted in 11*12 cm aluminum frames.
           For Ta targets the metal was deposited in vacuum onto a
           glass surface previously coated with about 5 um/cm2 of
           carbon to facilitate removal of the Ta by flotation on
           water. The metal film could then be placed in the
           center of a thin cellulose acetate support by raising
           the support film under the floating Ta.
           Target thicknesses were about 50 um/cm2 for U and about
           300 um/cm2 for Ta.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,COINC,PHD,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detectors were used to
           detect and measure energies of the fission fragments.
           The sensitive volumes were cylindrical, mostly about
           24 mm in diameter and 50 um thick. Detectors
           were mounted on arms so that the angles they subtended
           at the target could be changed. Detector to
           target distance was 30 - 40 cm.
           Discriminators were set to cutoff pulses smaller than
           those corresponding to 30-MeV fission fragments.
           Energy calibration makes use of the results of
           Schmitt+, see REL-REF.
