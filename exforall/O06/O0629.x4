FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Silver and Bromine Niclei were the Constituents of the
           Photoemulsions.
METHOD     (FISCT,INTB,STTA).
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Nuclear Photoemulsions.
PART-DET   (FF,RCL,A,T,D,P) Photoemulsion Sensitivity Threshold
           Allowed Registration of any Charged Particle with
           Specific Energy Losses Larger Than Ones For 150-MeV
           Protons.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)47-AG-CMP(P,TOT),,SIG) Average Cross Section
           For Silver and Bromine Niclei is Given Under 'Monit'.
           Comment by Compiler: not Clear Whether Calculated or
           Experimental. No Ref. Is Given.
CORRECTION Performed: Correction to the Monitoring Measurement,
           Taking Into Account Disintegrations with the Number of
           Particles < 3, Which were not Counted.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given by Authors.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Cross Section of Production 2 Products with
           The Short Range, <15 Mumeters.
           (MISC2) Cross Section of Production 3 Products with
           The Short Range, <15 Mumeters.
           (MISC3) Cross Section of Production 4-5 Products with
           The Short Range, < 15 Mumeters.
ADD-RES    (RANGE,ANGD) Range and Angular Distributions of
           Products.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The Interactions Resulted in 2 Short-
           Range Products are Most Likely Due to Non-Fission
           Reaction Mechanisms, Probably Fragmentation. An Upper
           Limit of the Fission Cross Section was Estimated with
           The Use of Product Range Distributions.
