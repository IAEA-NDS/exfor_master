FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Silver and bromine nuclei were the constituents of the
           photoemulsions.
METHOD     (FISCT,INTB,STTA).
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Nuclear photoemulsions.
PART-DET   (FF,A,T,D,P) Photoemulsion sensitivity threshold
           allowed registration of any charged particle with
           specific energy losses larger than ones for 150-MeV
           protons.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)47-AG-CMP(P,TOT),,SIG) Average cross section
           for silver and bromine nuclei is given under 'MONIT'.
           Comment by compiler: not clear whether calculated or
           experimental. No ref. is given.
CORRECTION Performed: Correction to the monitoring measurement,
           taking into account disintegrations with the number of
           particles < 3, which were not counted.
ERR-ANALYS Not given by authors.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Cross section of production 2 products with
           the short range, <15 mumeters.
           (MISC2) Cross section of production 3 products with
           the short range, <15 mumeters.
           (MISC3) Cross section of production 4-5 products with
           the short range, <15 mumeters.
ADD-RES    (RANGE,ANGD) Range and angular distributions of
           products.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The interactions resulted in 2 short-
           range products are most likely due to non-fission
           reaction mechanisms, probably fragmentation. An upper
           limit of the fission cross section was estimated with
           the use of product range distributions.
