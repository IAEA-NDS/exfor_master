           Data on Relative Fission Yields were Taken from the
           Two Above Mentioned Ref'S and from Private
           Communications of Jones+ and Timnick+.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAORL)
SAMPLE     Stacks of Natural Uranium Metal, Thorium Metal, and U-
           235-Oxide Plated on Platinum.
METHOD     (INTB,STTA,EDEG,ACTIV,MOSEP) The Energy of the
           Incident Protons was 21.9 MeV. The Stopping Powers of
           Uranium and Thorium were Determined Experimentally
           Relative to That of Copper.
           (RCHEM,BSPEC) The Fission Product Used Most
           Consistently was Zr-97. Several Checks were Made with
           Ba-139 and Sr-91.

COMMENT    -By Authors- As a Check of the Beam Monitoring Method,
           The Cross Section of the Reaction 12-Mg-0(P,X)11-Na-22
           Was Measured Near 20 MeV. It was Found by 20% Higher
           Than the Result of Batzel+, See Rel-Ref. To Take this
           Discrepancy Into Account, the Measured Fission Cross
           Sections were Reduced by 10%.
           -By Compiler- The Discrepancy Mentioned by Authors
           Originates Most Likely from the Defect in the
           Monitoring Data, Mentioned by Hille+ - See Rel-Ref -
           The Monitor Reaction Data of Ghoshal+ are Shifted
           Systematically Towards Higher Energies by 1-1.5  MeV,
           Probably Due to the Old Stopping-Power Values Used to
           Calculate the Energy Loss in the Foils.
