TITLE      The cross sections for the binary and ternary fission
           of platinum induced by 14,18 and 23 GeV protons

SAMPLE     Platinum layer was evaporated in vacuum
           onto the detector surface. Target thickness
           was about 100 Angstrom. The surface of the
           sample was normal to the proton beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.
           detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16.
           Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside the
           Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a 4pi
           geometry.
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal
           of the detector material in the course of chemical
           treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individual
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.
COMMENT    - By Authors - Eventswith two tracks with a solid
           angle between them larger than 90 degrees, and events
           with three correlated tracks whose lengths were greater
           than 3 um were taken as binary and ternary fission
           respectively.
