TITLE      The Cross Sections For the Binary and Ternary Fission
           Of Platinum,Induced by 14,18 and 23 GeV Protons
COMMENT    - By Authors - Events with Two Tracks with a Solid
           Angle Between Them Larger Than 90 Degrees, and Events
           With Three Correlated Tracks Whose Lenths were Greater
           Than 3 Mumeters were Taken As Binary and Ternary
           Fission Respectively.

SAMPLE     Platinum Layer was Evaporated in Vacuum
           Onto the Detector Surface. Target Thickness
           Was About 100 Angstrem. The Surface of the
           Sample was Normal to the Proton Beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol Polycarbonate Detectors Consisted of
           Two Sheets of a Size of 3*4*0.02 Cm Forming a Sandwich.
           Detector was Sensitive to Fragments with a>=16.
           Heavy   Reaction  Fragments  were  Stopped  Inside  the
           Makrofol Sheets and Could Thus be  Detected  in  a  4Pi
           Geometry.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of  Events of About 2% Due to Removal
           Of the Detector Material  in  the  Course  of  Chemical
           Treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual Coincidences Between Two Individual
           Tracks and an Individual Track with Binary Events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Statistics of the Fission Events,
           The Uncertainty in the Target Thickness and the Flux
           Determinations.
           (ERR-S) Statistics of the Fission Events.
