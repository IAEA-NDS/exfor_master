TITLE      Angular distributions and fission cross-sections for
           uranium, bismuth and gold for 156-MeV protons
AUTHOR     (L.Kowalski,C.Stephan)
INSTITUTE  (2FR PAR)
REFERENCE  (J,JPR,24,901,1963) In French.
REL-REF    (R,,L.Kowalski+,J,PL,2,356,1962) The data of the same
           group on linear momentum transfer were used. A misprint
           in ref. page no. is corrected by compiler.

           (A,C0363001,L.G.Jodra+,J,PR,99,1470,1955) The integral
           fission cross sections are not compiled in the given
           EXFOR Entry.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR)
SAMPLE     Bismuth and gold layers were obtained by evaporation.
           Natural uranium layer was obtained by electro-
           pulverization. The layers were 50-300 um/cm**2
           thick, in 30-um/cm2 backings. The target was
           placed at 45 degrees in respect to the proton beam.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two surface-barrier semiconductor detectors,
           2.4 cm**2 diameter. One of the detectors was placed at
           90 deg. and the other was movable.
           (IOCH) Helium ionization chamber for beam monitoring,
           calibrated with the use of a Faraday Cup.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in target thickness determination.
           (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainty
ADD-RES    (E-DIS) Kinetic energy distribution for bismuth
           fission fragments.
