REL-REF    (R,,H.H.HECKMAN+,J,PR,117,544,1960) Range-energy
           relation for heavy ions used to deduce their
           velocities.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2ZZZCER)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) A stack of eight llford k1 emulsion of low
           sensitivity was irradiated parallelly to the pellicle
           surface.
SAMPLE     Silver and Bromine atoms were the constituents of the
           emulsion.
PART-DET   (FF) Scanning for stars with two or more tracks of
           heavy nuclear fragments, Z>5, was performed. The
           following criteria for qualification of the fragment
           tracks were used: the range of the track is greater
           than 1 mumeter, and the track is continuous over the
           last 3-4 mumeters.
METHOD     (FISCT,STTA) The direction and intensity of the beam
           were approximately determined using the k5 emulsion
           pellicles irradiated simultaneously. No further
           details given by authors.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) The number of the observed binary events.
           (MISC2) The number of the observed ternary events.
           (MISC3) The mean value of the range of fragments from
           fission-like events.
           (MISC4) The sum of the mass numbers of the fragments,
           approximate value.
           (MISC5) The mean fragment velocity, in units of the
           velocity of light.
           (MISC6) The mean velocity component along the
           direction of the beam, in units of the velocity of
           light.
           (MISC7) The forward to backward ratio for the heavy
           fragments.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not any analysis is present.
           (MISC3-ERR) No explanation is given by authors.
           (MISC6-ERR) In units of the velocity of light.
           (MISC7-ERR) No explanation is given by authors.
ADD-RES    (RANGE) The range distribution of heavy fragments.
           (ANGD) The angular distribution of heavy fragments.
           (COMP) Comparison with calculations with the use of
           different models - fragment-recoil, fission,
           simultaneous breakup.
