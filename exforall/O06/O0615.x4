           natural uranium, from delayed gamma rays analysis

REL-REF    (R,,S.C.Burnett+,J,PR/C,3,2034,1971) Authors used the
           distribution of the total average number of neutrons
           emitted from the prompt fragments in 12 MeV proton
           energy induced fission on 238-U.
           (R,O0193001,S.Baba+,J,NP/A,175,177,1971) Authors used
           the results to derive the appropriate FWHM values,
           the centers of the light and heavy peaks and the
           mass number of the centre of the whole mass
           distribution.

SAMPLE     The target assembly consisted of several natural
           uranium targets 1.2 mg/cm2 thick, each being sandwiched
           between 4.2 mg/cm2 aluminum catcher foils to stop the
           fission products and to degrade the proton beam energy.
           The targets were prepared by depositing a solution
           of uranium acetate on aluminum backings.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 15 cm3 Ge-Li detector.
METHOD     (BCINT) Relative beam monitoring.
           (EXTB,STTA,EDEG) The energy values in the stack
           were calculated from tables - See REL-REF.
           The Initial proton energy was 13.2 MeV.

MONIT-REF  (P0028001,G.R.Choppin+,J,PR,131,2149,1963) Data were
           normalized at 11.9 MeV. The cross section of the given
           reaction is not compiled in the given EXFOR Entry.
ASSUMED    The product mass distribution was constructed with
           an assumption that there are two independent modes
           of fission, symmetric and asymmetric, each of them
           of a Gaussian form.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The gamma emitters were identified by comparing
           the energy values, the half-lives and the relative
           gamma lines intensities.
ERR-ANALYS Not given.
