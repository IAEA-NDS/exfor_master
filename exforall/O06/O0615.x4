SAMPLE     The Target Assembly Consisted of Several Natural
           Uranium Targets 1.2 Mg/Cm**2 Thick, Each Being
           Sandwiched Between 4.2 Mg/Cm**2 Aluminium Catcher
           Foils to Stop the Fission Products and to Degrade
           The Proton Beam Energy. The Targets were Prepared by
           Depositing a Solution of Uranium Acetate on
           Aluminium Backings.

METHOD     (BCINT). Relative Beam Monitoring.
           (EXTB,STTA,EDEG). The Energy Values in the Stack
           Were Calculated from Tables - See Rel-Ref.
           The Initial Proton Energy was 13.2 MeV.

MONIT-REF  (P0028000,G.R.CHOPPIN+,J,PR,133,1471,1964). Data were
           Normalized at 11.9 MeV. The Cross Section of the Given
           Reaction is not Compiled in the Given EXFOR Entry.
ASSUMED    The Product Mass Distribution was Constructed with
           An Assumption That There are Two Independent Modes
           Of Fission, Symmetric and Asymmetric, Each of Them
           Of a Gaussian Form.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)  The Gamma Emitters were Identified
           By Comparing the Energy Values, the Half-Lives and the
           Relative Gamma Lines Intensities.
           (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Sections were Obtained
           By Integration of the Mass Yield Curve.
