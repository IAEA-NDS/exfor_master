TITLE      Fission of uranium, thorium and bismuth by 20 GeV
           protons

FACILITY   (SYNCH,2ZZZCER)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,FISCT)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Low sensitivity K0 Ilford emulsion, about
           400-um thick, were loaded with different
           elements under study. The beam direction was
           perpendicular to the emulsion surface.
COMMENT    -By authors- We count as fission events only single
           tracks with range >= 17 um.
SAMPLE     Uranium, thorium, and bismuth were loaded into the
           emulsions.
           Comment by compiler: the authors mentioned 238U
           among the loaded nuclei. Most likely, 238 here means
           not the pure isotope but the average atomic mass for
           natural uranium loaded.
CORRECTION  Performed: Subtraction of background estimated from
           irradiation of unloaded emulsions. Correction to
           fissions produced by secondary particles, about 35%,
           with an uncertainty of 40%.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Number of observed fission events.
ADD-RES    (RANGE) Range distributions of the tracks.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted are compounded of the
           statistical error arising from the number of events
           found, the error in the amount of loading in each
           emulsion, the scanning efficiency, an estimate for
           the accuracy of the discrimination criterion, and
           the uncertainty in the correction to fissions
           produced by secondary particles.
           Comment by compiler: the errors quoted seem to include
           also the uncertainty in the proton fluence measurement.
