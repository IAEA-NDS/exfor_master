SAMPLE     The High-Current Target Consisted of a Thin Layer of
           58-Ni Deposited Ona Wedged Copper Block.
           Isotopic Composition of Enriched Nickel Target:
           58-Ni - 99.87+/-0.02%,
           60-Ni - 0.103%,
           61-Ni - 0.004%,
           62-Ni - 0.007%,
           64-Ni - 0.016%.
           Electrodeposited Layers of 58-Ni of About 108 Mumeters
           Thickness are Obtained.
COMMENT    - By Compiler - The Target is Thick Target For Used
           Proton Beams and Obtained Products. See Fig.5 in O0673.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) Compact Cyclotron Cv28.
METHOD     (SITA) Method of Target Preparation See in the Paper.
           (ACTIV) The Proton Beam Current of About 10 Mu-A.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Due to the Exceptionally High (P,2P)
           Cross Section, the Major Part of the 57-Co is Formed
           Directly and not Via the Decay of 57-Ni.
MISC-COL   (MISC) High Limit of Major Radioactive Impurity (56-CO)
           At 100 Hours After End of Bombardment to Allow For the
           Decay of 17.54 Hours 55-Co.
