           The given references represent the studies of different
           reactions by the same group, with more experimental
           details.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Lanthanum oxide powder, about 1 g. Admixtures
           found: Pr-2-O-3 <= 0.02%, Ce-2-O-3 < 0.02%.
METHOD     (INTB,STTA,MOSEP,GSPEC,BSPEC,MAGFR)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Butt-end counters.
           (MAGSP) Magnetic analyser was used to distinguish
           electron and positron activity.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
           The sample was wrapped in an aluminum foil served as a
           monitor. No reference to the monitor cross section is
           given.
             Comment by compiler: Compiler assumes that the
           authors used the same monitor cross section value as
           in REL-REF2. This value is given in common section.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Radioisotopes were identified by half-life
           and, in some cases, by beta-radiation energy
           determined by absorption in aluminum foils
CORRECTION Performed: See REL-REF.
