FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Lanthanum Oxide Powder, About 1 Gramm. Admixtures
           Found: Pr-2-O-3 <= 0.02%, Ce-2-O-3 < 0.02%.
METHOD     (INTB,STTA,MOSEP,RCHEM,GSPEC,BSPEC,MAGFR).
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Butt-End Counters.
           (MAGSP) Magnetic Analyser was Used to Distinguish
           Electron and Positron Activity.
PART-DET   (B-,B+,DG).
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24-G,CUM/UND,SIG,,,EXP)
           The Sample was Wrapped in an Aluminium Foil Served As a
           Monitor. No Reference to the Monitor Cross Section is
           Given. Comment by Compiler: Compiler Assumes That the
           Authors Used the Same Monitor Cross Section Value As
           In Rel-Ref2. This Value is Given in Common Section.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Radioisotopes were Indentified by Half-Life
           And, in Some Cases, by Beta-Radiation Energy
           Determined by Absorption in Aluminium Foils.
           (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Section was Determined
           From the Integrated Area Under the Mass Yield Curve.
CORRECTION Performed: See Rel-Ref.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given.
