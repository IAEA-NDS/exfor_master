REFERENCE  (J,ZET,38,716,1960) In Russian
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
METHOD     (INTB,FISCT).
DETECTOR   (PLATE). Nuclear Emulsions of P-9Ch Type.
SAMPLE     Natural Uranium was Loaded Into the Emulsion Layers.
PART-DET   (FF)
COMMENT    -By Authors- An Event was Considered As Binary Fission
           If the Following Two Criteria were Fulfilled:
            - The Event Included Two Tracks with Darkening
           Intensity Similar to Fission Tracks Caused by Thermal
           Neutrons;
            - The Ratio of Ranges For the Light and Heavy
           Fragment was Less Than 2.
CORRECTION  Performed: Rough Estimation of Correction Due to
           Fissions Induced by Secondary Particles.
MISC-COL   (MISC1). Uncorrected Cross Section.
           (MISC2). Correction Due to Fissions Induced by
           Secondary Particles.
           (MISC3). Total Number of Analyzed Fission Events.
ERR-ANALYS No Errors are Assigned to the Quoted Final Data.
ADD-RES    (RANGE). Distribution of Binary Fission Events on the
           Ratio of Fragment Ranges.
           (ANGD). Angular Distribution of Binary Fission
           Fragments.
