FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)

SAMPLE     Natural uranium was loaded into the emulsion layers.

COMMENT    -By Authors- An event was considered as binary fission
           if the following two criteria were fulfilled:
            - the Event included two tracks with darkening
           intensity similar to fission tracks caused by thermal
           neutrons;
            - the ratio of ranges for the light and heavy
           fragment was less than 2.
CORRECTION  Performed: Rough estimation of correction due to
           fissions induced by secondary particles.
MISC-COL   (MISC1). Uncorrected cross section.
           (MISC2). Correction due to fissions induced by
           secondary particles.
           (MISC3). Total number of analyzed fission events.
ERR-ANALYS No Errors are assigned to the quoted final data.
ADD-RES    (RANGE). Distribution of binary fission events on the
           ratio of fragment ranges.
           (ANGD). Angular distribution of binary fission
           fragments.
