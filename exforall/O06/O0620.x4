TITLE       Radiochemical study of deep spallation and fission
            of tantalum by 680-MeV protons

FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Metal tantalum plates about 0.1 mm thick, and about
           25*5 mm**2 size. The only admixture was niobium, less
           than 0,01%.
METHOD     (INTB,ACTIV,MOSEP,GSPEC,BSPEC)
DETECTOR   (NAICR,CSICR)
           Chemically separated isotopes were identified by
           half-life, by beta-radiation absorption in aluminium
           and by gamma- spectra.
           (PROPC) the absolute activity of separated products
           was determined with end-window counter.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
           (AREA) To obtain fission cross section, total
            production cross sections for masses=40-115 were
            summed and divided by 2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainties
ADD-RES    (A-DIS) Isotope production cross sections. From the
           text: The experimental data for the products of
           fission and deep spallation will be analyzed and
           discussed later.
           (COMP) With semi-empirical formulae for isotope
           production.
