TITLE      A Radiochemical Study of Spallation and Fission
           Reactions in Tantalum Induced by 680-MeV Protons.

INSTITUTE  (4CCPCCP)
REFERENCE  (J,RAK,4,470,1962) In Russian.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Metal Tantalum Plates About 0.1 mm Thick, and About
           25*5 mm**2 Size. The Only Admixture was Niobium, Less
           Than 0,01%.
METHOD     (INTB,ACTIV,MOSEP,RCHEM,GSPEC,BSPEC).
DETECTOR   (NAICR).
           (CSICR).
           Chemically Separated Isotopes were Identified by
           Half-Life, by Beta-Radiation Absorbtion in Aluminium
           And by Gamma- Spectra.
           (PROPC) The Absolute Activity of Separated Products
           Was Determined with Butt-End Counter.

MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,CUM/UND,SIG,,,EXP)
           Monitor Data Source is not Given.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
           (AREA) To Obtain Fission Cross Section, Total
            Production Cross Sections For Masses=40-115 were
            Summed and Divided by 2.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given.
ADD-RES    (A-DIS) Isotope Production Cross Sections.
           (COMP) With Semi-Empirical Formulae For Isotope
           Production.
