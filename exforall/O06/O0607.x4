METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,FISCT).
DETECTOR   (PLATE).Low Sensitivity Pellicles Loaded with Different
           Elements Under Study were Prepared,Starting from Ilford
           K0 Emulsion in Gel Form. The Loaded and Unloaded
           Pellicles were Irradiated As Stacks. Each Stack
           Consisted of 3 400-Mumeter-Thick Pellicles,with Each
           Pellicle Loaded with a Different Element. The Beam
           Direction was Perpendicular to the Stack Surface For
           The Fission Cross Section Measurements.
           (IOCH) The
           Ionization Chamber was Used For Relative Monitoring of
           The Proton Beam.
SAMPLE     Natural Silver was a Constituent of the Emulsion.
           Uranium, Thorium, Bismuth and Tungsten were Loaded Into
           The Emulsion Pellicles.
           Comment by Compiler: the Authors Mentioned 238-U and
           184-W Among the Loaded Nuclei.
           Most Likely, 238 and 184 Here
           Mean not the Pure Isotopes But the Average Atomic Mass
           For Natural Uranium and Tungsten Loaded.

           Indeed, this Error on Absolute Proton Flux at the Stack
           Location was Estimated to be of Thr Order Od a Factor
           2, So That We Could not Rely on It For Absolute Cross
           Section Measurements. - Comment by Authors -

           Comment by Compiler: this Uncertainty May be
           Underestimated by Authors.

           Comment by Authors: the Quoted Uncertainty Could be
           Underestimated.
          1(ERR-T). The Quoted Errors Include the Statistics of
           Fission Events, the Uncertainty in the Loading Density
           And the Uncertainty of the Exposure Doses.
          2(ERR-T). The Quoted Errors Include the Statistics of
           Fission Events, the Uncertainty in the Loading Density,

           Uncertainty of the Adopted Monitor Cross Section.

ASSUMED    The Data are Obtained by Supposing That All
           Fissions Observed in Unloaded Emulsions are the Ones
           Of Silver Nuclei. Thus the Quoted Values are Given
           As Upper Limits.
