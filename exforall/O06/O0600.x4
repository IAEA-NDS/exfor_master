TITLE       An Analysis of the Binary and Ternary
           Fission of Uranium Induced by 12.2 GeV
           Protons
COMMENT    -By Authors- We Mean by Binary Fission Those Events in
           Which Two Fragments of a>16 are Produced with an Angle
           Between Larger Than 90 Angular Degrees.

SAMPLE      A Layer of Natural Uranium of a
           Thickness of (1.2+-0.10)*10**3 Angstrem was Evapourated
           In Vacuum onto One of the Detector Foils on  the  Inner
           Side.
           The  Surface  of  the Sample was Parallel to the Proton
           Beam.
METHOD     (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol Polycarbonate Detectors Consisted of
           Two Sheets of a Size of 3*4*0.02 Cm Forming a Sandwich.
           Detector was Sensitive to Fragments with a>=16.
           Heavy Reaction Fragments were Stopped Inside the
           Makrofol Sheets and Could Thus be Detected in a 4Pi
           Geometry.
PART-DET   (FF)
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of  Events of About 2% Due to Removal
           Of the Detector Material  in  the  Course  of  Chemical
           Treatment.
           Negligible:  Casual Coincidences Between Two Individual
           Tracks and an Individual Track with Binary Events.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Includes Statistics of the Fission
           Events and the Uncertainties in the Flux Determination
           And the Target Thickness.
           (ERR-S) Statistics of the Fission Events.
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
           The Range Ratio Distributions For Two-Prong Events.
           The Distributions of the Space Angle Between Two
           Tracks For Two- And Three-Prong Events.
