REL-REF    (R,,R.A.ARNDT+,J,PR/D,28,97,1983) The Computer Code

           Was Used For Calculation of N-P Cross Sections Needed
           For Reconstruction of Neutron Spectrum.
ADD-RES    C-12(N,P)B-12 Double Differential Cross Section at a
           Neutron Energy of 100 MeV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDUPP) Gustaf Werner Cyclotron of the
           Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala.
SAMPLE     7-Li Discs, 100-200 Mg/Cm2 Thick, 99.984% Enrichment,
           Were Used For Neutron Production.
           Four 95-Mg/Cm2 Thick Targets of C-H-2 or Four 85-
           Mg/Cm2 Thick Carbon Targets, and a Reference 50-Mg/Cm2
           C-H-2 Foil were Used For Measurements of Neutron
           Energy Spectrum by Means of N-P Reaction.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Multiwire Proportional Chambers were Mounted
           Between the C-H-2 and Carbon Targets to Determine in
           Which Layer the Reaction Occurs and Thus to Correct
           For the Energy Losses of the Recoil Protons in the
           Subsequent Targets.
           (MAGSP) Dipole Magnet For Momentum Analysis of Recoil
           Protons.
           (MWPC) Four Position-Sensitive Drift Chambers, Two in
           Front and Two Behind the Dipole Magnet, are Used to
           Determine the Energy and Emission Angle of the Recoil
           Protons.
           (COIN,SCIN,SCIN,SCIN) The Event was Generated by
           Triple Coincidence Between Plastic Scintillators: a
           Thin One Placed Downstream the N-P Targets and Two
           Thicker Ones Behind the Last Drift Chamber.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) Proton Beam Focussed to a Diameter of
           About 5 mm in the Lithium Target. The Unaffected
           Proton Beam was Bent by a Magnet Into a Well-Shielded
           Beam Dump, While the Neutrons were Collimated in a
           Narrow Cone at 0 Degrees by a Collimator System,
           Before Entering the Experimental Area About 8 M After
           The Production Target. The Neutron Beam Spot at the
           Irradiation Position had a Diameter of 7 Cm.
           (TOF,COINC,PHD).
CORRECTION Performed: Events Due to Protons Contaminating the
           Neutron Beam, and Due to N-P Reactions in Construction
           Materials.
ANALYSIS   Recoil Proton Spectra from Neutron Scattering on
           Hydrogen were Obtained by Subtracting Carbon Spectra
           From Those of C-H-2 After Normalization. Then the
           Neutron Spectrum was Reconstructed with the Use of N-P
           Cross Section Values - See Rel-Ref.
