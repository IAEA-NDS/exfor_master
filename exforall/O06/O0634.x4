           The Given Experimens Used Solid State Detectors. The
           Agreement is Within 40% According to the Authors.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,EDEG,BCINT,REC,CHSEP). An Aluminium Foil,
           0.005 Inch Thick, Between Each Sandwich Served to
           Degrade the Proton Beam Energy. The Initial Proton
           Energy was 12.0 MeV. For Stopping Power Tables See Rel-
           Ref. Fission Occured Mainly in the Thirst 100-200 KeV
           Thickness of the Targets. The Energy Listed is the
           Calculated Entering Energy For Each Target.
DETECTOR  1(PROPC) Windowless 2-Pi Proportional Counter.
          2(NAICR) Na-I-Tl Scintilation Crystal.
PART-DET  1(B-).
          2(DG).
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Analysis of a Composite Beta-Decay Curve Into
           Its Components.
           (AREA) Total Fission Cross Sections were Obtained by
           Integrating Under the Mass Yield Curves.
CORRECTION Performed: For Backscattering, Self-Absorption and
           Selfscattering, Geometry and Counting Efficiency.
COMMENT    By Authors - Proportional Counting Provided the Bulk
           Of the Data.
           By Compiler - No Corrections were Considered For
           Effective Proton Energy in the Targets. Not Clear
           Whether and How the Correction For Momentum Transfer
           Was Applied.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Uncertainty in the Calculated Entering Energy
           For Each Target.
           No Analysis is Given For Total Fission Cross Section
           Uncertainties.

REACTION   (92-U-238(P,F),,SIG,,,EXP)
SAMPLE     The High Purity Uranium-238 Metal. Admixture of U-235
           Is Less Than 0.4%. Circular Targets, 0.75 Inch Diam.,
           0.001 Inch Thick. A Target Assembly Consisted of Three
           Uranium Targets Each of Which was Sandwiched Between
           Aluminium Recoil Catcher Foils, 0.001 Inch Thick,
           Which Stopped All the Activity.
