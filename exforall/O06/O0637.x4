           Decay Data For Fission Products were Taken from the
           Two Above Given Ref.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2NEDAMS)
SAMPLE     Thin Layers of Neptunium-237, Prepared by
           Electroplating on Aluminium, were Covered with Thin
           Aluminium Foils. Each of these Sandwiches was
           Protected Against Contamination by an Extra Aluminium
           Foil on Either Side. Three of these Sandwiches were
           Combined with Aluminium Energy Degrader Discs and
           Copper Beam Monitors.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,EDEG,ACTIV,MOSEP,REC) Proton Beam of 28 MeV
           Entered the Stack. No Reference to Stopping Power
           Tables is Given.
           (RCHEM,GSPEC) The Chemical Separations Prior to Gamma-
           Spectrometry were Used For Isolation of Ag, Cd, and
           Rare-Earth Fractions.
           (FPGAM) Direct Gamma-Spectrometry was Used For the
           Other Fission Products.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge-Li Detector.
PART-DET   (DG).
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(P,N+P)29-CU-64,UND,SIG,,,EXP) Triple
           Copper Foils were Placed in the Stack.  The Outer Foils
           Served to Compensate For Recoil Losses.
MONIT-REF  (B0072002,B.L.COHEN+,J,PR,94,620,1954) Used For
           Relative Energy Dependence Only.
           (,T.MCGEE+,J,JIN,34,3323,1972) Used For Absolute
           Normalization Cohen'S Data at 20. MeV.
           (B0001004,G.B.SAHA+,J,PR,144,962,1966) Used For
           Absolute Normalization Cohen'S Data at 21.5 MeV.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The Absolute Normalization Resulted in
           Multiplication of the Data of B.L.Cohen+ by 0.585.
CRITIQUE   -By Compiler- The Specified Product of the Absolute
           Monitor Reaction Could be Formed Also Through 29-Cu-
           63(N,G) Reaction Due to Low-Energy Neutron Background.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Total Fission Cross Section are Obtained by
           Summing the Cross Sections For All Production Cross
           Sections in the Light Fission Product Peak.

COMMENT    -By Compiler- The Data Given Under 'Data2' Represent
           The Average Curve Given by Authors. No Details of
           Averaging Procedure are Available.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total Error of the Average Curve Given by
           Authors. It Does not Include the Error in the Monitor
           Reaction Cross Section.
           (ERR-1) Data Reader Uncertainty.
FLAG       (1.) These Points Given Under 'Data1' are All Taken
           From One Irradiation. They Lie a Little Higher Than
           The Remaining Ones. This May Well Reflect a Systematic
           Error For That One Experiment - Commented by Authors.
