FACILITY   (SYNCH,2FR SAC)
SAMPLE     Self-Supporting Targets, About 1 Mg/Cm**2 Thick, were
           Made by Evaporation For Gold and by Rolling For
           Thorium. The Targets were Oriented at 45 Degrees with
           Respect to the Beam Direction.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,COINC)
           (EDE) 'E/Delta E' Information was Used to Separate
           Fission Fragments from Lighter Nuclei.
           (BCINT) Faraday Cup was Used at the Lowest Energies.
           At Higher Energies, a Secondary-Electron-Emission
           Detector was Used, Calibrated with the Use of the
           Faraday Cup.
DETECTOR   (COIN,IOCH,IOCH) Two Identical Position-Sensitive
           Ionization Chambers. One of Them was Movable in a
           Vertical Plane, from -2 to +12 Degrees, and was Placed
           At Angle -90 Degrees with Respect to the Beam
           Direction. The Second One was Movable in a Horizontal
           Plane from 10 to 170 Degrees on the Opposite Side of
           The Beam and had an Angular Aperture of 8 Degrees.
PART-DET   (FF).
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) Fission Cross Sections were Obtained by
           Integrating the Fission Fragment Angular
           Distributions.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Upper Limit of Mean Spin of the Fissioning
           Nuclei, Deduced from Fragment Angular Distributions,
           In Units of the Reduced Plank'S Constant.
           (MISC2) Mean Longitudinal Linear Momentum Transferred
           From Projectile to the Fissioning Nucleus, from
           Angular Distribution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Complete Analysis is not Given by Authors.
           (MISC2-ERR) No Analysis is Given by Authors.
ADD-RES    (ANGD) In-Plane and Out-Plane Angular Correlations
           Between the Two Fission Fragments. Fission Fragment
           Angular Distributions.
           (THEO) Intra-Nuclear Cascade Calculations.
