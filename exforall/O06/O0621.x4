FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU)
SAMPLE     Circular Targets, 1.84 Cm Diameter, were Cut from 1.5
           Mm Thick Natural Thorium Foil. To Prevent the Loss of
           Fission Products Recoiling from the Front and Back
           Surfaces, the Targets were Mounted Between Two Pure
           Aluminium Catcher Foils of 1 mm Thickness.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT,REC,RCHEM,GSPEC,BSPEC)
           Beam Energy Degradation Through the Target Assembly
           Was Calculated from Range-Energy Tables - See Rel-Ref.
DETECTOR  1(PROPC) Windowless 2Pi-Flow Proportional Counter.
          2(NAICR) Na-I Crystal.
PART-DET  1(B-)
          2(DG)
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Sections were
           Determined from the Integrated Area Under the Mass
           Yield Curves.
           (DECAY).
ERR-ANALYS Not Given.
COMMENT    - By Authors - Mean Energy of the Incident Particles in
           The Target is Listed in the Data Section.
