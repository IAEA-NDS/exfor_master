SAMPLE     Circular targets, 1.84 cm diam., were cut from 1.5 mm
           thick natural thorium foil. To prevent the loss of
           fission products recoiling from the front and back
           surfaces, the targets were mounted between two pure
           aluminum catcher foils of 1 mm thickness.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT,REC,CHSEP,GSPEC,BSPEC)
           Beam energy degradation through the target assembly
           was calculated from range-energy tables - see REL-REF.
DETECTOR  1(PROPC) Windowless 2Pi-flow proportional counter.

REL-REF    (D,P0028002,G.R.Choppin+,J,PR,131,2149,1963) This
           experiment used solid state detectors.
           (R,O0661002,H.A.Tewes+,J,PR,88,860,1952) Data are used
           to construct mass distribution curve for proton beam.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The total fission cross sections were
           determined from the integrated area under the mass
           yield curves.
           In order to determine the fractional chain yield for
           each nuclide, the cumulative yield for each of their
           respective mass chains must be known. For this goal:
             * mass yield curves at 9.3 MeV from Tewes and James
            (see REL-REF) normalized to present data at mass
            number 83, measured as 83Br;
             * mass yield curve at 11.5 MeV was compiled by
           plotting the data for each mass chain given by Tewes
           and James (see REL-REF) for 6.3,9.3,13.3, and 17.8 MeV
           proton energies and interpolating at 11.3 MeV.

             the mass yield curve for 11.5 MeV deuteron fission

            (see REL-REF) for the 9.5 MeV deuteron fission of

           measuring the cumulative yields of masses 83,
