REFERENCE  (J,PR,109,1779,1958)
           (J,JET,2,116,1956) Experiment at 660 MeV.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Photographic plates. Sensitivity threshold
           corresponded to 50-MeV protons.

           study of the same group with overlapping data.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The observed triple events might be
           subdivided into two types:
           Type 1 includes the events in which all three
           particles have comparable ranges and charges.
           Type 2 includes the events in which one of the three
           multicharged particles possesses much greater range
           than the other two.
           -by compiler- the data given under column 'DATA'
           relate to the triple events of type 2.
           -By Compiler- The data given under column 'DATA'
           relate to the triple events of type 2.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Ratio of the yields for the triple events of
           type 2 and type 1.
           (MISC2) The forward/backward ratio for the light
           multicharged fragments in the triple events of type 2.
           (MISC3) The mean charge of light fragments in the
           triple events of type 2
           (MISC4) Number of observed triple events of type 2.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given.
ADD-RES    (Z-DIS) Distribution of charge of light fragments in
           the triple events of type 2.
