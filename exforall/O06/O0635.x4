COMMENT    -By Authors- The Observed Triple Events Might be
           Subdivided Into Two Types:
           Type 1 Includes the Events in Which All Three
           Particles have Comparable Ranges and Charges.
           Type 2 Includes the Events in Which One of the Three
           Multicharged Particles Possesses Much Greater Range
           Than the Other Two.
           -By Compiler- The Data Given Under Column 'Data'
           Relate to the Triple Events of Type 2.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Ratio of the Yields For the Triple Events of
           Type 2 and Type 1.
           (MISC2) The Forward/Backward Ratio For the Light
           Multicharged Fragments in the Triple Events of Type 2.
           (MISC3) The Mean Charge of Light Fragments in the
           Triple Events of Type 2.
           (MISC4) Number of Observed Triple Events of Type 2.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given by Authors.
ADD-RES    (Z-DIS) Distribution of Charge of Light Fragments in
           The Triple Events of Type 2.
