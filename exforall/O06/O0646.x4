SAMPLE     Six U-238 Targets, 0.5-1.5 Mg/Cm**2 Thick, Painted on
           0.1-Mm Thick Aluminum Backings and Covered with 0.05-
           Mm Thick Aluminum Catcher Foils, were Pressed Together
           In a Target Holder to Form a 0.9-Mm Thick Stack.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,ACTIV,REC)
           (EDEG) Initial Proton Energy was 18.4 MeV. For Range-
           Energy Relations, See Rel-Ref.
           (BCINT) A Faraday Cup was Formed by Targets Housing
           Parts.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A High-Purity Germanium Detector with a
           Resolution of 1.8 KeV Fwhm at 1332 KeV.
PART-DET   (DG)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay Rates were Used to Confirm
           Identification of the Peaks.
           (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Sections were Derived
           From the Mass Distributions.
CORRECTION Negligible: Coincidence Summing and Positioning
           Errors.
ERR-ANALYS Complete Analysis is not Given by Authors.
