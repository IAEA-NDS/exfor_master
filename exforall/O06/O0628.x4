FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU)
SAMPLE     Circular Targets of 2.15 Cm Diam., Approx.1.5 mm
           Thick, were Cut from Natural Thorium Foils and Placed
           Between Two 1.0 mm Aluminum Catcher Foils.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT,REC,RCHEM,GSPEC,FPGAM).
DETECTOR   (GELI) 20 Cm**3, True Coaxial, Ge-Li Detector. 2.3
           KeV Resolution at 1.33 MeV.
PART-DET   (DG)
MONITOR    (90-TH-232(P,F)42-MO-99,CUM,SIG,,,EXP)
           Relative Monitor.
           Beam Current Measurement was Checked by Monitoring the
           Mo-99 Yield For Each Irradiation.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The Absolute Total Fission Cross Section was
           Obtained by Integration of One-Half the Mass Yield
           Curve.
CORRECTION Negligible: Interfering Impurities from the Aluminum
           Catcher Foils.
ERR-ANALYS Not Given by Authors.
ADD-RES    (A-DIS,Z-DIS) Cumulative Chain Cross Sections.
           Individual Formation Cross Sections. Fractional Chain
           Yields.
