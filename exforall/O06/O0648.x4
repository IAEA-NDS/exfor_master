FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAHRV)
SAMPLE     Targets, 100 Mg/Cm**2 Thick, 1*2 Cm Size, were
           Prepared from Bismuth Metal. Impurities, by Weight:
           Uranium, 1.5*10**-6; Zinc,1.9+-0.3*10**-6.
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,ACTIV,MOSEP,REC,RCHEM,BSPEC).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Flow Beta Geiger Counters. For Details See Rel-
           Ref.
PART-DET   (B-).
MONITOR    (83-BI-209(P,F)38-SR-91,CUM,SIG,,,EXP) Relative
           Monitor.
           ((MONIT)29-CU-65(P,N+P)29-CU-64,UND,SIG,,,EXP)
           Absolute Monitor.
MONIT-REF  (B0054006,J.W.MEADOWS JR.+,J,PR,91,885,1953) For
           Absolute Monitor.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Nuclides were Identified by Chemical Behavior,
           Half-Life, and Beta Absorption Curves.
           (AREA) Total Fission Cross Sections were Obtained by
           Summing the Mass Distributions.
CORRECTION  Performed: Recoil Loss of Bismuth Fission Fragments,
           Never More Than 0.5%.
            Negligible: Formation of the Studied Products in
           Interactions with the Uranium and Zinc Impurities.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The Incident Energy Values Quoted Here
           Are Most Probable Values. The Spread in Energy is
           About 10 MeV.
           -By Compiler- A Correction Should have Been Performed
           That Takes Into Account a Strong Energy Dependence of
           The Fission Cross Section.
           -By Compiler- The Specified Product of the Absolute
           Monitor Reaction Could be Formed Also Through 29-Cu-
           63(N,G) Reaction Due to Low-Energy Neutron Background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Complete Analysis is not Given by Authors.
           The Quoted Errors do not Include the Uncertainties in
           The Monitor Cross Section.
