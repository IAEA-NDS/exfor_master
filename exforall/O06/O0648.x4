FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAHRV)
SAMPLE     Targets, 100 mg/cm**2 thick, 1*2 cm size, were
           prepared from bismuth metal. Impurities, by weight:
           uranium, 1.5*10**(-6); zinc,1.9+-0.3*10**(-6).
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,ACTIV,MOSEP,REC,RCHEM,BSPEC).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Flow beta geiger counters. For details see
           REL-REF.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Nuclides were identified by chemical behavior,
           half-life, and beta absorption curves.
           (AREA) Total fission cross sections were obtained by
           summing the mass distributions.
CORRECTION  Performed: Recoil loss of bismuth fission fragments,
           never more Than 0.5%.
            Negligible: Formation of the studied products in
           interactions with the uranium and zinc impurities.
COMMENT    -By Authors- The incident energy values quoted here
           are most probable values. The spread in energy is
           about 10 MeV.
           -By Compiler- A correction should have been performed
           that takes into account a strong energy dependence of
           The fission cross section.
           -By Compiler- The specified product of the absolute
           monitor reaction could be formed also through
           Cu-63(n,gamma) reaction due to low-energy neutron
           background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Complete analysis is not given by authors.
           The Quoted errors do not include the uncertainties in
           the monitor cross section.
ADD-RES    (A-DIS) Fission product yields.
