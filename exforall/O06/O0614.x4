SAMPLE     Targets were Fabricated by Vacuum Evaporation of U-
           F(4),Metallic Tb,La-F(3) And Metallic Ag. The Silver
           Samples were Self-Supporting, the Others Supported
           By 40 Mugramm/Cm**2 Thick Carbon Foils. Aluminium
           Frames with a 20 mm Diameter Circular Hole
           Determined the Size of the Samples.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT,TOF,COINC,PHD,ACTIV,MOSEP).
DETECTOR   (COIN,SOLST,SOLST). Two Si Surface Barrier Detectors
           Of the Heavy Ion Type Placed on Two Moveable Arms.
           One Arm was Kept Fixed at 90 Degrees with Respect to
           The Incoming Proton Beam, the Other Moved in Plane
           To the Desired Position.
           A Transmission Start Detector Placed on the Fixed
           Arm 10 Cm in Front of the Si Detector. The Start
           Detector Consists of Two 10 Mugramm/Cm**2 Thick
           Carbon Foils from Which Electrons are Emitted on the
           Passage of Heavy Ions.
