FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER)
SAMPLE     Targets were fabricated by vacuum evaporation of
           U-F(4), metallic Tb,La-F(3) and metallic Ag. The silver
           samples were self-supporting, the others supported
           by 40 um/cm**2 thick carbon foils. Aluminium
           frames with a 20 mm diameter circular hole
           determined the size of the samples.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,FISCT,TOF,COINC,PHD,ACTIV,MOSEP)
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two Si surface barrier detectors
           of the heavy ion type placed on two moveable arms.
           One arm was kept fixed at 90 degrees with respect to
           the incoming proton beam, the other moved in plane
           to the desired position.
           A transmission start detector placed on the fixed
           arm 10 cm in front of the Si detector. The start
           detector consists of two 10 um/cm**2 thick carbon foils
           from which electrons are emitted on the passage of
           heavy ions.
ADD-RES    (E-DIS) The average single fragment and total kinetic
           energies shown versus the mass number for Ag, La and Tb
           (ANGD) Coincidence rate as a function of the angle
           between the silicon detectors.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The total systematic error
