TITLE      Fission cross sections of heavy nuclei induced by
           300 GeV protons with the help of plastic detector
AUTHOR     (M.Debeauvais,J.Tripier,S.Jokic)
INSTITUTE  (2FR STR)
REFERENCE  (C,76NEUHER,2,1179,1976)
           76Neuher = 9th International Conference on
           Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors,
           Neuherberg/Munchen, September 30 - October 6,1976.
REL-REF    (N,O0037001,M.Debeauvais+,J,PR/C,23,1624,1981) The data
           at 200 and 300 GeV were later corrected by authors and
           published in this reference.
           (D,O0644001,J.Hudis+,J,PR/C,13,1961,1976) Ratio of
           ternary to binary fission data of the authors are by
           far superior than those found. by J.Hudis and S.Katcoff
           and cannot be compared because of the difference of
           sensitivity of the detector. - Comment by authors.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER) 0.59, 18 and 23 GeV.
           (SYNCY,2FR SAC) 2 and 3 GeV.
           (CYCLO,1USANAL) 300 GeV
DETECTOR   (TRD) Two sheets of polycarbonate detectors, 200 um
           thick, with a fissile target in between.
           The detectors registered only ions with Z >= 8 with a
           length > 5 um.
           (PROPC) A calibrated end-window proportional counter
           was used for the monitoring measurement.
SAMPLE     Targets, 15-100 um/cm**2 thick, were prepared by
           vacuum evaporation of uranium fluoride, thorium
           fluoride or metal bismuth upon one of the detector
           sheets.
METHOD     (EXTB,FISCT,SITA,MOSEP)
           (COINC) After development, the fission fragment
           detectors were put in their initial position, with a
           precision of a few microns. Then, correlated tracks
           were observed and counted with a microscope.

COMMENT    -By Compiler- The values in Tabl.3 are obviously given
           in percents, although it is not explicitly stated by
           authors.
           - By authors - In this work, we shall limit ourselves
           in giving the first results obtained on U, Th and Bi
           targets, without making a complete physical analyze.
HISTORY    (19980216C) By Khlopin's Institute - A.P.
           (19980604A) Data for uranium are included.
           (19980605A) The data at 200 and 300 GeV in Subent 004
           are excluded because they are superceded in a later
           work of the same author, See 'Rel-Ref' - A.P.
           (19980625U) Last checking has been done.
