           Calculation of Response Functions of an Ne-213 Neutron
           Detector For 15-61.5 MeV.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAORL) Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Metallic Lithium Target, Isotopically Enriched to 99.3
           Weight Percent Li-7, 0.3 Cm Thick, was Mounted in an
           Aluminium Frame of a 1.6-Cm Aperture.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) The Beam Spot Diameter in the Target was
           Less Than 1 Cm.
           (TOF) Neutron Time-Of-Flight Path of 4 Meters.
           (COINC)
           (PSD) Pulse-Shape Discrimination was Used to Reduce
           Gamma-Ray Background.
           (MOSEP) A 2-Mg/Cm2 Mylar Film Placed Upstream the
           Target, For Beam Monitoring by Detection of Scattered
           Particles. Used For the 64-MeV Run Only.
           (BCINT) Faraday Cup was Used For Absolute Calibration
           Of the Beam Monitors.
DETECTOR  1(COIN,SCIN,SCIN) A 7.62 Cm Diameter, 7.62 Cm Long Ne-
           213 Liquid Scintillator was Positioned So That
           Neutrons Entered Along Its Axis. A 3-Mm Ne-102 Plastic
           Scintillator was Mounted in Front of the Ne-213 and
           Operated in Anti-Coincidence Mode to Veto Pulses from
           Charged Particles. For the 64-MeV Measurement, a 1.43-
           Cm Aluminium Plate was Placed 12.7 Cm in Front of the
           Detector to Get Rid of Protons Scattered from the
           Lithium Target.
          2(IOCH) An Ionization Chamber, with Total Thickness of
           101 Mg/Cm2 Aluminium Equivalent, was Placed
           Immediately Upstream the Neutron Production Target For
           Proton Beam Monitoring. This Configuration was Used
           For the 41-MeV Experiment.
          3(IOCH) The Same Chamber was Placed Aside the Primary
           Beam and Served As a Monitor Detecting Protons
           Scattered by the Thin Mylar Film, See 'Method'. This
           Configuration was Used Only For the 64-MeV Experiment.
           (SCIN) A Ne-102 Plastic Scintillator was Used For
           Proton Beam Monitoring Only For the 64-MeV Experiment.
           It was Placed Aside the Primary Beam and Detected
           Protons Scattered by the Thin Mylar Film, See
           'Method'.
           For Further Details See Rel-Ref.
PART-DET  1(N).
          2(P) Protons of the Primary Beam.
          3(P) Protons Scattered by the Monitor Film.
MONITOR    Faraday Cup was Used For Absolute Calibration of the
           Beam Monitors Described in 'Detector'.
CORRECTION Performed: For Neutrons Produced in the Beam Monitor
           Film, the Ionization Chamber, and the Target Frame, by
           Making Empty-Target Measurements.
           For Change of Efficiency Due to Neutron Interactions
           In the Aluminium Plate Upstream the Neutron Detector.
           Negligible: For P-N Reactions in the Aluminium Plate.
