FACILITY   (SYNCY,4RUSLIN)
SAMPLE     The targets of Au, W, Ag and Ni were self-supporting.
           The targets of Bi and Sb were vacuum evaporated onto
           a thin Ni foil, 80 um/cm2, and carbon foil, 40 um/cm2,
           respectively. The thicknesses of all targets were
           from 200 to 500 um/cm2.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF,ACTIV,MOSEP,EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (COIN,SI,SI) Two-arm detection system with Si-Au
           detectors in both arms = variant 1.
           (COIN,PS,GEMUC) Two-arm detection system with Si-Au
           detectors in one arm and a position-sensitive
           parallel plate avalanche counter in another arm =
           variant 2.
           Either variant 1 or 2 was used in different
           experiments.
           (GEMUC) Double-grid parallel plate avalanche counter
           was used as a start detector in both variants.
           (COIN,SI,SI) Two Si-Au detectors for beam
           monitoring with Au target.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
           Monitor used for the absolute calibration.
           (79-AU-197(P,F),,SIG) Relative monitor.
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.Cumming,J,ARN,13,261,1963) For the
           absolute monitor.
CORRECTION  Performed: the pulse height defect in the solid
           state detectors was determined according to the
           procedure suggested by Kaufman et al.,, see REL-REF.
            The energy losses of the fission fragments in the
           target, the backing and the start detector were
           taken into account using the stopping power data
           from Northcliffe et al., see REL-REF.
           The random coincidences were eliminated in off-line
           analysis.
ADD-RES    (ANGD) Angular correlations of fission fragments.
           (COMP) Comparison with results calculated with
           Cascade-Evaporation Model.
           (A-DIS) kinetic energy distribution.
