SAMPLE     The Targets of Au, W, Ag and Ni were Self-
           Supporting. The Targets of Bi and Sb were Vacuum
           Evaporated onto a Thin Ni Foil, 80 Mugramm/Cm**2,
           And Carbon Foil, 40 Mugramm/Cm**2  Respectively. The
           Thicknesses of All Targets were from 200 to 500
           Mugramm/Cm**2.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF,ACTIV,MOSEP,EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (COIN,SOLST,SOLST). Two-Arm Detection System with Si-
           Au Detectors in Both Arms = Variant 1.
           (COIN,SOLST,GEMUC). Two-Arm Detection System with Si-
           Au Detectors in One Arm and a Position-Sensitive
           Parallel Plate Avalanche Counter in Another Arm =
           Variant 2.
           Either Variant 1 or 2 was Used in Different
           Experiments.
           (GEMUC) Double-Grid Parallel Plate Avalanche Counter
           Was Used As a Start Detector in Both Variants.

CORRECTION  Performed: the Pulse Height Defect in the Solid
           State Detectors was Determined According to the
           Procedure Suggested by Kaufman+.
            The Energy Losses of the Fission Fragments in the
           Target, the Backing and the Start Detector were
           Taken Into Account Using the Stopping Power Data
           From Northcliff Et Al., See Rel-Ref.
           The Random Coincidences were Eliminated in Off-Line
           Analysis.

           And Energy Calibration Procedures, Random Event
           Estimation and Statistics.
