           Cross Section For Both Cs-134 Isomers.
SAMPLE     Natural Uranium Target was Used.

STATUS     (CURVE)
COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Decay Curves were Resolved Cleanly
           Into Three Components, 32-Min Cs-138, 2.9-Hr Cs-134-M a
            12.9-Day Cs-136, with a Long-Lived, Low-Activity Tail.
           The Gamma-Spectrum of this Sample Revealed Two Photo-
           Peaks Attributable to Cs-134-G (2.1-YR) And Cs-137
            (30-YR) After the Decay of Cs-136. Both the Cs-134-M
           And the Cs-134-G Activities were Measured Relative to
           That of Cs-136 from the B- And Gamma-Ray Measurements
           Respectively. The Independent Yield of Cs-134-G was
           Obtained by Difference Between the Two Measurements.
