METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,MOSEP,ACTIV)
SAMPLE     Two 238-U targets, about 500 mu-g/cm**2, on the
           100-mu-m thick aluminum foils, were installed
           back-to-back at 45 deg. to the beam axis. Between the
           targets there was a 0.6-mm thick copper foil
           for monitoring.
           Target composition :
           U-238 - 99.999%,

           U-235 - 0.0003%,
           U-236 - 0.0003%.
           the targets had a small admixture of 252-Cf to provide
           calibration of the detectors simultaneously to the
           beam measurements

METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,STTA,EDEG) The range-energy tables were
           taken from: O.F.Nemets et al. Handbook on nuclear
           physics. Kiev, 1975 (in Russian). A few irradiations
           were done with different initial proton energies.
SAMPLE     A stack of 10 U-238 targets, each about 500 mu-gr/cm2,
           was installed perpendicularly to the beam axis.
           Copper filters were placed between the targets to
           provide the proton beam energy degradation.
           Target composition:
           U-238 - 99.999%,
           U-234 - 0.0003%,
           U-235 - 0.0003%,
           U-236 - 0.0003%.
DETECTOR   (THRES) Thin-film breakdown counters of fission
           fragments, placed close to the targets
           perpendicularly to the beam axis. Relative detector
           calibration was performed in the same geometry but
           without the copper filters, with the use of the
           proton beam with energy of about 100 MeV.
COMMENT    -By authors-
           segments of the relative fission cross section energy
           dependence obtained with different initial proton
           energies were sewed together with the use of the
           least-square method.
           The absolute fission cross sections were obtained with
           the use of the absolute measurement at 62 MeV (see
           subent O0606002).
CORRECTION Performed: beam energy degradation in the targets
           and the detectors.
           Negligible: fission induced by background neutrons,
           energy dependence of the angular anisotropy of
           fission, the dependence of the detection efficiency
           on the energy and angular distributions of fission
           fragments.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T). The quoted errors include the uncertainty of
           the target weight, the inhomogeneity of the layer
           thickness, the statistics of fission events in the
           main and calibration measurements and the uncertainty
           estimated from the spread of data obtained in
           different measurement series.
           The quoted errors do not include the uncertainty
           of the absolute fission cross section measurement.

METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB)
SAMPLE     Two pairs of back-to-back targets with layers
           of Np-237 and U-238, about 200 mu-g/cm**2,
           were installed at 45 deg. to the beam direction.
           Np-237 target composition:
           Np-237 - 99.834%,
           Pu-238 - 0.15%,
           Pu-239 - 0.016%.
           U-238 target composition:
           U-234 - 0.0003%,
           U-235 - 0.0003%,
           U-236 - 0.0003%,
           U-238 - 99.999%.
DETECTOR   (THRES). Thin-film breakdown counters of fission
           fragments, placed on both sides of the target pair in
           order to detect the fragments of each nuclide
           separately. The relative calibration of the detectors
           was performed with the use of double-sided U-238
           targets irradiated by protons with the same energy as
           for the main measurements.
CORRECTION Performed: beam energy degradation in the targets and
           the detectors, difference in angular
           anisotropy of fission for the nuclides under study.
           Negligible: fission induced by background neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The quoted errors include the uncertainty of
           the weight of the main and calibration targets,
           the inhomogeneity of the layer thickness for the main
           and calibration targets, and the statistics of fission
           events in the main and calibration measurements.
