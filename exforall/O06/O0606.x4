COMMENT    -By Authors-
           Segments of the Relative Fission Cross Section Energy
           Dependence Obtained with Different Initial Proton
           Energies were Sewed Together with the Use of the
           Least-Square Method.
           The Absolute Fission Cross Sections were Obtained with
           The Use of the Absolute Measurement at 62 MeV (SEE

CORRECTION Performed: Beam Energy Degradation in the Targets
           And the Detectors.
           Negligible: Fission Induced by Background Neutrons,

           Fission, the Dependence of the Detection Efficiency
           On the Energy and Angular Distributions of Fission
           Fragments.

           The Target Weight, the Inhomogeneity of the Layer
           Thickness, the Statistics of Fission Events in the
