FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Metal Bismuth, Thorium and Uranium Plates, 25*7*0.5
           Mm Size. For Admixtures, See Rel-Ref.
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP,MAGFR).
           (ACTIV) Irradiation Time was 1 Hour Approximately.
           (CHSEP) 36 Elements were Extracted.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) End-Window Counters.
           (MAGSP) Magnetic Analyser was Used to Distinguish
           Electron and Positron Activity.
PART-DET   (B-,B+,DG).
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24-G,CUM/UND,SIG,,,EXP)
           The Sample was Covered by an Aluminium Foil Served As a
           Monitor.

           Comments by Compiler:
           - Misprints are Corrected in the Reference Given by
           Lavrukhina+;
           - The Projectile Energy For the Monitor Cross
           Section Value is Given Under 'En-Nrm'.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Radioisotopes were Indentified by Half-Life
           And, in Some Cases, by Beta-Radiation Energy
           Determined by Absorption in Aluminium Foils.
           (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Section was
           Determined from the Integrated Area Under the Mass
           Yield Curve.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Superseeded Value from a.K.Lavrukhina+'S Paper
           In Ae,2,27,57. See Rel-Ref.
CORRECTION Performed: Self-Absorption and Self-Scattering in
           The Sample, Absorption of the Radiation in Sample
           Cover, in Air, and in the Counter Window. Solid
           Angle Corrections. Natural Background. Miscounts at
           High Counting Rates. Chemical Yield Corrections.
            Additional Corrections Performed For Products
           Decaying by Electron Capture: Low-Energy Background,
           Fluorescent Yield, Counter Efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT-ERR) Monitor Cross Section Uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) Upper Limit of Counting Statistics
           Uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) Upper Limit of Uncertainty in Fission
           Product Formation Cross Sections For Beta-Active
           Products.
           (ERR-2) Upper Limit of Uncertainty in Fission
           Product Formation Cross Sections For E-Capture and
           B+ Decay Products.
           No Error Estimates are Given For the Total Fission
           Cross Sections.
