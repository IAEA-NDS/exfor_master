FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     Targets, 0.5-1 Gramm, were Made from Ingot Metallic
           Antimony Cleaned by Zone Fusion. No Admixtures were
           Found, That Might Distort the Fission Product Yields.
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP,RCHEM,GSPEC,BSPEC,MAGFR).
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Butt-End Counters.
           (MAGSP) Magnetic Analyser was Used to Distinguish
           Electron and Positron Activity.
PART-DET   (B-,B+,DG).
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24-G,CUM/UND,SIG,,,EXP)
           The Sample was Wrapped in an Aluminium Foil Served As a
           Monitor. No Reference to the Monitor Cross Section is
           Given.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Radioisotopes were Indentified by Half-Life
           And, in Some Cases, by Beta-Radiation Energy
           Determined by Absorption in Aluminium Foils.
           (AREA) The Total Fission Cross Section was Determined
           From the Integrated Area Under the Mass Yield Curve.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) The Most Probable Charge of Fission Products.
           (MISC2) The Share of Symmetric and Near-Symmetric
           Fissions, with the Difference from the Symmetric
           Splitting not More Than 3 Charge Units.
CORRECTION Performed: Self-Absorption and Self-Scattering in the
           Sample, Absorption of the Radiation in Sample Cover,
           In Air and in the Counter Window. Reflection of the
           Radiation from Sample Backing. Solid Angle Corrections.
            Additional Corrections Performed For Products
           Decaying by Electron Capture: Counter Efficiency and
           Fluorescent Yield.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainties in Fission Product Formation Cross
           Sections were 50-100%. No Error Estimation is Given
           For the Total Fission Cross Section.
