DETECTOR   (GLASD) The number of fissions was determined from
           the tracks left in glass by the fragments. The
           detection efficiency was obtained by means of a
           Pu-240 standard, and was (36 +- 1.5)% in the geometry
           used in the experiments.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB)
METHOD     (INTB) The layers and glass plates, together with an
           aluminum-plate monitor, were irradiated
           inside the vacuum chamber of the synchrotron.
           In calculation of the total number of fissions it was
           assumed that the angular distribution of the fragments
           can be represented as an expansion of cosines.
