SAMPLE     Silver and Bromine Nuclei were the Constituents of the
           Photoemulsions.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,STTA,EDEG). The Proton Beam with Initial
           Energy of 660 MeV was Passed Through Copper Filters to
           Degrade Its Energy. No Ref. Is Given to Stopping Power
           Tables. Thickness of the Degraders is Given Under
           'Misc4'.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Nuclear Photoemulsions of 'P-9-Sensitive'
           Type. The Specific Energy Loss Threshold Corresponded
           To 45-MeV Protons.
           (IOCH) The Beam was Monitored by an Ionization
           Chamber, Absolutely Calibrated For 660-MeV Protons. No
           Details are Given For the Calibration Procedure.
PART-DET   (FF).
ASSUMED    The Observed Binary Events were Attributed to Fission
           Mechanism If the Ratio of the Product Ranges was < 2.
           Fission-Related Parameters of Silver and Bromine
           Nuclei were Assumed Equal.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Number of Registered Fission Events.
           (MISC2) Average Number of Alpha-Particles and Protons
           Per Fission Event.
           (MISC3) Average Range of the Fission Fragments.
           (MISC4) Thickness of the Copper Degrader.
CORRECTION Comment by Compiler: a Correction Taking Into Account
           The Interactions Induced by Secondary Particles
           Originating from the Degraders is not Considered.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Compiler Assumes That the Quoted Errors are
           Purely Statistical.
ADD-RES    (RANGE) Distributions of the Ratio of Fission Fragment
           Ranges.
           (Z-DIS) Deduced Charge Distributions of Fission
           Fragments.
