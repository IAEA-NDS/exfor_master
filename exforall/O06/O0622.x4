SAMPLE     The 209-Bi Targets, 295.6 Mugramm/Cm**2 Thick, are
           Evaporated on 22 Mugramm/Cm**2 Backings. The
           Uniformity and Thickness are Given Within 5%.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,PHD,BCINT).
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Solid-State Counters Ortec 7901 of 100 mm**2
           Sensitive Area and 60 Mumeter Depth. Two Detectors are
           Used: One is Set at 90 Degrees with Respect to the
           Incident Beam and Subtends a Solid Angle of 0.015
           Sterad with an Angular Resolution of About 4 Degrees.
           During the Measurement this Detector is Used As a
           Reference Monitor. The Second Detector can be Rotated
           Around the Axis of the Scattering Chamber from 15 to
           170 Degree. The Solid Angle is 0.0049 Sterad and the
           Angular Resolution 2.3 Degrees.
