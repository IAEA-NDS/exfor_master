           The Details of the beam monitoring are given in these
           references.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSITE) Medical Beam of the ITEP Synchrotron.
SAMPLE     Two targets of a nuclide under study, each about 500
           mugramm/cm**2, were placed at 45 degree in respect to
           the proton beam direction. The targets of indium and
           antimony were prepared by vacuum evaporation onto an
           Aluminium backing, 150 mugramm/cm**2 thick. The
           Targets of silver and tin were self-supporting films.
           The targets were made of extra-pure materials.
           Presence of heavy fissile admixtures was checked by
           activation analysis and by thermal neutron irradiation.
           The admixture of uranium was found less than
           1*10**(-7) g/g in tin and less than 2.5*10**(-7) g/g
           in silver.
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA).
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Silicate glass detectors, 0.5*1.7 cm**2 size,
           were placed around every target at 6 cm distance,
           covering 20-160 deg. angles with 10 deg. step. The
           detectors registered only particles with mass A>=20
           and energy more than 13-15 MeV.
           Detection efficiency was calculated assuming a
           gaussian-shaped energy distribution of fission
           fragments in C.M.S., with the FWHM of 30 MeV.
PART-DET   (FF).
MONITOR    (6-C-12(P,N+P)6-C-11,,SIG)
           The beam current was measured by a magnetic induction
           detector, calibrated with the use of the reaction
           given above
MONIT-REF  (C0058002,D.F.Measday,J,NP,78,476,1966)
COMMENT    -By Compiler- The Reference given under 'MONIT-REF'
           contains the cross sections for the reaction given
           under 'MONIT' in the energy range 50-160 MeV only.
           The data were extrapolated up to 200 MeV by the authors
           of the present work. No details of the extrapolation
           are available.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) Integration of smoothed experimental angular
           distributions, extrapolated to cover 0-180 deg. region.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Ratio of the average longitudinal velocity of
           the fissioning nucleus to the average velocity of the
           fission fragment.
CORRECTION Performed: counting of fission fragments from
           the neighboring target, up to 11%; solid angle
           corrections; corrections to the fission fragment
           angular distribution taking into account the
           dependence of the detection efficiency on the fragment
           energy.
            Negligible: the contribution from the uranium
           admixture, not more than 1%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Complete analysis is not given. The quoted
           errors do not include uncertainties in the detection
           efficiency corrections.
           (ERR-1) Accuracy of the beam current measurement.
