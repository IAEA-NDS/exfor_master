TITLE      High-Energy-Proton Fission Cross Sections of U,Bi,Au
           And Ag Measured with Mica Track Detectors
AUTHOR     (J.HUDIS,S.KATCOFF)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,180,1122,1969)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL) Brookhaven Cosmotron - 0.6,1,2,3 GeV.
           (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven Ags - 13,29 GeV.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Two Rectangular Pieces of Muscovite Mica, 1*0.5
           Inch, 0.1 mm Thick, with a Fissile Layer in Between.
           (IOCH) For Relative Beam Monitoring.
           (PROPC) A Calibrated End-Window Proportional Counter,
           For Absolute Beam Monitoring, See 'Monitor'.

SAMPLE     Layers of Natural Silver, Gold, Bismuth, and Natural
           Uranium Fluoride were Evaporated onto the Mica in
           Vacuum. The Thickness Deposited was About 100
           Mugramm/Cm**2 For Silver and Gold, About 40
           Mugramm/Cm**2 For Bismuth and About 10 Mugramm/Cm**2
           For Uranium.
METHOD     (EXTB,FISCT,STTA,MOSEP).
           (COINC) The Mica Detectors were Photographed
           Separately. The Paired Sheets of Film were Examined on
           A Light Box, Where Correlated Pairs of Tracks were
           Found to be in Alignment. These Events were Identified
           As Binary Fission If Each Track was >= 1.6 Mumeters in
           Projected Length. Ternary Fission Events were
           Discarded If It Appeared Likely That They Consisted of
           A Correlated Pair of Tracks and an Accidental Unpaired
           Track.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,CUM/UND,SIG,,,EVAL).
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.B.CUMMING,J,ARN,13,261,1963).
CORRECTION Performed: Due to Fragments Entering Close to Grazing
           Incidence, Which are not Registered in Mica.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the Monitor Cross Section.
