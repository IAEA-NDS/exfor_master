TITLE      High-energy-proton fission cross sections of U,Bi,Au
           and Ag measured with mica track detectors
AUTHOR     (J.Hudis,S.Katcoff)
INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,180,1122,1969)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL) Brookhaven Cosmotron - 0.6,1,2,3 GeV.
           (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven Ags - 13,29 GeV.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Two rectangular pieces of muscovite mica, 1*0.5
           inch, 0.1 mm thick, with a fissile layer in between.
           (IOCH) For relative beam monitoring.
           (PROPC) A calibrated end-window proportional counter,
           for absolute beam monitoring, see 'Monitor'.
PART-DET   (FF,P)
SAMPLE     Layers of natural silver, gold, bismuth, and natural
           uranium fluoride were evaporated onto the mica in
           vacuum. the thickness deposited was about 100 um/cm2
           for silver and gold, about 40 um/cm2 for bismuth
           and about 10 um/cm2 for uranium.
METHOD     (EXTB,FISCT,STTA,MOSEP)
           (COINC) The mica detectors were photographed
           separately. The paired sheets of film were examined on
           a light box, where correlated pairs of tracks were
           found to be in alignment. These events were identified
           as binary fission if each track was >= 1.6 um in
           projected length. ternary fission events were
           discarded if it appeared likely that they consisted of
           a correlated pair of tracks and an accidental unpaired
           track.

CORRECTION Performed: Due to fragments entering close to grazing
           incidence, which are not registered in mica.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the monitor cross section.
