DETECTOR   (TRD) Natural muscovite mica detectors, each about
           5-10 cm2 * 0.01 cm, formed a sandwich, with an
           aluminum foil, 200 ug/cm2, in between, that was
           covered on one side by target material.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,FISCT,COINC,ACTIV,MOSEP) Correlated
           fission fragment tracks were observed after the
           chemical treatment of the detectors.
SAMPLE     The layers of natural uranium of about 5 ug/cm2
           were obtained by electrospraying or by thermal
           evaporation of uranium tetrafluoride.
           The layers of bismuth, natural lead, gold, natural
           tellurium, natural tin and natural silver of about
           20-100 ug/cm2 were obtained by thermal evaporation
           of metals.
           Comment by compiler: no details are given on the
           U-235 samples.

CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events as a result of their
           passing through the aluminum foil; admixture of
           false events due to interactions of incident protons
           with heavy constituents of mica or heavy impurities
           in the aluminum foil; accidental coincidences of
           two single tracks; fission of heavy impurities in
           the targets; non-uniformity of the target material.
            Negligible: sensitivity of the monitor and fissile
           layers to secondary particles.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Total number of observed binary tracks.
ADD-RES    (RANGE) Distributions of projected track lengths

COMMENT    -By authors- For the determinations of cross section
           for binary fission, the following scanning criteria
           were adopted for correlated pairs of tracks:
            - the track ranges exceeded 3 um;
            - the distance between the fragment entry points
           were less than about 20 um.
