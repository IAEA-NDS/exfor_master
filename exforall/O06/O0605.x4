TITLE      The Study of Nuclear Fission Induced by High-Energy
           Protons
COMMENT    -By Authors- For the Determinations of Cross Section
           For Binary Fission, the Following Scanning Criteria
           Were Adopted For Correlated Pairs of Tracks:
            - The Track Ranges Exceeded 3 Mumeters;
            - The Distance Between the Fragment Entry Points
           Were Less Than About 20 Mumeters.

DETECTOR   (TRD). Natural Muscovite Mica Detectors, Each About
           5-10 Cm2 * 0.01 Cm, Formed a Sandwich, with an
           Aluminium Foil, 200 Mugramm/Cm2, in Between, That was
           Covered on One Side by Target Material.
PART-DET   (FF)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,FISCT,COINC,ACTIV,MOSEP). Correlated
           Fission Fragment Tracks were Observed After the
           Chemical Treatment of the Detectors.
SAMPLE     The Layers of Natural Uranium of About 5 Mugramm/Cm2
           Were Obtained by Electrospraying or by Thermal
           Evaporation of Uranium Tetrafluoride.
           The Layers of Bismuth, Natural Lead, Gold,Natural
           Tellurium, Natural Tin and Natural Silver of About
           20-100 Mugramm/Cm2 were Obtained by Thermal
           Evaporation of Metals.
           Comment by Compiler: No Details are Given on the U-
           235 Samples.

CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of Events As a Result of Their
           Passing Through the Aluminium Foil; Admixture of
           False Events Due to Interactions of Incident Protons
           With Heavy Constituents of Mica or Heavy Impurities
           In the Aluminium Foil; Accidental Coincidences of
           Two Single Tracks; Fission of Heavy Impurities in
           The Targets; Non-Uniformity of the Target Material.
            Negligible: Sensitivity of the Monitor and Fissile
           Layers to Secondary Particles.
