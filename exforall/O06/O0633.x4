FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) 200-Mumeter Ilford D1 Nuclear Emulsions. Only
           Alpha Particles and Heavier Fragments were Recorded.
SAMPLE     Silver and Bromine Atoms were the Constituents of the
           Emulsion.
PART-DET   (FF) The Criteria Used in the Selection of Fission
           Events were the Dense Ionization of Each Track and the
           Appearance of a Taper Toward the End of the Range.
           Only Fragments with Z>=7 were Classified As Fission
           Fragments, Events in Which the Ratio of Track Ranges
           Exceeded 5 were not Accepted.
METHOD     (FISCT).
MISC-COL   (MISC1) The Mean Range of the Fission Fragments.
           (MISC2) The Mean Fragment Velocity in the Lab.System,
           In Units of the Velocity of Light.
           (MISC3) The Mean Angle Between the Two Fission
           Fragments.
