FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The 40Ca12+ beam with a typical
           intensity of 9E11 ions/s was delivered by the sector
           focusing cyclotron of the Heavy Ion Research Facility
           in Lanzhou (HIRFL), China. The beam energy at the
           center of the target was estimated to be 193 MeV and
           the effective irradiation time was 24 hours.
SAMPLE     The natural lutetium targets, 175Lu (abundance is
           less than 97.4%), 176Lu (abundance is less than 2.6%)
           and impurities, with a thickness of 500 ug/cm2 were
           evaporated onto 40 ug/cm2 carbon backing foils.
DETECTOR   (SI) Four silicon avalanche photodiodes mounted at
           +-30 degree and +-45 degree with respect to the
           incident beam direction were used to monitor the beam
           intensity via measuring the scattered projectiles.
           (SI) The evaporation residues were implanted
           into three 300 um thick position sensitive silicon
           detectors (PSSDs) abreast installed at the focal
           plane of the separator. Each PSSD, with an active
           area 50 x 50 mm2, was divided into 16 vertical strips
           in the front face. Eight non-position sensitive
           silicon detectors of similar type were mounted around
           the PSSDs, forming a box of the silicon detector (Si-
           box) open from the front side.
           (MWPC) In order to distinguish the alpha-decay events
           from the implantation events, a multi-wire
           proportional counter was mounted 15 cm upstream from
           the PSSDs.
METHOD     The evaporation residues (ERs) produced in this
           reaction were identified by their characteristic
           alpha-decay properties, based on the energy-position-
           time correlation measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
