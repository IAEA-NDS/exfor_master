           Lanzhou (HIRFL).

           Lanzhou (RIBLL).
SAMPLE     The first six silicon detectors were served as both
           the reaction samples and the dE detectors.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
           The same particle upstream and downstream of the
           reaction target can be counted.
           (TRN) The reaction cross section was obtained by the
           transmission method.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,CSICR) It is consist of 7 Si-Au and 1 CsI
           detector. The thickness of 7 Si-Au detectors are 1000,
           700, 2000, 1000, 1000, 2000 and 700 um, and the
           effictive area is 150 mm2. The thickness and effictive
           area of CsI is 10 mm and 70x70 mm.
           (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) To confirm the start and stop of TOF.
INC-SOURCE 8He secondary beam was produced by fragmentation of
           13C primary beam accelerated to 60 MeV/u by HIRFL on
           Be target (4 mm thick).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Including statistical uncertainty, systematic
           uncertainty and uncertainty in separation of 4He, 6He
           and 8He by fitting of energy spectrum
           (ERR-1) systematic uncertainty
           (ERR-S) statistical uncertainty
