           (PRJFS,3CPRIMP) The Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
           Lanzhou (RIBLL).
INC-SOURCE Secondary 17.7 MeV/u beam of 18Ne nuclei, 16.0 MeV/u
           beam of 17F nuclei and 14.1 MeV/u beam of 16O nuclei
           were produced by the bombardment of a 1 mm beryllium
           target with a 80nA and 45 MeV/u 20Ne primary beam.
SAMPLE     CH2 target (60 um thick).
DETECTOR   (PPAC,CSICR) The detector array included three
           parallel plate avalanche counters (PPAC), the
           position information of the incident particles were
           given by the PPAC1 and PPAC2, the position
           information of the outgoing particles were given by
           the PPAC3. The distances of PPAC1 and PPAC2, PPAC2
           and PPAC3 and the centre of target and PPAC2, were
           1142.5 mm, 524 mm and 274 mm, respectively. After the
           PPAC, the Plastic+CsI were used to monitor beam.
           (TELES,PS,SI,CSICR) The detector array included five
           position sensitive telescope. The first 4 consisted
           of position sensitive semiconductor detector (PSSD)
           and large area silicon, the fifth consisted of
           position sensitive semiconductor detector (PSSD) and
           CsI. The centre of PSSD1 to PSSD5 located at 79, 68,
           52.2, 64 and 60 degrees, respectively. The cover the
           range of angles were 86-72, 75-61, 59.2-45.2, 71-57
           and 67-53, respectively. The distances of the centre
           of target and all the PSSD were 18 cm.
           (SCIN) Two scintillation detectors were used to
           measure the time of flight, the distance of them was
           1737.3 cm.
METHOD     (TOF) To identify secondary beam.
PART-DET   (P)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical uncertainty and uncertainty
           due to correction.
