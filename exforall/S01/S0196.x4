FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) The NEC 9SDH-2 2x3 MV tandem
           accelerator, the accumulated charge per energy
           interval was usually ~20 uC.
SAMPLE     Pd/TiHx/Si was prepared by magnetron sputtering
           method, which was 1.8E17 atoms/cm2 H atoms in a 1.2E17
           atoms/cm2 Ti film. A Pd overlayer of 2.4E16 atoms/cm2
           was deposited onto the Ti film.
           The areal density of H relative to Pd was determined
           by their scattering with 12C assuming Rutherford
           scattering.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) An Au/Si surface barrier detector was placed
           at a backscattering angle, subtended a solid angle of
           1.12E-3 sr defined by a 3x4 mm slit. Two detectors,
           one to detect the H recoils at a recoil angle of 30
           degree and the other to measure the backscattered
           yield of the incident 12C particles at a scattering
           angle of 165 degree.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 1 of
           J,NIM/B,346,17,2015
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error associated with the measured
           cross section is about 7%
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) Pd-C statistics and BG subtraction
           (ERR-2,2.,3.) H-C statistics and BG subtraction
           (ERR-3,,1.) Pd-C Rutherford cross section due to
           uncertainties in the scattering angle (1 deg.) and
           the carbon beam energy (6 keV) is less than 1.%.
           (ERR-4,,3.) Due to using the Rutherford cross-section
           value on 4.35 MeV is less than 3%.
