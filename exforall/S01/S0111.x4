TITLE      The measurement of the excitation functions of
           isotopes of Fr and At, produced in the bombardment of
           C-12 on Bi-209

REFERENCE  (J,PHE,2,143,1978)
SAMPLE     The thickness of Bi-209 targets were 0.27 mg/cm2, no
           more detailed information.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) To measure the decayed alpha particle from
           the recoiled residual nuclei.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,3CPRIMP) No more detailed information.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The cooling time is more than 50 hours after
           irradiation.
           (HEJET,REC) The recoiled nuclei were moderated by
           helium gas and sent to the collecting cell for alpha
           particle measurement.
           (ASPEC) Off-line alpha-spectroscopic method.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is mainly from the
           thickness of target, normalization, counting. No more
           detailed information was given.
COMMENT    1. The data of Fr-214 were absolutely normalized to
           the cross section of At-210 at 62.5 MeV. 2. The data
           of Fr-213 were absolutely normalized to the cross
           section of At-209 at 67 MeV.
