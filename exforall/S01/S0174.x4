TITLE      Measurements of the neutron yields from 7Li(p,n)7Be

FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) Peking University 4.5 MV electrostatic
           accelerator.
SAMPLE     A 1.2 mm thick Lithium target was used.
METHOD     (BCINT) A current integration unit was used to
           determine the total proton charge bombarding the
           target.
DETECTOR   (LONGC) A well calibrated long counter, with
           sensitive volume 20 cm(diam)x30 cm was used to record
           the outgoing neutrons from the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction.
           The detector-to-target distance was 193 cm.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No detailed information was given.
HISTORY    (20160322C) Compiled by Chen Guochang (CNDC).
