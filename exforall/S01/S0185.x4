FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The experiments were performed at the
           sector focusing cyclotron in the Heavy Ion Research
           Facility Lanzhou (HIRFL), China.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After the end of the irradiation, the activity
           of the targets was measured by using HPGe detectors.

           description of experimental technique and setup
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The activation technique was used, with
           the detection of off-line gamma rays.
           (STTA) Two stacks with each stack having 8 targets.
           Energy loss was calculated by ATIMA within the LISE++
           program.
           (BCINT) Beam current was determined by Faraday cup.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) There are no information on uncertainty.
STATUS     (TABLE) The measured reactions data are taken from
           Table I at page 034615-4 in J,PR/C,93,034615,2016.
