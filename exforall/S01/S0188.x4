INC-SOURCE Primary beam of O-18 was extracted and accelerated to
           280 MeV/nucleon by the main Cooler Storage Ring (CSRm),
           and directed onto a beryllium target of 15 mm
           thickness. The reaction products from projectile
           fragmentation of O-18 were separated according to
           their magnetic rigidity using the in-flight fragment
           separator Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line (RIBLL2).
SAMPLE     A 900 mg/cm2 thick carbon reaction target
DETECTOR   (SCIN,IOCH) The secondary beams were identified based
           on a combination of the time of flight from SC1 to
           SC2 measured between two plastic scintillator
           detectors (SC1 and SC2) and the energy loss measured
           with a multiple sampling ionization chamber (MUSIC1).
           (SCIN) The time of flight from SC2 to TOFW was
           measured between a plastic scintillator (SC2) and a
           plastic scintillator wall (TOFW) with 30 strips and
           an active area of 120 x 120 cm2 placed about 10 m
           downstream from the target. The time of flight was
           calibrated using the O-18 primary beam, and a
           resolution of about 300 ps.
           (IOCH) The energy loss was measured by a multiple
           sampling ionization chamber (MUSIC2) placed 50 cm
           downstream of the reaction target.
METHOD     (TOF)
CORRECTION The background contributions were measured by using
           target-out runs and subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in the cross sections
           mainly comes from statistical error.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty arising from the software
           gates used for particle identification and the
           transmission efficiency is estimated to be 5%.
