FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) 1.5 meter cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE 12C ions beam
SAMPLE     Self-supporting target of natural silicon (100 ug/cm2
           thick).
METHOD     At 46, 58 and 70.5 MeV, measurements were done at 5
           to 35 deg. At other energies, the measurement was
           done at 9.3 deg. Pure Coulomb scattering was assumed
           at small angle.
           (EDEG) Incident energy was degraded by Al foils from
           72.7 to 43 MeV.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
DETECTOR   (TELES,IOCH,SIBAR) The dE detector was gas ionization
           chamber with 4 cm efficient length, E detector was
           silicon surface barrier detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T,8.,14.) Total uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of geometry condition.
           (ERR-2,3.5,12.) Uncertainty from the low energy
           threshold of dE-E telescope detection system.
