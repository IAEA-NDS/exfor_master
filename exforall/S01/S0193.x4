FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem Accelerator.
INC-SOURCE A 6Li3+ beam in the energy range from 16 to 28 MeV,
           the beam current was varied from 5.7 to 14.0 enA.
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-96,ENR=0.99) A 96ZrO2 metallic foil with 550
           mu-g/cm2 thickness and a 1.92 mg/cm2 gold backing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si(Au) surface barrier detectors were
           positioned at 30 degree with respect to the beam
           direction.
           (BGO,HPGE) An array consisting of 9 Compton-
           suppressed BGO-HPGe spectrometers and two planar HpGe
           detectors was used to detect online gamma rays
           emitted by the reaction products.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (GSPEC) The excitation function was measured using
           the online characteristic gamma spectrometry method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in this experiment
           mainly came from the statistical errors associated
           with the yields of the gamma rays and from the
           systematic errors in the target thickness as
           well as the estimation of the beam intensity.
           (ERR-1) The target thickness.
