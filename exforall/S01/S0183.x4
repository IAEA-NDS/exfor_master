FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRIMP) 320 kV platform for multidisciplinary
           research with highly charged ions. The current of
           proton beam was about 3-16 uA.
SAMPLE     (5-B-11,NAT=0.80) A 6.3 ug/cm2 thick natural boron
           target (80% 11B, 20% 10B), was made by sputtering
           natural boron onto a 0.2 mm thick tantalum backing and
           was directly water-cooled.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The capture gamma rays were observed using a
           4x4 fold segmented, Clover-type high-purity germanium
           detector, was placed in close geometry at 0 degree,
           with its front face at a distance of 29 mm from the
           target. The Clover detector has a relative efficiency
           of about 200% and a typical resolution of 2.3 keV at
           Eg=1.3 MeV. For low-energy gamma-rays, the efficiency
           was calibrated by two standard 152Eu and 60Co sources,
           for high-energy gamma-rays, the efficiency was
           determined by use of the reaction 14N(p,g)15O.
           (SCIN) An EJ-200 plastic scintillator (length=100 cm,
           width=50 cm, thickness =5 cm) was placed 10 cm above
           the Clover detector, acting as a veto to suppress the
           cosmic-ray background.

ANALYSIS   Measured (p,g1) cross section multiplied by the cross
            section ratio(p,g0)/(p,g1). The energy dependence of
            the (p,g0)/(p,g1) ratio was taken from F.E.Cecil (1992
            after normalization to 4.6% at 150 keV according to
            F.Ajzenberg-Selove (1990).
