FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem Accelerator.
INC-SOURCE A 6Li3+ beam in the energy range from 26 to 36 MeV,
           the beam current was varied from 1.9 to 5.0 pnA.
SAMPLE     (62-SM-154,ENR=0.99) A 154Sm metallic foil with 1.98
           mg/cm2 thickness.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si(Au) surface barrier detectors were
           positioned at 30 degree with respect to the beam
           direction.
           (HPGE) An array consisting of 9 Compton-suppressed
           BGO-HPGe spectrometers and two planar HpGe detectors
           was used to detect online gamma rays emitted by the
           reaction products.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (GSPEC) The fusion excitation function was measured
           using the online characteristic gamma spectrometry
           method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainty in this experiment
           mainly came from the statistical errors associated
           with the yields of the gamma rays and from the
           systematic errors in the target thickness as well as
           the estimation of the beam intensity.
