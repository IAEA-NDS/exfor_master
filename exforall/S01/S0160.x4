REFERENCE  (J,PHE,17,276,1993) Only data were given in figure.
           (J,PHE,17,166,1993) Detailed measurement information
           were given, but no data.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Heavy ion accelerator.
INC-SOURCE 12C ions beam, incident energy is 46.7 MeV/u, and the
           beam current is around 5-10 nA.
SAMPLE     The thickness of 58Ni is 1.046 and 2.092 mg/cm2. The
           thickness of 64Ni and 115In is 1.063 and 4.81 mg/cm2,
           respectively. And the thickness of 197Au is 2.73 and
           4.53 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,CSICR) For forward angle measurement, a
           telescope spectrometers is composed of 3 semi-
           conduction detector and CsI(Tl) to measure the
           projectile-like fragments from the reactions, and the
           distance between spectrometer and sample is 50 cm.
           The thickness of 3 semi-conduction detector is 130,
           1580 and 5000 um. For the middle-angle measurement,
           CsI(Tl) is set as 20 degree with beam direction and
           used to correlation measure the light particles.
           (TELES,IOCH,SOLST) For backward angle measurement, a
           telescope spectrometers is composed of gas ionization
           chamber and 3 semi-conduction position sensitive
           detector.
ERR-ANALYS No information on the uncertainty.
