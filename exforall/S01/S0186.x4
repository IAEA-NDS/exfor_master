FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem Accelerator.
INC-SOURCE 6Li3+ beams in the energy range from 14 to 28 MeV.
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-96,ENR=0.99) A 96ZrO2 metallic foil with 550
           mu-g/cm2 thickness and a 1.92 mg/cm2 gold backing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si(Au) surface barrier detectors were
           positioned at 30 degree with respect to the beam
           direction.
           (BGO,HPGE) An array consisting of 9 Compton-
           suppressed BGO-HPGe spectrometers and two planar HpGe
           detectors was used to detect online gamma rays
           emitted by the reaction products.
           (TELES,SI,SI) one auxiliary Delta E-E telescope was
           located at 65 degree with the beam direction, for the
           single identification of the light charged particles
           The distance between the target center and the
           telescope center was 55.0 mm. The telescope is
           composed of a silicon detector with diameter of 8 mm
           and a thickness 30.0 mu-m, and a stop silicon
           detector with a diameter of 12.0 mm and a thickness
           1000 mu-m. A collimator with a diameter of 5.0mm is
           put before the telescope.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (GSPEC) The excitation function was measured using
           the online characteristic gamma spectrometry method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in this experiment
           mainly came from the statistical errors associated
           with the yields of the gamma rays and from the
           systematic errors in the target thickness as well as
           the estimation of the beam intensity.
           (ERR-1) The target thickness.
