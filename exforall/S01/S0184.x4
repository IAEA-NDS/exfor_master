           deuterium by helium-4 ions at 30 degree with the

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) The NEC 9SDH-2 2x3 MV tandem accelerator
SAMPLE     The sample Ta/TiDx/Si was prepared by DC magnetron
           sputtering. A uniform film of TiDx with 2.8E17
           atoms/cm2 Ti atoms and 4.7E17 atoms/cm2 D atoms was
           deposited on Si substrate by reactive sputtering in
           an Ar/D gas mixture. A Ta overlayer of 2.6E16
           atoms/cm2 (about 5 nm in thickness) was deposited on
           the TiDx film. There is also 2 at.% H in the TiDx
           sample by residual gas in the process of deposition.
           The areal density of D relative to Ta was determined
           by their scattering with 5.6 MeV 16-Oxygen assuming
           Rutherford scattering.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Au/Si surface barrier detector was placed at
           the laboratory angle of 165 degree and subtended a
           solid angle of 1.83E-3 sr, defined by a 3x4 mm slit.
           A elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) detector
           was fixed at the laboratory recoil angle of 30 degree
           and it subtended a solid angle of 1.12E-3 sr. The
           detection energy resolution was about 18 keV, and
           angular resolution is better than 1 deg.
CORRECTION Corrected for loss of D atoms during whole measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty associated with the
           measured cross-section is about 5%
