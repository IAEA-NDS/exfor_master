FACILITY   .3.2 MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR AT TOKYO INST. OF TECH.,
            PULSED PROTON BEAM, REPETITION RATE 2 MHZ, PULSE WIDTH
            1.5 NS AND AVERAGE BEAM CURRENT 10 - 13 MICRO-AMP.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
METHOD     (TOF  )
DETECTOR   (NAICR) CAPTURE GAMMAS WERE DETECTED BY A NAI(TL)
            DETECTOR 7.6 CM IN DIAM AND 15.2 CM LONG CENTERED IN
            AN ANNULAR NAI(TL) DETECTOR 25.4 CM IN DIAM AND
            28.0 CM LONG, PLACED IN A HEAVY SHIELD OF BORATED
            PARAFFIN, LEAD AND CADMIUM, THE WHOLE DETECTOR BEING
            OPERATED AS AN ANTI-COMPTON GAMMA SPECTROMETER.
            A 6-LIH SHIELD WAS ADDED TO THE DETECTOR COLLIMATOR
            TO ABSORB NEUTRONS SCATTERED BY THE SAMPLE. THE SAMPLE
            DETECTOR DISTANCE WAS 80 CM AND THE GAMMAS WERE
            OBSERVED AT A LAB ANGLE OF 125 DEG TO THE PROTON BEAM.
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCY DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY USING
            SEVERAL CALIBRATED SOURCES.
           (SCIN ) 6-LI GLASS SCINTILLATION DETECTOR LOCATED 40 CM
            FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE AND AT 30 DEG TO THE PROTON
            BEAM, USED TO MONITOR NEUTRONS INCIDENT ON THE SAMPLE.
            THE SAME DETECTOR ALSO MEASURED THE TOF SPECTRUM AT
            THE AVERAGE ANGLE OF 14 DEG, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY
            BEING DETERMINED FROM A MONTE CARLO CALCULATION.
SAMPLE     .THE 13-C SAMPLE WAS 99 % ENRICHED CARBON POWDER IN AN
            ACRYLIC RESIN CONTAINER 5.8 CM IN DIAM AND 1.1 CM
            LONG. THE 13-C THICKNESS WAS 0.0402 ATOMS/B, THE
            SAMPLE BEING LOCATED 8.1 CM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE AT
            AN ANGLE OF 0 DEG.
           .A GOLD STANDARD SAMPLE 5.5 CM IN DIAM AND 0.17 CM LONG
            WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS
            INCIDENT AT THE SAMPLE POSITION.

           .THE PARTIAL OFF-RESONANCE CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE
            153 KEV RESONANCE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE ENERGY BIN
            CONTAINING THE 153 KEV PEAK ITSELF WERE CALCULATED
            USING THE COMPUTER CODE HIKARI, BASED ON THE DWBA,
            AND THE RESULTS NORMALISED TO THOSE MEASURED AND
            DEDUCED FOR THE ENERGY BIN IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE PEAK.
            THIS ENABLED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OFF-RESONANCE COUNTS
            TO BE CALCULATED, THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE TOTAL COUNTS
            RECORDED IN THE ENERGY BIN OF THE RESONANCE GAVE THE
            ON-RESONANCE COUNTS, FROM WHICH THE RESONANCE WIDTH
            WAS DEDUCED.
