            IGATED BY COLD FISSION MEASUREMENTS.

METHOD     (PHD  ) FOR EACH ANALYSED FISSION EVENT FOUR QUANTITIES
            ARE RECORDED, THE ANODE PULSE HEIGHTS AND THE ELECTRON
            DRIFT TIMES FROM EACH SIDE OF THE CHAMBER, FROM WHICH
            THE FRAGMENT MASS AND ENERGY CAN BE DETERMINED PROVID-
            ING THAT THE NON-IONIZING PART OF THE ENERGY LOST BY
            THE FRAGMENT (THE SO-CALLED PULSE HEIGHT DEFECT) IS
            PROPERLY ESTIMATED. THIS WAS INVESTIGATED BY CONSIDER-
            ING THOSE FISSION EVENTS FOR WHICH THERE IS PERFECT
            FRAGMENT IDENTIFICATION (SO-CALLED 'COLD' FISSION,
            CHARACTERISED BY HIGH KINETIC ENERGY FRAGMENTS AND NO
            NEUTRON EMISSION). THE RESULTING PULSE HEIGHT DEFECT
            WAS SHOWN TO BE NEGLIGIBLE FOR THE PRESENT CONFIGUR-
            ATION, THUS THE FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY CAN BE WELL
            REPRESENTED BY A LINEAR FUNCTION OF ANODE PULSE HEIGHT
            RESPONSE.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) TWIN IONIZATION CHAMBER WORKING IN PURE METHANE
            GAS AT 450 +-1 MBAR PRESSURE, CONSISTING OF TWO BACK-
            TO-BACK GRIDDED CHAMBERS SEPARATED BY A CENTRAL CATH-
            ODE AT THE CENTRE OF WHICH IS LOCATED THE FISSILE
            SAMPLE. TWO FRISCH GRIDS OF 30 MICRON TUNGSTEN WIRE
            SCREEN THE ANODES FROM THE POSITIVE ION EFFECT. THE
            CHAMBER IS OPERATED AT CONSTANT ROOM TEMPERATURE, AND
            THE GAS FILLING REPLENISHED AT A FLOW RATE OF 5 L/HR.
            THE ENERGY RESOLUTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 KEV FOR A
            100 MEV FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY.
PART-DET   (FF   )
SAMPLE     .A VERY THIN FISSILE SAMPLE IS REQUIRED. THE EXPERIMENT
            USED A SAMPLE CONSISTING OF UF4 IN A LAYER OF 5.3
            MICRO-G/CM2 EVAPORATED ONTO A 5 MICRO-G/CM2 THICK
            CARBON FOIL BACKING.
ANALYSIS   .THE FRAGMENT KINETIC ENERGY AND MASS BEFORE AND AFTER
            NEUTRON EMISSION ARE CALCULATED FOR EACH FISSION
            EVENT BY AN ITERATIVE PROCEDURE, THE MEAN VALUES AND
            STANDARD DEVIATIONS ARE DERIVED FROM THE RESULTING
            DISTRIBUTIONS. IN THESE CALCULATIONS THE COEFFICIENTS
            IN THE LINEAR FUNCTION RELATING KINETIC ENERGY TO
            PULSE HEIGHT HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REPRODUCE THE
            ASSUMED VALUE.

CORRECTION .THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES NEUTRON EMISSION AND BACKING
            EFFECT CORRECTIONS, THE LATTER TO CORRECT FOR THE
            ENERGY LOST BY THE FRAGMENT THAT CROSSES THE CARBON
            FOIL BACKING (AT ZERO ENTRANCE ANGLE THIS IS ABOUT
            300 KEV COMPARED WITH THE AVERAGE ENERGY LOST IN THE
            FISSILE DEPOSIT OF 60 KEV, WHICH IS NEGLIGIBLE).

            KINETIC ENERGY MEASUREMENT; THE UNCERTAINTIES VARIED
            FROM DE/E = 3.0E-3 TO 4.1E-3 FOR KINETIC ENERGIES
            RANGING FROM 100 DOWN TO 60 MEV.
