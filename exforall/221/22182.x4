TITLE      -THE STELLAR NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS OF 94-ZR
            AND 96-ZR.
AUTHOR     (K.A.TOUKAN,F.KAEPPELER)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3.75MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR OPERATED
            IN DC MODE DURING ACTIVATION RUNS.
CRITIQUE   .ALTHOUGH THE TERM 'MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM' IS USED
            THROUGHOUT THE PAPER THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IN A STELLAR
            CONTEXT, THE ACTUAL AVERAGE CROSS SECTION (<SIGMA>KT)
            BEING DEFINED AS THE AVERAGED REACTION RATE (CROSS
            SECTION MULTIPLIED BY VELOCITY) DIVIDED BY THE MEAN
            THERMAL VELOCITY (VT) WITHIN THE STELLAR PLASMA OF
            THERMAL ENERGY KT :
               <SIGMA>KT  = <SIGMA X VELOCITY>/ VT
            USING THE ACCEPTED MAXWELL VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
            FORMULA THE TERM VT CAN EASILY BE SHOWN TO BE
            (2KT/M)**0.5, M BEING THE REDUCED MASS. THIS IS EQUI-
            VALENT TO FOLDING THE CROSS SECTION WITH AN ENERGY
            SPECTRUM PROPORTIONAL TO A MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTION
            TIMES VELOCITY (E(N) X EXP(-E(N)/KT)) WITH A NORMAL-
            ISATION FACTOR OF 2/(PI)**0.5, INSTEAD OF A TRUE
            MAXWELLIAN (E(N)**0.5 X EXP(-E(N)/KT)). IT IS THIS
            FORMER SPECTRUM THAT IS REPRODUCED EXPERIMENTALLY
            USING THE P-LI7 SOURCE, AND THE RESULTING AVERAGE
            CROSS SECTION WITHOUT THE 2/(PI)**0.5 FACTOR APPEARS
            IN THE DATA TABLE.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) THICK METALLIC NATURAL LI TARGET ON A 1.0 MM
            THICK WATER-COOLED CU BACKING. USING 1912 KEV PROTONS
            THE 120 DEG FORWARD CONE OF EMITTED NEUTRONS CLOSELY
            APPROXIMATES TO A MAXWELLIAN KT = 25 KEV SHAPE. TOTAL
            NEUTRON RATE WAS 5.0E+8 S-1.
SAMPLE     .METALLIC ZR DISCS OF 8 OR 10 MM DIAM PLACED DIRECTLY
            ON THE LI TARGET AND SANDWICHED WITH 0.03 MM THICK
            AU FOILS OF THE SAME DIAMETER. THREE SEPARATE SAMPLES
            WERE USED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS:
                SAMPLE SEQUENCE   DIAM(MM)     ATOMS/B  X10-4

METHOD     (ACTIV) SAMPLE THICKNESS AND DIAMETER AND SAMPLE/
            MONITOR FOIL SEQUENCE VARIED SYSTEMATICALLY, ALLOWING
            UNCERTAINTIES AND CORRECTIONS TO BE STUDIED AND
            QUANTIFIED.
           (TOF  ) BEFORE EACH IRRADIATION THE PROTON ENERGY WAS
            READJUSTED TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED MAXIMUM NEUTRON
            ENERGY OF 106 KEV; THIS BEST DEFINES THE QUASI-STELLAR
            SPECTRUM AT KT = 25 KEV. THE ACCELERATOR WAS OPERATED
            IN PULSED MODE TO ENABLE THE NEUTRON ENERGY TO BE
            DETERMINED USING THE TOF TECHNIQUE.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) 1 MM THICK 6-LI GLASS DETECTOR TO MONITOR
            NEUTRON YIELD, POSITIONED ON THE BEAM AXIS 91 CM FROM
            THE TARGET. READINGS WERE TAKEN EVERY 2 MINS.
           (HPGE ) USED IN GAMMA COUNTING. THE EFFICIENCY WAS CARE
            FULLY CALIBRATED IN RANGE EG = 150 - 800 KEV USING A
            SET OF STANDARD SOURCES.
