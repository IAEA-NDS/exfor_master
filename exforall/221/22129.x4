TITLE      -THE 12-C(N,GAMMA0)13-C CROSS SECTION IN THE 8 - 11 MEV
            REGION.
COMMENT    .THIS EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED IN AN ATTEMPT TO
            RESOLVE DESCREPANCIES FOUND IN A PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT,

FACILITY   (VDGT ) THE UPPSALA EN TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
            DELIVERED 2 NS BUNCHES OF 7.8, 9.3 AND 10.8 MEV DEUTE-
            RONS AT A REPETITION RATE OF 2 MHZ.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED USING A STAINLESS STEEL
            DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET, 2.5 CM LONG AND WITH A 6 MG/CM2
            THICK NICKEL ENTRANCE FOIL, FILLED TO A PRESSURE OF
            1.7 ATM.
METHOD     (TOF  ) NEUTRON-GAMMA SEPARATION WAS OBTAINED WITH
            TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETER CONSISTED OF A
            NAI/TL/ CRYSTAL, 24 CM IN DIAMETER AND 36 CM LONG,
           (SCIN ) SUURROUNDED BY A PLASTIC ANTICOINCIDENCE
            SHIELD, CONSISTING OF AN ANNULUS DETECTOR AND A FRONT
            DETECTOR. BORATED PARAFFIN WAS USED TO SHIELD THE DE-
            TECTOR FROM ROOM-SCATTERED NEUTRONS, WHILE A LAYER OF
            LEAD SERVED AS A SHIELD FOR BACKGROUND GAMMA-RAYS. A
            HEVIMET SHADOW BAR ATTENUATED THE DIRECT TARGET NEU-
            TRON FLUX. A PLUG OF LITHIUM HYDRIDE WAS INSERTED IN
            THE COLLIMATOR TO REDUCE THE EFFECT OF SCATTERED NEU-
            TRONS. THE DETECTOR RESPONSE FUNCTIONS WERE DETERMINED
            BY MEANS OF PROTON CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS FROM 11-B. THE
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS CALCULATED WITH A MONTE CARLO
            COMPUTER CODE.
           (SCIN ) NORMALIZATION OF DIFFERENT RUNS WAS ACCOMP-
            LISHED WITH A PLASTIC NEUTRON MONITOR OPERATING IN TOF
            MODE, WHICH VIEWED THE NEUTRON PRODUCTION TARGET AT A
            DISTANCE OF 4 M AND AT AN ANGLE OF 60 DEG.
MONITOR    (20-CA-40(N,G)20-CA-41,PAR,DA) GROUND STATE TRANSITION.
SAMPLE     .CYLINDRICAL SAMPLES OF CARBON AND CALCIUM, 3.1 CM IN
            DIAMETER AND 3.8 CM IN HEIGHT, ORIENTED WITH THE
            SYMMETRY AXIS PERPENDICULAR TO THE REACTION PLANE AND
            AT A DISTANCE OF 11 CM FROM THE TARGET CELL. THE CAR-
            BON AND CALCIUM SAMPLE MASSES WERE 51.24 G AND 46.21
            G, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH BEING OF NATURAL ISOTOPIC COM-
            POSITION.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND, DEAD-TIME,
            NEUTRON AND GAMMA ATTENUATION, AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING
            EFFECTS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL ERRORS ONLY. IN ADDITION, THERE
            IS A +/- 20 PERCENT SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY.
