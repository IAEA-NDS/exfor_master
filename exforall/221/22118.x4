TITLE       An investigation of energy and emission probabilities
            of tritons and alpha-particles in the spontaneous

METHOD     (RELFY)
           (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Energy spectra of tritons and alpha
            particles were measured with a particle detector
            telescope. This consisted of two surface barrier
            detectors, shielded from heavy fission fragments by a
            12 um aluminium foil, mounted in front of the
            Cf-source in a vacuum chamber.
           (SOLST) The total number of fission events were
            monitored with a separate surface barrier detector.
