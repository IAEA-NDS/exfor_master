TITLE      -AN INVESTIGATION OF ALPHA PARTICLE AND TRITON EMISSION
            IN THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF 252-CF AND NEUTRON-IN-
            DUCED FISSION OF 238-U.

METHOD     (RELFY)
           (FISCT)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) ENERGY SPECTRA OF TRITONS AND ALPHA
            PARTICLES WERE MEASURED WITH A PARTICLE DETECTOR TELE-
            SCOPE. THIS CONSISTED OF TWO SURFACE BARRIER DETEC
            TORS, SHIELDED FROM HEAVY FISSION FRAGMENTS BY A 12
            MICRON ALUMINIUM FOIL, MOUNTED IN FRONT OF THE CF-
            SOURCE IN A VACUUM CHAMBER.
           (SOLST) THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FISSION EVENTS WERE MONI-
            TORED WITH A SEPARATE SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR.
