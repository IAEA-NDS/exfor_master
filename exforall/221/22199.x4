TITLE      -NEUTRON-NEUTRON SCATTERING LENGTH IN THE REACTION
            9BE(N,NN)8BE AT 10.3 MEV.

INSTITUTE  (2GERBOC)
FACILITY   (DYNAM) BOCHUM DYNAMITRON-TANDEM ACCELERATOR, WITH DEU-
            TERIUM BEAM PULSES OF 1.2 NS DURATION AT 5 MHZ REPE-
            TITION RATE.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) A PULSED BEAM OF 10.3 MEV (FWHM 0.6 MEV) NEU-
            TRONS WAS PRODUCED BY THE D-D REACTION, USING A DEU-
            TERIUM GAS TARGET. THE AVERAGE INTENSITY WAS 5E+6 PER
            SECOND.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE ENERGIES OF THE EMITTED NEUTRONS WERE DE-
            TERMINED WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
           (PSD  ) NEUTRON-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS APPLIED.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) THE EMITTED NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN FOUR
            NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATORS, ARRANGED IN TWO IDENTICAL
            ARMS AT 30 DEGREES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BEAM. EACH
            ARM CONSISTED OF TWO DETECTORS, ONE ANNULAR DETECTOR,
            40 MM THICK AND WITH INNER/OUTER DIAMETERS OF 120/140
            MM, AND ONE STANDARD DETECTOR, 180 MM IN DIAMETER BY
            80 MM THICK. THE DETECTORS IN EITHER ARM WERE PLACED
            AT 1 AND 2 M FROM THE SAMPLE, RESPECTIVELY. THIS
            ARRANGEMENT ALLOWED MEASUREMENT AT LOW N-N RELATIVE
            ENERGIES. THE DETECTORS WERE HOUSED IN MASSIVE SHIEL-
            DINGS CONSISTING OF BRASS, STEEL AND WATER. THE
            EFFICIENCIES OF THE DETECTORS WERE MEASURED BY THE
            ASSOCIATED PARTICLE METHOD AS WELL AS BY UTILIZING A
            252-CF FISSION SOURCE. A NEUTRON FLUX MONITOR WAS
            POSITIONED IN THE BEAM DIRECTION.
PART-DET   (N    )
SAMPLE     .A DISC-SHAPED 2 INCH DIAMETER BY 0.5 INCH THICK METAL-
            LIC BERYLLIUM TARGET WAS USED.
CORRECTION .DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR DEADTIME, AND FOR BACKGROUND
            BY FITTING A POLYNOMIAL OUTSIDE THE KINEMATICAL BAND.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) TOTAL ERROR.
ANALYSIS   .THE N-N SCATTERING LENGTH WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARING
            THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA WITH A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION,
            IN WHICH THE WATSON-MIGDAL MODEL WAS USED. IN THE
            SIMULATION, THE EFFECTS OF FINITE GEOMETRY, ENERGY
            RESOLUTION AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN THE TARGET, WERE
            CONSIDERED. THE EFFECTIVE RANGE PARAMETER, R-NN, WAS
            ASSUMED TO BE 2.65 FM.
