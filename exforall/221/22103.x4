FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS) The neutron generator of the Institute
           of Experimental Physics at Debrecen, was used to
           produce a 250 micro-Amps analysed beam of 220 +/- 5 keV
           deuterons.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) An air-jet cooled Ti-D target thicker than the
            range of the deuterons with a 0.33 mm thick Mo backing
            was employed in a low-mass beam line construction.
METHOD     (ACTIV) A fission chamber with niobium and monitor
            foils mounted inside and outside the chamber was
            placed at 0 degrees relative to the deuterium beam.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A Si(Li) X-ray detector, 25 mm in diameter and
            5 mm thick with a 0.0125 mm beryllium window, giving
            a resolution of 400 eV at 17 keV, was used for the
            measurement of the niobium K-shell X-radiation. The
            absolute efficiency of the detector was determined by
            means of a thin, point-like Nb-93m reference source.
           (FISCH) A fission chamber, containing 168.2 +/- 2.5
            micrograms of U-238, enriched to 99.98%, in
            form of the compound UF4, was used. The chamber was
            operated with a voltage gradient of 600 V/cm and a
            continuous gas flow of pure argon counting gas. The
            mass of U-238 was determined by comparing with the
            activity in an aluminium foil after irradiation with
            14.8 MeV neutrons, using the ratio of the well-known
            cross sections for 13-Al-27(n,a)11-Na-24 and
            92-U-238(n,f). The cross sections used were 112.10 mb
            +/- 0.6% and 1184.4 mb +/- 1.2%, respectively.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The neutron fluence determined
            with the 10 mm diameter fissionable material was
            interrelated to the 20 mm diameter niobium foils by
            also irradiating nickel foils with these two dia-
            meters.
SAMPLE     .Niobium foils, 20 mm diameter and with a mass of
            364.24 grams, positioned 1 cm from the neutron source,
            were used. The foils were irradiated for 210 hours,
            resulting in a total neutron fluence of 9.0000e+12
            n/cm2. Nickel foils were used for size normalisation.
            A tantalum foil, 20 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm thick
            was used for determining the background from tantalum
            impurities in the niobium samples.
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for self-absorption in the
            foils and for the effects of the extension of the
            source. Further, the data were corrected for fluore-
            scence caused by Ta impurities in the Nb samples, for
            elastic neutron scattering and for background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are composed of contributions
            from the measurement of the Nb-93 activity and from
            fluence related measurements.
