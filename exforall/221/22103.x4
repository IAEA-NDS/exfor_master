TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION
            NB-93(N,INL)NB-93-M AT 2.8 MEV.

FACILITY   (CCW) THE NEUTRON GENERATOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF EXPERI-
            MENTAL PHYSICS AT DEBRECEN, WAS USED TO PRODUCE A 250
            MICROAMPS ANALYSED BEAM OF 220 +/- 5 KEV DEUTERONS.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) AN AIR-JET COOLED TI-D TARGET THICKER THAN THE
            RANGE OF THE DEUTERONS WITH A 0.33 MM THICK MO BACKING
            WAS EMPLOYED IN A LOW-MASS BEAM LINE CONSTRUCTION.
METHOD     (ACTIV) A FISSION CHAMBER WITH NIOBIUM AND MONITOR
            FOILS MOUNTED INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER WAS
            PLACED AT 0 DEGREES RELATIVE TO THE DEUTERIUM BEAM.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A SI(LI) X-RAY DETECTOR, 25 MM IN DIAMETER AND
            5 MM THICK WITH A 0.0125 MM BERYLLIUM WINDOW, GIVING
            A RESOLUTION OF 400 EV AT 17 KEV, WAS USED FOR THE
            MEASUREMENT OF THE NIOBIUM K-SHELL X-RADIATION. THE
            ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTOR WAS DETERMINED BY
            MEANS OF A THIN, POINT-LIKE NB-93M REFERENCE SOURCE.
           (FISCH) A FISSION CHAMBER, CONTAINING 168.2 +/- 2.5
            MICROGRAMS OF U-238, ENRICHED TO 99.98 PERCENT, IN
            FORM OF THE COMPOUND UF4, WAS USED. THE CHAMBER WAS
            OPERATED WITH A VOLTAGE GRADIENT OF 600 V/CM AND A
            CONTINUOUS GAS FLOW OF PURE ARGON COUNTING GAS. THE
            MASS OF U-238 WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARING WITH THE
            ACTIVITY IN AN ALUMINIUM FOIL AFTER IRRADIATION WITH
            14.8 MEV NEUTRONS, USING THE RATIO OF THE WELL-KNOWN
            CROSS SECTIONS FOR 13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24 AND
            92-U-238(N,F). THE CROSS SECTIONS USED WERE 112.10 MB
            +/- 0.6 PERCENT AND 1184.4 MB +/- 1.2 PERCENT,
            RESPECTIVELY.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) THE NEUTRON FLUENCE DETERMINED
            WITH THE 10 MM DIAMETER FISSIONABLE MATERIAL WAS
            INTERRELATED TO THE 20 MM DIAMETER NIOBIUM FOILS BY
            ALSO IRRADIATING NICKEL FOILS WITH THESE TWO DIA-
            METERS.
SAMPLE     .NIOBIUM FOILS, 20 MM DIAMETER AND WITH A MASS OF
            364.24 GRAMS, POSITIONED 1 CM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE,
            WERE USED. THE FOILS WERE IRRADIATED FOR 210 HOURS,
            RESULTING IN A TOTAL NEUTRON FLUENCE OF 9.0000E+12
            N/CM2. NICKEL FOILS WERE USED FOR SIZE NORMALISATION.
            A TANTALUM FOIL, 20 MM IN DIAMETER AND 0.1 MM THICK
            WAS USED FOR DETERMINING THE BACKGROUND FROM TANTALUM
            IMPURITIES IN THE NIOBIUM SAMPLES.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE
            FOILS AND FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTENSION OF THE
            SOURCE. FURTHER, THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR FLOURE-
            SCENCE CAUSED BY TA IMPURITIES IN THE NB SAMPLES, FOR
            ELASTIC NEUTRON SCATTERING AND FOR BACKGROUND.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS ARE COMPOSED OF CONTRIBUTIONS
            FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF THE NB-93 ACTIVITY AND FROM
            FLUENCE RELATED MEASUREMENTS.
