FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE CN-TYPE HVEC 7 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
            OF CBNM. DELIVERED A 9.6 MICRO-AMP DEUTERON BEAM OF
            AVERAGE ENERGY 3000 +/- 20 KEV IN THE TARGET FOR
            4.0833 DAYS.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) A T-TI TARGET WITH A 3 CM DIAMETER TITANIUM
            LAYER OF 4.42 MILLIGRAM/CM2 THICKNESS LOADED WITH
            TRITIUM WITH A T/TI RATIO OF 1.3. THE TARGET WAS
            BACKED BY A 4 CM DIAMETER SILVER SHEET OF 0.25 MM
            THICKNESS. IT WAS GLUED IN A CYLINDRICAL ALUMINIUM
            TARGET HOLDER WITH 1 MM WALL THICKNESS. THE WHOLE
            ASSEMBLY WAS WOBBLED AND AIR COOLED. THE ENERGY LOSS
            IN HALF THE T-TI LAYER WAS 270 KEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE SAMPLES WERE ACTIVATED IN DIFFERENT ANGULAR
            POSITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE BEAM DIRECTION. IN THIS
            WAY THE NEUTRON ENERGY VARIATION WITH ANGLE FROM THE
            SOURCE REACTION COULD BE USED FOR THE EXCITATION
            FUNCTION MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SAMPLES WERE MEASURED
            RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER USING AN INTRINSIC GERMANIUM
            DETECTOR AT IRK AND DETERMINING THE FULL-ENERGY PEAK
            AREA OF THE 320 KEV GAMMA-RAY.
           (NAICR) ABSOLUTE ACTIVITIES WERE DETERMINED FOR THE
            SAMPLES WITH HIGHEST ACTIVITY USING A 12.7 CM DIAMTER
            BY 12.7 CM THICK WELL-TYPE NAI-TL SCINTILLATOR AT IRK,
            COUNTING ABOVE AN ENERGY DISCRIMINATION LEVEL OF 22.1
            KEV.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) THE TRIPLE-COINCIDENCE PROTON
            RECOIL TELESCOPE TC2 OF CBNM, POSITIONED IN THE
            DEUTERON BEAM DIRECTION WITH A SOURCE TO RADIATOR
            DISTANCE OF 80 CM, WAS USED FOR THE ABSOLUTE FLUENCE
            DETERMINATION. THE FLUENCE WAS FOUND TO BE 1.887E+13
            +/- 0.051E+13 NEUTRONS/SR, THE MAIN UNCERTAINTY BEING
            THE HYDROGEN CONTENT OF THE 43.75 MG/CM2 POLYETHYLENE
            RADIATOR USED. THE FLUENCE AT OTHER ANGLES WAS DETER-
            MINED BY USING THE KNOWN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
            SOURCE REACTION.
           .THE SIX CR SAMPLES
            POSITIONED AT 99, 105 AND 111 DEGREES WERE SANDWICHED
            BETWEEN TWO NIOBIUM FOILS IN ORDER TO CHECK THE
            FLUENCE DETERMINATIONS IN THE 14 MEV REGION USING THE
            41-NB-93/N,2N/-REACTION. THE ACTIVITY OF THE NB FOILS
            WERE MEASURED WITH THE NAI-DETECTOR. THE RESULT AGREED
            WITH THE PROTON RECOIL MEASUREMENTS WITHIN +/- 1
            PERCENT.
SAMPLE     .24 METALLIC SAMPLES OF RECTANGULAR SHAPE, 16 X 8 X 0.8
            MM. THEY WERE FIXED SYMMETRICALLY TO THE ION BEAM
            DIRECTION IN AN ALUMINIUM SAMPLE HOLDER RING OF 99 MM
            RADIUS AT NOMINAL ANGLES 9, 21, 33, 45, 57, 69, 81,
            99, 105 111, 123 AND 135 DEGREES. A 400 PPM ANTIMONY
            IMPURITY WAS FOUND IN THE SAMPLES.
CORRECTION .THE NEUTRON FLUENCE WAS CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON ATTENU-
            ATION AND NEUTRON IN- AND OUTSCATTERING BY THE TARGET
            BACKING AND ITS HOLDER.
           .THE MEASURED ACTIVITIES WERE CORRECTED FOR SELF-
            ATTENUATION AND COMPTON SCATTERING IN THE SAMPLES.
            ACTIVATION ENHANCEMENT DUE TO ELASTIC SCATTERING IN
            THE SAMPLES AND DUE TO INSCATTERING FROM ADJACENT
            MATERIAL WAS ALSO TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) TOTAL UNCERTAINTIES, ONE STANDARD DEVIATION.
            THE TOTAL UNCERTAINTIES ARE COMPOSED OF CONTRIBUTIONS
            BEING EQUAL FOR ALL SAMPLES AND THOSE WHICH VARY FROM
            SAMPLE TO SAMPLE. SEE BELOW, WHERE ALL ERRORS ARE ONE
            STANDARD DEVIATION.
