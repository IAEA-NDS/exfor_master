TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF RESONANCE PARAMETERS OF 232-TH AND
            THEIR INTEGRAL CHECK THROUGH THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL.
AUTHOR     (K.KOBAYASHI,Y.FUJITA,I.KIMURA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO)
FACILITY   (LINAC) THE 46 MEV ELECTRON LINAC AT THE RESEARCH REAC-
            TOR INSTITUTE OF KYOTO UNIVERSITY, OPERATED AT A
            FREQUENCY OF 240 - 250 PULSES/SEC AND WITH A PULSE
            WIDTH OF 33 (HIGH ENERGY) - 100 (LOW ENERGY) NS, WAS
            USED FOR THE MEASUREMENTS.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) BURSTS OF NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED FROM THE
            WATER-COOLED PHOTONEUTRON TARGET, WHICH WERE MADE OF
            SEVERAL SHEETS OF TA PLATES, 5 CM BY 5 CM SQUARE WITH
            AN EFFECTIVE TOTAL THICKNESS OF ABOUT 3.5 CM. THE TAR-
            GET WAS PLACED IN THE CENTER OF AN OCTAGONAL WATER
            TANK, 30 CM IN DIAMETER AND 8 CM THICK, TO MODERATE
            THE NEUTRON ENERGIES. A 7 CM DIAMETER BY 20 CM THICK
            PB BLOCK WAS PLACED IN THE FLIGHT PATH TO SUPPRESS THE
            PROMPT GAMMA-FLASH. THE NEUTRONS WERE COLLIMATED TO A
            4 CM DIAMETER AT THE SAMPLE POSITION BY B4C AND PB
            COLLIMATORS. A 0.5 MM THICK CD FILTER WAS USED TO
            SUPPRESS THERMAL NEUTRONS.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT WITH A
            FLIGHT PATH OF 22.13 +/- 0.03 M. A 14 G/CM2 S FILTER
            WAS USED TO REDUCE GAMMA-RAYS AND FAST NEUTRONS, WHILE
            5.7 MM OF PB, 3.0 MM OF MNO2, 1.0 MM OF CO, 0.5 MM OF
            AG AND 0.5 MM OF CD WAS USED AS NOTCH FILTERS. THE
            ENERGY SCALE WAS CALIBRATED BY USING A U FILTER AS A
            STANDARD.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) A 6-LITHIUM-LOADED GLASS SCINTILLATOR OF 12.7
            CM DIAMETER BY 1.27 CM THICK, MOUNTED ON A PM-TUBE,
            WAS USED AS NEUTRON DETECTOR.
           .THE NEUTRON INTENSITY WAS MONITORED WITH A 1 MM THICK
            6-LITHIUM GLASS DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     .THREE TYPES OF METALLIC TH SAMPLES WITH A PURITY OF
            99.7 PERCENT WERE USED, NAMELY /1/ 10 X 10 X 0.05 CM,
            /2/ 8 X 8 X 0.1 CM, AND /3/ 5.08 X 5.08 X 0.32 CM.
            FIVE KINDS OF SAMPLE THICKNESSES RANGING FROM 0.0015
            TO 0.0277 ATOMS/BARN WERE USED FOR THE FIRST FOUR S-
            WAVE RESONANCES, AND FOUR KINDS OF SAMPLE THICKNESSES
            RANGING FROM 0.0277 TO 0.110 ATOMS/BARN WERE USED FOR
            THE HIGHER ENERGY RESONANCES.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR DEAD-TIME LOSSES AND BACK-
            GROUND. THE BACKGROUND WAS DETERMINED FROM THE BLACK
            RESONANCES AND/OR NOTCH FILTERS OF CO, MN, AG AND CD.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS GIVEN CONTAIN BOTH STATISTICAL
            AND SYSTEMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS.
ANALYSIS   .MULTILEVEL BREIT-WIGNER ANALYSIS.
