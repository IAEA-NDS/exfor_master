INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3.75MV van de Graaff accelerator. Proton
            beam was continually moved across the target to avoid
            overheating and to optimise the yield. Continuous beam
            currents of up to 70 uAmp were used during
            activations.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Metallic layer of natural Li, 1 mg/cm2 thick
            and 5 or 6 mm diam, evaporated on a 1.0 mm thick
            water-cooled Cu backing. Using 1912 keV protons the
            120 deg forward cone of emitted neutrons closely
            approximates to a Maxwellian kT = 25 keV shape. Total
            neutron rate was 5.0E+8/s.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG,,MXW)
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-198-G,,DG,411.8,.955)
DETECTOR   (GLASD) 1 mm thick 6-Li glass detector to monitor
            neutron yield, positioned on the beam axis 91 cm from
            the target. Readings were taken at least every 4 mins
            throughout the activations.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample thickness and diameter and sample/
            monitor foil sequence varied systematically, allowing
            uncertainties and corrections to Be studied and
            quantified.
           (TOF) Before each irradiation the proton energy was
            readjusted to produce the required maximum neutron
            energy of 106 keV; this best defines the quasi-stellar
            spectrum at kT = 25 keV. The accelerator was operated
            in pulsed mode (1 MHz with 10 ns pulse width) to
            enable the neutron energy to be determined using the
            TOF technique.

SAMPLE      99.9% Pure Y2O3 evaporated in a thin 10 mm diam
            deposit onto 1 mg/cm2 thick Al foils of 14 mm diam.
            The sample mass was determined by weighing using a
            microbalance. Three different samples were used with
            the following measured masses:
                             0.500 +- 0.004 mg
                             0.749 +- 0.004 mg
                             0.266 +- 0.004 mg
            finally the samples were centered on a 15 ug/cm2
            plastic foil holder stretched over a 40 mm diam Al
            ring and then sealed with a second plastic foil.
            Monitor gold metal foils 0.03 mm thick and average
            mass 46 mg were placed adjacent to the samples.
DETECTOR   (SOLST,D4PI) 4-Pi beta spectrometer consisting of two

            close geometry, cooled by liquid nitrogen and adjusted
            to 0.5 mm from the sample using micrometer screws.
            The spectrometer efficiency was determined
            experimentally by irradiating an evaporated gold foil
            of 10 mm diam and 1.15 mg/cm2 and measuring the

SAMPLE      99.5% Pure sro or 99.99% pure SrF2 evaporated in a
            thin 10 mm diam deposit onto 1 mg/cm2 thick Al foils
            of 14 mm diam. The sample mass was determined by
            weighing using a microbalance. Three different samples
            were used with the following measured masses:
                      SrO    1.277 +- 0.004 mg
                      SrF2   0.970 +- 0.004 mg
                      SrF2   0.999 +- 0.004 mg
            finally the samples were centered on a 15 micro-g/cm2
            plastic foil holder stretched over a 40 mm diam Al
            ring and then sealed with a second plastic foil.
            Monitor gold metal foils 0.03 mm thick and average
            mass 46 mg were placed adjacent to the samples.
DETECTOR   (SOLST,D4PI) 4-Pi beta spectrometer consisting of two
            Si(Li) detectors (16 mm diam and 400 um thick) in
            close geometry, cooled by liquid nitrogen and adjusted
            to 0.5 mm from the sample using micrometer screws.
            The spectrometer efficiency was determined
            experimentally by irradiating an evaporated gold foil
            of 10 mm diam and 1.15 mg/cm2 and measuring the
            activity first in a calibrated HPGe detector and then
            counting in the spectrometer.
