TITLE      - 88-SR AND 89-Y: THE S-PROCESS AT MAGIC NEUTRON NUMBER
             N=50.

INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3.75MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR. PROTON
            BEAM WAS CONTINUALLY MOVED ACROSS THE TARGET TO AVOID
            OVERHEATING AND TO OPTIMISE THE YIELD. CONTINUOUS BEAM
            CURRENTS OF UP TO 70 MICRO-AMP WERE USED DURING
            ACTIVATIONS.
CRITIQUE   .ALTHOUGH THE TERM 'MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM' IS USED
            THROUGHOUT THE PAPER THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IN A STELLAR
            CONTEXT, THE ACTUAL AVERAGE CROSS SECTION (<SIGMA>KT)
            BEING DEFINED AS THE AVERAGED REACTION RATE (CROSS
            SECTION MULTIPLIED BY VELOCITY) DIVIDED BY THE MEAN
            THERMAL VELOCITY (VT) WITHIN THE STELLAR PLASMA OF
            THERMAL ENERGY KT :
               <SIGMA>KT  = <SIGMA X VELOCITY>/ VT
            USING THE ACCEPTED MAXWELL VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
            FORMULA THE TERM VT CAN EASILY BE SHOWN TO BE
            (2KT/M)**0.5, M BEING THE REDUCED MASS. THIS IS EQUI-
            VALENT TO FOLDING THE CROSS SECTION WITH AN ENERGY
            SPECTRUM PROPORTIONAL TO A MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTION
            TIMES VELOCITY (E(N) X EXP(-E(N)/KT)) WITH A NORMAL-
            ISATION FACTOR OF 2/(PI)**0.5, INSTEAD OF A TRUE
            MAXWELLIAN (E(N)**0.5 X EXP(-E(N)/KT)). IT IS THIS
            FORMER SPECTRUM THAT IS REPRODUCED EXPERIMENTALLY
            USING THE P-LI7 SOURCE, AND THE RESULTING AVERAGE
            CROSS SECTION INCLUDING THE 2/(PI)**0.5 FACTOR
            APPEARS IN THE DATA TABLE.

            AND 5 OR 6 MM DIAM, EVAPORATED ON A 1.0 MM THICK
            WATER-COOLED CU BACKING. USING 1912 KEV PROTONS THE
            120 DEG FORWARD CONE OF EMITTED NEUTRONS CLOSELY
            APPROXIMATES TO A MAXWELLIAN KT = 25 KEV SHAPE. TOTAL
            NEUTRON RATE WAS 5.0E+8 S-1.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) 1 MM THICK 6-LI GLASS DETECTOR TO MONITOR
            NEUTRON YIELD, POSITIONED ON THE BEAM AXIS 91 CM FROM
            THE TARGET. READINGS WERE TAKEN AT LEAST EVERY 4 MINS
            THROUGHOUT THE ACTIVATIONS.
METHOD     (ACTIV) SAMPLE THICKNESS AND DIAMETER AND SAMPLE/
            MONITOR FOIL SEQUENCE VARIED SYSTEMATICALLY, ALLOWING
            UNCERTAINTIES AND CORRECTIONS TO BE STUDIED AND
            QUANTIFIED.
           (TOF  ) BEFORE EACH IRRADIATION THE PROTON ENERGY WAS
            READJUSTED TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED MAXIMUM NEUTRON
            ENERGY OF 106 KEV; THIS BEST DEFINES THE QUASI-STELLAR
            SPECTRUM AT KT = 25 KEV. THE ACCELERATOR WAS OPERATED
            IN PULSED MODE (1 MHZ WITH 10 NS PULSE WIDTH) TO
            ENABLE THE NEUTRON ENERGY TO BE DETERMINED USING THE
            TOF TECHNIQUE.

            THE SAMPLE MASS WAS DETERMINED BY WEIGHING USING A
            MICROBALANCE. THREE DIFFERENT SAMPLES WERE USED WITH
            THE FOLLOWING MEASURED MASSES:
