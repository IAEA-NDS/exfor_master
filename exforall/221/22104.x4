INSTITUTE  (2GERMUN)
FACILITY   (REAC)  FRM research reactor with 4 MW thermal power.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutrons at energies 1.26, 5.19, 18.8, 132 keV
            were obtained with the help of resonance filters.
            Neutrons of 1970 eV were obtained by the double
            resonance scattering technique. A foil of Cu-63 in a
            tangential beam tube served as a resonance scatterer
            near the reactor core. The emerging 1970 eV neutrons
            were, after a flight path of 7 m, scattered again by
            a Se-80 scatterer. Primarily scattered neutrons of
            other energies were suppressed by a filter combination
            of Sc, B4C and Co.
           .Neutrons of 143 keV energy were produced by filtering
            the fission neutron beam of the converter facility at
            the reactor with a silicon filter.
METHOD     .Transmission measurements.
           (FNB)  Filtered neutron beams
DETECTOR   (BF3)   BF3-counters were used. No other details
            given.
SAMPLE     .Samples of lead and bismuth were used. No other
            details given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
STATUS     .Data taken from main reference.
