TITLE      -EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE ELECTRIC POLARIZABILITY OF
            THE NEUTRON.
AUTHOR     (L.KOESTER,W.WASCHKOWSKI,J.MEIER)
INSTITUTE  (2GERMUN)
FACILITY   (REAC ) FRM RESEARCH REACTOR WITH 4 MW THERMAL POWER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) NEUTRONS OF 1970 EV WERE OBTAINED BY THE DOUBLE
            RESONANCE SCATTERING TECHNIQUE. A FOIL OF CU-63 IN A
            TANGENTIAL BEAM TUBE SERVED AS A RESONANCE SCATTERER
            NEAR THE REACTOR CORE. THE EMERGING 1970 EV NEUTRONS
            WERE, AFTER A FLIGHT PATH OF 7 M, SCATTERED AGAIN BY
            A SE-80 SCATTERER. PRIMARILY SCATTERED NEUTRONS OF
            OTHER ENERGIES WERE SUPPRESSED BY A FILTER COMBINATION
            OF SC, B4C AND CO.
           .NEUTRONS OF 143 KEV ENERGY WERE PRODUCED BY FILTERING
            THE FISSION NEUTRON BEAM OF THE CONVERTER FACILITY AT
            THE REACTOR WITH A SILICON FILTER.
METHOD     .TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS.
DETECTOR   (BF3  ) BF3-COUNTERS WERE USED. NO OTHER DETAILS
            GIVEN.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES OF LEAD AND BISMUTH WERE USED. NO OTHER
            DETAILS GIVEN.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
