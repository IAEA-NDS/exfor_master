TITLE      -NEUTRON SCATTERING LENGTHS OF MOLTEN METALS DETERMINED

INC-SOURCE (REAC ) NEUTRON-GRAVITY-REFRACTOMETER USING 108 M
            FLIGHT PATH WITH A DROP IN HEIGHT OF UP TO 1.8 M.
METHOD     (REFL) NEUTRON-GRAVITY-REFRACTOMETER. THE REFLECTIVITY
            (REFLECTED/INCIDENT NEUTRON NUMBERS) OF A LIQUID
            MIRROR OF THE MOLTEN METAL SAMPLE WAS MEASURED AS A
            FUNCTION OF THE GEOMETRIC HEIGHT FALL OF THE NEUTRON
            BEAM.
ANALYSIS   .THE MEASURED REFLECTIVITIES AGAINST HEIGHT FALL ARE
            FITTED BY A REFLECTION CURVE, FROM WHICH THE POINT OF
            TOTAL REFLECTION IS OBTAINED OCCURRING AT THE CRITICAL
            HEIGHT FALL FOR THE METAL. THE COHERENT SCATTERING
            LENGTH FOR BOUND ATOMS IS PROPORTIONAL TO THIS
            CRITICAL HEIGHT FALL.
ASSUMED    .THE CONSTANT OF PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN THE CRITICAL
            HEIGHT FALL AND THE COHERENT SCATTERING LENGTH IS
            CALCULATED USING THE FOLLOWING ASSUMED VALUES:
                    NEUTRON MASS = 939.5720(42) MEV/C2
                        LITTLE G = 9.80745(10) M/S2
                PLANCK'S CONST H = 6.582122(39)E-22 MEV.S
                               L = 6.0221367(36)E+23 MOL-1

            GLASS WINDOWS IN THE CYLINDER ENDS ALLOWED THE BROAD
            40 CM NEUTRON BEAM TO TRAVERSE THE CHAMBER.

            IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER.
