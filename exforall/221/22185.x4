TITLE      -MECHANISM FOR ELECTRIC DIPOLE TRANSITIONS FROM THE
            BROAD P-WAVE NEUTRON RESONANCE IN 24-MG.

FACILITY   .3.2 MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR AT TOKYO INST. OF TECH.,
            PULSED PROTON BEAM, REPETITION RATE 2 MHZ, PULSE WIDTH
            1.5 NS AND AVERAGE BEAM CURRENT 9 MICRO-AMP.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) LI EVAPORATED CU DISK. TARGET THICKNESS DETER-
            MINED BY MEASURING NEUTRON TOF SPECTRA.
METHOD     (TOF  )
           (GSPEC) THE GAMMA PULSE-HEIGHT SPECTRA WERE UNFOLDED
            BY AN ITERATIVE METHOD TO YIELD GAMMA ENERGY SPECTRA
            AND YIELDS, USING THE MATRIX FORMED FROM THE PRODUCT
            OF THE GAMMA RESPONSE MATRIX AND M-C GENERATED
            CORRECTION MATRIX.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) CAPTURE GAMMAS WERE DETECTED BY A NAI(TL)
            DETECTOR 7.6 CM IN DIAM AND 15.2 CM LONG CENTERED IN
            AN ANNULAR NAI(TL) DETECTOR 25.4 CM IN DIAM AND
            28.0 CM LONG, PLACED IN A HEAVY SHIELD OF BORATED
            PARAFFIN, LEAD AND CADMIUM, THE WHOLE DETECTOR BEING
            OPERATED AS AN ANTI-COMPTON GAMMA SPECTROMETER.
            A 6-LIH SHIELD WAS ADDED TO THE DETECTOR COLLIMATOR
            TO ABSORB NEUTRONS SCATTERED BY THE SAMPLE. THE SAMPLE
            DETECTOR DISTANCE WAS 80 CM AND THE GAMMAS WERE
            OBSERVED AT A LAB ANGLE OF 125 DEG TO THE PROTON BEAM.
            DETECTOR EFFICIENCY DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY USING
            SEVERAL CALIBRATED SOURCES.

SAMPLE     .DISKS OF NATURAL MG, 60 MM DIAM BY 2 MM FOR THE 84 KEV
            RESONANCE EXPERIMENT AND 60 MM DIAM BY 12 MM FOR THE
            266 KEV AND 431 KEV RESONANCE EXPERIMENTS. THE SAMPLE
            THICKNESSES WERE CHOSEN TO GIVE THE N TRANSMISSIONS OF
            ABOUT 70 % AT THE RESONANCE PEAK, THUS REDUCING THE
            MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND SELF-SHIELDING CORRECTIONS.
            IN ATOMS/BARN THE SAMPLE THICKNESSES ARE:
                          84 KEV RES   6.78E-3 ATOM/B
                 266 AND 431 KEV RES   4.06E-2 ATOM/B
            THE DISCS WERE PLACED 156 MM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE
            AT 90 DEG TO THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION.

            CREATION OF GAMMAS IN THE SAMPLE. THE CORRECTION WAS
            FOUND TO BE SEVERAL PERCENT AT MOST.

           .THE PARTIAL OFF-RESONANCE CROSS SECTIONS AT THE RES-
            ONANCES CONSIDERED WERE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF
            POTENTIAL-CAPTURE THEORY USING THE COMPUTER CODE
            HIKARI. SUCH CALCULATIONS MAY INCLUDE ERRORS OF 20 -
            30 %, BUT THESE CROSS SECTIONS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 10 %
            OF THE AVERAGE PARTIAL CROSS SECTIONS.
