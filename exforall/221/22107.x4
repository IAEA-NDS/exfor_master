FACILITY   (VDG) CN-TYPE VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR AT GEEL. ABOUT
            4 MICRO-AMPS OF DEUTERONS WERE ACCELERATED TO 5.091
            +/- 0.005 MEV.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) 7.91 MEV NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY THE D(D,N)
            REACTION USING A 4 CM LONG AIR-JET COOLED GAS TARGET
            CELL, OPERATED AT 1.5E+05 PA GAS PRESSURE, EQUIPPED
            WITH A 3.29 MG/CM2 HAVAR ENTRANCE WINDOW AND A 0.5 MM
            TA BEAM STOP. A BACKGROUND RUN WAS PERFORMED WITH THE
            GAS CELL FILLED WITH HE.
METHOD     (ACTIV) A FISSION CHAMBER WITH NIOBIUM AND MONITOR
            FOILS MOUNTED INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER WAS
            PLACED AT 0 DEGREES RELATIVE TO THE DEUTERIUM BEAM AND
            AT A DISTANCE OF 6 MM FROM THE TARGET BEAM STOP.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A CALIBRATED SI(LI) X-RAY DETECTOR WAS USED FOR
            THE MEASUREMENT OF THE NIOBIUM K-SHELL X-RADIATION.
           (FISCH) A FISSION CHAMBER, CONTAINING 168.4 +/- 2.1
            MICROGRAMS OF U-238, ENRICHED TO 99.98 PERCENT, IN
            FORM OF THE COMPOUND UF4, WAS USED. THE URANIUM
            DEPOSIT WAS A 10 MM DIAMETER LAYER ON A 0.2 MM AL
            BACKING. THE MASS OF U-238 WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARING
            WITH THE ACTIVITY IN AN ALUMINIUM FOIL AFTER
            IRRADIATION WITH 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS, USING THE RATIO OF
            THE WELL-KNOWN CROSS SECTIONS FOR
            13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24 AND 92-U-238(N,F). THE CROSS
            SECTIONS USED WERE 112.10 MB +/- 0.6 PERCENT AND
            1182.7 MB +/- 0.9 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.
           (NAICR) A 12.7 CM BY 12.7 CM NAI(TL) WELL-TYPE DETECTOR
            WAS USED TO MEASURE THE CO-58 ACTIVITY FROM THE NICKEL
            FOILS.
           (GELI) THE TA-182 ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED BY MEANS OF A
            GE(LI) GAMMA-RAY DETECTOR.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) THE NEUTRON FLUENCE DETERMINED
            WITH THE 10 MM DIAMETER FISSIONABLE MATERIAL WAS
            INTERRELATED TO THE 20 MM DIAMETER NIOBIUM FOILS BY
            ALSO IRRADIATING NICKEL FOILS WITH 20 MM DIAMETERS AND
            MEASURING THE CENTRAL AND OUTER PARTS SEPARATELY.
SAMPLE     .A NIOBIUM FOIL, 20 MM DIAMETER AND 0.13 MM THICK, WITH
            A PURITY OF BETTER THAN 99.9 PERCENT, WAS USED. NICKEL
            FOILS WERE USED FOR SIZE NORMALISATION. A TANTALUM
            FOIL, 20 MM IN DIAMETER AND 0.1 MM THICK WAS USED FOR
            DETERMINING THE BACKGROUND FROM TANTALUM IMPURITIES IN
            THE NIOBIUM SAMPLES. THE FOILS WERE IRRADIATED FOR 60
            HOURS, RESULTING IN A TOTAL NEUTRON FLUENCE OF 5.0E+12
            N/CM2.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR SELF-ABSORPTION IN THE
            FOILS AND FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTENSION OF THE
            SOURCE. FURTHER, THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR FLOURE-
            SCENCE CAUSED BY TA IMPURITIES IN THE NB SAMPLES, FOR
            ELASTIC NEUTRON SCATTERING AND FOR BACKGROUND.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERROR IS COMPOSED OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
            THE MEASUREMENT OF THE NB-93 ACTIVITY AND FROM FLUENCE
            RELATED MEASUREMENTS.
