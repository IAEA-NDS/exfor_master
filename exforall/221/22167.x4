INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 30 MG/CM-SQ THICK SELF-SUPPORTING FOIL OF
            NATURAL ABUNDANCE LOCATED AT THE EXIT OF THE BEAM
            SWINGER MAGNET. NEUTRONS OF 35 MEV (650 KEV FWHM) WERE
            PRODUCED AT 0 DEG TO THE PROTON BEAM WITH INCIDENT
            PROTON ENERGIES OF 37 MEV.
METHOD     (TOF  )NEUTRON TIME-OF-FLIGHT SPECTROMETER WITH A BEAM
            SWINGER SYSTEM, USING A 44 M FLIGHT PATH.
           .TO REDUCE BACKGROUND COMING FROM THE NEUTRON PRODUCING
            SOURCE IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION AT THE DETECTOR
            POSITION, 1 M THICK CONCRETE WALLS AND LEAD AND IRON
            COLLIMATORS, AS WELL AS A 90 CM LONG IRON SHADOW BAR,
            WERE USED.
DETECTOR   (SCIN )AN ARRAY OF 12 LIQUID SCINTILLATOR DETECTORS:
           (STANK) FOUR RECTANGULAR BOXES DIMENSIONS 50 X 10 X
            5 CM FILLED WITH NE213, AND EIGHT CYLINDRICAL CON-
            TAINERS 20.3 CM DIAM AND 5 CM DEEP ALSO FILLED WITH
            NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATOR.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL C TARGET 2.0 CM DIAM AND 7.5 CM IN HEIGHT
            WEIGHING 39 G AND SUSPENDED ON NEGLIGIBLY THIN NYLON
            WIRES.
CORRECTION .SUBTRACTION OF BACKGROUND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AIR AND
            THE NEUTRON SOURCE
           .FINITE SCATTERING EFFECT ON NEUTRON YIELDS: ESTIMATION
            OF MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND ATTENUATION, AND ANGLE
            AVERAGING. THESE CORRECTIONS ASSESSED BY MONTE CARLO
            SIMULATION USING THE CODE MULTI1.
