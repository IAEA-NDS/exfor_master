TITLE      -STELLAR KRYPTON CROSS SECTIONS AT KT = 25 AND 52 KEV
AUTHOR     (F.KAEPPELER,A.A.NAQVI,M.AL-OHALI)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK) F.K. AND EXPERIMENTAL SITE
           (3SARDHA) A.A.N., M.A.-O.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) 3.75MV PULSED 1 MHZ RATE, WITH 18 NS WIDTH AND
            2 MUA BEAM CURRENT DURING 52 KEV SPECTRUM MEASUREMENTS
CRITIQUE   .ALTHOUGH THE TERM 'MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM' IS USED
            THROUGHOUT THE PAPER THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IN A STELLAR
            CONTEXT, THE ACTUAL AVERAGE CROSS SECTION (<SIGMA>KT)
            BEING DEFINED AS THE AVERAGED REACTION RATE (CROSS
            SECTION MULTIPLIED BY VELOCITY) DIVIDED BY THE MEAN
            THERMAL VELOCITY (VT) WITHIN THE STELLAR PLASMA OF
            THERMAL ENERGY KT :
               <SIGMA>KT  = <SIGMA X VELOCITY>/ VT
            USING THE ACCEPTED MAXWELL VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
            FORMULA THE TERM VT CAN EASILY BE SHOWN TO BE
            (2KT/M)**0.5, M BEING THE REDUCED MASS. THIS IS EQUI-
            VALENT TO FOLDING THE CROSS SECTION WITH AN ENERGY
            SPECTRUM PROPORTIONAL TO A MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTION
            TIMES VELOCITY (E(N) X EXP(-E(N)/KT)) WITH A NORMAL-
            ISATION FACTOR OF 2/(PI)**0.5, INSTEAD OF A TRUE
            MAXWELLIAN (E(N)**0.5 X EXP(-E(N)/KT)). IT IS THIS
            FORMER SPECTRUM THAT IS REPRODUCED EXPERIMENTALLY
            USING THE P-LI7 SOURCE, AND THE RESULTING AVERAGE
            CROSS SECTION APPEARS IN THE DATA TABLE. IT IS
            ASSUMED THAT THE 2/(PI)**0.5 FACTOR HAS BEEN APPLIED.
