FACILITY   (VDG,2FR BRC) 4 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR, DEUTERON
            BEAM ENERGY 1.8 - 4.0 MEV, BEAM CURRENT 15 - 25 MUA.
           (SPECM,2FR GRA) 60 DEG AND 12 CM RADIUS MASS
            SPECTROMETER.
INC-SOURCE (D-D,D-T) CYLINDRICAL GAS TARGET 100 MM LONG AND 15 MM
            IN DIAM FILLED WITH GASEOUS 2-H OR 3-H AT A PRESSURE
            OF 1.5 BAR. TARGET COOLED BY REFRIGERATED HE CIRCULAT-
            ING BETWEEN TWO 2.4 MICRON THICK HAVAR FOILS SEPARATED
            BY 5 MM AND ISOLATING THE NEUTRON PRODUCING TARGET
            FROM THE EVACUATED EXTENSION.
              EN = 5 - 7 MEV: 2-H TARGET WITH ED = 2.4 - 4 MEV
              EN = 16 - 19 MEV: 3-H TARGET WITH ED = 1.8 - 3.2 MEV
INC-SPECT  .ENERGY RESOLUTION (+- HWHM) CALCULATED TAKING INTO
            ACCOUNT KINEMATICS AND ENERGY LOSS AND STRAGGLING IN
            APPARATUS.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL MG, 99.99% PURE, IN A DISC 16.5 MM IN DIAM AND
            2 MM THICK, PLACED WITH ITS AXIS ALONG THE DEUTERON
            BEAM AXIS AND 50 MM FROM THE END OF THE GAS TARGET
            CYLINDER.
DETECTOR   (TELES) 'E DELTA-E' PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE TO MONITOR
            NEUTRON BEAM, PLACED 100 CM FROM CENTRE OF GAS TARGET
            AT AN ANGLE OF 20 DEG TO BEAM AXIS. ABSOLUTE CALI-
            BRATION PERFORMED USING A SECOND SIMILAR TELESCOPE AND
            ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY CALCULATED USING A PRECISE SIMU-
            LATION CODE.
METHOD     (ASEP ) MASS SPECTROMETER USED TO MEASURE NE
            CONCENTRATIONS IN MG SAMPLES. THE SAMPLES WERE
            OUTGASSED AT 85 DEG-C UNDER VACUUM FOR SEVERAL DAYS,
            AND THE RELEASED NE WAS CLEANSED USING TI SPONGES,
            HEATED CU-O-PD POWDER AND ACTIVATED CHARCOAL TRAP.
            ABSOLUTE NEON CALIBRATION WAS OBTAINED WITH A GAS
            PIPET OF AIR COMPOSITION.
CORRECTION .NEUTRON FLUENCE IS NOT CORRECTED FOR ATTENUATION AND
            MULTIPLE NEUTRON SCATTERING IN MG SINCE THESE EFFECTS
            ARE NEGLIGIBLE IN A 2 MM THICK SAMPLE.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) QUADRATIC SUM OF OVERALL ERRORS IN FOLLOWING
            QUANTITIES:
               NO. OF MG ATOMS IN THE TARGET
               INTEGRATED NEUTRON FLUX (INCLUDING TELESCOPE EFFI-
                 CIENCY CALIBRATION, TELESCOPE-GAS TARGET DISTANCE
                 AND COUNTING STATISTICS)
               MEASURED NE CONCENTRATIONS (INCLUDING CORRECTIONS
                 FOR CALIBRATION, TARGET/SYSTEM BLANKS, AND
                 THE CONTAMINANTS 40-AR(2+), WATER AND CO2(2+)).

CORRECTION .22-NE CONCENTRATIONS CORRECTED FOR THE INTERFERENCE
            FROM CO2(2+). THE VALUE AT EN = 19.05 MEV IS CORRECTED
            FOR THE CONTRIBUTION FROM 22-NA DECAY PRODUCED BY THE
            REACTION 24-MG(N,T)22-NA WITH THRESHOLD 16.3 MEV. THE
            22-NA ACTIVITY WAS TOO LOW TO BE MEASURED, SO THE
            CORRECTION WAS MADE BY ADOPTING A VALUE OF 4.5 +-
            1.5 MB FOR THE 22-NA PRODUCTION CROSS SECTION OF
            NATURAL MG.
