INSTITUTE  (2GERBOC)
FACILITY   (DYNAM,2GERBOC) 4 MV dynamitron tandem accelerator,
            delivering an average proton current of 75 micro-amps.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) A 100 micro-g/cm2 metallic lithium target with
            natural abundance, evaporated onto an aluminium hut of
            16 mm diameter. The hut was water-cooled and served as
            a beam dump. The average neutron flux was 1.7e+07
            N/cm2 sec through the fissile deposit.
           .Two sets of measurements were performed. In the first
            the proton beam was defocussed to a diameter of 12 mm,
            giving an energy resolution of about +/-20 KeV. In the
            second the well-focussed proton beam was scanned over
            an area of 8 X 8 mm by deflection magnets, thus giving
            a better energy resolution.
METHOD     (TOF)   Three different methods were applied.
           (COINC)
              I. Double time-of-flight measurement of coincident
                 fission fragments.
             Ii. Double energy measurement of coincident fission
                 fragments.
            Iii. Time-of-flight/energy measurements of single
                 fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (MWPC)  Fission fragments were detected with five
            10.2 X 10.2 cm parallel plate avalanche counters,
            having a position resolution of +/-0.8 mm. They were
            placed at a distance of 40 cm from the target and at
            angles of 0, 45, +/-90, -107 and -135 degrees with
            respect to the proton beam direction. These detectors
            were used for method I and iii.
           (SIBAR) Two 900 mm2 and three 300 mm2 F-series ortec
            surface barrier detectors measured time-of-flight and
            energy of the fragments. They were placed at angles of
            17, 73, -107, -118 and - 148 degrees. These detectors
            were used for method ii and iii.
           .The time reference signal for all the detectors was
            provided by a one channel plate arrangement, placed
            perpendicular to the target out of the reaction plane.
            Electrons knocked out from the target were deflected
            to the detector with an electrostatic mirror. By the
            position read-out the reaction point in the target
            could be determined with a resolution of +/-1.5 mm.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),,KE,FF)
SAMPLE     .In the first set of measurements the fission target
            was stacked from four 140 micro-g/cm2 thf4 layers,
            each evaporated onto 25 micro-g/cm2 carbon foil. In
            the second set it was a face-to-face sandwich of two
            510 micro-g/cm2 thf4 layers on 50 micro-g/cm2 carbon.
            The targets were located 42 mm from the neutron
            producing target.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for energy losses in the
            target.
