FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) Swimming-Pool-Type JRR-4 Reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  .Sample irradiated in the T-pipe of the reactor, giving
            a thermal N-flux 4.0E+13 n/cm2/s and an epithermal
            index in the Westcott convention of 0.02.
SAMPLE     . 3.0 micro-l of CsCl solution containing 0.1 MBq of
            137Cs evaporated to dryness in a small polyethylene
            bottle, which was sealed and then placed in a poly-
            ethylene capsule with a flux-monitor wire of 0.475 W/O
            Co/Al alloy 0.76 mm in diameter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 10 min
           (CHSEP) Cs separated from 24Na and 38Cl activity by
            absorbing it onto 2 mg of Zeolite and filtering off.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 2.3 keV energy resolution at 1.3 MeV. Counting
            efficiency measured with a calibrated multi-gamma
            source.

CORRECTION .Corrected for sum coincidence loss.
           .Dead time correction not necessary because only ratio
            of counts considered in analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Does not include the errors in gamma
            emission probabilities and decay constants.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties in detector counting efficiencies
            estimated to be 5 %.

REACTION   (55-CS-137(N,G)55-CS-138,,SIG,,SPA) Averaged over
               thermal and epithermal neutron spectrum
ANALYSIS   .Cross section calculated from the intensity ratio of
            each of the three 138Cs gammas to the 662 keV gamma
            of 137Cs. Data is weighted mean of four runs, giving
            12 cross sections.
INC-SPECT  .Epithermal components contributes 2%
