FACILITY   (REAC ) HIGH FLUX REACTOR IN PETTEN.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) 24.5 KEV NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY FILTERING
            THE REACTOR NEUTRONS IN ONE OF THE HORIZONTAL BEAM
            TUBES. THE 2.4 CM DIAMETER FILTER CONSISTED OF 22.5 CM
            IRON, 36 CM ALUMINIUM AND 6.5 CM SULPHUR. THE 24.5 KEV
            NEUTRON FLUX WAS 3.6 +/- 0.3 TIMES E+5 NEUTRONS/CM2
            AND SECOND.
INC-SPECT  .QUASIMONOENERGETIC 24.5 KEV NEUTRON BEAM WITH A CON-
            TAMINATION OF A FEW PERCENT EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS.
METHOD     (EXTB ) THE 3-HE TARGET WAS IRRADIATED BY THE FILTERED
            24.5 KEV NEUTRON BEAM.
           (ACTIV) ACTIVATION OF GOLD FOILS WERE USED AS NEUTRON
            FLUX MONITOR.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE MEASURED WITH A
            3 X 3 INCH NAI/TL/ DETECTOR, PLACED 9.4 CM FROM THE
            TARGET AND PERPENDICULAR TO THE BEAM. THE DETECTOR WAS
            SHIELDED WITH 10 CM OF LEAD AND WITH HYDROGEN- AND
            BORON-CONTAINING MATERIALS.
           (SCIN ) ACTIVE SHIELDING AGAINST COSMIC RAYS WAS PRO-
            VIDED BY A LARGE DETECTOR, 1000 CM2, WHICH CONSISTED
            OF LAYERS OF SCINTILLATING PLASTIC SANDWICHED WITH 5
            CM THICK LAYERS OF LEAD. THE RESPONSE OF THE NAI
            DETECTOR FOR 20.6 MEV GAMMA-RAYS WAS MEASURED USING
            PROTON CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS AT THE UTRECHT VDG ACCELER-
            ATOR. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTOR WAS CALCULATED
            WITH A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION COMPUTER CODE.
PART-DET   (G    )
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) A STACK OF NINE 50
            MG/CM2 THICK AU FOILS, COVERED ON BOTH SIDES WITH 1 MM
            THICK CADMIUM SHEETS, WAS USED FOR NEUTRON FLUX DETER-
            MINATION. BY STUDYING THE ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE
            FOILS, CORRECTIONS FOR THE EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS COULD
            BE APPLIED.
SAMPLE     .TO ABTAIN A SIZABLE 3-HE TARGET DENSITY, AN ALUMINIUM
            TARGET GAS CELL, 10.2 CM LONG, 3.0 CM IN DIAMETER AND
            WITH 0.3 CM THICK WALLS, WAS KEPT AT A TEMPERATURE OF
            11.8 +/- 0.4 K AND A PRESSURE OF 23.0 +/- 0.4 BARS.
            THIS RESULTED IN A 3-HE DENSITY OF 1.48 +/- 0.05 TIMES
            E+22 NUCLEI/CM3.
CORRECTION .CORRECTION WAS APPLIED FOR THE EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS.
