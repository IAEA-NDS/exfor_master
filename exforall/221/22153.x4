TITLE      -APPLICATION OF A RESONANCE CAPTURE DETECTOR TO THE
            PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRON TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS.
AUTHOR     (K.KOBAYASHI,S.YAMAMOTO,Y.FUJITA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNKTO) THE 46 MEV ELECTRON LINAC AT THE
            RESEARCH REACTOR INSTITUTE OF KYOTO UNIVERSITY, OPERA-
            TED AT A FREQUENCY OF 300 PULSES/SEC AND WITH A PULSE
            WIDTH OF 68 NS, ELECTRON ENERGY 32 MEV AND PEAK
            CURRENT 2 A.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) BURSTS OF NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED FROM THE
            WATER-COOLED PHOTONEUTRON TARGET, WHICH WERE MADE OF
            SEVERAL SHEETS OF TA PLATES, 5 CM BY 5 CM SQUARE WITH
            AN EFFECTIVE TOTAL THICKNESS OF ABOUT 3.5 CM. THE TAR-
            GET WAS PLACED IN THE CENTER OF AN OCTAGONAL WATER
            TANK, 30 CM IN DIAMETER AND 10 CM THICK, TO MODERATE
            THE NEUTRONS. A 7 CM DIAMETER BY 20 CM LONG PB BLOCK
            WAS PLACED IN THE FLIGHT PATH IN FRONT OF THE TARGET
            TO SUPPRESS THE PROMPT GAMMA-FLASH. THE NEUTRON BEAM
            WAS AT AN ANGLE OF 135 DEG TO THE LINAC BEAM AND WAS
            REDUCED TO 2 CM DIAMETER AT THE DETECTOR POSITION
            USING B4C, LI2CO3 AND PB COLLIMATORS. A 0.5 MM THICK
            CD FILTER WAS PLACED IN THE NEUTRON BEAM TO SUPPRESS
            OVERLAP OF THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM PREVIOUS PULSES.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT WITH A
            FLIGHT PATH 12.7 M.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) A RESONANCE CAPTURE DETECTOR CONSISTING OF 8
            PIECES OF BI4-GE3-O12 (BGO) CRYSTAL SCINTILLATOR AND
            A CAPTURE SAMPLE OF TA. THE CRYSTALS, 5 X 5 CM SQUARE
            AND 7.5 CM THICK, WERE ASSEMBLED INTO A BANK LEAVING A
            THROUGH HOLE 2.7 X 2.7 CM SQUARE, THE INSIDE OF WHICH
            WAS COATED  WITH 3 MM THICK ENRICHED 6-LIF TILES. THE
            TA CAPTURE SAMPLE WAS A 1.8 X 1.8 CM SQUARE PLATE,
            1 MM THICK, PLACED AT THE CENTRE OF THE BGO HOLE. THE
            BGO CRYSTALS ARE A TOTAL ABSORPTION DETECTOR IN THE
            MEASUREMENT OF CAPTURE GAMMAS, AND THUS THE RESONANCE
            DETECTOR IS SENSITIVE ESPECIALLY TO NEUTRONS AT THE
            RESONANCE ENERGIES OF THE TA(N,G) REACTION. THE BACK-
            GROUND LEVEL WAS DETERMINED USING A TA SAMPLE ALSO IN
            THE TOF BEAM, A SO-CALLED SELF-INDICATION MEASUREMENT,
            AND VERIFIED WITH NOTCH FILTERS SUCH AS AG AND CO.
           .DETECTOR PERFORMACE WAS CHECKED BY MAKING NEUTRON
            TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS WITH POLYETHYLENE, THE
            RESULTS SHOWING VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH ENDF/B-IV.
           .THIS RESONANCE CAPTURE DETECTOR HAS ALSO BEEN USED TO
            MEASURE THE TOTAL SB CROSS SECTION, SEE EXFOR
            22154.004.

SAMPLE     .THREE TRANSMISSION SAMPLES IN THE FORM OF METALLIC PB
            PLATES, EACH 5 X 5 CM SQUARE AND 0.5 CM THICK, PURITY
            99.9993%, THE SAMPLE THICKNESSES BEING 0.09858,
            0.13152 AND 0.16478 ATOMS/BARN. THE SAMPLES WERE
            LOCATED ABOUT 10 M FROM THE TA TARGET.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR DEAD-TIME LOSSES AND BACK-
            GROUND.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS GIVEN CONTAIN BOTH STATISTICAL
            AND SYSTEMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS. UNCERTAINTIES ARE DUE
            MAINLY TO THE TRANSMISSION RATE STATISTICS AND THE
            SAMPLE THICKNESS.
