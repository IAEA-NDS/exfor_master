TITLE      - SPIN-SPIN CROSS SECTIONS OF 27-AL AND 93-NB FOR
            NEUTRONS FROM 20 TO 50 MEV.
AUTHOR     (W.HEERINGA,H.O.KLAGES,CHR.WOELFL,R.W.FINLAY)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
           (1USAOHO) R.W.F.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERKFK) THE POLARISED N BEAM FACILITY POLKA AT
            THE KARLSRUHE CYCLOTRON AND THE POLARISED TARGET
            FACILITY KRYPTA.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) POLARISED DEUTERONS FROM AN ATOMIC BEAM SOURCE,
            ACCELERATED BY THE CYCLOTRON TO 52 MEV ONTO A 1 CM
            THICK LIQUID D2 TARGET. N POLARISATION TYPICALLY 50%.
            BEAM POLARISATION WAS VERTICAL, AND BEAM DIAMETER WAS
            REDUCED TO 20 MM USING 40 CM LONG W COLLIMATOR.
METHOD     (TOF  ) EN FROM TOF TECHNIQUES.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) TWO NE102A SCINTILLATORS, 0.5 AND 1.0 MM THICK,
            PLACED RESPECTIVELY IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND THE TARGET,
            WERE USED AS NEUTRON FLUX MONITORS BY DETECTING RECOIL
            PROTONS GENERATED IN POLYETHYLENE CONVERTERS
            POSITIONED IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE SCINTILLATORS.
            A 0.5 MM AL ABSORBER WAS USED TO STOP UNWANTED LOW
            ENERGY PROTONS.
SAMPLE     .TARGETS WERE POLARISED IN THE KRYPTA CRYOSTAT CONTAIN-
            ING A 3-HE/4-HE DILUTION REFRIGERATOR AND A 9 TESLA
            SPLIT COIL MAGNET. TYPICAL TARGET TEMPERATURES WERE
            FROM 10 - 17 MILLI-KELVIN.
CORRECTION .MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE WITH A WARM (UNPOLARIZED) 93-NB
            TARGET TO DETECT INSTRUMENTAL ASYMMETRIES.
ERR-ANALYS .THE N POLARISATION WAS SWITCHED EVERY 4 SECS DURING
            THE EXPERIMENT TO MINIMIZE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS.
           (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
