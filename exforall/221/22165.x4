FACILITY   (ISOCY,2JPNOSA) AVF CYCLOTRON AT THE RESEARCH CENTRE
            FOR NUCLEAR PHYSICS, OSAKA UNIV.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) A 17.0 MG/CM-SQ THICK TARGET WAS BOMBARDED WITH
            A 64.94 MEV PROTON BEAM, RESOLUTION 170 KEV FWHM, PRO-
            DUCING NEUTRONS OF 62.8 MEV FROM THE 9-BE(P,N)9-B-GND
            REACTION. THE PROTON BEAM WAS STOPPED BY STACKED SI
            CRYSTALS OF TOTAL THICKNESS 25 MM WHICH ALSO SERVED AS
            A FARADAY CUP. THE NEUTRON YIELD WAS 3.3E+6 N/S/CM-SQ
            FOR A 1 MICRO-AMP PROTON BEAM, AND THE ENERGY LOSS IN
            THE TARGET WAS 145 KEV. THE ESTIMATED NEUTRON BEAM
            RESOLUTION WAS 223 KEV FWHM.
METHOD     (EDE  )
           (TOF  )
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) MAGNETIC SPECTROGRAPH 'RAIDEN' WITH A MOMENTUM
            RESOLUTION DELTA-P/P OF BETTER THAN 1.0E-4 ALONG THE
            FOCAL PLANE, SET AT 0.0 DEG. THE SOLID ANGLE WAS
            6.0 MILLI-SR WHICH CORRESPONDED TO AN ANGULAR SPREAD
            OF 3.6 DEG FWHM, THE MEAN ANGLE OF RECOIL PROTONS
            BEING 2.66 DEG. THE RESULTING KINEMATIC SPREADING DUE
            TO THIS FINITE GEOMETRY EFFECT WAS 365 KEV FWHM.
           (MWPC ) THE FOCAL PLANE DETECTOR CONSISTED OF A 2-D
           (PROPC)  POSITION SENSITIVE GAS COUNTER, TWO DELTA-E
           (SCIN )   PROPORTIONAL DETECTORS AND A PLASTIC SCIN-
                      TILLATION COUNTER, TOTAL LENGTH 1.5 M. THE
                      RESOLUTION WAS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH FOR ITS
                      EFFECT ON THE MEASUREMENTS TO BE IGNORED.
SAMPLE     .A 17.1 MG/CM-SQ DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE TARGET BACKED
            WITH A 3 MM THICK GRAPHITE PLATE AND LOCATED 65 MM
            FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE POINT. ENERGY LOSS IN SAMPLE
            WAS 173 KEV.
CORRECTION .BACKGROUND, DETECTION EFFICIENCY (DETERMINED FROM
            116-SN(P,P') AND 1-H(N,P)N SCATTERING)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
           .THE ANGULAR RESOLUTION IS THE FWHM OF THE ANGULAR
            FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION DUE TO FINITE GEOMETRY EFFECT.
