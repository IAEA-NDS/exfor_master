TITLE      -NUCLEAR CHARGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE REACTOR NEUTRON
            INDUCED FISSION OF 232-TH, FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE
            YIELDS OF THE ISOTOPES OF KRYPTON AND XENON.
AUTHOR     (A.SRIVASTAVA,H.O.DENSCHLAG)
INSTITUTE  (2GERMNZ)
FACILITY   (REAC ) THE MAINZ TRIGA REACTOR WAS USED FOR THE
            IRRADIATIONS.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE IRRADIATION POSITION WAS IN THE CENTER OF
            THE REACTOR, WHERE THE FAST, EPI-CADMIUM NEUTRON FLUX
            IS OF THE ORDER OF 1.0E+11 NEUTRONS/CM2 AND SEC.
INC-SPECT  .FAST REACTOR SPECTRUM WITH A CADMIUM RATIO OF ABOUT
            30.
METHOD     (OLMS ) THE FISSION FRAGMENTS RECOILING OUT OF THE
            SAMPLE FOIL WERE STOPPED IN A LAYER OF MAGNESIUM
            STEARATE FROM WHICH ONLY THE RARE GASES DIFFUSED INTO
            AN ADJACENT EVACUATED SPACE WHERE THEY DECAYED TO
            LONGER LIVED DESCENDENTS THAT DEPOSITED ON THE WALLS.
           (ABSFY) BY MEASURING THE ACTIVITY OF THE DESCENDENTS,
            THE FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE YIELD COULD BE DETERMINED
            DIRECTLY.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) AFTER RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION OF THE DESCEN-
            DENTS IN THE STEARATE AND ON THE WALLS, THE ACTIVITY
            OF THE SAMPLES WERE COUNTED IN A FIXED GEOMETRY ON A
            154 CM3 INTRINSIC GERMANIUM DETECTOR, HAVING A RESO-
            LUTION OF 1.8 KEV AT 1332 KEV.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE WAS A 232-TH METAL FOIL WITH A THICKNESS OF
            10 MICRO-M AND A WEIGHT OF 1 MG. THE SAMPLE WAS MOUNT-
            ED IN AN IRRADIATION SETUP MADE OF POLYETHYLENE IN
            ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE DOSE FROM NEUTRON ACTIVATION.
            THE SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED FOR 60 MIN.
CORRECTION .THE ACTIVITIES WERE CORRECTED FOR CHEMICAL YIELD, FOR
            THE GAS VOLUME BETWEEN THE TH-TARGET AND STEARATE, AND
            FOR THE NON NEGLIGIBLE GAS VOLUME WITHIN THE STEARATE
            GRAINS.
ERR-ANALYS (RATIO-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
