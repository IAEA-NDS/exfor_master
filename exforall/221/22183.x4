COMMENT    .SEE EXFOR 21837 FOR PREVIOUS RESULTS FORM THIS SERIES
            OF ACTIVATIONS EXPERIMENTS USING VARIOUS SAMPLES.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) WATER COOLED TI(T) TARGET, BOMBARDED WITH 3 MEV
            DEUTERONS AT 50 MICRO-AMP.
METHOD     (ACTIV) VACUUM EXTRACTION AND GAS COUNTING OF TRITIUM.
            ACTIVATION REACTIONS USED AS INTERNAL MONITORS.
SAMPLE     .A HEMISPHERICAL COMPACT GEOMETRY, DIAM 40 MM, WAS USED
            FOR IRRADIATIONS WITH THE TI(T) N SOURCE PLACED AT THE
            CENTRE. EACH SAMPLE WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE SEGMENTS,
            AND A MONTE CARLO CALCULATION WAS PERFORMED TO CAL-
            CULATE THE NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE SEEN BY EACH SEGMENT,
            TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SINGLE ( BUT NOT MULTIPLE )
            SCATTERING IN THE TRITIUM TARGET, COOLING WATER AND
            SURROUNDING  CAPSULE.
