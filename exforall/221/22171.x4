TITLE      - 7-LI(N,G)8-LI - TRIGGER REACTION TO A PRIMORDIAL

           (1USANOT) M.W.
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3.75MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR. A 1 MM-
            SQ PROTON BEAM SPOT WAS SWEPT MAGNETICALLY ACROSS THE
            TARGET TO ACHIEVE HOMOGENEOUS ILLUMINATION. BEAM
            CURRENTS OF UP TO 90 MICRO-AMP WERE USED. THE TARGET
            WAS BOMBARDED FOR 5 SEC INTERVALS EVERY 10 SEC.
SAMPLE     .TO DERIVE THE 7-LI(N,G) CROSS SECTION FROM THE ACTI-
            VATION ANALYSIS THE NUMBER OF 7-LI ATOMS IN THE
            SAMPLES HAD TO BE DETERMINED. THIS WAS DONE BY MEASUR-
            ING THE 6-LI(N,T)2-HE-4 REACTION. THE ACCELERATOR WAS
            OPERATED IN DC MODE, EP = 1.912 MEV, TO PRODUCE THE
            MAXWELLIAN KT = 25 KEV SPECTRUM, AND THE SAMPLES
            POSITIONED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TARGET. THE
            PROTON BEAM INTENSITY WAS REDUCED TO 5 - 10 MICRO-AMP
            AND THE IONIZATION CHAMBER WAS USED WITH AN INCREASED
            GAS PRESSURE OF 700 MILLI-BAR. TRITON AND ALPHA YIELDS
            WERE DETERMINED BY STANDARD PEAK ANALYSIS OF THE
            SPECTRA, FROM WHICH THE LI ABUNDANCES AND THUS THE
            SAMPLE THICKNESSES IN ATOMS/B COULD BE CALCULATED.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG,,MXW) DATA FROM ENDF/B-V, USED
            IN DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF 7-LI ATOMS IN THE

DETECTOR   (GLASD) 6-LI GLASS DETECTOR TO MONITOR NEUTRON YIELD,
            POSITIONED ON THE BEAM AXIS 0.7 M FROM THE TARGET.
           (GE-IN) A SHIELDED 45 CM3 GE DETECTOR, 1.6 KEV RESOLU-
            TION AT 1.33 MEV, WAS USED TO COUNT GOLD MONITOR FOIL
