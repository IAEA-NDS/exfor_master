TITLE        7Li(n,gamma)8Li - trigger reaction to a primordial
            r-process?
AUTHOR     (M.Wiescher,R.Steininger,F.Kaeppeler)
REFERENCE  (J,AJ,344,464,1989)
REL-REF    (C,22401001,M.Heil+,J,AJ,507,997,1998) There is a
           miscalculation of the total efficiency of the
           ionization chamber.
                A new analysis yields gives 57+/-9 ub at 25 keV
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK) R.S., F.K. and experimental site
           (1USANOT) M.W.
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) 3.75MV Van de Graaff accelerator. A 1 mm2
            proton beam spot was swept magnetically across the
            target to achieve homogeneous illumination. Beam
            currents of up to 90 uA were used. The target
            was bombarded for 5 sec intervals every 10 sec.
SAMPLE      To derive the 7-Li(n,gamma) cross section from the
            activation analysis the number of 7-Li atoms in the
            samples had to be determined. This was done by
            measuring the 6-Li(n,t)2-He-4 reaction. The
            accelerator was operated in DC mode, Ep = 1.912 MeV,
            to produce the Maxwellian kT = 25 keV spectrum, and
            the samples positioned in close proximity to the
            target. The proton beam intensity was reduced to
            5 - 10 uA and the ionization chamber was used with an
            increased gas pressure of 700 mbar.
            Triton and alpha yields were determined by standard
            peak analysis of the spectra, from which the Li
            abundances and thus the sample thicknesses in atoms/b
            could be calculated.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG,,MXW) Data from ENDF/B-V, used
            in determination of the number of 7-Li atoms in the
            respective samples.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) 6-Li glass detector to monitor neutron yield,
            positioned on the beam axis 0.7 m from the target.
           (GE-IN) A shielded 45 cm3 Ge detector, 1.6 keV
            resolution at 1.33 MeV, was used to count gold monitor
            foil activity.
CORRECTION  Background, detector efficiency.
