REACTION   (42-MO-92(N,P)41-NB-92-M,,SIG) THE FIRST CHANCE PROTON
            EMISSION.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) VARIABLE ENERGY COMPACT CYCLOTRON CV28.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) NEUTRONS RANGING FROM 9.0 - 10.6 MEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (RCHEM) ADDITION OF NB CARRIER TO MO SAMPLE FOLLOWED BY
            DISSOLUTION IN ACID. THE NB WAS PRECIPITATED BY NEU-
            TRALISING THE SOLUTION WITH NH4OH, AND THEN HEATED TO
            TO FORM THE OXIDE WHICH WAS TRANSFERRED TO AN AL
            PLANCHET FOR X-RAY COUNTING. CHEMICAL YIELD DETERMINED
            GRAVIMETRICALLY AND ALSO FROM FAST NEUTRON ACTIVATION
            ANALYSIS SEVERAL MONTHS LATER USING 93-NB(N,2N)92-NB-M
SAMPLE     .EITHER MO POWDER IN A POLYTHENE CAPSULE (DIAM 1.2 CM,
            LENGTH 1.3 CM) OR A STACK OF MO FOILS (DIAM 1.6 CM,
            HEIGHT 0.8 CM). IN BOTH CASES THE MO WAS 99.9% PURE.
            AL MONITOR FOILS OF THE SAME SIZE WERE ATTACHED TO THE
            FRONT AND BACK OF THE SAMPLE. IN GENERAL THE FLUX
            DENSITY WAS 4.0E+7 N/CM2/S.
