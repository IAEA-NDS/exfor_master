TITLE      -ISOMERIC YIELD RATIOS OF 134-I AND 136-I AND
            INDEPENDENT FRACTIONAL YIELDS OF SOME HALOGEN ISOTOPES
            IN THE FISSION OF 232-TH WITH REACTOR NEUTRONS.
AUTHOR     (R.HENTZSCHEL,H.O.DENSCHLAG)
INSTITUTE  (2GERMNZ)
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMNZ) THE FAST PNEUMATIC TUBE FACILITY OF THE
            MAINZ TRIGA REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE IRRADIATION POSITION IN THE REACTOR WAS
            WRAPPED IN A CD SHEET TO REDUCE GAMMA DOSE FROM
            232-TH(N,G) AND WAS CHARACTERISED BY AN INTEGRATED
            FAST, EPI-CADMIUM NEUTRON FLUX OF THE ORDER OF
            1.5E+12 NEUTRONS/CM2 (100 MILLI-SEC NEUTRON PULSE).
INC-SPECT  .FAST REACTOR EPI-CADMIUM SPECTRUM WITH AN ESTIMATED
            MEAN EFFECTIVE NEUTRON ENERGY FOR 232-TH(N,F) OF 3 MEV
SAMPLE     .POLYSTYRENE CAPSULES FILLED WITH A SOLUTION OF 0.5 G
            232-TH AS NITRATE IN 1.5 ML OF 2 M HNO3, CONTAINING
            0.1 ML OF SATURATED SOLUTION OF NA2SO3, PLUS SUITABLE
            ADDED AMOUNTS OF IODINE CARRIER AND HOLD-BACK CARRIERS
            TE(6+), SN(2+) AND SB(3+). IRRADIATION TIMES WERE
            100 MILLI-SEC.
METHOD     (CHSEP) FAST AUTOMATED RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION USING
            PNEUMATIC TRANSPORT AND COMPUTER CONTROL. THE I AND BR
            WERE COLLECTED ON A PREFORMED AGCL FILTER LAYER BY
            ION EXCHANGE WITH A CHEMICAL YIELD OF ABOUT 90 %.
           (RELFY) THE HIGH SPIN ISOTOPES OF 134-,136-I USED AS
            INTERNAL STANDARDS TO MONITOR FISSION EVENTS AND
            CHEMICAL YIELD SINCE THEY HAVE NO BETA PRECURSORS.
            THE COMPLEX DECAY CURVE OF THE 1313 KEV GAMMA FROM
            136H-I AND 136L-I WAS RESOLVED MATHEMATICALLY IN EACH
            EXPERIMENT.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) GROWTH AND DECAY CURVES AS A FUNCTION OF
            WAITING TIME BETWEEN END OF IRRADIATION AND CHEMICAL
            SEPARATION WERE ANALYSED TO EVALUATE THE FRACTIONAL
            INDEPENDENT YIELDS.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) FIXED GEOMETRY COUNTING WITH AN EFFICIENCY
            CALIBRATED 155 CM3 HPGE DETECTOR, RESOLUTION 1.9 KEV
            AT 1333 KEV. INITIAL HIGH DEAD-TIMES CONTINUOUSLY
            CORRECTED USING A LOSS-FREE COUNTING MODULE.

CORRECTION .THE LOW COUNTING RATE OF 134-I NECESSITATED A
            DETECTION EFFICIENCY AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE (SAMPLE -
            DETECTOR DISTANCE = 1 CM), CONSEQUENTLY A CORRECTION
            FOR GEOMETRICAL SUMMING LOSSES WAS NECESSARY (UP TO
            30%).
