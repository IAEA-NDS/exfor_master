TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON-PROTON SPIN CORRELATION
            COEFFICIENT AYY AT 90 DEGREES C.M. BY ELASTC SCATTER-
            ING OF 13.7 MEV POLARIZED NEUTRONS FROM A POLARIZED
            PROTON TARGET.

INC-SOURCE (LAMB ) ERLANGEN LAMB-SHIFT POLARIZED ION SOURCE,
            DELIVERED 11.5 MEV VECTOR POLARIZED DEUTERONS ONTO
            A DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET. THE TARGET CELL WAS 13 MM IN
            DIAMETER BY 50 MM THICK, AND FILLED TO A PRESSURE OF
            5 BAR AT A TEMPERATURE OF 77 K. THE NEUTRON POLARI-
            ZATION WAS REVERSED EVERY 50 SEC.
           (POLTR) ERLANGEN POLARIZED PROTON TARGET. IT USES A
            THIN LANTHANUM MAGNESIUM NITRATE, LMN, SINGLE CRYSTAL,
            DOPED WITH 1 PERCENT ND AT THE LA SITES. THE PROTONS
            OF THE CRYSTAL WATER MOLECULES WERE POLARIZED BY
            DYNAMIC NUCLEAR ORIENTATION AT LOW TEMPERATURES, 1.3
            K, IN A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD, 1.85 T, USING 70 GHZ
            MICROWAVES. THE LMN CRYSTAL HAD THE SHAPE OF A SLAB,
            300 MICROMETERS THICK AND WITH A CROSS SECTION AREA
            OF 6 BY 6 MM. THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OF THE GAS
            CELL TO THE LMN CRYSTALL WAS 10 CM.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES WAS USED TO OBTAIN
           (COINC) COINCIDENCES BETWEEN THE PROTON AND NEUTRON
            DETECTORS. COINCIDENCES BETWEEN THE SI-DETECTORS OF
            THE TELESCOPE WERE ALSO RECORDED.
           (PSD  ) THE NEUTRON DETECTORS USED PSD FOR NEUTRON-
            GAMMA DISCRIMINATION.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST) A DELTA-E - E DETECTOR TELESCOPE, BUILT
            FROM TWO SILICON BARRIER DETECTORS, HAVING AN ACTIVE
            AREA OF 12 MM IN DIAMETER AND BEING 110 AND 800 MICRO-
            METERS THICK, RESPECTIVELY, WAS USED TO DETECT THE
            RECOIL PROTONS. THE TELESCOPE WAS PLACED AT AN ANGLE
            OF 45 DEGREES AND AT A DISTANCE OF 6 CM FROM THE LMN
            CRYSTAL.
           (SCIN ) A 10 CM DIAMETER BY 11.4 CM THICK NE213 LIQUID
            SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WAS USED FOR NEUTRON DETECTION.
            THE DETECTOR WAS PLACED AT AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES AND
            AT A DISTANCE OF 60 CM FROM THE LMN CELL. TWO SIMILAR
            DETECTORS, ONE PLACED IN THE BEAM DIRECTION AND THE
            OTHER ABOVE THE SCATTERING PLANE SERVED AS FLUENCE
            MONITORS. THE DISTANCE FROM THE LMN CELL TO THESE
            DETECTORS WERE 3 M.
           .THE POLARIZATION OF THE DEUTERON BEAM WAS MONITORED
            WITH A CARBON POLARIMETER.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND BY SUBTRACTING
            THE YIELD OUTSIDE THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT PEAK. CORRECTIONS
            WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR DEAD-TIME AND FLUCTUATIONS IN
            THE DEUTERON BEAM CURRENT.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) ONE STANDARD DEVIATION. INCLUDES COUNTING
            STATISTICS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE NEUTRON BEAM
            POLARIZATION, THE TARGET POLARIZATION AND THE
            ANALYZING POWER.
ANALYSIS   .AN ANALYZING POWER VALUE OF 0.019 +- 0.002 WAS ASSUMED
            IN THE ANALYSIS.
