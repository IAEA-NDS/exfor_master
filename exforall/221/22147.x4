TITLE      -A STUDY OF MONOENERGETIC, FAST NEUTRON-INDUCED TERNARY
            FISSION IN 238-U.

INSTITUTE  (2UK BIR)
FACILITY   (DYNAM,2UK BIR)
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) THE NEUTRON SOURCE CONSISTED OF A 25 MM DIA-
            METER DEUTERATED LAYER OF TI ON A 31.7 MM DIAMETER,
            0.5 MM THICK AG BACKING. THE DISC WAS WATER COOLED TO
            ALLOW DEUTERON BEAM CURRENTS OF ABOUT 200 MUA.
            NEUTRON ENERGIES OF 3.6 AND 4.1 MEV WERE OBTAINED
            BY BOMBARDING WITH 900 KEV AND 1.4 MEV DEUTERONS.
            THE SOURCE WAS CONTAINED IN THE 40 CM DIAMETER VACUUM
            CHAMBER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR THE EXPERIMENT AND
            MAINTAINED AT 1.0E-5 TORR.
METHOD    1(RELFY) SEVERAL DAYS OF IRRADIATION WERE REQUIRED TO
            PRODUCE SUFFICIENT TERNARY FISSION EVENTS.
           (EDE  ) THE MASS DETERMINATION OF THE LCP WAS PERFORMED
            BY AN ELECTONICS UNIT CALLED THE PARTICLE IDENTIFICA-
            TION UNIT (PIU) WHICH ANALYSED THE RESPONSES OF THE
            'DELTA E' AND 'E' DETECTORS IN THE TELESCOPE.
          2(FISCT)
DETECTOR  1(TELES,SOLST,SOLST) THE TRITONS AND ALPHA PARTICLES
            WERE DETECTED WITH A PARTICLE DETECTOR TELESCOPE
            CONSISTING OF TWO SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS, SHIELDED
            FROM HEAVY FISSION FRAGMENTS BY A 12 MICRON ALUMINIUM
            FOIL, AND VARYING IN DISTANCE BETWEEN 25 TO 50 MM
            FROM THE FISSION FOIL WITHIN THE VACUUM CHAMBER AT AN
            ANGLE OF 30 DEG TO THE BEAM DIRECTION. THE 'DELTA E'
            DETECTOR WAS FULLY DEPLETED WITH A THICKNESS OF ABOUT
            50 MICRON AND ACTIVE AREA 75 MM2; THE 'E' DETECTOR HAD
            A THICKNESS OF 800 MICRON AND ACTIVE AREA OF 400 MM2,
            INITIAL ENERGY RESOLUTION BEING 36 KEV FOR 6.05 MEV
            ALPHAS. A WEAK ANNULAR 241-AM SOURCE WAS PERMANENTLY
            MOUNTED BETWEEN THE 'DELTA E' AND 'E' DETECTORS TO
            MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY THEIR RESOLUTION THROUGHOUT THE
            EXPERIMENT.
          2(SOLST) THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FISSION EVENTS WERE MONI-
            TORED WITH A SEPARATE SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR OF
            THICKNESS 100 MICRON LOCATED 120 MM FROM THE 238-U
            FISSION FOIL WITHIN THE VACUUM CHAMBER AT AN ANGLE OF
            30 DEG TO THE BEAM DIRECTON.

SAMPLE     .THE FISSION FOIL CONSISTED OF AN ELECTROSPRAYED
            500 MICRO-G/CM2 LAYER OF 99.99% 238-U, 20 MM IN DIA-
            METER, ON A 7 MICRON THICK AU-COATED POLYMIDE FOIL,
            MOUNTED ON AN ANNULAR AL RING, INSIDE DIAMETER 30 MM,
            AND POSITIONED IN THE VACUUM CHAMBER APPROXIMATELY
            15 MM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE. THE 238-U DEPOSIT
            THICKNESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE REASONABLE COUNT-
            ING STATISTICS BUT DID NOT SERIOUSLY DEGRADE THE
            ENERGY OF THE LCP.
CORRECTION .TO ALLOW FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN GEOMETRICAL COUNTING
            EFFICIENCY OF THE TWO SETS OF DETECTORS, WHICH WERE
            LOCATED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE 238-U FOIL,
            MICA TRACK DETECTORS WERE USED TO RECORD THE HEAVY
            FISSION FRAGMENTS AT THE TWO DETECTOR POSITIONS WITHIN
            THE VACUUM CHAMBER. THE TELESCOPE RECORDED A CONSIDER-
            ABLE BACKGROUND COUNT WHICH HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE
            TRITON-ALPHA SPECTRUM. INTERFERENCE FROM STRUCTURAL
            MATERIALS AND CHANCE COINCIDENCE COUNTS WERE ALSO
            ALLOWED FOR.
