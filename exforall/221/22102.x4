TITLE      -STUDIES OF (N,T) REACTIONS ON LIGHT NUCLEI.
AUTHOR     (A.SUHAIMI)
INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO) FOR THE BORON AND NITROGEN MEASUREMENTS,
            DEUTERONS WERE ACCELERATED TO 3.0 - 8.0 MEV WITH A
            COMPACT CYCLOTRON, CV 28.
           (REAC) THE THERMAL CROSS SECTION FOR BORON WAS
            DETERMINED USING THE FRJ-2 REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 2.5 TO 10.6 MEV WERE
            PRODUCED WITH A DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET, HAVING AN
            ENTRANCE HAVAR FOIL OF 7 MICROMETER THICKNESS, OR A
            NIOBIUM ENTRANCE FOIL OF 6.5, 20.0 OR 50.O MICROMETERS
            THICKNESS AND A MOLYBDENUM BEAM STOP. THE GAS CELL HAD
            A LENGTH OF 3.7 CM AND A DIAMETER OF 4.0 CM, WITH WALL
            THICKNESSES OF 0.1 CM MADE OF BRASS. THE MEAN NEUTRON
            FLUX DENSITIES WERE OF THE ORDER OF 1.0E+07 N/CM2SEC.
           (THCOL) THE THERMAL COLUMN OF FRJ-2 WAS USED TO OBTAIN
            A THERMAL FLUX DENSITIY OF THE ORDER OF 1.0E+12
            N/CM2SEC FOR DETERMINING THE THERMAL CROSS SECTION OF
            BORON.
METHOD     (CHSEP) TRITIUM COUNTING TECHNIQUES.
            TRITIUM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE IRRADIATED SAMPLES
            BY VACUUM EXTRACTION AND MEASURED IN THE GAS PHASE
            USING ANTICOINCIDENCE PROPORTIONAL COUNTING.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A 31 MM DIAMETER CYLINDRICAL GAS-FILLED COUNTER
            (FZ35) WAS USED FOR ABSOLUTE TRITIUM ACTIVITY MEASURE-
            MENTS. THE COUNTER HAD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTING VOLUME OF
            85 CM3 AND A DEAD VOLUME OF 15 CM3. LOW LEVEL COUNTING
            WAS PERFORMED BY PLACING THE COUNTER INSIDE A RING
            TYPE GAS COUNTING TUBE (RZ/500) HOUSED WITHIN A LEAD
            SHIELD. THE TWO DETECTORS WERE USED IN AN ANTICOINCI-
            DENCE MODE.
           (GELI) GELI DETECTOR USED FOR MEASUREMENT OF GAMMA-
            RAYS FROM THE MONITOR FOILS.
SAMPLE     .THE NITROGEN SAMPLES CONSISTED OF BETWEEN 9 AND 15 G
            OF DEGASSED ALUMINIUM-NITRIDE (ALN) POWDER (CHEMICAL
            PURITY GREATER THAN 98 PERCENT, GRAIN SIZE LESS THAN
            10 MICROMETERS) PRESSED IN A POLYETHYLENE CAPSULE,
            24.5 MM DIAMETER AND UP TP 25.0 MM LONG. LITHIUM AND
            BORON IMPURITIES IN THE SAMPLE WAS DETERMINED WITH
            NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS.
           .THE BORON SAMPLES CONSISTED OF ABOUT 1 G OF ENRICHED
            B-10 OR 12 G OF B4C IN A POLYETHYLENE CAPSULE. THE
            CHEMICAL PURITIES WERE 99.998 AND 99 PERCENT,
            RESPECTIVELY.
           .IN THE NITROGEN AND BORON IRRADIATIONS, NICKEL AND
            IRON FOILS WERE PLACED IN FRONT AND AT THE BACK OF THE
            SAMPLE TO SERVE AS NEUTRON FLUX MONITORS. THE THERMAL
            NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED WITH A GOLD FOIL.
            IRRADIATIONS WERE PERFORMED FOR 2 TO 12 HOURS.
           .FOR IRRADIATIONS AT THE REACTOR B2O3 POWDER WAS MIXED
            WITH ZNO POWDER AND CONTAINED IN 3 MM DIAMETER BY 40
            MM LONG QUARTZ AMPOULES. THE ZNO WAS USED AS AN
            INTERNAL FLUX MONITOR. THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED FOR
            22 HOURS.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR BACKGROUND NEUTRONS FROM
            THE TARGET CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL AND FROM THE D-D
            BREAKUP REACTION. CORRECTIONS WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR
            TRITIUM LOSS DUE TO RESIDUAL TRITIUM IN THE SAMPLE.
