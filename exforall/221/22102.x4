METHOD     (CHSEP) Tritium counting techniques.
            Tritium was separated from the irradiated samples
            by vacuum extraction and measured in the gas phase
            using anticoincidence proportional counting.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A 31 mm diameter cylindrical gas-filled counter
            (FZ35) was used for absolute tritium activity measure-
            ments. The counter had an effective counting volume of
            85 cm3 and a dead volume of 15 cm3. Low level counting
            was performed by placing the counter inside a ring
            type gas counting tube (RZ/500) housed within a lead
            shield. The two detectors were used in an anticoinci-
            dence mode.
           (GELI) Geli detector used for measurement of gamma-
            rays from the monitor foils.
CORRECTION  Corrections were applied for background neutrons from
            the target construction material and from the d-d
            breakup reaction. Corrections were also applied for
            tritium loss due to residual tritium in the sample.

REACTION   (7-N-14(N,T)6-C-12,,SIG)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) For the boron and nitrogen measurements
            deuterons were accelerated to 3.0 - 8.0 MeV with a
            Compact Cyclotron, CV 28.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons in the energy range 2.5 to 10.6 MeV were
            produced with a deuterium gas target, having an
            entrance havar foil of 7 um thickness.
            The gas cell had  a length of 3.7 cm and a diameter
            of 4.0 cm, with wall thicknesses of 0.1 cm, or a
            niobium entrance foil of 6.5, 20.0 or 50.0 um
            thickness and a molybdenum beam stop. The gas cell had
            a length of 3.7 cm and a diameter of 4.0 cm, with wall
            thicknesses of 0.1 cm made of brass.
            The mean neutron flux densities were of the
            order of 1.0E+07 n/cm2sec.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)
           (26-FE-54(N,P)25-MN-54,,SIG)
SAMPLE     The nitrogen samples consisted of between 9 and 15 g
           of degassed aluminium-nitride (ALN) powder (chemical
           purity greater than 98%, grain size less than 10 um)
           pressed in a polyethylene capsule, 24.5 mm diameter
           and up to 25.0 mm long. Lithium and boron impurities
           in the sample was determined with neutron activation
           analysis.
