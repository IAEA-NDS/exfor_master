SAMPLE     .THIN MG FOILS OF 2 TO 90 MG/CM-SQ AND 2.54 CM DIAMETER
            WITH 99.99% PURITY SANDWICHED BETWEEN STANDARD FE
            FOILS OF 80 MG/CM-SQ AND 2.54 CM DIAMETER WITH 99.99%
            PURITY. IRRADIATION AT 6 TO 10 CM FROM TARGET AT 0 DEG
            TO THE BEAM. THE RECOILING 24-NA NUCLEI WERE COLLECTED
            ON POLYTHENE 'CATCHER' FOILS.
CORRECTION .THE USE OF THE FE-MG-FE SANDWICH IN THE SAMPLE REMOVES
            THE NECESSITY TO MEASURE THE PRECISE DISTANCE FROM THE
            TARGET AND ALMOST ELIMINATES THE CORRECTION FOR
            NEUTRON SCATTERING IN THE FOILS. THE SMALL 'K'
            CORRECTION FOR 24-NA, WHICH COMBINES THE EFFECTS DUE
            TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BETA COUNTER TO GAMMA RAYS
            AND THE COMPLEX DECAY SCHEME OF THE ISOTOPE, WAS TAKEN
            FROM JP/G,4,1783,1978.
