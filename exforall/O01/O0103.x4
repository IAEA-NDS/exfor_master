TITLE      Production of helium by medium energy (600 and
           800 MeV) protons.

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)  LAMPF A-6 proton target station.
           A beam of large diameter, about 50 mm, compared to  the
           size of the He accumulation samples so that any spatial
           variation of proton fluence within the samples would be
           insignificant.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,HE-AC) The 4He and 3He contents of the test
           materials were determined at Rockwell International
            (USA) by mass spectrometry following vaporization of
           the specimen under vacuum in a resistance heated
           graphite crucible.
SAMPLE     Metals of Fe, Cu, Mo and W, as well as, additional
           metals of general interest: Al, Au and Ni were used.
           The size of the helium accumulation samples (3 mm
           diameter by 0.1 mm thickness).
           The samples that were analyzed for helium content, were
           sandwiched between thick samples of the same material
           to eliminate any surface effects due to recoil escape
           of alpha particles and He-3 atoms.

           nucleon-meson transport code (HETC).

MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG)
           The  aluminum dosimeter foils were placed in contact
           with the test materials so that the proton fluences
           would be the same.

DETECTOR   (GELI)  For beam fluence measurements.
           (MAGSP) For 3-He and 4-He contents.
ERR-ANALYS Any information is absent.
CRITIQUE   1. Any information for experimental accuracy is absent.
           2. The production of helium-3 due to radioactive decay
           of tritium is not discussed. This production is
           possible and tritium production influence depends from
           time interval from proton irradiation and helium
           content measurement.
