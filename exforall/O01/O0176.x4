TITLE      Preequilibrium neutron emission in the reactions
           Zr-90,Pb-208(p,xn) with 80 MeV projectiles.

           The 80.5-MeV proton beam had an average
           intensity of 14 nA and a burst width of delta t less
           700 ps at the magnetic beam swinger which was operated
           with deflection angles of 0,11,and 24 degrees,
           respectively.

           Time-Of-Flight Spectra.
           (N-SPC) The size of neutron spectra figures does not
           permit to use Data-Point Reader, because this size is
           very small.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN).  This allowed to measure the angular
           range from 0 to 144 degrees with five fixed detectors.
           The detector which was used to measure angles of 82-106
           degrees (lab. angle) required a 15-cm diameter
           collimator hole to be cut through 1.2 m of concrete
           shielding.
           The neutron detectors consisted of cylindrical cells
            (30.5 cm diam*20.3 cm) filled with the liquid
           scintillator BI501,with photomultiplier tubes RCA 8854.
           Elastically scattered protons were detected with a
           deltaE-E telescope consisting of plastic
           scintillators.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,PSD)
           (BCINT)
COMMENT    -By Compiler- Neutron spectra for 208-Pb(p,xn) reaction
           were not compiled because figure size is very small.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative uncertainties within angular
           distributions are mostly due to:
           (ERR-1) target inhomogeneities (5%),
           (ERR-2) inconsistencies in the background
                                          treatment (10%), and
           (ERR-3) incomplete beam-current integration (4%).
