SAMPLE     Six Targets of Isotopically Pure U-238, Each with a
           Thickness of Approximately 1.5 Mg/Cm**2 Mounted in
           Sandwich on Aluminum Backings 0.1 mm Thick, were Used.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Hauser-Feschbach Model.
           (STRUC) The Disposition Lomg- And Short-Lived Isomers
           Of 235-Np. Authors Believe That Ground State of 236-Np
           Is the Long-Lived One.

METHOD     (BCINT)
           (ACTIV)
           (STTA)
           It was Necessary to Take Into Account the Fact That not
           Only 236-Pu But Also 238-Pu from the Reaction
           238-U(P,N)238-Np-->238-Pu Accumulated in the Target.
           Because of the Considerable Thickness of the Uranium
           Targets (1.5 MILLIGRAMM/CM**2), It was Impossible to
           Resolve the 236-Pu and 238-Pu Peaks in the Alpha
           Spectra. The Relative Ratio of the Activity of the
           Plutonium Isotopes was Obtained by Measuring the Alpha
           Spectra of the Aluminum Foils Separaiting the Uranium
           Targets During Proton Irradiation. This Method Made It
           Possible to Measure the Reaction Cross Sections of Both
           238-U(P,N)238-Np and 238-U(P,3N)236-Np-Short-Lived.
CRITIQUE   The Energies of 238-Np and 236-Np Nuclei are not Equal.
           Therefore the Ranges of Residuals are Different. It was
           Not Excluded That the Ratio 238-Np/236-Np on Aluminum
           Foil will not be Equal this Ratio in Uranium Target.
