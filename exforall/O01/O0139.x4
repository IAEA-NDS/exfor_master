TITLE      Analyzing power for the (p,alpha'x) reaction in the
           continuum at E(p)=72 MeV.

CRITIQUE   The analyzing power for target nuclei has been shown as
           a  function  of  the  channel energy which is the total
           kinetic c.m.  energy in the  final  channel.   But  the
           authors  did  not  report  the  method to calculate the
           channel energy if they know alpha particle energy only.
ADD-RES    (COMP).A Quasi-Free Scattering Calculation.
COMMENT    * by Compiler*  Authors data for channel energy have
           been recalculated by compiler by using the formulae -
           E(channel)= E(alpha)*(A+1)/(A-3)
           This hypothesis is likelihood because the authors
           described their data as quasi-free Scattering Model.
           *by Authors*. Depolarization Factors
           D=Exp(-0.70A**(1./3.)) was used to compare experimental
           data and Quasi-Free Scattering Model.
