SAMPLE     An O(2) Gas Target (99.8% O-16) Contained in a
           Cylindrical Cell 10.2 Cm in Diameter and 2.5 Cm High.
           The Gas Cell had a 25 Mum Thick 'H-Foil' Window and
           It was Placed in the Center of a 40 Cm Diameter
           Evacuated Scattering Chamber.

           To Previous Measurements of the N-14(P,2P)C-13
           Reaction at 45 MeV.
DETECTOR   (TELES).The Outer Chamber Housed Two Coplanar Detector
           Telescopes Each of Which Consisted of a 300 Mum Thick
           Surface-Barrier Detector For Measuring Delta E,a
           Stacked Parallel Combination of Two 3 mm Thick Li-
           Drifted Silicon Detectors For Measuring E,and a 3 mm
           Thick Li-Drifted Veto Detector.Each Detector Telescope
           Was Cooled by a Peltier Thermoelectric Diode Having
           A Water-Cooled Heat Sink.The Angular Acceptance in the
           Scattering Plane was 2 Degree For Each Detector,and
           The Detectors Accepted Events Which were Coplanar
           Within the Same Angular Range.

COMMENT    -By Authors-
           The Events were Analysed Only If Abs(E/L-E/R)<=4MeV.
FLAG       (1.) Since It was Necessary to Increase the Gas
           Pressure to 3 Atm at Large Angles to Obtain Reasonable
           Counting Rates, the 3/2- Peak Could not Clearly
           Separated in That Angular Region from the Doublet
           Because of Energy Loss in the Gas Target.
