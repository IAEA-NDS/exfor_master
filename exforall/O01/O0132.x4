SAMPLE     Isotopically Enriched Ni-58,Ni-60,Ni-62,Ni-64 Targets
            (ABOUT 1 MG/CM**2 IN THICKNESS) Were Used.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The Cascade and Hybrid Model.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Observed Gamma-Rays were Assigned to a
           Particular Final Nucleus on the Basis of  the  Measured
           Energies  and  the  Consistency  of  Relative Intensity
           Patterns with  Those  Expected  For  G-Ray  Transitions
           Belonging  to  One  or  More Cascades For That Nucleus.
           For this Purpose a List of Gamma Rays Assigned Oin  the
           Basis  of in-Beam Measurements to Nuclei with 44<=a<=65
           And Their Relative Location in Their Decay Schemes  was
           Prepared from the Recently Published Literature.
CORRECTION Needed Correction For Dead Time of the Electronics and
           The Data Acquisition System has Been Included.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           (ERR-S). Systematic Uncertainties Associated with the
           Absolute Cross Sections Due to Charge Integration, Dead
           Time Correction, Target Thickness, and Detection
           Efficiency are Estimated to be About 15%.
           * Comment by Authors * Typically, Adequate Statistics
           Were Obtained to Observe Gamma Rays Produced with Cross
           Sections As Low As 2 Mb with an Accuracy of About 10%.

COMMENT    *by Authors*
           Cross Sections For the Production of Individual Final
           Nuclei were Obtained by Summing Observed Cross Sections
           For Gamma Rays Assigned to Transition to the Ground
           State and to the Known Isomeric States of the
           Respective Nucleus.
           It Should be Noted That the in-Beam Measurments Yield
           Only a Lower Limit For the Production Cross Sections
           For Given Nucleus Since Weak Transitions to and Direct
           Production of the Ground State are not Observed.
