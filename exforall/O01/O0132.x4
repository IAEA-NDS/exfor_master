           Off-line activation measurements
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched Ni-58,Ni-60,Ni-62,Ni-64 targets
            (about 1 mg/cm**2 in thickness) were used.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The Cascade and Hybrid Model.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) crystal which had an efficiency of 10%
           compared to a 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI detector for the
           1332 keV line of a l OCO source placed at 25 cm. Most
           measurements were made with the Ge(Li) at 90. degr.,
           3 to 5 cm from the target.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAINU)
METHOD     (GSPEC) The in-beam gamma-rays.
           (BCINT)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Observed gamma-rays were assigned to a
           particular final nucleus on the basis of the measured
           energies and the consistency of relative intensity
           patterns with those expected for gamma-ray transitions
           belonging to one or more cascades for that nucleus.
           For this purpose a list of gamma rays assigned on the
           basis of in-beam measurements to nuclei with 44<=A<=65
           and their relative location in their decay schemes was
           prepared from the recently published literature.
CORRECTION Needed correction for dead time of the electronics and
           the data acquisition system has been included.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS). Systematic uncertainties associated with the
           absolute cross sections due to:
               * charge integration,
               * dead time correction,
               * target thickness, and
               * detection efficiency
           are estimated to be about 15% but for the 80 MeV
           measurements for Ni-58 and Ni-62 and 100 MeV
           measurements with a Ni-64 target is estimated to be
           30% because of a bias in charge integration due to an
           alternating current pick up in the Faraday cup for the
           first case and because of poor integration at low
           currents (< 0.1 nA) employed in the second case.
COMMENT    *by Authors*
            -Cross sections for the production of individual final
           nuclei were obtained by summing observed cross sections
           for gamma rays assigned to transition to the ground
           state and to the known isomeric states of the
           respective nucleus.
            -It should be noted that the in-beam measurements
           yield only a lower limit for the production cross-
           sections for given nucleus since weak transitions to
           and direct production of the ground state are not
           observed.
