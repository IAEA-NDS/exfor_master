HISTORY    (19960126C)
           (19960912A). Reference and Some Reactions are
            Corrected.
           (19980619A) Decay-Data are Included.
           (20000425A) Date is Corrected
           (20001116A) Subentries O0177002-005 are Corrected
           According to O.Schwerer'S Remarks.
           (20001123U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Targets were Manufactured by Evaporation of U-238
           Dioxide on Thin Backing from Al(2)O(3).The Used Uranium
           Was Impoverished Relatively U-235.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For Gamma-Rays.
           (SCIN).Plastic Scintillation Detector. For Beta.
PART-DET   (B-)
           (G)
           The Authors Detected Beta-Minus Particle and
           Gamma-Quanta, But Decay Data For Radioactive Products
           Are Absent in this Report. Therefore Compiler Included
           Half-Lives from ENSDF.
FACILITY   (VDGT,4RUSEPA)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (SITA)
           Coulomb Scattering was Used As Beam Monitor. The
           Monitor Detector was Installed at 20 Ang.Degree to
           Beam Direction.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors For Relativity Projectile Energy Runs of
           Cross-Section were Conditioned Mainly by Statistic
           Errors of Counts, Which were Less 5%. Statistic Errors
           Of Monitor and Fission Fragments Detector Counts were
           Less 1%.
           (ERR-1) Error of Absolute Efficient For Ge(LI)
           Detector. It was Conditioned by Errors of Standard
           Sources.
           (ERR-2) Error of Branching Ratio For Gamma and
           Beta-Decay For Np-238,239 and U-237.
           (ERR-5) Error of Solid Angle For Fission Fragment
           Detector.
           (ERR-3).Errors of Decay Constants.
           (ERR-4).Errors Fission Cross-Section.
           (ERR-T).Total Errors Activation Cross-Section-8-10%.

COMMENT    -By Compiler- The Cross Section of (D,HE3) Reaction is
           Very Small Due to the Barrier. Therefore (D,T) Channel
           Must be Took an Account.
