TITLE      Cross-section activation measurement for U-238
           through protons and deuterons in energy interval
            10-14 MeV.

FACILITY   (VDGT,4RUSEPA)
SAMPLE     The targets were manufactured by evaporation of U-238
           dioxide on thin backing from Al(2)O(3). The used
           uranium was impoverished relatively U-235.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For gamma-rays.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillation detector. For Beta.
PART-DET   (B-,G)
           The authors detected beta-Minus particle and
           gamma-quanta, but decay data for radioactive products
           are absent in this report. Therefore compiler included
           half-lives from ENSDF.
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA)
           Coulomb scattering was used as beam monitor. The
           monitor detector was installed at 20 degr. to
           beam direction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,,5.) The errors for relativity projectile energy
           runs of cross-section were conditioned mainly by
            statistic errors of counts, which were less 5%.
           (ERR-6,,1.) Statistic errors of monitor and fission
                   fragments detector counts were less 1%
           (ERR-1) Error of absolute efficient for Ge(LI)
           detector. It was conditioned by errors of standard
           sources
           (ERR-2,,2.) Error of branching ratio for gamma and
           beta-decay for Np-238,239 and U-237.
           (ERR-5,,3.) Error of solid angle for fission fragments
           detector
           (ERR-3,,1.) Errors of decay constants.
           (ERR-4,,2.) Errors fission cross-section.

           Very Small Due to the Barrier. Therefore (D,T) Channel
