MONITOR    (26-FE-57(P,EL)26-FE-57,,DA)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSSUL) U-120 cyclotron.
METHOD     (EDEG). For 5.2 MeV
           (ACTIV) Irradiation times were varied from 3.8 up to
           12.4 hours.
           (SITA)
           (GSPEC) Gamma spectra were measured at different times
           after irradiations from 0.8 up to 68. Hours.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Any analysis of the uncertainties is absent.
