FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)Linear electron accelerator LU-40 with
           tantalum target in Research and Development Complex
           "Accelerator" NSC KIPT. Instability of electron beam
           intensity was within 2%.
SAMPLE     In studying the reaction 107Ag(g,3n)specimen of
           metallic silver with natural isotopic abundance was
           used in the form of disks with a thickness of 2 mm and
           diameters of 2 to 10 mm. A specimen of powdered silver
           was used to determine the isomer ratio for the 104m,gAg
           nucleus. In studying the reaction 109Ag(g,5n) the
           powder was enriched with isotope 109Ag (enrichment, not
           less than 99%) and weighed 329.85 mg.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Resolution of 2 keV for Co-60 line 1332 keV.
ADD-RES    Experimental data are compared with theoretical
           predictions calculated with TALYS code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties include contributions from
           photopeak efficiency calibration, abundance, geometry
           configuration and intensities of gamma-rays (photopeak
           areas). Statistical uncertainties of photopeak areas
           made the main contribution to total uncertainty of
           result, the other errors are negligible.
