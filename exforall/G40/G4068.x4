METHOD     (EXTB)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN,TRD) Secondary protons were analyzed in
           momentum by a magnetic spectrometer with an
           acceptance angle +-0.5 degrees and were recorded by a
           spark chamber telescope. The polarization of the
           protons was determined by the asymmetry of their
           scattering in the spark chamber telescope. Events with
           stopping of a  proton in the spark chamber were
           recorded by coincidence of the pulses of two
           scintillation counters and anticoincidence of one
           scintillation counter.

ADD-RES    The energy dependence of the polarization cross
           section in the photon energy interval 950-1250 MeV was
           calculated with the amplitudes for photoproduction of
           single pi0 mesons from protons taken from the work of
           R.L.Walker, Phys.Rev.,182,1729,1969.
