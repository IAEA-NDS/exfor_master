HISTORY    (20130612A)OG Digitized data were substituted by
           tabulated data received from A.M.Parlag in May 2013.
COMMENT    For investigation excitation functions unresolved group
           two lines 459.8 and 490.7 keV were used.
           The contribution of produced Tl-202(HL=12.2D),
           irradiating gamma-rays with energy 439.6 keV was taken
           into account.
