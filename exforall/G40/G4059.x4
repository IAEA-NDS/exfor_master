TITLE      Study of the excitation of 11/2- isomeric state of
           the nucleus 139Ce in reaction (g, n)m in the giant E1-
           resonance region

INC-SOURCE (BRST) 0.5 mm Ta converter
FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) M-30 microtron
SAMPLE     Targets were made of high-purity oxide powder cerium,
           pressed in thin-walled caprolon cassettes with a
           diameter of 20 mm and a mass of 2 g.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The spectrometer resolution was equal to
           2.0 keV at the gamma transition with Egamma=1332.5 keV
           in 60Co nucleus.
REL-REF    (R,,R.B.Firestone+,B,FIRESTONE,,1996) DECAY-DATA given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard errors through series of
            measurements.
HISTORY    (20171207C) UKRNDC
           (20171212R) Data were received from P.S.Derechkey.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental data are compared with theoretical
            predictions calculated with TALYS-1.6 code.
