FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)
INC-SOURCE (BRST,POLPS) A linearly polarized quasimonochromatic
           gamma-ray beam was produced as a result of coherent
           bremsstrahlung of 1.2-GeV electrons in a 1-mm-thick
           diamond single crystal.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,MAGSP) The channel for the reaction
           g,4He->p,t under study was isolated by measuring the
           p,t coincidences. The protons and tritons emitted
           from the liquid-helium target were analyzed in terms
           of their momenta by two magnetic spectrometers and
           detected by the scintillation  counter telescopes.
           The energy resolution of the experiment, which was
           determined by the angular and momentum capture of the
           magnetic spectrometers, varied in the experimental
           energy range from dEg/Eg = 0.08 to 0.14 MeV, with
           allowance for the energy loss of particles in the
           target and in the foil of the frame.
METHOD     (COINC)  Detection of p and t in coincidence.
SAMPLE     The liquid-helium target with a 90-pm-thick
           stainless-steel neck had the shape of a cylinder 25 mm
           in diameter and 130 mm long along the beam axis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
