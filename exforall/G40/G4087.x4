FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) The M-30 microtron
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The bremsstrahlung was generated by impinging of
           the electron beam on the solid tantalum and aluminum
           beam dumps. The absolute bremsstrahlung fluence was
           monitored by the 176Hf(gamma,n)175Hf reaction.
SAMPLE     The targets were made of powdery hafnium, both
           natural isotope composition and enriched 180Hf till
           94.3%. At 14.5 MeV the target represented the
           enriched 180HfO2, weight 1.532 g, which was sealed in
           the oval quartz vessel. At 14.8 MeV the target
           consisted of the natHfO2 powder, weight 8.85 g, which
           was put in the aluminum cylindrical vessel.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe-detector which have the energy resolution
           of 1.8-2 keV at the 1332.5 keV peak of 60Co

ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured isomeric ratios were compared with
           values of  model calculation TALYS-1.6 and EMPIRE-3.2
           codes.

           Taken by authors from R.B.Firestone, Table of Isotops,
           8th ed.
ANALYSIS   The author assumed the similarity of the excitation
           functions for the (g,n)-reactions on the 176Hf and
           180Hf nuclei in the used range of bremsstrahlung
           energies, so to determine the yield for the stable
           179Hf ground state, was used the 176Hf(g,n)175Hf
           reaction and the unstable ground state of 175Hf.

ANALYSIS   The authors assumed that contribution of the
           176Hf(g,2n) reaction is neglected in the used range of
           bremsstrahlung energies.
