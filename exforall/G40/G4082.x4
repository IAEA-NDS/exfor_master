FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) 2-GeV linear electron accelerator
INC-SOURCE (BRST,POLPS,KINDT) Linearly polarized gamma rays were
            produced by passing electrons with an energy
            E=1200 MeV along the (110) plane (far from the axes)
            of a silicon crystal 500 um thick.
           The value of the degree of linear polarization in the
            coherent part of the gamma spectrum was measured with
            a polarimeter based on a gaseous deuterium target and
            a surface-barrier semiconductor detector, on the
            basis of the asymmetry of the proton yield for the
            coherent part of the gamma spectrum.
           (KINDT) Gamma-ray energy was reconstructed by
            measuring the energy spectra of the charged products.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Si surface-barrier semiconductor detectors
            positioned on different sides of the target, at
            angles (90 deg and -85 deg) corresponding to the
            kinematics of the reaction of interest.
           These detectors were connected in a coincidence
            circuit.
METHOD     (COINC) Detection of t and alpha in coincidence
SAMPLE     Free-standing foil of the isotope 7Li (1 mg/cm2 thick)
            in a vacuum chamber.
ADD-RES    The particle considered (triton or alpha) and its
            angle (90 deg or 85 deg) is not clear. Following
            parallel-perpendicular asymmetry  avlues were
            digitized from Fig.1 of JETP Lett.49(1989)155:
