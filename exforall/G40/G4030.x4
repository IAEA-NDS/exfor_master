FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) The M-30 microtron
SAMPLE     The metallic disks with mass about 15 g and 20 mm in
           diameter from natural stibium were used as targets.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The induced activity was measured using a gamma-
           spectrometers at the 1.8 -2 keV resolution for the Co60
           gamma-line 1.173 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)Full uncertainty values were determined as a sum
           of systematic and statistical errors.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured isomeric ratios were compared with
           values of  model calculation TALYS-1.0.
