INC-SOURCE (BRST) 1.05 mm Ta converter with 32 to 84 MeV electron
FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) Linear electron accelerator LU-40 with
            tantalum target in Research and Development Complex
            "Accelerator" NSC KIPT.
           Instability of electron beam intensity was within 2%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Resolution of 1.9 keV for Co-60 line 1332 keV.
SAMPLE     Metallic Sb target with natural isotopic abundance.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental data are compared with theoretical
            predictions calculated with TALYS code.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties include contributions from
           photopeak efficiency calibration, abundance, geometry
           configuration and intensities of gamma-rays(photopeak
           areas). Statistical uncertainties of photopeak areas
           made the main contribution to total uncertainty of
           result, the other errors are negligible.
