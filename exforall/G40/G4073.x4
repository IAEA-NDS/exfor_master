FACILITY   (ESTRG,2SWDLND) The MAX-lab Nuclear Physics facility
           in Lund
INC-SOURCE (BRST,POLPS,TAGD) The electron beam with energy
           192.7MeV was extracted from the MAX-I storage ring,
           which worked in a stretcher mode. Then the beam was
           delivered into experimental area and was directed onto
           photon radiators. The beam size on the radiators was
           no more than 2 mm, and the electron current was about
           5...10 nA. The polarized photon beam has been
           produced at process of a coherent bremsstrahlung of
           electrons in a diamond crystal of 100 mu-m thick.
METHOD     (EDE)
SAMPLE     Two targets, a 1.1mm CH2 and a 1mm CD2 thickness
           plates, were used for measurements. The targets were
           positioned on the distance about 2 m from the photon
           collimator at angle 30 degrees to the photon beam
           direction. The numbers of carbon nuclei per cm2 were
           0.885e22 cm-2 for the CH2 target and 0.771e22 cm-2
           for the CD2 target, the number of deuteron nuclei per
           cm2 was 1.541e22 cm-2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SISD) Protons were detected by a CsI/SSD
           telescope, placed under angle 90 degrees to the beam
           axis. It consisted of two identical single-sided
           silicon strip detectors and a CsI(Tl) counter, which
           functioned as deltaE and E detectors, respectively.
           The SSDs had a thickness of 0.5 mm and 64 strips,
           each of 1 mm width, which were paralleled in groups
           of two for the read-out, thus yielding an effective
           strip width of 2 mm. The CsI(Tl) detector was of
           cylinder shape of 12.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm long,
           housed in Al container.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
            The systematic uncertainty was estimated to be about
            10%, and arises from error of the random background
            spectra normalization at the background subtraction
            (about 7%), and accuracy of the polarization
            determination (about 5%).
