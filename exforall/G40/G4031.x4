FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)The electrostatic electron accelerator
           ELIAS having:
              energy of accelerated electrons (0.5-3.2) MeV;
              deviation for energy < 1%;
              electron current without scanning (0.5-150) micro-A;
              maximum electron current with scanning > 500 micro-A
              dispersion of electron beam 10E-4 rad;
              vacuum in accelerated and electron tubes 10E-7 mbar;
              diameter of the beam (without focusing) 1.0 cm;
              diameter of the beam (with focusing) < 1 mm.
           Bremsstrahlungs spectra with Eg max<=3.0 MeV were
           generated by irradiating Ta converter with thickness of
           0.5 mm. The fluent of water under pressure of 2.5 bars
           is used for cooling the radiator during experiments.
SAMPLE     Natural abundance Indium target (95.6% 115In and 4.4%
           113In) by thick of 0.2 mm and diameter of 15 mm was
           placed in the photon beam just behind the converter
METHOD     (ACTIV)Induced g-activity was measured (Eg=388.532keV
           T1/2=2.81 hours)
DETECTOR   (GELI)Ge(Li) detector with sensitive volume of
           40 cm3 and energy resolution 2.5 keV for 1332 keV of
           60Co isotope.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Full uncertainty values of excitation function
           were determined as a sum of systematic and statistical
           errors. Statistical errors were small - better than 3%,
           the main contribution to the full error comes from the
           efficiency calibration of the Ge(Li) detector.
