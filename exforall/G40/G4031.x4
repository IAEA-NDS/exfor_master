FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) The electrostatic electron accelerator
           ELIAS having:
              energy of accelerated electrons (0.5-3.2) MeV;
              deviation for energy < 1%;
              electron current without scanning (0.5-150) micro-A;
              maximum electron current with scanning > 500 micro-A
              dispersion of electron beam 10E-4 rad;
              vacuum in accelerated and electron tubes 10E-7 mbar;
              diameter of the beam (without focusing) 1.0 cm;
              diameter of the beam (with focusing) < 1 mm.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlungs spectra with Eg max<=3.0 MeV
            generated by irradiating Ta converter with thickness
            of 0.5 mm.
SAMPLE     Natural abundance In target (0.2 mm thick, 15 mm diam.)
            placed in the photon beam just behind the converter
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced g-activity was measured (Eg=388.532keV
            T1/2=2.81 hours)
REL-REF    (M,,D.Belic+,J,NIM/A,463,26,2001)
            Derivation of (g,g') area for isomer production
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector with sensitive volume of 40 cm3
            and energy resolution 2.5 keV for 1332 keV of 60Co
            isotope.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Sum of systematic and statistical errors.
            Statistical errors were small - better than 3%,
            the main contribution to the full error comes from
            the efficiency calibration of the Ge(Li) detector.
