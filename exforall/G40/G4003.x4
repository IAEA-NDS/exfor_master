METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     Disks of Np237 oxide with diameter of active layer
            11.5 mm and thickness 20 microns on Al backing with
            diameter of 30 mm.
           Impurities Pu238 and Pu239 in target made 2.*10**(-9)
            and 6.*10**(-7) g accordingly.
           Accumulation of fragments as carried out aluminum foil
            - by collectors thickness of 0.1 mm which it was
            established before a layer of dividend of material of
            target.
           During experiment assembly - "sandwiches" (a layer of
            a dividend of a material - a collector) were used.

COMMENT    Cumulative outputs were determined as relative to
           Te-132 (228.2 keV) and relative to 133 I (529.9 keV).
           The numerical values of the relative cumulative yields
           of fragments obtained for these rappers are consistent
           with each other with an accuracy better than 1%.
