SAMPLE     The enriched 90% U-235 sample had a weight close to
           0.5 g.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
STATUS     (TABLE,APRVD) Data from the table 1 from
           YFE,15,(2),111,2014. Data were approved by
           V.O.Zheltonozhskii
COMMENT    The experimental values of isomeric yield ratios
           were calculated taking into account the contribution
           from the beta-decay of isobaric nuclei in the yields
           of isotopes studied.
           DECAY-DATA information was given by authors from
           Firestone R.B., Shirley V.S., Baglin C.M. et al. 8th
           edition of the Table of Isotopes CD-ROM. - 1996. Ver.1.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Errors include both the systematic and
           statistical errors.

ADD-RES    (AMFF)The average values and the distributions of
           angular momentum of the primary fragments 133Te, 134I
           and 135Xe are determined by the statistical model
           analysis.
