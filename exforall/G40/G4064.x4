FACILITY   (ESTRG,2SWDLND) MAX I ring in Lund.
SAMPLE     The CH2 target was applied both for carbon
           disintegration measurement and for removing the
           background contribution from this process to the
           deuteron disintegration. The CD2 target had a disc
           shape, 75 mm in diameter and 1mm thick. The CH2
           target had a square form, 150.2x150.2mm2 and 1.1mm
           thick.
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SISD) The emitted protons were detected
           by a CsI/SSD telescope. The telescope consists of two
           identical single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs),
           and a CsI(Tl) counter. The SSD detectors (deltaE) are
           of octagonal shape, have an active area 3300 mm2 and
           a thickness 0.5 mm. They have 64 strips, each with
           a width of 1 mm. The strips are paralleled in groups of
           two for the read-out, thus yielding an effective strip
           width of 2 mm. The active aria of the detectors was
           wrapped Al foil 15 mu-m thick. The CsI(Tl) detector (E)
           is of a cylinder shape 12.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm
           long, placed in Al container with the standard
           Al-front-foil. The telescope was placed under angle
           Sigma p = 90 degrees to the beam axis. The distance
           between the first SSD and the center of the photon beam
           sport on the target was 98.5 mm, the distance between
           the SSDs was 15mm, and the distance between the second
           SSD and CsI was 10mm.

REACTION  1(1-H-2(G,N)1-H-1,,DA,P) Background subtraction A
          2(1-H-2(G,N)1-H-1,,DA,P) Background subtraction B
ANALYSIS   Two variants different by execution sequence of the
            random and carbon background subtraction.
          1Variant A:
            On the first step the carbon background was removed
            by subtraction of the normalized CH2 spectrum. On the
            second step, the remaining random background with the
            exception the deuteron peak range was fitted by five
            order polynomial to provide adequate description the
            background in all energy range.
          2Variant B:
            After the background subtraction, the spectra both
            for the CD2 and CH2 targets were flat within the
            statistical errors and consistent with zero in the
            background range. On the next step the above CD2 and
            CH2 spectra were subtracted, and the d(g,p) reaction
            Emis spectra were obtained.
