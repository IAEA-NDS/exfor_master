TITLE      Investigation of the isomeric states excitation
           processes for 111Cd and 115Cd isotopes in (gamma,n)
           reaction at the gamma-quantum energies in giant
           dipole resonance region.

FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) The M-30 microtron
SAMPLE     The targets were metal disks 30 mm in diameter and
           1.5 mg in weight, made up of Cd with the natural
           isotope content.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Semiconductor detector at the 3.5 keV resolution
           for the Co60 gamma-line 1.173 MeV.
