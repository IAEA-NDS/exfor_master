INC-SOURCE (BRST) 1.05 mm Ta converter with 32 to 84 MeV electron
FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) Linear electron accelerator LU-40 with
           tantalum target in Research and Development Complex
           "Accelerator" NSC KIPT.
           Instability of electron beam intensity was within 2%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Resolution of 1.9 keV for Co-60 line 1332 keV.
SAMPLE     (26-FE-54,ENR=0.9985) Enriched (99.85%) 54Fe sample
           were formed as metal disks of iron 10 mm in diameter
           and 236mg mass for first sample (215mg for second one).
ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental data are compared with theoretical
            predictions calculated with TALYS code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties include contributions from
           photopeak efficiency calibration (2%), abundance(<1 %),
           geometry configuration (2%) and intensities of
           gamma-rays (3%, excluding case for 43.6 MeV).
           Statistical uncertainties of photopeak areas were the
           major contributors to total uncertainty of result.
           (ERR-1)photopeak efficiency calibration (2%),
           (ERR-2)geometry configuration (2%),
           (ERR-3,,1.)abundance(<1 %).
