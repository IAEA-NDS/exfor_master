TITLE      Experimental results on cross sections for 7Be

INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     Corundum (Al2O3), high-purity graphite (C), a highly
            compressed aluminum nitride powder (AlN), and Mo.
DETECTOR   (GE) The spectrometer complex "CANBERRA InSpector-2000"
            with an energy resolution of 1.74 keV in the 1332 keV
            line.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ANALYSIS   The simulated bremsstrahlung spectrum was convolved
            with the known experimental cross-section for the
            100Mo(g,n)99Mo reaction and with the cross-section,
            obtained using the program TALYS-1.4, with the result
            that the calculated values of 99Mo activity in the
            check test target were obtained.
           The difference between the measured 99 Mo activity
            value and the simulated result does not exceed 5-8%.
