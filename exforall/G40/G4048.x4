COMMENT    The bremsstrahlung photons' flux density in the
           target's location was calculated using a computer
           simulation. A computational modelling was performed to
           describe the passage of primary electrons of energies
           ranging from 40 to 90 MeV with a 10 MeV step through
           the target assembly model having the parameters, which
           correspond to the parameters of the experimental
           target assembly. For computation purposes, a computer
           program KIPT has been developed. The library of the
           GEANT4 classes, version 9.4 were used. The electron
           beam diameter was set to be 10 mm, the electron beam
           distribution was determined using class G4UniformRand.
           For the description of physical processes, the low-
           energy electromagnetic process model Livermore was
           used.
           The simulated bremsstrahlung spectrum was convolved
           with the known experimental cross-section for the
           100Mo(g,n)99Mo reaction and with the cross-section,
           obtained using the program TALYS-1.4, with
           the result that the calculated values of 99 Mo
           activity in the check test target were obtained. The
           difference between the measured 99 Mo activity
           value and the simulated result does not exceed 5-8 %.
               Cross-section for the 100Mo(g,n)99Mo reaction was
           given from H.Naik+,Journal of Radioanalytical and
           Nuclear Chemistry. 2013, v. 295, iss. 1, p. 807-816.
SAMPLE     Targets: corundum (Al2O3), high-purity graphite (C) and
           a highly compressed aluminum  nitride powder (AlN).
           The molybdenum target 4-Mo used as a check test piece.
DETECTOR   (GE)The spectrometer complex "CANBERRA InSpector-2000"
           with an energy resolution of 1.74 keV in the 1332 keV
           line.
CORRECTION The experimental data on 7Be activity in the C, N, O
           targets were corrected for the 99 Mo yield. In this
           way the errors due to non identical conditions of
           different irradiation sessions were reduced in the
           determination of the cross-section for 7 Be production.
