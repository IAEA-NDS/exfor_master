FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)Linear electron accelerator of the
           Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology. The
           working electron beam current was 0.15 micro-A, beam
           energy was adjusted within 1 GeV . In this regime
           accelerator worked 10000 hours. Cooling time from
           bremsstrahlung intensive experiments to present
           radiation measurement is 35 years.
SAMPLE     A tantalum plate of 0.3 mm in thickness was set at the
           output of the accelerator on the electron beam way.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)working volume of 40cm3, energy resolution
           2.5 keV
ERR-ANALYS The typical statistical errors deduced from the areas
           of the gamma lines were less then 3-5%.
