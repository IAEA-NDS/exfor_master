            176Lu(a,p)179Hfm2 and 175Lu(a,2n)177Ta reaction
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) The M-30 microtron
SAMPLE     Targets were made from metal and powder hafnium of
           natural isotopic composition. The samples were in the
           form of an aluminum cylinder 8 mm high by 2 cm in
           diameter with 9 g of HfO2 powder for 17.5 MeV and a
           2.4x1.3x0.4 cm rectangular strip weighing about 13 g
           for 15.1 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The induced activity was measured using a gamma-
           spectrometers at the 1.8 -2 keV resolution for the Co60
           gamma-line 1.173 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured isomeric ratios were compared with
           values of  model calculation TALYS-1.4 and EMPIRE-3.2
           codes.

           Taken by authors from R.B.Firestone, Table of Isotops,
           8th ed.
ANALYSIS   The author assumed the similarity of the excitation
           functions for the (g,n)-reactions on the 176Hf and
           180Hf nuclei in the used range of bremsstrahlung
           energies, so to determine the yield for the stable
           179Hf ground state, was used the 176Hf(g,n)175Hf
           reaction and the unstable ground state of 175Hf.

ANALYSIS   The authors assumed that contribution of the
           176Hf(g,2n) reaction is neglected in the used range of
           bremsstrahlung energies.
