FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)Linear electron accelerator LU-40.
           Incident electron flux instability did not exceed 2%.
           A tantalum converter with a thickness of 1.05 mm was
           installed at the output of the electron accelerator;
           an aluminum electron moderator with a size of diameter
           90x100 mm was situated behind the converter. The
           distance from the Ta converter to the Al moderator was
           20 mm, and the distance to the studied sample was
           200 mm.
SAMPLE     Samples of metallic zirconium in the form of a powder
           with a mass of 206.36 mg, enriched with the 90Zr
           isotope, and zirconium oxide with a mass of 463.9 mg,
           enriched with the 91Zr isotope, were used for
           irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Resolution of 1.9 keV for Co-60 line 1332 keV.
ADD-RES    Experimental data are compared with theoretical
           predictions calculated with TALYS code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties include contributions from
           photopeak efficiency calibration, abundance, geometry
           configuration and intensities of gamma-rays (photopeak
           areas). Statistical uncertainties of photopeak areas
           made the main contribution to total uncertainty of
           result, the other errors are negligible.
