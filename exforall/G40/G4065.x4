FACILITY   (BETAT,4UKRUZH) The 25 MeV betatron
INC-SOURCE (BRST) A tungsten target
DETECTOR   (PROPC) From 1 to 3 SNMO-5 neutron counters were
           placed in a paraffin tube measuring 73x73x80 cm, with
           a 4x5 cm axial channel for the investigated samples.
           The counters were located 12.8 cm from the channel
           axis. The photoneutrons were registered between the
           betatron pulses, with a delay of 30 microseconds
           following the g-quantum pulse and a registration time
           of 900 microseconds. The efficiency of photoneutron
           registration was determined by several neutron standard
           sources (Po-Be), and by measurement of the yield of
           photoneutrons from the copper. The activity of the
           standard neutron source was known accurate to  +- 10%.
           (IOCH) The g-quantum flux was measured with a thick-
           wall aluminum ionization chamber.
