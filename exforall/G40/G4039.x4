           The energy uncertainty for accelerated electrons did
            not exceed 50 keV.
           The average current of accelerated electrons was 5 uA.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) A 0.5-mm-thick Ta plate served as a radiator
SAMPLE     Discs of glassy tellurium oxide TeO2 with a diameter
            of 25 mm, a thickness of 2 mm, and purity of 99.99%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector with a volume of 175 cm3 and a
            resolution of 1.9 keV for the line 1332 keV of 60Co.
