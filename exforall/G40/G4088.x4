            Data for the 178Hf(n,gamma)179m2Hf reaction
FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) The 40 MeV electron linac (LUE-40)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The bremsstrahlung was generated by impinging
           the electron beam on the solid tantalum and aluminum
           beam dumps.
SAMPLE     A stack of the natHf-natTa-natLu sample was made. The
           samples were wrapped with 0.040 mm thick aluminum
           foil with purity higher than 99.99% and put in the
           aluminum cylinder with diameter of 1.5 cm and height
           of 2 cm.
           The size of the natLu metal foil was 1x0.7x0.007 cm,
           weight 0.05 g.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe-detector which have the energy resolution
           of 1.8-2 keV at the 1332.5 keV peak of 60Co.
MONITOR    (71-LU-175(G,N)71-LU-174-G,,SIG)
           (71-LU-175(G,2N)71-LU-173,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   The 175Lu(gamma,n)174Lu-G and 175Lu(gamma,2n) 173Lu
           reactions cross-sections were calculated with the
           step of 1 MeV by using the TALYS-1.6 and EMPIRE-3.2
           codes and checked on agreement with the experimental
           data from L0015019 and L0015020 in the energy regions
            (7.800-13.0)MeV and (14.06-19.3) MeV, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall uncertainty is the quadratic
           sum of both random and systematic errors. The random
           errors are due to uncertainties in sample mass and
           counting statistics. The systematic errors are due to
           uncertainties in the simulated bremsstrahlung
           spectrum due to the use of GEANT4 code, the
           experimental photon or neutron fluxes due to the use
           of the 175Lu(g,n) 174gLu, 175Lu(g,2n)173Lu or
           180Hf(n,g)181Hf monitor reactions cross-sections,
           detection efficiency and the decay intensities. The
           overall uncertainty is found to be 6.4-7.9%.
