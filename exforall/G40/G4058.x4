SAMPLE     A closed 235U source (90% 235U + 10% 238U,
           514 mg in mass, and packed into a container) and
           a 238U specimen (stripes from evaporated 238U with
           a total isotope mass of 2 g) were used as targets.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The spectrometer resolution was equal to
           2.0 keV at the gamma transition with Egamma=1332.5 keV
           in 60Co nucleus.
ADD-RES    (AMFF) The values of mean angular momenta of the
           fission fragments were determined theoretically with
           the use of the software codes TALYS 1.6 and EMPIRE 3.2.
CORRECTION Corrected for decay of 97Zr(16.9 hr) by using the
            difference in the 743.36 keV gamma counts measured
            at 10 half-lives and one half-life.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Measurement errors were evaluated as the
           statistical errors of the areas under the peaks of
           total absorption, and the decay of the isobaric
           precursor nucleus.
