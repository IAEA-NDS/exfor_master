SAMPLE     A closed 235U source (90% 235U + 10% 238U,
           514 mg in mass, and packed into a container) and
           a 238U specimen (stripes from evaporated 238U with
           a total isotope mass of 2 g) were used as targets.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The spectrometer resolution was equal to
           2.0 keV at the gamma transition with Egamma=1332.5 keV
           in 60Co nucleus.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from the table 3 from J,UJP,62,285,2017
REL-REF    (R,,R.B.Firestone+,B,FIRESTONE,,1996) Decay data
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Measurement errors were evaluated as the
           statistical errors of the areas under the peaks of
           total absorption, and the decay of the isobaric
           precursor nucleus.
HISTORY    (20170927C) UKRNDC
ADD-RES    (AMFF)The values of mean angular momenta of the
           fission fragments were determined theoretically with
           the use of the software codes TALYS 1.6 and EMPIRE 3.2.
