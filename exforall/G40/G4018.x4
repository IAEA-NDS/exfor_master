FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)Linear electron accelerator LU-40 with
           tantalum target in Research and Development Complex
           "Accelerator" NSC KIPT. Instability of electron beam
           intensity was within 2%.
SAMPLE     The cylindrical targets Ag and In with isotopes natural
           abundance were of 2 mm thickness and 10 mm diameter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Resolution of 2 keV for Co-60 line 1332 keV.
ADD-RES    Experimental data are compared with theoretical
           predictions calculated with TALYS code.

ANALYSIS   For definition of yields for Ag-104 the
           areas of gamma-line photopeaks were measured: for
           ground state (J=5+) 555.8 and 767.7 keV gamma-lines,
           for isomeric state (J=2+) 555.8 keV gamma-line.
