FACILITY   (MICRT,4UKRIEP) The M-30 microtron was used for the
           energy region 10-18 MeV.
           (BETAT,4UKRUZH) The B-25/30 betatron was used for the
           energies 19, 20, and 22 MeV.
SAMPLE     The samples were discs of glassy tellurium oxide TeO2
           with a diameter of 25 mm, a thickness of 2 mm,
           and purity of 99.99%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector with a volume of 175 cm3 and a
           resolution of 1.9 keV for the line 1332 keV of 60Co.
