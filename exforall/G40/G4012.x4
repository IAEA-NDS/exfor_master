FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)The 3 MV electrostatic electron
           accelerator ELIAS having a beam intensity up to
           500micro-A. Experiment was carried out following the
           photoactivation technique within the photon energy
           range of 1.0-3.0 MeV with a step of 0.2 MeV. An
           electron beam 2 mm in diameter and with a current up to
           200 micro-A was slowed down in a tantalum radiator
           0.5 mm in thickness cooled with flowing water.
SAMPLE     Pieces of a cadmium foil 15 mm in diameter and
           0.2 mm in thickness. The natural abundance of the
           111Cd isotope is 12.81%.
METHOD     (ACTIV)The decay of the isomer was determined by
           registering gamma-quanta with an energy of 245.4 keV
           and the relative probability of the decay of 94.2%.
           The isomeric state 111m-Cd with an energy of 396 keV
           has the spin = 5.5- and the half-life period T1/2 =
           48.54 min, the ground state is stable and has
           the spin = 0.5+.
DETECTOR   (GELI)Working volume of about 40cm3, energy resolution
           2.5 keV for 1332 keV of 60Co.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors of the definition of the integral
           cross-sections are equal to the sum of statistical and
           systematic ones.
ANALYSIS   The integral cross-sections were determined as the
           parameters used for the fitting of experimental yield
           data. The bremsstrahlung spectrum of electrons  in a
           tantalum radiator was modeled with the help of a
           GEANT3.21 code. Each experimental point corresponds
           to the averaging over 10e7 measurements, the interval
           of grouping was 1 keV, and the cut-off energy of the
           cascade with respect to photons and electrons amounted
           to 0.5 MeV.
