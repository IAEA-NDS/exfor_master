FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) The 3 MV electrostatic electron
            accelerator ELIAS
INC-SOURCE (BRST) An electron beam 2 mm in diameter and with a
            current up to 200 uA was slowed down in a Ta radiator
            0.5 mm in thickness cooled with flowing water.
SAMPLE     (48-CD-111,NAT=0.1281)
           Pieces of a Cd foil 15 mm in diameter and 0.2 mm in
            thickness.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Working volume of about 40cm3, energy resolution
            2.5 keV for 1332 keV of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ANALYSIS   The integral cross-sections were determined as the
            parameters used for the fitting of experimental yield
            data.
           The bremsstrahlung spectrum of electrons in a Ta
            radiator was modeled with the help of a GEANT3.21
            code.
           Each experimental point corresponds to the averaging
            over 10e7 measurements, the interval of grouping was
            1 keV, and the cut-off energy of the cascade with
            respect to photons and electrons amounted to 0.5 MeV.
