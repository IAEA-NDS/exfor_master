FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The bremsstrahlung beam of a 2-GeV linear
           electron accelerator. A gamma beam with a
           cross-sectional area of 12x12 mm2 is produced in a
           liquid-deuterium target.
SAMPLE     A liquid-deuterium target 60 mm in diameter and 200 mm
           long.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,TELES) The polarization of protons was measured
           by means of a spark chamber telescope which was placed
           at the exit of a magnetic spectrometer. The energy
           resolution of the protons detected by the telescope
           was 25 MeV.
METHOD     (DSCAT) The polarization of protons was determined from
           the asymmetry of their scattering by carbon nuclei (pC
           scattering) by means of the maximum likelihood method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
