INC-SOURCE (BRST,POLPS) The monochromatic gamma-ray beam was
           obtained from the coherent bremsstrahlung of
           electrons with energies of 600, 1000, and 1200 MeV in
           a diamond single crystal 0.3 mm thick. The crystal
           was oriented in the goniometer in such a way that a
           single reciprocal-lattice site, (2,0), contributed
           most of the coherent bremsstrahlung.
CORRECTION Corrected for background. The spectrum of
           coherent-bremsstrahlung gamma rays has a
           characteristic interference maximum, against the
           background of an incoherent (Schiff) bremsstrahlung.
           To single out the interference component, the energy
           distributions of gamma rays at deuterium and lithium
           targets for three orientations of the crystal under
           identical kinematic conditions were measured.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) Protons were identified by a two-channel
           telescope of scintillation counters by means of
           magnetic analysis and the dE/dx method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
