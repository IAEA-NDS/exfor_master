METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
SAMPLE     Disks of Th-232 oxide with diameter of active layer
            11.5 mm and thickness 20 microns on Al backing with
            diameter of 30 mm.
           Accumulation of fragments as carried out aluminum foil
            - by collectors thickness of 0.1 mm which it was
            established before a layer of dividend of material of
            target.
           During experiment assembly - "sandwiches" (a layer of
            a dividend of a material - a collector) were used.

COMMENT    Cumulative outputs were determined as relative to
           Te-132 (228.2 keV) and relative to 133 I (529.9 keV).
           The numerical values of the relative cumulative yields
           of fragments obtained for these rappers are consistent
           with each other with an accuracy better than 1%.
