INC-SOURCE (BRST)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT)The 3 MV electrostatic electron
           accelerator ELIAS having an voltage instability 50 kV
           and a beam intensity up to 500micro-A. Bremsstrahlung
           spectra have been generated by electrons irradiating of
           0.5mm thickness Ta converter.
SAMPLE     Samples of natural Sr (0.2mm thick and 15mm in
           diameter) have been placed in the photon beam behind
           the converter.
METHOD     (ACTIV)Induced g-activity was measured (Eg=388.532keV
           T1/2=2.81 hours)
DETECTOR   (GELI)working volume of 50cm3, energy resolution
           2.5 keV for 1332 keV of 60Co
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Full uncertainty values of excitation function
           were determined as a sum of systematic and statistical
           errors.

COMMENT    The intermediate state integrated cross section was
           calculated from difference between experimental and
           calculated yield. A theoretical yield function has been
           constructed from the Geant photon spectra using Monte
           Carlo calculation.
