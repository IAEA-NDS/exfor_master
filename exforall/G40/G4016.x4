FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT) The 3 MV electrostatic electron
            accelerator ELIAS having an voltage instability 50 kV
            and a beam intensity up to 500 micro-A. Bremsstrahlung
            spectra have been generated by electrons irradiating
            of 0.5 mm thickness Ta converter.
SAMPLE     Samples of natural Sr (0.2mm thick and 15mm in
            diameter) have been placed in the photon beam behind
            the converter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced g-activity was measured (Eg=388.532 keV
            T(1/2)=2.81 hours)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Working volume of 50 cm3, energy resolution
            2.5 keV for 1332 keV of 60Co
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Full uncertainty values of excitation function
            were determined as a sum of systematic and statistical
            errors.

COMMENT    The intermediate state integrated cross section was
           calculated from difference between experimental and
           calculated yield. A theoretical yield function has been
           constructed from the Geant photon spectra using Monte
           Carlo calculation.
