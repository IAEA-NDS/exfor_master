INC-SOURCE (TAGD,POLPS)  The  polarized photon beam was generated
           at process of coherent bremsstrahlung of electrons in a
           diamond crystal. The crystal was orientated in such a
           way that main contribution to the coherent
           bremsstrahlung cross section gave one vector of the
           reciprocal lattice of the  crystal, [0-22] for parallel
           and [0-2-2] for perpendicular directions of the
           polarization to the reaction plane.
SAMPLE     The measurements were performed using a CD2 plate of
           1 mm thick, and a 1.1 mm CH2 target for the carbon
           disintegration background subtraction. The targets
           were positioned on the distance ~2 m from the photon
           collimator at angle 60 degrees to the photon beam
           direction.
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SISD) Protons were detected by a CsI/SSD
           telescope, placed under angle THETAp= 90 degees to the
           beam axis. It consisted of two identical single-sided
           silicon strip detectors and a CsI(Tl) counter, which
           functioned as delta E and E detectors, respectively.
           The SSDs had a thickness of 0.5 mm and 64 strips,
           which were paralleled in groups of two for the
           read-out, thus yielding an effective strip width of 2
           mm. The CsI(Tl) detector was of cylinder shape of
           12.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm long. Its angular
           acceptance was determined by Monte Carlo simulation,
           using the GEANT-4 package, and was deltaTHETAp +-14
           degrees FWHM. The proton detection threshold was Eth
           18 MeV that corresponded to the photon energy of Eg
           40 MeV for the d(g,p)n reaction.

           Systematic uncertainty includes errors due to solid
           angle, resulted from uncertainties of the
           measurements of the set up dimensions (2%), the
           stolen correction due to uncertainties of the beam
           duty factor value (5%) and tagging efficiency,
           resulted from uncertainties due to the background
           contribution (6%). Thus, the root mean square of the
           systematic uncertainties was ~8%, under the
           assumption of independent sources.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.
           Systematic uncertainty includes error mainly due to
           photon polarization determination, because of
           relative character of this observable, and was ~ 8
           and 6% for the above asymmetry values, respectively.
