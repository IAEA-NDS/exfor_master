INC-SOURCE (TAGD,POLPS) The polarized photon beam was generated
            at process of coherent bremsstrahlung of electrons in
            a diamond crystal.
           The crystal was orientated in such a way that main
            contribution to the coherent bremsstrahlung cross
            section gave one vector of the reciprocal lattice of
            the crystal, [0-22] for parallel and [0-2-2] for
            perpendicular directions of the polarization to the
            reaction plane.
SAMPLE      CD2 plate (1 mm thick), and CH2 target (1.1 mm thick)
             for the carbon disintegration background subtraction.
            The targets were positioned on the distance ~2 m from
             the photon collimator at angle 60 deg to the photon
             beam direction.
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SISD) Protons were detected by a CsI/SSD
            telescope placed under angle theta(p)= 90 deg to the
            beam axis.
           It consisted of two identical single-sided Si strip
            detectors and a CsI(Tl) counter, which functioned as
            delta E and E detectors, respectively.
           The SSDs had a thickness of 0.5 mm and 64 strips,
            which were paralleled in groups of two for the
            read-out, thus yielding an effective strip width of
            2 mm.
           The CsI(Tl) detector was of cylinder shape of 12.5 cm
            in diameter and 10 cm long. Its angular acceptance
            (+/-14 deg FWHM) was determined by Monte Carlo
            simulation using the GEANT-4 package.
           The proton detection threshold was Eth=18 MeV that
            corresponded to the photon energy of Eg=40 MeV for
            the d(g,p)n reaction.
