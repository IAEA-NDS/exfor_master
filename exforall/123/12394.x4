METHOD     (BGCT) A gold foil was irradiated in the 0.10 eV
           neutron beam directly behind the 235U foil whose
           fission counting rate was observed. The absolute
           activity of the gold foil was determined by
           comparison beta counting in a proportional counter
           with an identical gold foil which was irradiated in a
           thermal neutron beam and whose absolute activity was
           determined by beta-gamma coincidence counting. The
           235U fission cross section at 0.0253 eV is obtained
           from the previously determined shape of the fission
           cross section and the assumed 197Au capture cross
           section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Include statistical uncertainty, gold
           cross section uncertainty and the weight of the
           fission foil uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) Statistical analysis uncertainty.
