TITLE      A determination of the ratio of capture to fission
            cross section of U-233.
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) NRU reactor.
SAMPLE     Each sample contained about 1.5 grams of U-233 alloyed
           with 57 grams of superpure aluminum. The alloys were in
           the form of cylinders 1.5 cm diam., 12 cm long and were
           sheathed in aluminum.
INC-SPECT   Reactor spectrum.R=0.022+-0.004 and T=40 degr(C)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty quoted includes only
            * the errors in the measured alpha,
            * epithermal parameter
            * quoted uncertainties in the cross sections

STATUS     (DEP,12350002) The 2200 m/sec value of alpha0  was
            derived from the measured alpha.
ANALYSIS   Calculated from reactor spectrum averaged value, using
            g-factors and cross sections of Westcott, 1964.
HISTORY    (20120521A) SD: Energy value corrected.
