INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
FACILITY   (CHOPS,1USABNL) Brookhaven slow chopper.
DETECTOR   (HORBU,BF3) The fission neutrons were detected by
           means of proton recoils in a suspension of ZnS in
           lucite. This phosphor mixture is molded in the form of
           2 in.-diameter "buttons" approximately 1.5 in. in
           length. A thin-walled BF3 counter, which gives the
           distribution in energy for slow neutrons.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight.
HISTORY    (19760804T) Translated from SCISRS.
           (19841005A) Converted to reaction formalism.
           (20180523U) BP: Updated to new date formats, lower
                      case. Corrections according last EXFOR rules
                       and Dict. Added doi, extensive experimental
                       details.

REACTION   (92-U-233(N,ABS),,ETA)
SAMPLE     The foil was made of uranium metal with 233U content
           greater than 90% and a thickness of 0.025 in.
MONITOR    (92-U-233(N,ABS),,ETA) Measurements were normalized to
           eta=2.31 at thermal energy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical accuracy of data points is
           about 1% from 0.01 to 0.1 eV; while fission cross
           sections errors are as large as 5%.
CORRECTION The corrections for isotopic impurities, scattering,
           and the departure of BF3 counters from 1/v were each
           about 1%.
STATUS     (SCSRS) Also shown in Fig. 3, page 183.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,ABS),,ETA)
SAMPLE     The foils used were made of uranium metal enriched in
           235U to a concentration higher than 90% and also
           contained minor amounts of 238U and 234U. Two sample
           thicknesses were used, 0.030 and 0.045 in.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,ABS),,ETA) The Brookhaven data are
           normalized to eta=2.08 at thermal energy.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,1.,3.) The statistical accuracy of data points
           varies from about 1% in the thermal region to about
           3% at 0.16 eV.
CORRECTION The correction applied to the data: departure of BF3
           counter from 1/v, about 1.2%; 234U and 238U
           impurities, about 3.5%; and scattering correction,
           about 0.7%.

REACTION   (94-PU-239(N,ABS),,ETA)
FACILITY   (CHOPF,1USABNL) Brookhaven fast chopper.
SAMPLE     0.033 in. plutonium metal sample was used, which
           contained over 90% of 239Pu and about 1% of aluminum.
MONITOR    (94-PU-239(N,ABS),,ETA) The data from thermal up to
           0.15 eV were obtained with slow chopper and normalized
           eta=2.03 at thermal.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The residual error is statistical.
CORRECTION The corrections for scattering and departure from 1/v
           are small (~1%).
