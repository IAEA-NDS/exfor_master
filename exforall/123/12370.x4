INSTITUTE  (1USAWIS,1USALAS)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAWIS) The Wisconsin electrostatic generator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were obtained by bombarding a
           lithium target by protons. The Li target had a
           stopping power of 25 keV at the Li(p,n) threshold.
           Most of the energy spread of the neutrons was due to
           the finite target thickness.
SAMPLE     The one-cm thick sample was used at energies below
           900 keV, while the 2-cm sample was used above this
           energy. Two samples of normal uranium were used, both
           circular disks, 1-3/4 inches in diameter. One was one
           cm thick and contained 0.0479*10**24 atoms/cm2, the
           other was 2 cm thick containing 0.0957*10**24
           atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The neutrons were detected by means of B10F3
           counter.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were computed assuming an exponential
           decrease of neutron intensity in the sample. Neutron
           energies were computed from the known value of the
           Li(p,n) threshold, i.e., 1.882 MeV. Neutron
           energies are taken as those half-way between the
           maximum and minimum value of the neutron energy
           spread caused by the finite target thickness.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The resulting statistical error is about +-
           0.7 barns at the lowest energies, +-0.5 barns up to
           one MeV and +-0.2 barns above one MeV.
CORRECTION The cross sections were corrected for background and
           for scattering into the detector (3%) assuming
           isotropic scattering. Diffraction scattering was not
           taken into account, nor could the increased
           sensitivity of the counter for inelastically
           scattered neutrons be corrected for. If only elastic
           scattering occurred, the correction for diffraction
           scattering would increase the cross by 7% at 500 keV.

METHOD     (TRN) The measurements were simple transmission
           experiments in a geometry such that the cross section
           for scattering through angles greater than 20 degrees
           was measured. The observations were carried out at an
           angle of 115 degrees with respect to the incident
           protons.
