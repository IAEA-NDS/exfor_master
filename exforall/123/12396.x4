INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T,D-D) Monoenergetic neutrons were produced
           from three sources for the present work. For the
           neutron energy interval between 40 and 200 keV, the
           Li(p,n)Be7 source was used with evaporated lithium
           targets of about 10 keV stopping power. Between 160
           and 350 keV, neutrons were produced by the T(p,n)He3
           reaction with a tritium gas target having 30 to 10
           keV stopping power. The source of neutrons for the
           range of 4 to 7.5 MeV was the reaction D(d,n)He3,
           which was produced by bombarding a deuterium gas
           target about 300 to 100 keV thick. Neutrons emitted
           in the forward direction were used from these
           reactions, except for the energy interval of 40 to
           120 keV where data were obtained at ll5 degrees from
           the proton beam direction.
SAMPLE     The samples of material which were used in this
           simple transmission experiment were 1 in. diameter
           cylinders of different lengths. The length of sample
           used at a given energy was governed by the fact that
           the greatest accuracy in cross section value is about
           60%.
METHOD     (TRN) Data for measuring total neutron cross sections
           were obtained from a good geometry transmission
           experiment in which samples were placed midway
           between a neutron source and counter 20 in. apart.
ANALYSIS   The cross sections were calculated in the usual way
           by assuming that the transmission varied
           exponentially with the thickness of the sample.
CORRECTION A correction for the neutron background caused by
           neutrons scattered from the floor, etc., was obtained
           by placing a paraffin or polyethylene shadow cone
           between the source and counter. The correction was
           only 1 to 3% above 400 keV. When the T(d,n) reaction
           was used, an additional run was made with hydrogen in
           the target to correct for extraneous neutron
           background caused by deuterons striking places other
           than the gaseous target. This amounted to less than a
           3% correction in the total cross section in each
           case. Small angle scattering from the sample into the
           detector was not taken into account since so little
           is known about this correction and since the
           favorable geometry used in the experiment would make
           the correction a small one.

DETECTOR   (IOCH) For neutron energies above 250 keV, recoils in
           a gas ionization chamber were counted. The gas
           counter was filled with hydrogen at pressures up to
           500 psi or helium at 700 psi. The helium-filled
           chamber proved to be more useful because it could be
           used from 400 to 750 keV without changing gas
           pressure, while the hydrogen counters required
           pressure reduction at low neutron energies.
