ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors shown for data at angle greater
           than 23. degr. are based on an assumed 5% error in the
           total cross sections for the carbon scatterer that was
           used as a standard in the supplementary experiment.
           At the ange less that 15. degr., the errors shown have
           been increased (somewhat arbitrarily) to about 8% to
           account for additional experimental uncertainties.

MONITOR    (1-H-PLE(N,TOT),,SIG)
           Similar to uranium measurements were performed for CH2
           scatterers at angles near 2. degr. Then multiple-
           scattering corrections were made by use of the known
           hydrogen and carbon differential cross sections
           extrapolated to the small-angle region. These
           corrections took account of the energy dependence of
           the multiply scattered neutrons. The corrected CH2
           results normalized to the corresponding theoretically
           expected cross sections (D.J.Hughers+,R,BNL-325,1955)
           were utilized to obtain final absolute differential
           cross sections for uranium.
