TITLE      Number of Neutrons per Fission for 25 and 49

INC-SPECT  The thermal flux which is available well back in the
           graphite block, using the cyclotron as a neutron
           source.
METHOD     The number of fast neutrons given off was measured by
           making a volume integral of the resonance activity
           acquired by indium foils and comparing this with a
           similar integral from a Ra-Be source of known output;
           the number of fissions was measured by counting the
           fissions from a thin foil on the face of a case
           containing the sample of fissionable material, and
           knowing the ratio of weights of material in the foil
           to material in the sample. The measurement gives a
           rather accurate value of the ratio nubar/Q where Q is
           the neutron output of Ra-Be source.
CORRECTION The self absorption correction was calculated on the
           basis of this average counting rate plus the
           assumption of an isotropic neutron flux around the
           sample. The straight-through self-absorption in the
           sample was about 11 percent in the worst case (round
           25 sample); it becomes larger when averaged over all
           angles, but is partially monitored by the detector
           foil, one side of which is shaded by the sample. The
           net correction was 5 percent for the round 25 sample.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Los Alamos notation uses 49 for
           Z=94, A=239 (239Pu) and 25 for Z=92, A=235 (235U).

SAMPLE     The 25 foils from material of the same isotopic
           constitution as weighing 25 samples (E-10 oxide).
           Direct weighing of these foils proved unreliable,
           apparently because their large areas encourage the
           deposition of impurities.

SAMPLE     For 49 the thin foil was made by transferring
           quantitatively an aliquot of the total sample on to a
           thin platinum disk. The value thus obtained was
           checked by comparing the fission counts from this
           foil with the fission mounts from a very small 49
           foil which had been alpha-counted accurately; and
           alpha-counting a very small aliquot from the total
           sample (note that the ratio is independent of the
           specific activity of 49).
