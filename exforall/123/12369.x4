METHOD     (TOF) The first type of measurement employed fast
           time-of-flight techniques to determine the
           differential elastic-scattering cross sections of
           U-235 at 10-keV intervals for 0.4 to 0.6 MeV.
           Measurements were made at 8 angles between 25 and 150
           deg with incident-neutron resolution of 20 keV and
           scattered-neutron resolutions of 25 keV. All measured
           neutrons within the scattered resolution function
           were considered due to elastic processes.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(N,SCT)6-C-12,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   (4PI1A) The measured values were normalized to the
           known differential scattering cross sections of
           carbon, corrected for multiple scattering, and
           expressed as a Legendre expansion.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The indicated errors represent relative
           experimental uncertainties and do not include
           possible systematic effects due to the normalization.

           Arbitrarily normalized to 1.25 B at 0.4 MeV.
METHOD     The second experiment determined the relative fission
           cross section of U-235 from 0.36 to 0.65 MeV. The
           measurements were made with an automated facility
           including digital computer control of a Van de Graaff
           accelerator and all requisite experimental equipment.
           The facility was programmed to determine the ratio of
           the response of a U-235 fission counter to that of a
           long counter with a preset statistical uncertainty
           and at specified neutron energies. The facility was

           specified neutron energies. The incident resolution
           was <=15 keV and measurements were made at 5-keV
           intervals throughout the incident energy range.
           Neutron emission angle was 15 degrees.
