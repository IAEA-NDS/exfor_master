TITLE      Energy dependence of Nu bar (p) for neutron-induced
           fission of U235 below 1.0 MeV.
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAANL)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The thickness of the lithium targets was
           adjusted so that the energy loss of a proton passing
           through them corresponded to a neutron energy spread
           of 0.04-0.06 MeV except at the two points near 0.04 MeV
SAMPLE     The fissionable material was spread uniformly over the
           plates that used as a fission chamber.The 235U detector
           contained 187 mg of uranium enriched to 96%; while the
           252Cf detector contained enough californium to give
           approx. 600 fissions per minute.

METHOD     Two fission detectors, one containing 235U and the
           other 252Cf, were surrounded by the neutron detector.
           Neutrons entered through the tapered collimator. A
           fission pulse started a time analyser which recorded
           the neutron time distribution in 1024 channels for
           1200 mu-sec after the fission. Two time distributions
           were recorded, one for fission pulses originating in
           the 235U detector and one for those originating in the
           252Cf detector (see REL-REF).

DETECTOR   (BF3)  The neutron detector consisted of twenty-four
           BF3 counters arranged in two concentric rings of twelve
           each and embedded in a paraffin cylinder 46 cm long and
           51 cm in diameter. A tube, 8-6 cm in diameter, passing
           through the centre cylinder contained the fission
           detectors. All surfaces of the paraffin cylinder were
           covered with 0.5 mm cadmium sheet. The measured
           efficiency of this detector for 252Cf neutrons was
           9.42+-0.07% occupying a region 4 cm long.
           (FISCH) The fission detectors were multiple plate ion
           chambers, each having ten plates and occupying a region
           4 cm long. The two chambers were separated by a plate
           thick enough to prevent the passage of fission
           fragments.
