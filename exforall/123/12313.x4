REL-REF    (A,,D.E.Conway+,J,NSE,22,20,1965) The previous
           measurement.
INSTITUTE  (1USABET)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABET) Reactor MTR, (1-3)x10**14 n/cm2-sec.
METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP) Two 235U samples were under cadmium and
           two were bare. Six 233U samples were irradiated under
           cadmium and six were bare.
