           of the current measurements.
INSTITUTE  (1USABET)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABET) Beryllium reflector of the materials
           testing reactor with a neutron flux of 8*10**14.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.93) Two samples of enriched uranium
           6.3 wt.% in Zr in a form of 0.030 in. wire.
METHOD     (ABSFY,INTB) The capture-to-fission ratio, alpha, for
           the irradiation is equal to the ratio of the number
           of 236U produced to the number of 235U nuclei
           fission. The number of fissions can be determined from
           the post-irradiation concentration of 137Cs as
           measured by gamma counting. 236U concentration in the
           sample can be determined from mass-spectrometric
           analysis. Uranium samples were wrapped in Cd shield
           with a cut-off threshold of 0.51 eV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
