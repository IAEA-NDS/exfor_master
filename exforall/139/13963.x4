INC-SPECT  The neutron flux at the target position, without
           filters in the beam was measured to be 1.2 x l0**8
           cm-2s-l. With 15.2 cm of Bi and 30.5 em of quartz
           filters at liquid N2 temperature the neutron flux at
           the target is O.9xl0**7 cm-2s-1.
SAMPLE     D217O sample was prepared by burning D2 (1.2% H2) and
           170 gas (34.04% 160, 28.9% 170 and 37.06% l8O).
METHOD     (GSPEC,PHD) Normalizing the 1982 keV gamma-ray
           intensity to capture in 16O and to the 6255 keV
           gamma-ray due to capture in D2, the capture cross
           section for section for 170 was deduced.
CORRECTION The contribution due to capture in H2 recorded under
           identical conditions with an ordinary polyethylene
           target was subtracted out.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
