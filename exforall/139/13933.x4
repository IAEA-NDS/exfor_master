TITLE      Thermal-neutron-capture gamma rays from the
            reaction 207Pb(n,gamma)208Pb
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) High Flux Beam Reactor
INC-SPECT  External filtered thermal-neutron beam
DETECTOR   (GELI) GeLi. detector 20 cm3
SAMPLE     Natural Pb and sample enriched to 92.85 % 207Pb.
MONITOR    Gamma energies measured by comparison with known
            lines from H(n,gamma), C(n,gamma), 204Pb(n,gamma)
            and N(n,gamma).
            The intensities of gamma- rays relative to the
            intensity of the 7367.7 -keV gamma-ray were determined
            with the aid of an efficiency curve obtained in the
            manner described by Kane and Mariscotti.

CORRECTION Corrected for background: graphite sample was
            used to provide measurements of the background
            spectrum due to scattered neutrons.
