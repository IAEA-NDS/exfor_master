TITLE      Spin of the 398 eV resonance in 35Cl
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) High Flux Beam Reactor
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector. Ge(Li) detector at 46 cm from
            the sample at 90 and 135 degrees with respect to the
            incident beam. Efficiency was 10.7% relative to NaI
            at 1.33 MeV and a resolution of 2.0 keV at 1.33 MeV.
SAMPLE     CCl4 target of 306 g in a 10 cm x 15 cm x 1.3 cm in
            Al holder.
METHOD     (TOF) 48 m flight path was used.
CORRECTION A background free spectrum was obtained by
            subtracting the off-resonance components under
            the peak.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The major contribution to the uncertainty
            is the statistical error of approximately 10%.
           There is an additional normalization error of
            approximately 5%.
