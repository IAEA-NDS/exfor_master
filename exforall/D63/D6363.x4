SAMPLE     Targets of 203Tl and 205Tl of thicknesses ~175 +/- 10
           ug/cm2 and 155 +/- ug/cm2, respectively, with thin
            (~35 ug/cm2) carbon backing.
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SISD) A multiwire proportional counter, with an
           active area of 15.0 cm x 5.0 cm, followed by a double-
           sided silicon strip detector were used to record the
           ERs.
           A mylar foil 0.5 um thick was used as the entrance
           window of the MWPC in order to minimize the ER energy
           loss.
           The effective active area of the MWPC was reduced to
           11.0 X 5.0 cm2, due to foil supporting flange.
           The MWPC was operated at ~3 mbar of isobutane.
           (SIBAR) Two Silicon detectors were placed at 25 degree,
           with respect to the beam direction in the horizontal
           plane, for absolute normalization of ER cross sections.
METHOD     (ASEP) The ERs were separated from the background
           events using Hybrid Recoil mass Analyzer (HYRA)
           (TOF)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall errors in cross sections (<20%)
