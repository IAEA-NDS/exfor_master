FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC) The beam current ~ 100 nA was
           monitored from current integrator count rate.
SAMPLE     Natural 141Pr (Purity of 99.9%) having thickness
           ~3.32 mg/cm2 and aluminum catcher/energy-degrader foils
           of thickness ~6.75 mg/cm2 were prepared by vacuum
           evaporation technique.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector of (100 c.c.) high-purity
           germanium detector coupled to a multi-channel analyzer
           was calibrated using standard 152Eu gamma-source.
           The resolution of the detector was ~2 keV for 1332 keV
           gamma-line of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) A stack consisting of eight 141Pr target
           samples followed by Al degraders/catchers was irradiate
           for ~12 hours.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error in the measured cross sections is
           estimated to be (<10%)
           (ERR-1,,1.) foil thickness      (<=1%)
           (ERR-2,,5.) beam fluctuations    (<5%)
           (ERR-3,,5.) efficiency of the spectrometer due to
                      solid-angle effect     (<=5%)
