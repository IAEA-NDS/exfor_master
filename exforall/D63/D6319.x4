DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWPC) Evaporation residues were detected
           through a 15.2 X 5.1 cm2 multiwire proportional
           counter (MWPC) operated at a pressure of 3 mbar of
           isobutane gas.
           (SIBAR) Two silicon-surface barrier detectors were
           mounted symmetrically at angle 15.5 degree with
           respect to beam direction at a distance of 10 cm from
           the target. The detectors were used for beam direction
           monitor and cross section normalization.
METHOD     (TOF) Delta E-TOF for evaporation residue selection.
           (ASEP) Fusion cross-sections were measured using the
           Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer (HIRA).
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The experimental errors includes statistical
           error and HIRA efficiency error
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty due to HIRA efficiency
           determination (10%)
CORRECTION Energies are corrected for energy loss in the carbon
           backing and target half thickness.
