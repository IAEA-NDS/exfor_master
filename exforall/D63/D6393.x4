FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15UD Pelletron accelerator.
SAMPLE     A thin 68Zn target of thickness 370 ug/cm2, was
           prepared on 30 ug/cm2 carbon backing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier detectors with
           1 mm diameter aperture mounted at +/- 15.5 degrees
           about the incident beam direction.
           The detectors were used to monitor the beam and
           cross-section normalization.
           (MAGSP,MWPC) A position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counter, with an active area of
           150 x 50 mm2 was mounted at the HIRA focal plane for
           detection of evaporation residues.
METHOD     (TOF) Delta E-TOF for evaporation residue selection.
           (OLMS) Fusion cross-sections were measured using the
           Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer (HIRA)
CORRECTION Corrections for loss of beam energy in carbon backing
           and half target thickness
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors presented are the statistical
           errors and the uncertainty in estimating HIRA
           efficiency.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty due to HIRA efficiency
           determination (~10%)
