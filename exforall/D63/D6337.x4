SAMPLE     124Sn target of thickness 2.47 +/- 0.4 mg/cm2 used
           for online gamma measurement.
           124Sn having thickness in the range of 1.5-4.0 mg/cm2
           for offline gamma measurement.
DETECTOR   (GE) Two Compton suppressed clover detectors were
           placed at a distance of 25 cm from the target center,
           one at 125 deg, for absolute cross-section estimation
           of various reaction channels, and the other at 90 deg,
           for identification of unshifted gamma lines.
           (SI) A monitor detector (=500 um) was placed at 30
           deg. It was used in the ER cross section estimation
           using measured elastic (Rutherford) scattering cross
           section.
           (HPGE) The off-line gamma ray counting was done using
           HPGe detector. The energy calibration and efficiency
           of the detector were measured by calibrated
           radioactive 152Eu, 133Ba and 241Am sources.
CORRECTION The beam energies were corrected for the loss at half
           the target thickness
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) In off-line gamma-ray measurements the
           systematic uncertainties arises due to beam current,
           target thickness, detector efficiency and extraction of
           gamma-ray yield.
