FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15UD Pelletron accelerator
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWPC) A multiwire proportional counter, with an
           active area of 150 x 50 mm2 was placed at the focal
           plane of Heavy Ion Reaction Analyser.
           (SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier detectors
           provided with a 1-mm-diam entrance aperture were
           mounted inside the target chamber at a +/- 15.5 degree
           angle with respect to the incident beam direction to
           monitor the beam and to calculate the normalized
           cross section of ERs.
METHOD     (TOF) Delta E-TOF for evaporation residue selection.
           (ASEP) Fusion cross-sections were measured using the
           Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer (HIRA).
CORRECTION Energies are corrected for energy loss due to target
           thickness by subtracting energy loss at the half
           thickness from its corresponding incident projectile
           energy.
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors presented are absolute errors
           consisting of statistical error.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty due to HIRA efficiency
           determination (10%)
