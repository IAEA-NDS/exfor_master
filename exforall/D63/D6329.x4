FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC) The beam current ~ 100 nA was
           monitored from current integrator count rate.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector of (100 c.c.) coupled to a
           multi parameter CANBERRA system was calibrated using
           standard 152Eu gamma-source.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) A stack consisting of three pure natural
           gold 197Au targets was irradiated for ~12 hours by a
           collimated alpha-particle beam.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The overall experimental errors in the
           present measurements are expected to be < 10%.
