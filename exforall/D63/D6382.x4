SAMPLE     The sizes of zinc foils were 0.7 X 0.7 cm2 and
           0.8 X 0.8 cm2.
           A high-purity (99.5%) metallic form of natural-zinc
           foil (86-um thickness) with isotopic composition of
           64Zn (49.17%), 66Zn (27.73%), 67Zn (4.04%),
           68Zn (18.48%) and 70Zn (0.61%) was used as a target.
           Natural copper of purity > 99% and 103.45-um  thickness
           and natural aluminium of purity > 99% and 108-um
           thicknesses were used as monitor foils as well as
           proton beam energy degrader.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray activities were measured with a
           pre-calibrated HPGe detector connected to a PC based
           4096 channel analyzer.
           The energy resolution of the detector was 1.8 keV at
           the photo-peak of 1332.5 keV gamma-line of 60Co.
           The dead time of detector always kept less than 5%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The stack was irradiated for 10 min with
           proton beam energy of 20 MeV and beam current of
           a 100 nA.
           The irradiated stack was cooled for about 1.5 h.

ERR-ANALYS The overall uncertainty (7.7-9.6%) due to the
            following systematic and statistical uncertainties:
           (ERR-S,2.,5.) Statistical uncertainty in counting
           statistics estimated                        (2-5%)
           (ERR-SYS,7.5,8.2) The overall systematic uncertainty
            (7.5-8.2%) are due to  uncertainties in:
           (ERR-1) irradiation time                  (0.5%)
           (ERR-2) proton flux                       (~ 6.5%)
           (ERR-3) efficiency                        (~ 3%)
           (ERR-4,2.,4.) gamma-ray abundance         (2-4%)
