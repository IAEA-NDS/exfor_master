TITLE      Measurement of 58Fe(p,n)58Co reaction cross-section
           within the proton energy range of 3.38 to 19.63 MeV

SAMPLE     Natural iron foils of 99.99% purity, 100 um thickness
           and having size 0.7 X 0.7 cm2.
           Natural copper foils of 99.99% purity, 108 um thickness
           having size 0.8 X 0.8 cm2 used as energy degrader and
           monitor.
           The Al foil of 99.99% purity of thickness 108 um and
           size 0.8 X 0.8 cm2 used in the first position of the
           stack.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector coupled to a PC based 4k
           channel analyzer. The detector resolution was 2.0 keV
           for 1332 keV gamma ray of 60Co.
           The dead time of detector always kept less than 10%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The stack was irradiated for 30 minutes
           with a proton-beam of 21 MeV. The beam current was 28
           nA constant during the irradiation.

ERR-ANALYS Overall uncertainty (4.9-8.6%) is from
           (ERR-S,2.2,7.4) Statistical uncertainty in counting
           statistics estimated (2.2-7.4%)
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic errors (~ 4.4%) are due to
           uncertainties in:
           (ERR-1) Proton flux estimation (2.5%)
           (ERR-2) Irradiation time (~ 0.5%)
           (ERR-3) Detector efficiency calibration (~ 3%)
           (ERR-4) Half life of reaction products and gamma-ray
           abundance (~ 2%)

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-5) Uncertainty due to precission based on
            replicate measurements.
           Haladhara Naik (2019-04-04):
            The total uncertainty has to be propagated based on
           the overall uncertainty (4.9-8.6%) and precision
           uncertainty.
