FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Data were collected at the Los Alamos
           Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Weapons Neutron
           Research (WNR) facility, which provides neutrons in
           the energy range from 0.2 - 800 MeV
SAMPLE     Five stacked foils of natural Pb (natPb) angled 20 deg
           off the normal of the beam direction. Each foil
           measured nominally 5 cm x 5 cm in area and 0.475 mm
           in thickness. Sample was located at the center of
           gamma ray detector array.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)The GEANIE spectrometer consists of 26 HPGe
           detectors, 20 of which haveBGO active shields. Of
           the 26 Ge detectors, 16 are coaxial geometry with a
           dynamic range up to 4 MeV and 10 are planar geometry
           detectors with a limited dynamic range of 1 MeV.
           Only coaxial detectors were used in the experiment.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight method was used for neutron
           energy determination
