FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed the 88-Inch
           Cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI,SI)Scattered protons were detected
           using the Silicon Telescope Array for Reaction
           Studies (STARS) arranged in dE-E1-E2 configuration
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using Livermore-
           Berkeley Array for Collaborative Experiments
            (LiBerACE), which consisted of five clover-type high
           purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with bismuth-
           germanate-oxide (BGO) Compton-suppression shields.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Coincidence between protons detected in
           STARS and gamma ray, detected in LiBerACE was required
ANALYSIS   (SURGT)The aim of the experiment was to study
           possibilities of surrogate method for (n,gamma) cross
           section  determination. In analysis a simplified
           Weisskopf-Ewing approach which neglect spin/parity
           effects in nuclear reactions  was used.

STATUS     (UNOBT) Measured gamma ray emission probabilities for
           154,156 and 158 Gd are presented in fig. 7.  Cross
           sections presented in fig. 8 are derived from these
           probabilities using surrogate method. Cross section
           data are not final, since more sophisticated analysis
           is planned. Present results differ by factor of two
           from other experimental data.
