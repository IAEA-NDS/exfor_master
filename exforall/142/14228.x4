INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton beam with an energy of Ep=1912 keV,
           30 keV above the reaction threshold, was delivered
           by the Karlsruhe 3.7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
           with typical intensities of 100 to 150 mu-A.
           Under these conditions the neutrons are kinematically
           collimated into a forward cone of 120deg opening angle.
           Neutron source strength of (2-4)x10**9/s was obtained.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Induced activities were counted with a pair
           of HPGe clover detectors, each with a relative
           efficiency of 120%.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (COINC) To reduce background, activity of
           61Fe was determined also by coincidence
           counting of 297.9 and 1027.42 keV gamma rays.

REACTION   (26-FE-60(N,G)26-FE-61,,SIG,,MXW)
SAMPLE     60Fe contained in HCl solution was dried on a graphite
           backing with diameter of 6mm. Total number of 60Fe
           atoms in the sample was (7.5+-1.6)E+15, as determined
           by measuring the daughter activity of 60Co

                             DG,1205.07,0.436) Gamma rays
           297.9 and 1027.42 keV were measured in coincidence,
           therefore the given gamma ray intensity of
           1027.42 keV equals to that of 297.9 keV.

ANALYSIS   Maxwellian averaged cross sections were obtained
           by folding the energy differential (n,g) cross
           calculated using the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model
           with the experimental neutron energy distribution to
           obtain a normalization factor, which wass applied to
           the energy differential cross section. This normalized
           cross section was then folded with a true Maxwell-
           Boltzmann distribution at temperatures of
           astrophysical interest.
