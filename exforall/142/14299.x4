DETECTOR   (STANK,FISCH) A large liquid scintillator of high
           efficiency for the detection of neutrons. Neutrons are
           detected by cadmium capture gamma-ray pulses in the
           liquid scintillator. The detector consisted of a
           cylindrical tank 16 inches high and 16 inches in
           diameter with 32 DuMont 1177 photomultiplier tubes.
           The detector was filled with toluene loaded to 4 g
           per liter with p-terphenyl. It used a wavelength
           shifter of POPOP and was loaded with cadmium in the
           form of cadmium octoate to a concentration of 0.0025
           cadmium atoms per hydrogen atom.
METHOD     (COINC,PHD) A 45-microgram Pu240 sample was placed on
           a foil in a small parallel plate fission chamber at
           the center of the scintillator tank. A fission pulse
           from the fission chamber was used to initiate the
           process of recording the liquid scintillator output.
           By using 2.20+-0.03 for the average number of prompt
           neutrons per spontaneous fission of Pu240 the
           efficiency of the scintillation detector for fission
           spectrum neutrons was determined. The efficiency,
           alpha, thus obtained was, together with its probable
           error, 0.716+-0.012.
CORRECTION Corrections for finite resolving time and background
           pulses.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The probable errors attached to the
           emission probabilities in Table I were obtained by
           calculating the effect of independent variations in
           the parameters used in calculating the emission
           probabilities. The root sum square of the variations
           in the emission probabilities caused by one
           standard deviation in the parameters gave the
           standard deviation in the emission probabilities.
