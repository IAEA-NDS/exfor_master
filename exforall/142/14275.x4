TITLE      Cross section for the reaction 12C(n,2n)11C at 90 MeV

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the 184-in.
           cyclotron of the Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley.
SAMPLE     Polystyrene sheet with thickness of 5 mil.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)Four proportional counters in coincidence
           were used to measure recoil protons from paraffin
           sample for neutron flux determination. Detector used
           for activity determination is not specified.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) Neutron beam was produced by the action of
           190-Mev deuterons on a 0.5 in. beryllium target.
           Neutron beam emerged through an aluminum window in
           the wall of the cyclotron tank with flux density of
           the order 10E+6 to 10E+7 n/cm2/sec.
