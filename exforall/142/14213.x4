FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Collimated neutron beam of neutrons from
           BNL pile was chopped into series of 200 microsecond
           bursts by slow chopper and filtered by a 4 inches of
           Be maintained at liquid N2 temperature to eliminate
           neutrons of thermal and higher energies.
SAMPLE     Gaseous O2 sample in sample vessel with length of 3.5 m
           Sample vessel may be evacuated or filled to 10 atm
           with O2. Sample temperature was 296 K.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Neutrons were detected with a shielded BF3
           counter in a good geometry.Chopped beam was monitored
           by a BF3 counter placed in a beam obtained from the
           same region of the pile as the chopped beam. Monitor
           beam was filtered through the graphite.
METHOD     (TOF)The velocities of detected neutrons were
           determined by time of flight over the 5 m flight path
