TITLE      Spectroscopic study of 11Be through beta-delayed
           neutron- and gamma-decays of spin-polarized 11Li

INSTITUTE  (2JPNOSA,2JPNTOK,1CANTMF,2JPNKEK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANTMF) Radioactive nuclear beam facility ISAC
           of TRIUMF.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,HPGE)
METHOD     (TOF,COINC) Highly polarized 11Li beam produced by
           means of collinear optical pumping technique. The
           polarized 11Li beam (2x10**2 pps, P ~ 48%) was
           transported in vacuum and it was stopped on a Pt
           stopper foil where an external static magnetic field
           was applied to preserve the nuclear polarization. The
           Pt foil was surrounded by an assembly of radiation
           detectors placed in the atmosphere. The beta-decay
           asymmetry was measured by thin plastic scintillation
           detector telescopes placed along the polarization
           axis (theta = 0 and pi). The gamma-rays were detected
           by two HPGe detectors. The delayed neutrons were
           detected by two types of scintillation detectors. The
           neutron energies were measured by the time-of-flight
           technique in beta-neutron coincidence.
