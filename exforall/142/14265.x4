FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory Shielded Neutron Source
SAMPLE     Deuterated liquid scintillator NE232, encased in a
           glass cylinder of 4.2 cm in diameter and 6.4 cm high.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Central detector with deuterated scintillator
           NE232. Twelve side detectors with NE213 liquid
           scintillator with a diameter of 12.7 cm and a
           thickness of either 5.1 or 6.1 cm.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-D)Polarized deuterons were produced by TUNL
           Atomic Beam Polarized Ion Source (ABPIS),
           accelerated through an FN Tandem accelerator and
           directed on he gas cell filled with deuterium to 7.8
           atm. Polarized neutrons were produced via the
           2H(d,n)3He source reaction at 0deg. The entrance to
           the gas cell was a 6.35 mum thick Havar foil, the
           exit was a 0.50-mm-thick gold beam stop. The
           deuteron beam current reaching the deuterium gas
           cell ranged typically from 800 to 1200 nA. The
           energy spread in the neutron beam due to the energy
           loss of the deuteron beam in the deuterium gas and
           the Havar foil was 305 keV.
CORRECTION Data corrected for multiple scattering
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty included
             -statistical uncertainty
             -uncertainty in correction for multiple scattering
             -uncertainty connected with background estimation
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in determination of polarimeter
           asymmetry (added only in two of five runs)
