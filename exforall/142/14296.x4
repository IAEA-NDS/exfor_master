SAMPLE     The scatterers consisted of solid cylindrical bars of
           uranium metal, 3.0 cm in diameter by 35 cm long. Two
           enrichments were available to us, namely natural
           uranium (0.71% 235U) and slightly enriched
           uranium (0.92% 235U). The dummy scatterer was
           a bismuth cylinder of similar dimensions.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),,NU,,FIS)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The total intensity of the fast beam at the
           center of the detection system was about 2*10**3 n/sec.
INC-SPECT  A beam of piled neutrons 4 cm2 emerging from the EL.2
           reactor. The fast beam emerging at 90 degrees to the
           thermal beam is collimated by a hole 100 cm long by
           2.5 cm in diameter placed in a large tank of water.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The detection system consisted of BF3,
           proportional counters embedded in paraffin and placed
           along two circles approximately concentric with the
           axis of the beam. They were well shielded by
           additional water, paraffin, boron and cadmium.
METHOD     A beam of pile neutrons 4 cm2 emerging from the
           reactor strikes a 3 mm thick uranium converter plate,
           enriched to 20 per cent in 235U. The fast beam
           emerging at 90 degrees to the thermal beam is
           collimated by a hole 100 cm long by 2.5 cm in
           diameter placed in a large tank of water. Emerging
           from the collimator it passes through a cavity in a
           large paraffin cylinder containing the neutron
           detection system. Scatterers could be inserted in
           this cavity, along the beam axis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Random errors of positioning, counting
           statistics and uncertainties in the size of the
           systematic corrections.
CORRECTION Corrected for inelastic scattering and delayed
           neutrons, plus by extrapolating the intensity to zero
           235U enrichment.

INC-SOURCE (REAC) The total intensity of the fast beam at the

INC-SPECT  A beam of piled neutrons 4 cm2 emerging from the EL.2

           thermal beam is collimated by a hole 100 cm long by
           2.5 cm in diameter placed in a large tank of water.
DETECTOR   (BF3,FISCH) The detection system consisted of BF3,
           proportional counters embedded in paraffin and placed
           along two circles approximately concentric with the
           axis of the beam. They were well shielded by
           additional water, paraffin, boron and cadmium. The
           fission chamber used in the coincidence measurements
           consisted of 19 parallel plates of aluminum coated
           on both sides (except for the end plates) with
           natural uranium oxide to a nominal thickness of 1
           mg/cm2. The chamber was filled with a mixture of 95%
           Ar and 5% CO2, at atmospheric pressure.
METHOD     (COINC) A beam of pile neutrons 4 cm2 emerging from
           the reactor strikes a 3 mm thick uranium converter
           plate, enriched to 20 per cent in 235U. The fast beam
           emerging at 90 degrees to the thermal beam is
           collimated by a hole 100 cm long by 2.5 cm in
           diameter placed in a large tank of water. Emerging
           from the collimator it passes through a cavity in a
           large paraffin cylinder containing the neutron
           detection system. The coincidence rate between
           fissions occurring in a fission chamber placed in the
           beam and the secondary neutrons detected by the BF3,
           counter assembly. A fission chamber using natural
           uranium was used. The thermal neutron beam for
           inducing fission in the 235U of the chamber was
           obtained by replacing the converter plate by a
           paraffin block which scattered the pile neutrons into
           the collimating system. A simple mechanical
           arrangement made it possible to have either the fast
           beam, thermal beam or no beam.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Most of the experimental error is due to the
           counting statistics.
CORRECTION A small correction due to spontaneous fission in 238U
           was applied to the final result. A correction for the
           17 per cent fission fraction due to 235U with the
           fast beam was also applied. Finally, the result has
           been corrected for the degradation of the neutron
           spectrum in the beam. The the value of the overall
           correction for anisotropy turned out to be 2.0+-0.5%.

           detection system. The spontaneous fission of 238U was
           easily obtained by measuring the fission and
           coincidence rates in the absence of primary neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Most of the experimental error is due to the
           counting statistics.
CORRECTION Calculated or measured corrections for alpha-pile-up,
           stray thermal neutron induced fission in 238U,
           accidental coincidences, etc., were negligible, their
           combined value being under 1%.
