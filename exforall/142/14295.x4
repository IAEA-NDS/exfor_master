DETECTOR   (BF3) Two B10F3 neutron counters. The counters were
           6.4 cm in diameter and the active length was about 50
           cm.
SAMPLE     Metallic uranium: Freshly refined natural uranium
           metal was used in the form of seven flat strips 40
           cm long, 3.4 cm wide, and 0.45 cm thick.
METHOD     (ABSFY) The uranium was surrounded by paraffin wax,
           and in holes in the wax two B10F3 neutron counters
           were placed as shown, centered about 9 cm. below the
           uranium. This pile was built on a steel frame, the
           paraffin being contained in light steel tanks so that
           the whole was demountable. A lead absorber could be
           placed on top of the pile up to 25 cm in thickness.
           The neutrons which come from one fission event are
           slowed down in the paraffin and with a mean life of
           about 150 microsec will be captured in the paraffin
           or in the boron of the counters. Neutrons recorded in
           a suitable time interval after the nuclear event will
           therefore have a common origin. But because of the
           low efficiency of such an arrangement, only a few of
           the released neutrons will be recorded. The amount of
           uranium (8.05 kg) used was much too small to produce
           a substantial number of thermal-neutron-induced
           fissions in U235 by spontaneous fission neutrons
           slowed down in the paraffin. This was checked by
           surrounding the uranium with cadmium which lowered
           the counting efficiency without producing a
           significant effect on the final results. The
           measurements are considered to apply to U238 since the
           amount of U235 and other isotopes is known to be less
           than 1% and their spontaneous fission rate is too
           small to contribute appreciably.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION Corrections were also necessary for accidental counts
           and for dead times of the circuits wherever they
           applied.
