REFERENCE  (J,NIM/A,614,468,2010)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Experiment performed at the WNR facility
           of the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Thin (1/4in.)and thick(2in.) fast-plastic
           scintillators BC-408 served as the stop detectors.
           The thin detector had a single photomultiplier
           tube(PMT) while for the thick one,two 2 in.-diameter
           PMTs (RCA8575)were connected on opposite ends of the
           scintillator.Signal digitization was performed using
           8-bit Acqiris model DC265 cPCI-based digitizer boards
           with 2 Mb or 256 kb on-board memory.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy was determined with
           time-of-flight method
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)A proton beam with energy of 800 MeV with an
           average intensity of 2 mA bombarded a tungsten
           target producing a white(i.e.continuous
           energy)source of neutrons. The proton pulses (referred
           to as micropulses)are less than 1 ns in width and
           were repeated at 1.8 mu-s intervals for a period for
           625 or 725 ms (referred to as a macropulse). The
           macropulse was repeated at 60 Hz, or every 16.7ms.
