REFERENCE  (C,2008MACKIN,(077),2008)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Experiment performed at white neutron
           source of the Lujan Center, based on spallation
           reactions on a tungsten target using a pulsed
           800-MeV proton beam, accumulated in the proton
           storage ring.
SAMPLE     Two samples were used 1. Selfsupporting natural Lu
           metalic foil with diameter of 25 mm and thickness of
           31 mg/cm2 2. Mass separator deposited 176Lu sample
           with diameter of 7 mm and thickness of 1 mg/cm2 on 1
           mu-m aluminized mylar foil
DETECTOR   (BAF2) 4PI gamma-detector array DANCE, composed of
           160 BaF2 scintillators.DANCE provides the total
           g-ray calorimetry and the multiplicity information
           of the g-cascade following neutron capture. DANCE is
           located on a 20 m flight path.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy determined by time of
           flight.
MONITOR    (71-LU-176(N,G)71-LU-177,,SIG) Preliminary data
           normalized to the thermal cross section of (2020)+-70 b

            Atlas of Neutron Resonances, Elsevier (2006).
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed 800-MeV proton beam impinging on W
           target. The bunch length was 200 ns and the
           repetition rate 20 Hz. Sample and detector placed at
           a distance of 20 m.
