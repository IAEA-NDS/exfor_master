FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK)The experiment was performed at the
           88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National
           Laboratory.
SAMPLE     The 171Yb target with an areal density of 981 mu-g/cm2.
           The 173Yb target with an areal density of 502 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI,SI)The outgoing reaction particles were
           detected with an array of annular segmented silicon
           detectors Silicon Telescope Array for Reaction
           Studies. The array consisted of three double-sided
           silicon detectors located downstream of the target.
           The arrangement of the detectors consisted of a thin
           500 mu-m dE detector and two thick 1000 mu-m stopping
           detectors, allowing for particle identification.
           Forward angles from 44deg to 77deg were covered.
           (HPGE) Six compton suppressed HPGe clover detectors
           from Livermore Berkeley Array for Collaborative
           Experiments were used to detect gamma radiation in
           coincidence with particles.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Coincidence required between charged
           particles and gamma rays.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty. Lowest
           energy bin includes a considerable amount of events
           from below the neutron separation energy due to the
           detector resolution being approximately 100 keV FWHM.

ANALYSIS   (SURGT) Surrogate technique utilizing
                   171Yb(d,pg)172Yb  and
                   173Yb(d,pg)174Yb reactions was used. Cross
           section ratio of 4+ -> 2+ transitions in 172YB
           and 174YB was determined experimentally
CORRECTION Corrected for contribution from 6+ -> 4+ transition
