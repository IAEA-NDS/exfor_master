TITLE      Mass-spectroscopic search for neon and argon
           isotopes in ternary fission of 235U
AUTHOR     (G.Kugler,W.B.Clarke)

REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,3,849,1971)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANMCM) McMaster reactor with thermal neutron
           flux  approx. 1.5E+13 n/(cm2 sec)
           (SPECM,1CANMCM)
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9218)
           Samples of U3O8 enriched to 92.18% in 235U weighting
           from 1 to 9 mg. Samples were purified by heating to
           1500 deg C under high vacuum for several hours.
           After purification samples were sealed under high
           vacuum in quartz vials and irradiated.
METHOD     (CHSEP,MASSP) Neon and argon isotopes were separated
           from more abundant Kr and Xe using a selective
           adsorption properties of inert gases on columns of
           activated charcoal. Analysis of fission product
           gases was carried out on a 10 in. radius first-order
           direction focussing mass spectrometer
