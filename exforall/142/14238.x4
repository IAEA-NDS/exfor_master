FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKFK)Experiment was carried out at the
           Karlsruhe 3.7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
SAMPLE     A sample of calcium carbonate (152.6 mg CaCO3) with
           natural isotopic abundance 96.941% of 40Ca was used
           in this measurement. The sample material was pressed
           into a thin pellet 8 mm in diameter, enclosed in 15
           mu-m thick aluminium foil, and sandwiched between
           two 30 mu-m thick gold foils of the same diameter.

METHOD     (ACTIV) Monitor reaction was measured by activation.
           (AMS)In addition to activation measurements, the number
           of 41Ca nuclei produced in the neutron activation was
           measured offline applying the technique of accelerator
           mass spectrometry (AMS) at the VERA (Vienna
           Environmental Research Accelerator) facility.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron flux variation during activation
           was applied.

ANALYSIS   Maxwelian averaged cross sections were calculated
           from experimental values measured at 30 keV using
           energy dependency of evaluated cross sections.
           Small correction for deviation from true Maxwellian
           spectrum in experiment was applied.
CORRECTION Correction for true Maxwellian spectrum applied
