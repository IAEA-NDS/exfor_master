SAMPLE     (20-CA-40,NAT=0.96941)
           A sample of calcium carbonate (152.6 mg CaCO3) with
            natural isotopic abundance 96.941% of 40Ca was used
            in this measurement.
           The sample material was pressed into a thin pellet
            8 mm in diameter, enclosed in 15 um thick Al foil,
            and sandwiched between two 30 um thick Au foils of
            the same diameter.

METHOD     (ACTIV) Monitor reaction was measured by activation.
           (AMS)In addition to activation measurements, the number
            of 41Ca nuclei produced in the neutron activation was
            measured offline applying the technique of accelerator
            mass spectrometry (AMS) at the VERA (Vienna
            Environmental Research Accelerator) facility.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron flux variation during activation
            was applied.

ANALYSIS   Maxwelian averaged cross sections were calculated
           from experimental values measured at 30 keV using
           energy dependency of evaluated cross sections.
           Small correction for deviation from true Maxwellian
           spectrum in experiment was applied.
CORRECTION Correction for true Maxwellian spectrum applied
