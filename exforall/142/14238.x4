SAMPLE     (20-CA-40,NAT=0.96941) A sample of calcium carbonate
            (152.6 mg CaCO3) with natural isotopic abundance
           96.941% of 40Ca was used in this measurement. The
           sample material was pressed into a thin pellet 8 mm
           in diameter, enclosed in 15 microm thick Al foil, and
           sandwiched between two 30 microm thick Au foils of
           the same diameter.

METHOD     (ACTIV) Monitor reaction was measured by activation.
           (AMS) In addition to activation measurements, the
           number of 41Ca nuclei produced in the neutron
           activation was measured offline applying the
           technique of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at
           the VERA (Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator)
           facility.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron flux variation during activation
            was applied.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The Karlsruhe group original
           result was based on its own 197Au(n,gamma) cross
           section by Ratynski and Kaeppeler, Phys.Rev. C37, 595
            (1988), EXFOR entry #22099 for neutron beam monitor
           that later was proven as deficient.
           Kaeppeler and Reifarth comment: cross section value in
           entry 14238 is renormalized
           a) for new gold cross section
           b) note that the quoted neutron energies refer to the
           lab system; effective energies in the c.m. system have
           to be reduced by 40/41

ANALYSIS   Maxwellian averaged cross sections were calculated
           from experimental values measured at 30 keV using
           energy dependency of evaluated cross sections.
           Small correction for deviation from true Maxwellian
           spectrum in experiment was applied.
CORRECTION Original data: Correction for true Maxwellian spectrum
           applied
           Revised data: Measured quantity: Correction for revised
            gold standard 622.7/586 = 1.0626
