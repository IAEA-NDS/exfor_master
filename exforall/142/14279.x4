FACILITY   (REAC,1USAGEV) General Electric Test Reactor,
           Vallecitos, California.
INC-SPECT  The energy spectrum consists principally of thermal
           neutrons in this well-moderated reactor.
SAMPLE     The 155Fm target material was separated from its
           parent the beta emitter 255Es, which was present in
           an einsteinium fraction of the following composition:
           1.0 microg 253Es, 3.4x10**-5 microg 255Es. The
           fermium was separated from the einsteinium by elution
           from a column Dowex-50 resin with 0.4 M ammonium
           alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate solution, pH = 3.85 at 85
           degrees C. The target composition at the start of the
           irradiation was 1.43x10**9 atoms 2SSFm and
           1.21x10**10 atoms 253Es. The 253Es was present in the
           target as a contaminant because of incomplete
           chemical purification of the fermium.

METHOD     (INTB,CHSEP) The total neutron exposure was 6 h at an
           average flux of 8.6x10**13 n/cm2 sec, which was
           determined by the activation of a cobalt wire. The
           flux measurement is estimated to be accurate to +-
           10%. After removal from the reactor, the target was
           dissolved in 80% HCI - 20% ethanol solution and
           treated to remove fission products. This solution was
           saturated with HCl gas and loaded directly onto a
           Dowex-50x12 (colloidal form) ion-exchange column.
           Elution of the column with HCl-ethanol solution
           resulted in the purification of the combined
           einsteinium and fermium fraction from most fission
           products, particularly the rare earths. The decay of
           spontaneous fissions in the sample was measured by
           counting in an ionization chamber with the amplifier
           biased to record fission events only. In order to
           calculate the neutron capture cross section of 255Fm,
           the following cross section estimates were assumed
           sigma(n,fission) = 200 b; for 256Fm,
           sigma(n,destruction) = 20 b. However, the calculation
           is insensitive to the values assumed since
           neutron-induced reactions account for only 2% of the
           destruction of 25SFm during the irradiation; the
           remainder is due to alpha decay. In the case of 256Fm,
           neutron-induced reactions account for < 10**-4 of the
           destruction rate as compared to the 157 min decay.

ANALYSIS   Cross section estimate: The general trend for neutron
           capture cross sections is to decrease with an
           increase in mass number for isotopes of a given
           element on the neutron excess side of stability. An
           odd-even effect is also seen, e.g. the odd-mass
           fermium isotopes have capture cross sections somewhat
           higher than neighboring even-mass isotopes. Thus, we
           may conclude that the capture cross section of 257Fm
           for a well-thermalized reactor spectrum is less than
           30 b.
