SAMPLE     The copper and aluminum samples and the empty can
           used to derive the net 235U and manganese
           reactivities were unaltered. The same 252Cf source
           was used. The amounts of uranium and manganese-copper
           alloy were increased approximately fourfold, to
           compensate partially for the reduced signal caused by
           the absence of thermalneutron effects. These new
           samples were all 12.7 x 2.5 cm, with These new
           samples were all 12.7 x 2.5 cm, with thicknesses of
           0.005 cm for the uranium and 0.015 cm for the
           manganese - copper. The oscillated uranium sample
           weighed 2.7247 g and the four uranium samples used
           for the absolute fission-rate determination were all
           within 1.2% of this mass. The four manganese - copper
           samples which were first oscillated and subsequently
           irradiated ranged from 3.4 to 4.2 g.
METHOD     (MANGB) The experimental procedure requires the
           measurement of 1) the relative reactivities rhoi of
           samples of 235U, 252Cf, and manganese; 2) the
           absolute capture rate for manganese RMn, and fission
           rate for 235U, R25f; and 3) the spontaneous neutron
           emission rate S for the 252Cf sample. The manganese
           and 252Cf are used to establish the importance of
           absorbed and fission neutrons, respectively. The only
           additional information required is the number of
           neutrons per 235U fission, nu25. When the results are
           normalized to the same power level, the effective
           capture-to-fission ratio:
           alpha=(RMn/rhoMn)(rho25/R25f - (nu25*rhoCh/S))-1.
