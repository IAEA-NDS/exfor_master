INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Argonne heavy water reactor, CP-5.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) CP-5 reactor neutron flux was ~2*10**13
           neutrons cm-2 sec-1.
DETECTOR   (GELI,PROPC)
METHOD     (CHSEP,BSPEC) Neutron irradiations were made in the
           large pneumatic tube (rabbit) of the Argonne heavy
           water reactor, CP-5. After an irradiation or
           collection period the catcher foils were either
           counted in a standard position of a Ge(Li) gamma-ray
           spectrometer or dissolved (in HCl or NaOH for
           aluminum and in HClO4-HNO3 for polyethylene) in the
           presence of carriers for the fission product
           elements. The fission products were isolated using
           conventional radiochemical techniques and counted in
           a beta proportional counter with a low background.
           Fission yields were calculated from the measure
           activities using the appropriate Bateman equations to
           correct for growth and decay.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: This publication contains an
           extensive review of many measurements that could be
           found in EXFOR entries 10516, 10642, 13340, 13454.
           Only 249Cf (n,f) results were not published elsewhere.

REACTION   (98-CF-249(N,F),,NU)
ANALYSIS   Derived from the mean masses (first moments) of the
           light and heavy mass groups (AL and AH) as nubar =
           AF-(AL+AH), where AF is the mass of the compound
           nucleus for the particular fissioning system.
