REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,NU,,MXW) Fission Counter #1.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Argonne CP-5 reactor thermal column.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission counter.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)(1.185+-0.007)*10**6 neutrons/sec.
METHOD     (MANGB,COINC) The basic equipment for Phase I
           consists of a fission counter containing material
           which either fissions spontaneously or can be induced
           to fission, a fast-acting neutron detector, and
           electronic circuitry to record the number of single
           and coincident events. Phase II consists of separate
           measurement of the absolute neutron rate sing the
           manganese bath. Adequate source rate is obtained by
           adding a "booster foil" consisting of additional
           enriched uranium place in the umbral region of the
           chamber coating. The 235U fission counter and booster
           are concentric hemispheres.
ANALYSIS   The final computation for the neutron yield is a
           simple division of the normalized neutron rate in
           Phase II and the normalized fission rate of Phase I,
           separately determined for each of the fission counters.

ANALYSIS   The two values have been equally weighted in
           averaging together, since 3.3% spread, which exceeds
           the standard deviation assigned to each individual
           counter, is probably dominated by discrepancies
           associated with orientation of each fission counter,
           an effect with equal a priori likelihood.

DETECTOR   (FISCH)  Hemispherical foil counter.
METHOD     (MANGB,COINC) The absence of reactor-induced neutron
           background in the manganese bath favors the
           californium measurements. Roughly half of a microgram
           of 252Cf was deposited on a platinum disk used as one
           electrode of parallel-plate fission chamber. The
           geometry of the hemispherical counter does not permit
           application of a simple theory (precise evaluation of
           the fission rate), but its relatively high efficiency
            (90%) suggests an extrapolation can be made to a
           neutron detector with 2pi solid angle.
           The neutron intensity was 7.277*10 n/sec (+-0.7%).

DETECTOR   (FISCH) Flat foil chamber.
METHOD     (MANGB,COINC) The absence of reactor-induced neutron
           background in the manganese bath favors the
           californium measurements. Roughly half of a microgram
           of 252Cf was deposited on a platinum disk used as one
           electrode of parallel-plate fission chamber. The
           strong correlation between fragment and neutron
           emission results in a variation in a fission rate
           determined by the coincidence method according to the
           angle between the fission foil axis and the neutron
           detector normal. A simple theory allows a relatively
           precise evaluation of the fission rate from these
           data.
           The neutron intensity was 5.15*10**5 n/sec (+-1.8%).

ANALYSIS   The neutron yield per fission is calculated from the
           data separately for the hemispherical counter and
           flat foil chamber. The two results are weighted with
           inverse variances.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) It was decided to increase 0.1% standard
           error obtained in the angular scan to 0.5%, providing
           an over-all weighted error in the fission rate of
           0.4%. All quoted errors are one standard deviation.
