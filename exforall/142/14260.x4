SAMPLE     Enriched metallic foils
              171Yb with thickness of 982mu-g/cm2
              173Yb with thickness of 502mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Array of annular segmented silicon
           detectors STARS was used to detect charged particles.
           STARS consisted of three large area Si detectors
           dE detector of 500 mu-m thickness for particle
           identification and two 1000 mu-m  detectors for total
           energy determination. Each detector is separated into
           48 rings in front and 16 sectors in the  back for
           measurement of particle emission angle. Forward angles
           from 44deg to 77 deg relative to the beam axis were
           covered.
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using 6 high purity
           germaniun clover detectors of the LiBerACE array
METHOD     (EDE) for proton identification
           (COINC) Coincidence of emitted protons with
           prompt gamma rays was required

ANALYSIS   (SURGT)Measured proton energy was used to determine
           excitation energy of the final nucleus. Only part of
           the excitation energies, which can be obtained also in
           neutron capture reaction were analysed. Cross section
           ratios were determined from 4+ -> 2+ yrast transitions.
           To select the spin distribution closer to that of the
            (n,g)reaction, the intensity of the 6+ -> 4+ yrast
           transition was subtracted from the intensity of the
           4+ -> 2+ yrast transition.
