FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKFK)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Samples as well as in the gold foils was
           measured in far geometry by means of a shielded high
           purity Ge detector with 1.7 keV resolution at
           1.33 MeV gamma ray energy and a relative efficiency
           of 30%.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
INC-SPECT  The angle-integrated spectrum corresponds almost
           perfectly to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for
           a thermal energy of kT = 25 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in reference cross section
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in detection efficiency
           (ERR-3,,0.1) Uncertainty in g-ray selfabsorption
ANALYSIS   Maxwelian averaged cross sections were calculated
           from experimental values measured at 25 keV using
           energy dependency of evaluated cross sections.
           Small correction for deviation from true Maxwellian
           spectrum in experiment was applied.
