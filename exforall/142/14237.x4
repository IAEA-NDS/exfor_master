FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Samples as well as in the gold foils was
           measured in far geometry by means of a shielded high
           purity Ge detector with 1.7 keV resolution at 1.33
           MeV gamma ray energy and a relative efficiency of 30%.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
INC-SPECT  The angle-integrated spectrum corresponds almost
           perfectly to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for
           a thermal energy of kT = 25 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty in reference cross section
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in detection efficiency
           (ERR-2,,0.1) Uncertainty in g-ray selfabsorption
ANALYSIS   Maxwellian averaged cross sections were calculated
           from experimental values measured at 25 keV using
           energy dependency of evaluated cross sections.
           Small correction for deviation from true Maxwellian
           spectrum in experiment was applied.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The Karlsruhe group original
           result was based on its own 197Au(n,gamma) cross
           section by Ratynski and Kaeppeler, Phys.Rev. C37, 595
            (1988), EXFOR entry #22099 for neutron beam monitor
           that later was proven as deficient.
           Kaeppeler and Reifarth comment: Cross section value in
           entry 14237 is renormalized for new gold cross section.
