TITLE      Measurement of Ratio of Eta of Uranium-233 to
           Uranium-235 in the Reactivity Measurement Facility

           description.
INSTITUTE  (1USAPPO) Phillips Petroleum Company, Atomic Energy
           Division, Idaho Falls, Idaho.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAINL) The Reactivity Measurements Facility
            (RMF) is a low power reactor located in the fuel
           element storage canal of the Material Testing Reactor
           at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.
INC-SPECT  The correction to eta was introduced to obtained the
           Maxwellian-averaged eta ratio. This factor
           [(sigma/sigma m)U-233/((sigma/sigma m)U-235)]*
           [1-((sigma ef flux e)/(sigma f flux))U- 33]/
           [1-((sigma ef flux e)/(sigma f flux))U-235] where
           subscripts m, e and f denote, respectively,
           Maxwellian, above Maxwellian and fission, and sigma
           the effective microscopic cross section for the
           indicated energy region.
METHOD     (REAC) The RMF measurements were made on 46-ml
           samples sealed in polyethylene capsules. Dilutions of
           the 1-N HNO3 solutions permitted extrapolation of the
           differential reactivity to infinite dilution to
           determine corrections for self-shielding. The three
           experimental positions of the RMF used represent a
           range of flux spectra of equivalent thin 1/v-
           cadmium ratios from 28 to 150.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION The measurements were corrected for all known sample
           impurity effects.
