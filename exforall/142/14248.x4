           (R,INDC(GER)-0053,2021) Revised values of Karlsruhe
           cross sections.
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK,2GERMUN,2GERGSI,3POLLOU)
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)Measurements were carried out at the
           Karlsruhe 3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator using the
           activation technique
SAMPLE     The W samples have been cut from metal foil of natural
           composition and high chemical purity. Three
           samples with different diameter and thickness
           were used :
            Sample Diameter(mm) Thickness(mm) Mass(mg)
             1       10           0.05       81.41
             2        6           0.16       90.23
             3        6           0.11       59.02
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma activities were counted by means of
           two high-purity HPGe detector systems, a single
           detector with about 30% relative efficiency and a
           setup of two Ge clover detectors each with a
           relative efficiency of 130% in very close geometry.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The Karlsruhe group original
           result was based on its own 197Au(n,gamma) cross
           section by Ratynski and Kaeppeler, Phys.Rev. C37, 595
           (1988), EXFOR entry #22099 for neutron beam monitor
           that later was proven as deficient.

                      included Sub. 4-5 suggested by Kaeppeler
                      and Reifarth.
