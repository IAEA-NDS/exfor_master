TITLE      Investigation of the prompt-neutron spectrum for
           spontaneously- fissioning 252Cf

SAMPLE     252Cf deposit on a 0.0254 cm thick platinum
           disc of 0.953 cm diameter. The source strength was
           1.43E+5 fissions per second
DETECTOR   (SCIN)A gas-scintillation counter was used for the
           detection of fission events. The detector has a
           cylindrical shape with 16 cm height and a diameter
           of 22 cm. Neutron entry and exit windows with a
           radius of 13 cm at the top and bottom of the counter
           consisted of 0.0O36 cm thick Al foil. A mixture of 85%
           argon and 15% nitrogen was used as the scintillation
           gas. Four photo- multipliers were mounted on the
           outside of the cylindrical surface.
           (SCIN) Two liquid scintillation detectors with NE213
           scintillator were used as black neutron detectors (BND)
           Smaller scintillator with a radius of 7.62 cm
           and a height of 17.78 cm, and with a cylindrical
           neutron-entrance channel of 1.9 cm radius and 4.76 cm
           length was coupled to RCA 8854 photomultiplier. The
           larger BND was a cylindrical liquid scintillator with
           a radius of 10 cm and a height of 37 cm, and with a
           neutron entrance channel of 1.9 cm radius and 14 cm
           length coupled to four 58 DVP phototubes.
              Gas scintillation detector with 252Cf source was
           placed in a 4pi neutron shield built with lithium
           and boron plastic blocks. Neutrons were colimated by
           sophisticated series of collimators and after the
           flight path of  2.58/3.47 m detected by small/big
           scintillation  counter. Several shadow bars and carbon
           samples were used to determine background and total C
           cross section for normalization purposes.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Time of flight was used to determine
           neutron energy. Pulse shape discrimination
           properties of NE2123 scintillator was used to
           discriminate against gamma rays from CF source
CORRECTION Experiment was designed in such way as to minimize
           necessary corrections. Data were corrected for
             - accidental coincidences
             - shadow bar background
             - residual background between gamma peak and neutrons
             - dead time losses in stop channel
             - total fission fragment absorption (5%)
             - elastic scattering of neutrons in Pt backing
             - neutron backscattering to the BND (1%)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given, probably total
            uncertainty given.
