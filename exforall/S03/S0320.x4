FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The second Radioactive Ion Beam Line
            in Lanzhou (RIBLL2) of the Heavy Ion Research
            Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL)
INC-SOURCE 9Be(40Ar,28Si). A primary Ar-40 beam was accelerated
            to 400 MeV/nucleon at the main cooler storage
            ring(CSRm) and guided in the slow extraction mode to
            impinge on a 10-mm thick beryllium target. The
            secondary beam of interest was then transported by
            the RIBLL2 to bombard the reaction target.
SAMPLE     The reaction target was made of natural carbon with a
            thickness of 1.855 g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,IOCH,MWDC) Upstream of the reaction target, a
            fast timing scintillator detector and a multiple
            sampling ionization chamber sandwiched by two
            multi-wire drift chambers were installed. Downstream
            of the reaction target, there was a similar setup
            consisting of one ionization chamber and two drift
            chambers. The combination of two multi-wire drift
            chambers before and after the reaction target was
            utilized to determine the trajectories of incoming
            and outgoing particles. The Time-of-Flight and
            energy-loss for incident ions were determined on an
            event-by-event basis by the scintillator detectors
            and multiple sampling ionization chamber.
METHOD     (TOFDE) The particle identification for the incoming
            ions upstream of the reaction target was achieved by
            employing the standard delta-E-TOF-Bp method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) The statistical uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) The contamination from neighboring isotopes.
