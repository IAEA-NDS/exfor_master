FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and
            Nuclear Structure-2 (SHANS2) at CAFE2 in LanZhou
            China. China Accelerator Facility for Superheavy
            Elements (CAFE2).
INC-SOURCE The 55Mn18+ beam was acce1erated to 257 MeV by a
            superconducting linear acce1erator. The beam
            intensity was approximate1y 160 pnA.
SAMPLE     The targets of natura1 terbium 159Tb were 400 ug/cm2
            thick evaporated on carbon foi1s with a thickness of
            60 ug/cm2. Twenty arc-shaped 159Tb targets were
            mounted on the edge of a rotating wheel with a
            diameter of 50 cm and the wheel was rotated at 2000
            rpm during the irradiation.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear
            Structure-2 (SHANS2)
           (SISD) The ERs were imp1anted into a 300 um thick
            doub1e sided silicon strip detector (DSSD model BB-
            17) with a sensitive area of 128 x 48 mm2 The silicon
            strip width of the DSSD was 1 mm forming a tota1 of
            6144 pixe1s.
           (SI) Six 500 um thick side silicon detectors (SSD model
            W4) were mounted perpendicu1ar to the face of the
            DSSD. Each SSD with an active area of 120 x 63 mm2 was
            divided into eight 15 x 63 mm2 strips.
           (MWPC) Two multiwire proportiona1 chambers (MWPCs)
            mounted approximate1y 26 cm upstream of the DSSD were
            used to distinguish alpha decay events from the
            implanted recoils. The MWPCs were filled with
            isobutane gas at a pressure of 370 Pa.
           (SI) To minimize interference from scattered energetic
            light ions in the DSSD three silicon detectors with a
            thickness of 300 um and a sensitive area of 50 x 50
            mm2 were mounted behind the DSSD and used as veto
            detectors.
METHOD     (HEJET)The recoiled evaporation residues (ERs) were
            separated in-f1ight from the primary beam particles
            using the gas-filled recoil separator SHANS2 filled
            with helium gas at 0.8 mbar. The magnetic rigidity
            was set to 1.588 T.m.
