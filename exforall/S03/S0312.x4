INC-SOURCE The proton beam intensity was about 5 nA.
SAMPLE     Thickness of Au sample was 6.14 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A Clover detector consists of four coaxial N-
           type high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, each
           with a diameter of 60 mm and a length of 60 mm. The
           energy resolution (FHWM) was 2.2 keV for 1.332 MeV
           gamma-ray of 60Co. The detection efficiency of each
           germanium crystal was 38%. The efficiency of the
           Clover detector was calibrated using 152Eu standard
           sources and monoenergetic sources (137Cs, 241Am, 88Y,
           104Cd, 65Zn).
METHOD     (ACTIV) The sample was irradiated for 40 minutes,
           cooled 20 minutes.
