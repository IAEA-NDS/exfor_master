SAMPLE     The platinum disk containing enriched Te-124(99.3%)
           TeO(2) was fitted. The disk was covered with aluminum
           foil, 0.25-mm, held down by a clamping plate. An
           increase of the disk diameter from 10 mm to 20 mm
           increase the surface of the disk four time which
           reduces the power densities and allows a much more
           effective cooling.
           A 10 MM (Te-124) TeO(2) target disk, thickness of
            (Te-124)TeO(2)-191-mg/cm**2, was used for target
           yields in table 3.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK HHL) A Scanditronix MC40 Mk II cyclotron
CORRECTION  Correction for loss from the distillation was made.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The Bicron 400 plastic scintillator.
           (GELI) a co-axial GeLi detector for measurement radio-
            nuclidic purity. The system was calibrated for energy
           and efficiency using Eu-152 and I-125 sources.
           The radioactivity of I-124 was measured by an IG12
           ionization detector.
