SAMPLE     A polypropylene foil of thickness 50-mum and density
            0.896-g/cm**3 was used.
METHOD     (COINC) All the cross sections presented in this paper
            are those from the analysis of the coincidence
            spectra.

INC-SOURCE The secondary Be-11 beam was produced by fragmentation
           of a 65 MeV/nucleon 15N beam from the GANIL cyclotron,
           which bombarded a carbon target of thickness
            1.03-g/cm**2 located between the two superconducting
           solenoids of the SISSI device. The Be-11 beam was
           analyzed by the alpha spectrometer, which was operated
           as a fragment separator and had a 215-mg/cm**2 aluminum
           achromatic degrader to reject unwanted ion species.
           For the H-1(N-15,N-14)H-2 reaction, the N-15 primary
           beam was degraded in energy by a 745-mg/cm**2 carbon
           foil in SISSI to 584 MeV
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)  magnetic spectrometer (SPEG) (see Nucl.Instr.
             Meth. A276 (1989) 509-520)).
           Unambiguous particle identification was achieved
           through a combination of the energy-loss signal from
           an ionisation chamber, the light output from a stopping
           plastic scintillator.
           (IOCH)
           (SCIN) a thick plastic scintillator.
           (PS) The angles of the incident beam particles were
           measured event-by-event using two position sensitive
           drift chambers. The combined efficiency of the two
           chambers was approximately 88% for the Be-11 beam and
            96% for the N-15 beam.
           A position-sensitive microchannel detector was used as
           a diagnostic device.
           (PSSCN) The recoiling deuterons were detected in an
           array of ten position-sensitive sheet-resistive silicon
           detectors(CHARISSA). Each detector was 5*5-cm**2 in
           area and 500-mum thick.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Vibrational coupling model.
CORRECTION Data in coincidence with the CHARISSA detector were
           corrected for the variation of geometrical deuteron
           detection efficiency as a function of the heavy ion
           laboratory angle.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).Statistical error
           (ERR-SYS). For the four most-forward angle points,
            the systematic errors arising from the uncertainties
            on the angle determination in SPEG and in the CHARISSA
            detectors and on the variation efficiency of the
            detection system as function of the scattering angle
            are estimated to be of the order of 15%.
