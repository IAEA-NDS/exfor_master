SAMPLE     The targets of natural uranium, in the form of
            (N(H4))2U(2)O(7) with a thickness of approx. 1.5-mg/
           cm**2.
ADD-RES     The singles of the gamma-ray spectra of the thorium
           fraction separated from the bombarded uranium target
           is observed.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector has an energy resolution of 2.1 keV
            (FWHM) for the 1332 keV line of Co-60 and an
            efficiency of 30%.
INC-SPECT  *EN-RSL-FW*.The energy resolution.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) the Heavy Ion Research Facility in
           Lanzhou of the Institute of Modern Physics.
METHOD     (CHSEP) The chemical yield of thorium in the entire
            procedure was determined to be 70%.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The Th-236 isotope was identified by
           the characteristic gamma-rays of 642.2, 687.6 and
            229.6 keV.
