TITLE      A novel method for N.C.A. Cu-64 production by the
           Zn(d,2P)Cu-64 reaction and dual ion-exchange column
           chromatography.

           (J,ARI,64,1001,2006) Preliminary results
SAMPLE     An enriched Zn-64 target, isotopic composition -
           Zn-64 is 99.4%, Zn-66 is 0.39%, Zn-67 is 0.04%,
           Zn-68 is 0.15% and Zn-30 is 0.02%, was used. The foils
           used were of thickness 320-mum or 325-mum.
           The natural target material (several Zn-nat targets
           were irradiated for optimization of the experimental
           set-up and radiochemistry procedures) was natural Zn
           99.98% and Ti-natural 99.6% for monitor foils.
           Foils, together with a 30-mum Ti-nat monitor were
           placed in a standard aluminium target holder and fixed
           with a 0.7-cm diameter aluminium collimator.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP) The scanditronix MC-40 cyclotron of
           the joint research center, ISPRA, Italy.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Two of the three runs, of low irradiation
           charge, were used for radiochemistry. The copper
           isotopes were separated from other radionuclidic
           impurities by the combination of cation and anion
           exchange chromatography.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The origin of Na-24 and Co-58 contaminants
           can be explained by the Al-27(d,x)11-Na-24 side
           reaction on the target holder and the Fe(d,xn)Co-58
           reaction on Fe-trace impurity, respectively.
