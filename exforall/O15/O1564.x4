FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR) the Orsay synchrocyclotron.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Optical potential analysis.
SAMPLE     Two different targets were used.
           For laboratory scattering angles less than 30 degrees,
           a rectangular target 2 cm thick was set normal to the
           direction of the scattered particles in order to
           minimize the energy loss by the He-4 particles. For
           the other angles, the cylindrical target was used.
           For all angles smaller than 25 degree and at other
           angles for every second measurement, the background due
           to scattering on the Havar windows of the target was
           measured on an empty target with identical geometry.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN)
           Three different arrangements were used.
            -for Ang(lab) from 8.7 to 60-degree the protons were
           detected in the image plane of a magnetic analyzer by
           three telescopes, consisting of three plastic
           scintillators in coincidence with a large plastic
           scintillator.
            -for region from 60 to 120-degree was measured with
           the delta-E-E telescope was used.
           For scattering angles less than 90-degree(lab) a thin
           copper absorber was placed in front of the thick E-
           plastic scintillator in order to limit the energy the
           protons incident on the E-detector to less than 100 MeV
            -from 127.7 to 168 c.m. angles the p-He-4 cross
           section was measured by detecting the recoil He-4
           particles in the image plane of the magnetic analyzer.
           In order to minimize the detection of protons or
           deuterons with the same magnetic rigidity an absorber
           and veto counter were placed behind the three
           telescopes.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The errors are statistical and normalization.
           An uncertainty of 5% on the absolute cross sections due
           to the uncertainty in the proton-proton reference cross
           section has not been included.
