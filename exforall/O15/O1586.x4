TITLE      Cross sections for the formation of In-114-m and
           In-116-m on bombardment of cadmium by deuterons.

SAMPLE     Stacks of natural cadmium foils were used. The target
           stack was thick enough to stop the 27.5 MeV deuteron -
           external beam.
           Thin target foils were placed between aluminum foils.
DETECTOR   (GELI)) A high resolution Ge(Li) detector.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,3ARGCNE) the 60 inch synchrocyclotron of the
            Argentine CNEA.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV)
           (EXTB)
           (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY,AREA)
CORRECTION  No corrections were made either for the energy spread
           at each foil resulting from foil thickness variations
           or for deuteron energy losses at preceding foils.
           Losses of reaction products by recoil were assumed to
           be negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR,,1.) Maximum uncertainty in the incident beam
           energy was estimated to be less than 1%.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties in the cross section values
           were obtained by propagating in quadrature the
           contributions from peak analysis, including counting
           statistics and decay curve analysis, absolute detector
           efficiencies, disintegration schemes, target
           thicknesses and deuteron flux.
COMMENT    /by Compiler/
            1. To get presentation of cr.section in usual form,
           someone should multiplying values on the average atomic
           mass of target (in this case: 112.411)
            2. The authors indicated different the half-life for
           In-114-m  (54 min and 50 day), but according Nuclear
           Wallet Cards In-114-m has half-life equal 49.51 day.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The Cd-116(d,2n)In-116-M includes the
           contribution of 2.16 sec isomeric state due to the
           decay of the shorter lived precursor.
