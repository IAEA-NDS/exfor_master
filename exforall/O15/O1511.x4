FACILITY   (CYCLO,3SAFITH) The separated-sector cyclotron facility
            of iThemba LABS in Faure, South Africa.
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (BCINT) The beams currents were nominally either 50 or
            100-nA. The irradiation times varied between 1 and
            1.5-Hr
           (STTA)
           (GSPEC)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) The Al-monitor foils
           served as a consistency check.

           The cross sections of the observed activation
           products were calculated from their measured
           gamma-ray emissions using disintegration data
           from the catalogue of Firestone et al., Table of
           radioactive isotopes, version 2.1, january 2004.

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses
           during and after bombardment, as well as during
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured by
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic
           nuclear interactions were made.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to
            be about 7%, including-
           (ERR-1).The uncertainty in beam current integration
            is 3%.
           (ERR-2).The uncertainty in detector efficiency is 5%.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty in counting geometry is 1%.
           (ERR-4).The uncertainty in decay corrections is 2%.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainty in foil thickness is 3%.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties in the measured cross
           sections were obtained by summing all the contributing
           uncertainties in quadrature. A variable component
           includes the uncertainty due to counting statistics and
           photo-peak integration as well as the uncertainty
           associated with the beam-loss correction. The latter
           did not exceed 1.6%.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
            table.
           The uncertainty in energy of each measured data point
           was estimated from the uncertainty in incident beam
           energy, foil thickness and depth of penetration in the
           stack.
           (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table, which include a 7% estimated systematic
           uncertainty.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Since Ce-137-m has no precursors,
           excitation function is for its direct production only.
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses
           during and after bombardment, as well as during
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured by
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic
           nuclear interactions were made.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to
            be about 7%, including-
           (ERR-1).The uncertainty in beam current integration
            is 3%.
           (ERR-2).The uncertainty in detector efficiency is 5%.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty in counting geometry is 1%.
           (ERR-4).The uncertainty in decay corrections is 2%.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainty in foil thickness is 3%.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties in the measured cross
           sections were obtained by summing all the contributing
           uncertainties in quadrature. A variable component
           includes the uncertainty due to counting statistics and
           photo-peak integration as well as the uncertainty
           associated with the beam-loss correction. The latter
           did not exceed 1.6%.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
            table.
           The uncertainty in energy of each measured data point
           was estimated from the uncertainty in incident beam
           energy, foil thickness and depth of penetration in the
           stack.
           (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in

           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
