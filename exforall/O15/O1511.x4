            of iThemba LABS in Faure, South Africa.
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (BCINT) The beams currents were nominally either 50 or
            100-nA. The irradiation times varied between 1 and
            1.5-Hr
           (STTA,GSPEC)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) The Al-monitor foils
           served as a consistency check.

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses
           during and after bombardment, as well as during
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured by
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic
           nuclear interactions were made.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to
            be about 7%, including-
           (ERR-1).The uncertainty in beam current integration
            is 3%.
           (ERR-2).The uncertainty in detector efficiency is 5%.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty in counting geometry is 1%.
           (ERR-4).The uncertainty in decay corrections is 2%.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainty in foil thickness is 3%.
            in the measured cross
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties includes:
            * the uncertainty due to counting statistics and
           photo-peak integration
           (ERR-6) the uncertainty associated with the beam-loss
           correction and ERR-SYS.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in energy of each measured
           data point was estimated from the uncertainty in
           incident beam energy, foil thickness and depth of
           penetration in the stack.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Since Ce-137-m has no precursors,
           excitation function is for its direct production only.
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (BCINT) The beams currents were nominally either 50 or

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses
           during and after bombardment, as well as during
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured by
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic
           nuclear interactions were made.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to
            be about 7%, including-
           (ERR-1).The uncertainty in beam current integration
            is 3%.
           (ERR-2).The uncertainty in detector efficiency is 5%.
           (ERR-3).The uncertainty in counting geometry is 1%.
           (ERR-4).The uncertainty in decay corrections is 2%.
           (ERR-5).The uncertainty in foil thickness is 3%.
            in the measured cross
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties includes:
            * the uncertainty due to counting statistics and
           photo-peak integration
           (ERR-6) the uncertainty associated with the beam-loss
           correction and ERR-SYS.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in energy of each measured
           data point was estimated from the uncertainty in
           incident beam energy, foil thickness and depth of
           penetration in the stack.

COMMENT    *By authors*The data for the cumulative production of
           Ce-139 are reported. The directly produced component is
           almost negligible.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3SAFITH) The separated-sector cyclotron facility
            of iThemba LABS in Faure, South Africa.
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across
           the entire energy region of interest.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (BCINT) The beams currents were nominally either 50 or
            100-nA. The irradiation times varied between 1 and
            1.5-Hr
           (STTA,GSPEC)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) The Al-monitor foils
