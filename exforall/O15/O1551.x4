FACILITY   (VDGT,2NEDUTR) the 6-MV tandem Van de Graaff.
SAMPLE      82% enriched Sr-84, prepared in the chemical form
           SrCO(3), had the following isotopic composition-
            Sr-84    -   82.2%,
            Sr-86    -    3.7%,
            Sr-87    -    1.6%,
            Sr-88    -   12.5%
           The SrCO(3) was converted to SrO by heating. Four parts
           of SrO were mixed with one part of Al powder, the
           mixture was then pressed into pellets of about 5 mg
           each. For each target, two of the pellets were placed
           in a small tantalum chimney evaporation apparatus.
           The Sr-84 metal liberated was collected on
           a 20-mug/cm*2 thick carbon film. The film was then
           remounted on a Al target frame.
           Targets approximately 150 mug/cm**2 thick for the
           alpha and proton scattering experiments and about
            20-mug/cm**2 thick for the d-scattering experiment
           were produced.
METHOD     (EDE)
ADD-RES     SR-84(a,a') and Sr-84(p,p')spectra were observed.
           The a'-gamma and p'-gamma coincidence experiments were
           also performed.
