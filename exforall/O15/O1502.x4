ADD-RES    (COMP) The theoretical interpretations of the measured
           excitation functions were done by EMPIRE-II code.
           (TTY-C) Thick target yield was calculated from an
           integration of excitation function.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two high-resolution hyper pure germanium
            detectors.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3EGYCAI) The MGC-20 cyclotron

METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB) Beam current 200-250 nano-Amperes.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation time was 1 hour.
           (GSPEC) The activity of In-113m induced in the foils
           was measured 2-10 hours after bombardment, while the
           activity of In-114m was measured several days after
           bombardment to allow short-lived isotopes to decay.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,8.,9.) The uncertainty in the proton flux was
            estimated to be 8-9%.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty in the detector efficiencies
            was about 8%.
           (ERR-S,10.,25.) The uncertainty in the calculation of
           the gamma-ray count rates were about 10-25%.
           (ERR-4) The uncertainty in the decay data used was less
           than 1%.
           (ERR-5) The uncertainty in the coincidence losses was
           less than 0.2%.
           (ERR-6) The uncertainty in the target mass was about
            5%.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in each cross section was
           obtained by combining these independent (see above)
           uncertainties in quadrature.

SAMPLE     Targets of highly enriched 114-Cd-isotope were prepared
           by evaporating enriched cadmium metal on 10-mum thick
           Al-foil of 13-mm diameter and on 30-mum thick copper
           foils of 13-mm diameter. The sandwich samples
           Al+Cd-114+Al, labeled as CD1 and Cu+Cd-114+Al, labeled
           as CD2, were used for irradiation.
