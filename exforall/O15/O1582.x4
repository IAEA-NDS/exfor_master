METHOD     (EXTB)
             -the radiochemical separation of I-124 from
           natural Sb was by distillation of iodine using conc.
           sulphuric acid saturated with sodium nitrite as a
           solvent for the target, CCl(4) as a trap and 100 mug
           of KI as a carrier.
             -in the separation of I-124 from enriched Te-124
           target, the same procedure is used except that only
           sulphuric acid is used to dissolve the target. The
           distillation procedure takes about 30 minutes and at
           the end of this period over 90% of the I-124 distils
           into the CCl(4) trap. Finally I-124 is extracted from
           CCl(4) with 0.5 ml of 0.01 M NaOH solution.
           (EDEG) the deuteron beam of 20 MeV available from the
           cyclotron is degraded in energy to 15 MeV by using high
           purity Al foils. The energy window used for the
           production of I-124 is from 15 to 8 MeV.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           (HPGE) in the case of I-125 measurement. I-125 was
           monitored by comparing the ratio of the 28 keV iodine
           X-ray to the 35 keV gamma-ray of I-125 in a pure I-125
           sample and in the produced I-124.
CORRECTION  The data was corrected for decay occurring between
            EOB and counting times.
