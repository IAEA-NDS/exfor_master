TITLE      Experimental study of excitation functions for the
           deuteron induced reactions Zn-64(d,2P)Cu-64 and
           Zn-64(d,an)Cu-61 using the stacked-foil technique.

           (J,RCA,95,75,2007) It is o1508 and thick target yields
            for reaction Zn-64(d,2p) and Zn-64(d,x)
SAMPLE     Highly enriched Zn-64 target (99.4%) in form of discs
           were used.
           Titanium monitor foils of 30+-1 mum thickness were
           used to determine the integrated ion beam current on
           the stacked-foil target .
           A stack of five Zn-64 foils together with three Ti
           monitor foils was prepared.
           In order to avoid any losses of activity by recoil
           processes, each foil was enveloped by a catcher foil
           of pure Al of 22.5+-1 mum thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
CORRECTION  Dead-time correction was employed in the gamma-ray
           spectrometry chain.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP) MC-40 cyclotron.
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(D,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
METHOD     (STTA)
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC) The experimental cross-sections were determined
            from the gamma-ray spectra using the activity formula
            for thin foils.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.
            The cross section uncertainty was deduced by
           considering the uncertainties in foil thickness,
           deuteron current and uncertainty in activity
           measurement, including for Cu-64 also the uncertainty
           in the branching ratio.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.
