SAMPLE     The target consisted of self-supporting Al(2)O(3) with
           thickness of 350 mug/cm**2, was used.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3ISLWZI) The 14UD Pelletron accelerator.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,PS) One fragment was detected in a
           delta-E-E telescope. The delta-E detector was an
           ionization chamber with a window of 300 mug/cm**2
           thickness of Hostaphan.
           The residual energy was measured with a solid state
           surface barrier detector of 450-mm**2.
           The second fragment was detected by a fast, position
           sensitive detector system, composed of a bi-dimensional
           drift chamber and a parallel plate avalanche counter,
           providing the time signal.The detector had a window of
            300 mug/cm**2 thickness.The active area of the
           detector was 30*4 cm**2. The average angle between the
           small and large detector was 78-degree and it was kept
           constant in all measurements.
METHOD     (COINC) coincidence measurement of both O-16 fragments
           (EDE)
COMMENT    -By authors.The data were normalized relative to the
           Faraday cup reading. The absolute normalisation was
           obtained using the elastic scattering of O-16 on the
           Al-27 at 29, 45 and 65 MeV. After correcting for the
           average charge state in the Faraday cup, the
           normalization constants were consistent within 20%
           between the three energies.
           *By authors*.The double differential cross section
           vs Q is shown in fig.1 for different angles measured.
           The spectra are similar and show the following features
            -a peak at Q=0 MeV corresponding to the g.s-g.s
           transition,
            -a peak at Q approx.-(6-8)MeV corresponding to the
           excitation of one O-16 fragment into one of the levels
           of O-16 between 6 and 8 MeV
            - a peak around Q=-13 MeV corresponding to excitation
           of both O-fragments to one of the states around
           E-EXC=6-8 MeV,
            - a broad tail extending from Q=-16 to -20 MeV  is
           approximately the maximum Q value possible for this
           reaction and corresponds to a total kinetic energy in
           the final state close to the Coulomb barrier for two
           O-16 nuclei.
