FACILITY   (DYNAM,2GERBOC) The 4-MV dynamitron accelerator.
METHOD     (GSPEC) A new method is based on the use of a large-
           volume NaI(Tl) detector covering a solid angle of
           most 4-pi for photons emitted by target placed at its
           center.
           (BCINT) The current of the alpha-beam on target ranged
           from 6 to 140-nA depending on the dead time.
           The current of the proton beam ranged between 10 and
            100-nA.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The main advantage new method in using
           a large-volume 4-pi summing detector is that instead of
           measuring at least five gamma spectra at each beam
           energy and further analyzing numerous gamma transitions
           one needs to acquire only one spectrum and analyze only
           one gamma peak, the so-called sum peak.
           *By authors*.The center-of-mass energies given in the
           table 2 are the effective beam energies in the center-
           of-mass system
            E(eff)=E(beam)-delta-E/2, where E(beam) is the beam
            energy and delta-E the corresponding target thickness.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,NAICR) Gamma-single spectra were measured by
           means of a large 12 inches X 12 inches 4pi NaI(Tl)
           summing detector with a bore hole of diameter 35-mm
           along its axis.
           A solid angle covered by this detector for photons
           emitted at its center is almost 98% of 4-pi.
           The energy resolution of the detector was approx. 2%
           at approx. 10 MeV.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Hauser-Feshbach theory.
           A simple experimental procedure, called the in/out
           ratio method to determine average multiplicities of
           capture reactions producing compound nuclei at excited
           states in the continuum phase space was developed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross sections are
           of the order of 10%-20% , this accuracy reflects mainly
           the uncertainties in the sum-peak efficiency due to its
           strong dependence on the average multiplicity of the
           reaction of interest.
