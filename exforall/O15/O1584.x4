            Te-124(d,2n)I-124 reaction.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3SARSAR) the CS-30 cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (CHSEP)
SAMPLE     The Te-124 with 96% isotopically enrichment was used.
           The multi-plater has been used to produced uniform
           T-124 targets ranging in thickness from 0.92- to 14.4-
           mg/cm**2. Th first is copper plates, which have a total
           surface area of 98.2-cm**2 are electroplated with
            280 mug/cm**2 Ni. The second plates was made from
           Teflon.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Fig.3 depicts the expected result that the
           I-123 production yield is dependent upon the Te-124
           target thickness for the (p,2n) reaction. Each data
           point represents the average  for 13 to 59
           determinations, except the point at 30 muA which
           represents an average of five runs.
           The target thickness has a minor influence on the
           relative percentage of the I-124 radionuclidic impurity
           in the I-123 under the production conditions,
           principally due to the relative magnitude of the cross
           sections for (p,n) and (p,2n) reactions on Te-124 in
           the energy range studied by K.Kondo. See Rel-Ref.
