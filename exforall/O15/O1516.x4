REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,75,065803,2007)
           (J,PRL,97,122502,2006) It is O1399
            Cross section data at E=127-169-keV and activation
            method of measurements.
           (J,PR/C,75,035805,2007) It is O1520
            Activation method of measurements and E=105.6-keV.
            Details of experiment.
SAMPLE     Enriched He-3 gas, isotopic purity more than 99.95%,
           pressure 0.7-mbar, target thickness 8-10 keV, was used.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A 100-mum thick silicon detector detects
           projectiles that have been elastically scattered first
           in the target gas and subsequently in a movable 15-
           mug/cm**2 carbon foil.
           (HPGE) Prompt gamma-rays are counted with a  135% ultra
            low-background HPGE detectors shielded with 5-cm of
           OFHC copper and 25-cm of lead.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2ITYLGS) The 400 kV LUNA accelerator.
           The beam energy is obtained from a precision resistor
           chain and have 5 eV/hour long-term stability.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) Prompt gamma method
HISTORY    (20070716C)
           (20070716U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS Since the same beam and target for both method were
           used, some systematic uncertainties (beam intensity,
           target density and purity) cansel out in the comparison
           between the two techniques. See O1520 ERR-ANALYS
           for activation method in details.
           (ERR-SYS).The total systematics errors is 3%. See
            above.
           (ERR-S).The errors due to statistics-activity
           measurements.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The S-factors from the two methods do not
           show any discrepancy within the experimental errors.
           An extrapolated S(0)=0.560+-0.017-KeV barn is obtained.
           Branching ratios between the two prompt gamma
           transitions have been measured with 5-8% accuracy.

FLAG       (1.).The prompt gamma rays method.
           (2.).Activation method of measurement
COMMENT    *By authors*.For each couple of data(prompt gamma and
           activation) obtained at the same E(a), the effective
           energy, calculated assuming a constant S-factor over
           the target length, is slightly different. Indeed the
           target of the prompt gamma experiment, defined by the
           inner collimator, is a fraction of the whole target
           contributing to Be-7 production. The E(eff) difference
           corresponds to an S-factor change smaller than 0.1%.
