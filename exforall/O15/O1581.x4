TITLE      Influence of the giant dipole resonance in the
           statistical decay of the compound nucleus Er-160.

           (J,PRL,54,398,1985) the same reaction was studied with
                               a similar experimental setup.

SAMPLE     A 1.3 mg/cm**2 lead backed Nd-144 target was used.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR STR) MP tandem accelerator.
CORRECTION  Excitation and bombarding energies have been corrected
           to take into account the energy loss in the target.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) High-energy gamma rays(E(g)=3-20 MeV) were
           detected in lead collimated 25*30 cm NAI detector
           located 60 cm from target. A 15 cm thick polyethylene
           cone was placed close to the target so as to slow down
           fast neutrons which could be separated from gamma-rays
           by their time-of-flight. The detector was energy
           calibrated using the B-1(d,n)C-12 reaction at
           E(lab)=17 MeV. Its resolution for 15 MeV gamma rays was
           approx. 5%.
           (GELI) For the evaporation residues. Efficiency varied
           between 60-70%.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (BCINT)
COMMENT    -By authors.The relative normalisation of the gamma
           ray yield was given by integration of the incident
           beam current. The absolute normalisation was obtained
           from a comparison with results of reference second
           where the same reaction was studied with a similar
           experimental setup.
