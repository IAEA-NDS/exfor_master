TITLE      Mass distribution in 12-C induced fission of 232-Th

SAMPLE     Self supporting thorium metal foils of a thickness of
           approximately 2.0 mg/cm2 were used for the
           irradiations.
           Super pure aluminum catcher foil of a thickness of 6.8
           mg/cm2 was used to collect the fission products in the
           forward direction.
METHOD     (EXTB) 12-C beam at E-lab - 72 MeV.
           The current on the target was in the range of 50 to 100
           nanoAmpere (electrical).
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time was 30 minutes for short lived
           fission products and 5 hours for long lived fission
           products.
           (BCINT) An electron suppressed Faraday cup.
           (GSPEC) Activities of the short irradiation samples
           were followed for about three days and those of long
           irradiation for about three months.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) The experiments were performed at BARC -
            TIER 14UD Pelletron.
COMMENT    - By authors.  The experimentally determined cross
           sections correspond to fission products collected in
           the forward catcher foil as well as in the target.
CORRECTION The formation cross section of a fission product was
           obtained by applying a correction for the fission
           products emitted in the backward direction.  The
           correction factors, which are the ratio of total
           activity to the activity in the front catcher and in
           the target, were evaluated by the measurement of
           fission product activities in the catcher and in the
           target, separately.  The  factor for different fission
           products was constant within experimental errors and
           an average value of 1.81 was used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No any analysis is presented.

CORRECTION In order to arrive at the mass yields from the measured
           independent and cumulative cross sections of a given
           fission product were corrected for the contribution of
           the unobserved members of the mass chain.
FLAG       (1.) The cross section was determined from 141-Ba
           yield.
