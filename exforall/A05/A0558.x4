TITLE      Cross section for C(alpha,x)11-C at 0.64 - 2.8 GeV.

FACILITY   (SYNCH,2FR SAC) Saturne I
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (SITA) The targets were 3, 6, or 10 mm thick disks of
            NE102A or PILOT B scintillator plastics, 38 mm in
           diameter and polished on all sides.
           A carbon weight fraction of 0.9152 was used for both
           targets.
           (ACTIV) Exposures lasted from 5 upto 15 minutes,
           giving total integrated fluxes of 5.E+6 - 7.E+7 alpha
           particles.
PART-DET   (B+)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN,SCIN) To measure alpha beam intensity.
           Second scintillator was used as target.
           (SCIN) Irradiated scintillator from telescope.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The average calculated error in the C-11 from
           decay fits.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The C-11 decay curves were fitted to two
           components, one having a half-life of 20.39 minutes,
           the other a constant background, which was measured for
           the targets several days after irradiation, when all
           the C-11 had decayed.
HISTORY    (20030806C)
           (20040213U) Last checking has been done.
CORRECTION 1. Dead time correction;
           2. Deutron contamination;
           3. Neutron contamination;
           4. Secondary contamination.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-2) Random error. The error comes mainly from the
           counting statistics in determining the C-11 activity.
           (ERR-3) The systematic errors for each energy are 1.3%
           from neutron beam contamination, 3% from H-2
           contamination, 1% from the secondary production, and 1%
           for the C-11 counting efficiency in the target.
           (ERR-T) It is the arithmetic sum of the ERR-2 and ERR-3
MISC-COL   (MISC) Number of measurements
