           (970220U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Thin Targets were Prepared by Compressing the
           Necessary Amount of the Natural, High Purity K-Br.
            the Isotopic Composition of the Natural Bromine -
           Br-79-69%,
           Br-81-49.31%.
           Pellets  Thicknesses  were  Obtained  by the Weight and
           Area Measurement.
           the  Weight of Pressed  K-Br  Pellets,  Diameter  1.5
           Cm, Area 1.76 Cm**2, Varied Throughout the Stacked Thin
           K-Br Discs According to Necessary Energy Loss of
           Protons in Each Discs.
           About Twenty K-Br Pellets (0.2-0.6 G/CM**2) Were Placed
           in an Aluminum Target Holder.

DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE).Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
METHOD     (STTA)  See Sample.
           (EXTB) Beam Current had Been Kept at 70 Nanoampere.
           the Stacks were Exposed During 0.5 - 0.75 Hour.
           (GSPEC) The Stacks were Repeatedely Measured Over a
           Period of Several Day.
STATUS     (TABLE)   Table 1.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           the Total Cross Sections was Obtained by Summing Up in
           Squares All the Individual Errors

           4.  Conversion of Gamma Intensities Into Reaction Cross
           Sections
           and Amounted to 13-18%.
           Authors  Assumed  For  the Cross Section and Yields the
           Error 15%.
COMMENT    - By Authors - Proton Energy (EN) Is Average Proton
           Energy at the Mid Thickness of K-Br Discs.
