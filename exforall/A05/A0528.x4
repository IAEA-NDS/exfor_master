SAMPLE     Two piles of 7 neptunium targets on aluminum backings
            0.1 mm thick were prepared. The targets were separated
           with 0.005 mm thick aluminum foils.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF ABA) The MGC-20 cyclotron of Abo Akademi
           University.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Thick-target yield curves, based on the
           measured cross sections, were derived.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Main sources of total uncertainty are:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the thickness of the neptunium
           layer on the aluminum backing surface
           (ERR-2) The integrated charge of protons passing
           through the targets during irradiation was determined
           by means of a Faraday cup with precision of 5%.

SAMPLE     The thin neptunium targets, 90 ug/cm2 thickness,
           were used.
METHOD     (BCINT,ACTIV)
FLAG       (1.) This value was obtained by interpolation.
COMMENT    /By authors/. The activity of Pu-236 formed in the
           Np-237(p,n+p+d)Pu-236 reaction was determined
           separately by measuring the plutonium alpha-emission
           of the irradiated 90 ug/cm2 thick neptunium targets
           at 7,23,92 hr and at 2 months after the end of
           bombardment.

FLAG       (1.) This value was obtained by interpolation as the
           difference between the total cross section of Pu-236
           formation, measured two months after irradiation, and
           the interpolated value of sigma (p,pn+d) multiplied by
           W, where W is the known branching ratio of Np-236.
