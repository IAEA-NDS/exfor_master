SAMPLE     Two piles of 7 neptunium targets on aluminum backings
            0.1 mm thick were prepared. The targets were separated
           with 0.005 mm thick aluminum foils.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF ABA) The MGC-20 cyclotron of Abo Akademi
           University.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) Thick-target yield curves,based on the
           measured cross sections, were derived.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Main sources of total uncertainty are:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the thickness of the neptunium
           layer on the aluminum backing surface
           (ERR-2) The integrated charge of protons passing
           through the targets during irradiation was determined
           by means of a Faraday cup with precision of 5%.

COMMENT    /By authors/.the activity of Pu-236 formed in the
           Np-237(p,n+p+d)Pu-236 reaction was determined
           separately by measuring the plutonium alpha-emission
           of the irradiated 90 mug/cm**2 thick neptunium targets
           at 7,23,92 hr and at 2 months after the end of
           bombardment.
