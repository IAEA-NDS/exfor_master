SAMPLE     TWO PILES OS 7 NEPTUNIUM TARGETS ON ALUMINIUM BACKINGS
            0.1 MM THICK WERE PREPARED.THE TARGETS WERE SEPARATED
           WITH 0.005 MM THICK ALUMINIUM FOILS.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF ABA).THE MGC-20 CYCLOTRON OF ABO AKADEMI
           UNIVERSITY.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).THICK-TARGET YIELD CURVES,BASED ON THE
           MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS,WERE DERIVED.
ERR-ANALYS 1.VARIATIONS IN THE THICKNESS OF THE NEPTUNIUM LAYER
           ON THE ALUMINIUM BACKING SURFACE WERE 3 PER CENT.
           2.THE INTEGRATED CHARGE OF PROTONS PASSING THROUGH THE
           TARGETS DURING IRRADIATION WAS DETERMINED BY MEANS OF
           A FARADAY CUP WITH A PRECISION OF 5 PER CENT.

COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.THE ACTIVITY OF PU-236 FORMED IN THE

           SEPARATELY BY MEASURING THE PLUTONIUM ALPHA-EMISSION
           OF THE IRRADIATED 90 MUG/CM**2 THICK NEPTUNIUM TARGETS
           AT 7,23,92 HR AND AT 2 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF
           BOMBARDMENT.
