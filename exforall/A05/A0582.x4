SAMPLE     To minimize the uncertainties in the projectile
           energies at each target foil, thinly stacked foils with
           only three targets were used in each stack.  Aluminium
           foils of 6.85 mg/cm**2 were used as energy degraders
           and internal flux monitor. For measuring the cross
           sections of relatively short-lived nuclides, 1.0
           mg/cm**2 thickness 197-Au deposited on Al spacer foils
           served as targets. To obtain measurable yields of
           long-lived residuals, self-supporting 46.6 mg/cm**2
           thick 197-Au targets were used in the stack. Both the
           target and the degrader foils were 0F 99.99% purity.
METHOD     (STTA) See SAMPLE
           (ACTIV) The irradiation times were optimized according
           to half-lives of residual and the irradiations were
           performed in duplicate.
           (BCINT) The flux values were in good agreement with
           flux values obtained from monitor reactions. Their
           average was used to determine the cross sections.
           (GSPEC) The decay of characteristic gamma peaks was
           followed for more than five half-lives except for
           195-Au for which only two half-lives were followed.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error assigned is the root mean square of
           the statistical errors associated with the individual
           cross sections.
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in the energy.
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in the flux measurement
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in the detector efficiency
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The excitation functions were analysed in terms
           of direct, pre-equilibrium and evaporation emissions.
           The two most commonly used models of pre-equilibrium
           reactions, the exciton and the hybrid models, have both
           been used and compared.  The choice of the initial
           exciton number, the role of the pre-equilibrium cluster
           and multiple nucleon emissions have been investigated.
           The direct emission of cluster are found to
           significantly affect the excitation functions of 197-Hg
           and Au isotopes.

COMMENT    -By authors. For Tl-196 the metastable and ground-state
           half-lives are comparable and isomer transition is
           4.5%. The gammas detected, however, are common to the
           decay of both Tl-196-m and Tl-196-g, thereby giving us
           sigma(m)+sigma(g).
