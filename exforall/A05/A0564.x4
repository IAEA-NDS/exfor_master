           (ACTIV)
           (EXTB) The Be-9 beam intensity was kept between 2 to 10
           electric nA, and the used charge state 4+.
SAMPLE     The target was natural bismuth 220 ug/cm**2
           thick evaporated onto a 150 ug/cm**2 carbon
           foil; backing thickness was chosen to stop at the
           target site the recoiling evaporation residues.
MONITOR    (83-BI-209(4-BE-9,EL)83-BI-209,,DA,,RTH)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two detectors, 100 um thick, with an effective
           surface of around 415 mm2 were used for the detection
           of the alpha particles emitted by the evaporation
           residues and two detectors, ~ 300 um thick, with an
           active surface of 12.6 mm2 used as monitor detectors.

ANALYSIS    Total fusion cross sections were calculated adding
           all the observed channels and the fission one extracted
           from Subent E1658.010.
REL-REF    (A,E1658001,A.Yoshida+,J,PL/B,389,457,1996) Fusion
           cross sections used for comparison were derived from
           the E1658 Entry. (The contribution from the mixed 2n
           and p3n channels, not reported there, was taken from
           the interpolation of present data.)
STATUS     (CURVE) Fig.3 from Eur.Phys.J.,A2(1998)227
           (DEP,A0564002) (2n + p3n) cr.sect.
           (DEP,A0564003) (3n) cr.sect.
           (DEP,A0564004) (4n) cr.sect.
           (DEP,E1658010) fission cr.sect.
ERR-ANALYS The overall accuracy of the cross section is less than
           size of the points on fig. (Symbol size on the fig.
           is ~4.5%).
COMMENT    From authors: We believe that discrepancies between
           the two sets of data might be attributed to
           normalization errors in data of A.Yoshida+ (see
           REL-REF) where only one monitor detector was used.
           Anyhow, for the present work the weighted average of
           the two data sets was adopted.
