METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) Undivided products spectra were measured
           25-30 times during to 5 months. First spectrum has been
           measured later on 2.5-6.8 hours after end of
           irradiation.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- The experience of another authors
           witnesses, that an irradiation of one foil lead up to
           partial lost radioactive products.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) The  uncertainty  of  absolute
           calibration of used spectrometer;
             * statistical error;
            Uncertainties in decay data and monitor cross section
            were not included in ERR-T.
