ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T). The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           This Uncertainty Includes Statistical Error and
           Uncertainty of Absolute Calibration of Gamma
           Spectrometer. Decay Data and Monitor Cross Section
           Uncertainties were not be Included in this Error.
           (ERR-1) The Uncertainty of Absolute Calibration of
           Spectrometer.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC). Undivided Products Spectra were Measured
           25-30 Times During to 5 Months. First Spectrum has Been
           Measured Later on 2.5-6.8 Hours After End of
           Irradiation.

COMMENT    -By Compiler- The Expierence of Another Authors
           Witnesses, That an Irradiation of One Foil Lead Up to
           Partial Lost Radioactive Products.
