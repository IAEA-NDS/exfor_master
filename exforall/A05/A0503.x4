SAMPLE     Targets used in this measurement were 0.5 mg/cm**2 to
           1.5 mg/cm**2 thick and were prepared by
           electro-deposition on ~1 mg/cm**2 Cu backings. Target
           thickness values were estimated by measuring Rutherford
           scattering.
           Relative thickness values of different targets were
           also checked by measuring X-ray induced fluorescence.
           While 192-Os targets were 99% enriched, 188-Os targets
           had the following isotopic composition, 86.7% 188-Os,
           9.51% 189-Os, 2.46% 190-Os, and 1.33% 192-Os.

METHOD     (EDE) Most of the fission fragments were stopped in the

COMMENT    -By authors.  In the case of 203-At , absolute
           intensities of gamma-rays were not available.   Hence,
           the activity of 203-Po (daughter nuclei from beta-decay
           of  203-At)  was followed.  Small corrections due to
           direct formation of 203-Po were made using statistical
           model predictions, which explain all other major
           channels satisfactorily.
CORRECTION Contributions of other isotopes present in small
           abundance, in the case of 188-Os target, were also
           corrected using statistical model predictions.

           beam induced activity was counted using an efficiency
           calibrated 60 cc HPGe detector for several half lives
           of the evaporation residues produced.

COMMENT    -By authors.  In the case of 202-At , absolute
           intensities of gamma -rays were not available.   Hence,
           the activity of 202-Po (daughter nuclei from beta-decay
           of  202-At)  was followed.  Small corrections due to
           direct formation of 202-Po were made using statistical
           model predictions, which explain all other major
           channels satisfactorily.
CORRECTION Contributions of other isotopes present in small
           abundance, in the case of 188-Os target, were also
           corrected using statistical model predictions.
