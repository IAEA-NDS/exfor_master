TITLE      Backscattering of 6-Li and 7-Li ions from oxygen below
           6 MeV

SAMPLE     The sample consisted of a carbon substrate made of
           pyrolytic graphite, and was covered with layers of
           Al/2-O/3  (174.6 nm) and Au (10.0 nm) on top.  The gold
           film was deposited by electron beam evaporation and was
           used as an internal dose reference.  The thicknesses of
           the layers were determined by 4-He ion backscattering
           at 2023 KeV incident energy.  The atomic ratio of
           oxygen to aluminium was determined to be 3:2 with an
           accuracy of 2%.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)  PIPS detector
FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERGAR) 3 MV tandem
METHOD     (EXTB)  Measurements were made with Li+ below 5 MeV and
           with Li++ above 5 MeV.  The energy spread of the beam
           is below 1 KeV for protons at 1000 KeV and is assumed
           to be of the same order for Li ions, which are produced
           with the same source.  About 10-20 microcoulomb total
           charge were collected for each data point at energies
           below 5 MeV, and between 60 and 240 microcoulomb in the
           5-6 MeV range to improve the statistics of the
           measurements.

CORRECTION For backscattering cross-section from gold the

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error in the determination of the cross
           section on oxygen is due to the uncertainty in the
           determination of the ratio of the areal densities gold
           and oxygen of about 3%, and additionally due to count
           statistics of the oxygen peak and the background due to
           nuclear reactions with the carbon substrate.  The
           statistical error of the Au peak was always <0.5%.

REL-REF    (A,O0869001,E.RAUHALA+,J,NIM/B,35,7,1988)
           For 7-Li, there is good agreement with the data of
           rauhala and raisanen (see REL-REF ) at energies below
           5200 KeV.  At higher energies, however, there is a
           disagreement by a factor of almost two, which is much
           larger than the error bars of the measurements.  The
           reason for this disagreement is not known.  The
           measurements were performed at slightly different
           scattering angles (165 versus 170), but it seems
           unlikely that this small difference is able to explain
           this disagreement. (Comment by authors)
