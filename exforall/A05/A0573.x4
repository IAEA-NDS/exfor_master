SAMPLE     High Purity Metal Cobalt and Manganese Foils were Used
           As Targets. From Ten to Fourteen Cobalt Foils, 15 mm
           Diameter,0.8-1.0 G/Cm**2 Thick, were Placed in an Al
           Target Holder and Interspaced With Mn Foils, Also 15 mm
           Diameter,0.6-0.8 G/Cm**2 Thick, to Provide Simultaneous
           Proton Bombardment.
           in  Case  of Cobalt Targets, a Stack of Pellets Made by
           Compressing  the  Necessary  Amount  of  the   Powdered
           Co-Cl(2),  15  mm  Diameter,0.4-0.5  G/Cm**2,  was Also
           Used.  The Thickness of Foils and Pellets was Estimated
           by Weight and Area Measurements.

METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB) The Stacks were Exposed For 3 - 8.5 Hours
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)  The  Stacks  were  Repeatedely Measured Over a
           Period of Several Day.
