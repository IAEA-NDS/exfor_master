TITLE      Excitation functions and yields of some nuclear
           reactions induced by 100 MeV energy protons in Mn and
           Co targets: production of Fe-52

           Physics in Serpukhuv (Russia).
SAMPLE     High purity metal cobalt and manganese foils were used
           as targets. From ten to fourteen cobalt foils, 15 mm
           diameter,0.8-1.0 g/cm**2 thick, were placed in an Al
           target holder and interspaced with Mn foils, also 15 mm
           diameter,0.6-0.8 g/cm**2 thick, to provide simultaneous
           proton bombardment.
           In  Case  of cobalt targets, a stack of pellets made by
           compressing  the  necessary  amount  of  the   powdered
           Co-Cl(2),  15  mm  diameter,0.4-0.5  g/cm**2,  was also
           used.  The thickness of foils and pellets was estimated
           by weight and area measurements.

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
           (EXTB) The stacks were exposed for 3 - 8.5 hours.
           (GSPEC)  The  stacks  were  repeatedly measured over a
           period of several day.
