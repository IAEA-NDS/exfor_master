TITLE      Integral cross sections for (d,xn) and (d,pxn)
           reactions on Bi-209 nuclei at deuteron energy range
           to 47 MeV.

           The irradiation time was 3.7 h at the
           mean beam current 11 nA.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) A number of targets in stacks is unknown.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors involve accidental components
           and systematic ones associated with
             * inaccurate measurement of the deuteron current,
             * error in target thicknesses,
             * error in detector efficiency.
