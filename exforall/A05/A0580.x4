ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)  Low  Limit  of  the  Uncertainty  of  Absolute
           Calibration of Used Spectrometer.
           (ERR-2) High Limit of the Uncertainty of Absolute
           Calibration of Used Spectrometer.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Irradiation Time was 5 Minuts.
           (GSPEC). The Measurments were Began After 50 Minutes
           Of End of Irradiation, Approximately. These
           Measurements have Been Continued During to 7 Days.
           Second Cycle of the Measurements have Been Executed
           After 5 Months Approximately.
           (STTA) The Stack has Contained Three Aluminium and
           Three  Copper  Foils.   All  Foils have Diameter 20 mm.
           Thicknesses were 0.0253 (AL) And 0.1015 (CU) G/Cm**2.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- The Expierence of Another Authors
           Witnesses, That an Irradiation of One Foil Lead Up to
           Partial Lost Radioactive Products.
           Authors did not Give any Information About Possible
           Lost Activity.
