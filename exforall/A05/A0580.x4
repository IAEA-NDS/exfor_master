                    - prev. measurements of Cu.
           (R,,U.Reus+,J,AND,29,1,1983) - decay data, half-lives
DETECTOR   (GELI) 50 cm3 Ge(Li) with 2.2 keV resolution at
             Egamma=1.3 MeV

FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB)
SAMPLE     The stack has contained three aluminum and three
           copper  foils.   All  foils have diameter 20 mm.
           Thicknesses were 0.0253 (Al) and 0.1015 (Cu) g/cm**2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA)  Irradiation time was 5 minutes.
           (GSPEC) The measurements were began after 50 minutes
           of end of irradiation, approximately. These
           measurements have been continued during to 7 days.
           Second cycle of the measurements have been executed
           after 5 months approximately.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,5.,7.) The  uncertainty  of  absolute
           calibration of used spectrometer.
COMMENT    -By Compiler- The experience of another authors
           witnesses, that an irradiation of one foil lead up to
           partial lost radioactive products.
           Authors did not give any information about possible
           lost activity.
