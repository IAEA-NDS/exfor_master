SAMPLE     High Purity Natural Ta (TA-180-0.0123%,TA-181-99.8877%)
           in Metallic Form was Used As Target Materials For All
           Irradiations.The Stack of Targets was Composed of 32
           Marked Tantalum Foils (20 FOILS OF 0.20 G/CM**2+-1% AND
            12 FOILS 0.148 G/CM**2+-1% THICK,AND 16 MM IN DIAME-
           TER).The Thickness of Each Ta Foil was Determined by
           Weight and Area Measurements.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Hybrid Model of Nuclear Reactions Using the Well
           Developed Computer Code Overlaid Alice.

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG,,,EVAL)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE).Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)
           the Stack was Irradieted For 12 Hours With a Proton
           Beam Current of 40 Nanoamperes.
           the Stacks were Repeatedely Measured Over a Period of
           Several Months.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           the Total Errors in the Cross Section were Obtained by
           Taking Square Roots of the Sums of the Squares of All
           the Individual Errors,Like Those in the Detection
           Efficiency,Counting Geometry and Statistics,Proton
           Energy Degradation Corrections,Proton Beam Monitoring,
           Decay Schemes,Computer Spectral Integration,Etc.The
           Resulting Total Error is Thus Partly Systematic and
           Amounts to Between 10-15%.On Average,the Error in Cross
           Sections was a High As 15%.
