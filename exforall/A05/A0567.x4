TITLE      Excitation function for W-178 production in the
           Ta-181(p,4n)W-178 reaction over proton energy range

FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE) Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
SAMPLE     (73-TA-181,ENR=0.998877) High purity natural Ta
            (Ta-180 - 0.0123%, Ta-181 - 99.8877%) in metallic form
           was used as target materials for all irradiations. The
           stack of targets was composed of 32 marked tantalum
           foils (20 foils of 0.20 g/cm2+-1% and 12 foils
           of 0.148 g/cm2+-1% thick, and 16 mm in diameter). The
           thickness of each ta foil was determined by weight
           and area measurements.

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge-Li detector (volume of 47 cm3 and 2 keV
           resolution at 1332 keV)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC)
           The stack was irradiated for 12 hours with a proton
           beam current of 40 nanoamperes.
           The stacks were repeatedly measured over a period of
           several months.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross sections
           were obtained by taking square roots of the sums of
           the squares of all the individual errors like those in
            * detection efficiency,
            * counting geometry and statistics,
            * attenuation corrections,
            * proton beam monitoring,
            * decay schemes,
            * computer spectral integration, etc.
