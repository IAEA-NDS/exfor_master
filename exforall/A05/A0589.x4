           Details of detector.
SAMPLE     An existing target of 7-Li/F, having 99.9% enrichment
           of 7-Li, was used.  The target was of thickness ~80
           microgramm/cm**2, evaporated onto a ~35
           microgramm/cm**2 carbon backing.  A very thin layer of
           Au (~4 microgramm/cm**2) was deposited on the target
           for beam dose and solid angle normalisation.  The
           composition of the target was determined by elastic
           recoil detection analysis using a 58-Ni beam of energy
           60 MeV, which is less than half the Coulomb barrier
           energy for all target components.  In terms of number
           of nuclei/cm2, the abundance of the various target
           components relative to 7-Li were measured to be:
           Li:F:C:O:Au
           = 1.00 :  1.00+/-0.01 :  0.96+/-0.01
           :  0.0427+/-0.0004 :  0.0069+/-0.0003.

DETECTOR   (IOCH) Special ionization chamber.  The full energy of
           the ions entering the detector was measured using a 21
           cm long grid electrode, whilst the energy loss signal
           was obtained from a separate 3.2 cm long anode.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3AULCBR) The experiment was performed with a 12-C
           beam of energy 10.5 MeV, from the 14UD Pelletron
           accelerator.

MISC-COL   (MISC) Fusion cross section after correction on low
           energy evaporated residues.  See COMMENT

COMMENT    - By authors. It needs to be emphasized here that this
           cross-section, excluding evaporated residues having
           kinetic energies below 4 MeV and also excluding the
           evaporated residues C and B, is indeed the lower limit
           to the fusion cross-section at this energy.
           To compare with gamma-ray measurements, an estimate is
           needed of the cross-sections of evaporated residues
           with kinetic energies below 4 MeV, not available from
           the present measurement.  Statistical model
           calculations performed using the code PACE, which
           reproduces the energy and angular dependence of the
           evaporated residues, predicted the contribution of
           evaporated residues below 4 MeV to be 20% of the total
           fusion cross-section.  However, to take into account
           the possible dependence of the calculation on the
           various parameters in the code, this contribution below
           4 MeV has been taken to be (20+/-8)%, where the
           uncertainty has been estimated very conservatively.
