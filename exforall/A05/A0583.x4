REL-REF    (M,A0565001,A.V.Gonchar+,J,AE,75,205,1993) A detailed
           description of the equipment used in this experiment to
           irradiate the targets and to measure the gamma-spectra,
           as well as the formulas for calculating the reaction

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(HE3,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
             Aluminum foils calibrated in thickness served to
           reduce gradually the energy of incident 3He ions.

METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT) The stacks were disposed in Faraday's cup
           (STTA)  Two stacks have been used.
           (GSPEC) Three runs of measurements with different
           time intervals were made.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Ultrapure germanium. The energy resolution
           of this detector at Egamma = 1.3 MeV was 2.4 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors in the cross sections comprise both
           statistical and systematic uncertainties of the
            experiment.
           This uncertainty does not include:
           (ERR-1,,10.) Beam current uncertainty and
             * decay data;
             * systematic uncertainty of energies (1.0-1.5 MeV).
CORRECTION Needed corrections for secondary neutrons influence and
           secondary electron yield from Faraday's cup were
           included.
