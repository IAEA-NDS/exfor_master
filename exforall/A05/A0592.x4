TITLE      Cross section and recoil properties of the products
           from the interaction of 240-MeV 12-C ions with nat-Ag
AUTHOR     (Kuen-Bey Chen,Yu-Wen Yu)
INSTITUTE  (3CHFTHU) Nuclear Science and Technology Development
           and Center College of Nuclear Science
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,569,616,1994)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) 88-inch cyclotron.
SAMPLE     Each unprocessed target stack consisted of seven foils,
           the target foil was a 3 mg/cm2 thick nat-Ag foil
            (99.999%). The Ag target was sandwiched between three
           pairs of 3.5 mg/cm2 Mylar foils, the innerpair of
           foils served as forward and backward catchers, and the
           outer pair of foils were gaurd foils. The pair of
           foils between each pair of inner and outer foils served
           as blank measurements. The two target stacks used for
           the chemical separations were the same, except three
           pairs of 8.7mg/cm2 Al foils (99.99%) were used instead
           of Mylar foils.
           A thermal-neutron activation analysis was performed on
           the Mylar foils at the Tsing-Hua research nuclear
           reactor, and showed no observable Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
           Ga or As impurities.
METHOD     (STTA) Two irradiated target foil stacks were subjected
           to chemical separations before measuring the activities
           of the reaction products, and another two target foil
           stacks were measured without chemical processing.
           (EXTB) The incident beam of 245-MeV 12-C(5+) ions had
           an intensity of 70 electrical nanoamperes in the target
           foils.
           (BCINT) An electron-suppressed Faraday cup.
           (ACTIV) Irradiations were between 30 and 60 minutes in
           length. The charge deposited in the Faraday cup was
           recorded periodically throughout the bombardments to
           permit the reconstruction of the beam flux histories.
           (GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectra of each sample in the energy
           range between 50 KeV and 2 MeV were taken at several
           time intervals.
           (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Two Ge(Li) detectors
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The peak areas were sorted into decay
           curves, which were interactively identified on the
           basis of gamma-ray energy and half-life.
CORRECTION For the absolute gamma-ray abundance, chemical yield,
           and gamma-ray detection efficiency.  The beam flux
           history was used to calculate apparent production cross
           sections.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty in the intensities of
           the gamma rays and deviations between runs.
ADD-RES    (TRCS)
           (RANGE) Recoil properties of products.
           Parameters of decomposed mass distribution curves.
           Charge dispersion Guassian parameters.
