SAMPLE     Molten lead was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           (BGO) To exclude 511-KeV radiation
           (SCIN) The samples were positioned in the 1.6 mm gap
           between the two 0.5-mm-thick plastic scintillators of
           the beta-ray detector.

METHOD     (JET) The Hg-element products produced during the
           600-MeV 18-O bombardment were continuously released,
           transported, and separated by using an online
           gas-thermochromatographic device.  The mercury
           isotopes, created in the inner section of the molten
           lead target material were immediately evaporated out of
           the surface of the molten lead at a target temperature
           of ~700 C.
           The total contamination level of the separated samples
           was estimated to be less than 1%.
           (BCINT) The beam intensity was measured by a
           gas-motivation  Faraday cup in front of the target
           chamber.  This Faraday cup can open or shut off the
           target irradiation beam and record the instantaneous
           beam intensities at the irradiation start and end
           point.  It can also periodically be inserted to monitor
           the varying beam intensities.
           (EXTB) In order to control the dead-time correction to
           a reasonable range a beam of ~2.2 particle nanoampere
           was used.
           (GSPEC)
           (BGCT) The gamma-beta coincidence measurements
           combining an anticoincident with the 511-KeV gamma rays
           detected by a large BGO detector were performed.

           The measured production cross sections for Hg isotopes
           206-Hg, 207-Hg, 208-Hg, and 209-Hg were considered as
           independent cross sections, whereas the production
           cross sections of 203-Hg and 205-Hg were classified as
           cumulative cross sections. (Comment by authors)

COMMENT    -  By  authors. Considering the different half-lives of
           the neutron-rich Hg isotopes two different experimental
           arrangements, A and B, were used.
           1. Group A:  Every sample collected the separated Hg
           isotopes produced during a target irradiation duration
           of 120 sec.  After shutting off the beam the sample was
           automatically transported to a low-background
           measurement area -50 m away from the online target
           device within 15-20 sec.  Then the sample was put into
           the  measurement position and the detection was started
           at, on the average, 45 sec after irradiation.  The
           measurement  lasted 420 sec.  The data were recorded on
           time-successive multispectrum modes and the single and
           the filtered gamma-ray spectra were simultaneously
           recorded for each 20-sec time bin.  A total of 143 such
           cycles were performed.
           2.  Group B:  The irradiation duration is 90-100 min.
           The measurements started at 8 min after irradiation.
           The spectrum measurements lasted about 100 min.  Three
           such samples were measured.  Only the last sample was
           measured for 44 hours.  The time bins used for
           group B were, in order, 5 min during the first hour, 20
           min during the second and third hours, and 2 hours
           during the last 40 hours.
