HISTORY    (19950203C)
           (19960522A) Reaction lines in subent 2,3 are changed
           according to action 60 of IAEA consultants' meeting,
           2-4 may 1995. Part-Det is included.
           (20040604A) Correction according to MEMO CP-C/344
           (20040715U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     As targets were used thin layers, aproximatelly
            140 mug/cm**2, of scandium saturated tritium. The
           scandium layers were evaporated on the molybdenum
           backing. The energy thickness of this target was about
            42 KeV.
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSEPA) Electrostatic accelerator EG-2.5
           Re-equipped for the work with lower energies.
METHOD     (BCINT)
PART-DET   (N)
EN-SEC     (E,N)
DETECTOR   (SCIN).A scintillation spectrometer on the basic of
           stilbene crystal for the neutron spectrum measurements.
           The total neutron yield was measured through a 'long'
            McKibben's counter installed at 90 degrees angle to
           beam direction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)The errors of spectrum measurement (with
           statistical errors and errors of the methods for
           processing preliminary spectrum of recoil protons)
           comprised together less 15%.
           (ERR-2) The total errors of absolute yields were
           determined of methods errors of the transformation
           procedure of the recoil proton spectrum to the neutron
           spectrum comprising approximatelly 10%.
           (ERR-3)  The errors of geometrical factor not exceeding
           approximatelly 5%.
           (ERR-4) The errors of projectile number of about 1%.
           (ERR-5) The error of spectrum arbitrary run is defined
           by the first and second components of the total errors
           and is about 11-14%.
