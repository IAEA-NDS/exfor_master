TITLE      Production of 128,131-Ba,132-Cs in proton induced
           reactions on a Cs target and of 127,129-Cs in 3,4-He
           induced reactions on I target.

SAMPLE     The thin targets were prepared by compressing the
           necessary amount of the natural, high purity Cs-Cl
           powder.
           Pellets thicknesses were obtained by the weight and
           area measurement.  The weight of pressed Cs-Cl pellets,
           diameter 1.5 cm,area 1.76 cm**2, varied throughout the
           stacked  thin Cs-Cl discs according to necessary energy
           loss of protons in each discs.  The number of pellets
           varied  in  different  irradiations.  The  thin target
           discs were then stacked in thin-walled  aluminum  tube,
           which  used  as  target  holder,  with  aluminum  foils
           between each Cs-Cl discs.

           Advantages of using I-127-He-3,4 reactions for
           production of Cs-127,129 are discussed.

           between 13-18%. Authors assumed for the cross section
           and yields the error 15%.
