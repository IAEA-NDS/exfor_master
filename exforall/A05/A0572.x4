SAMPLE     The Thin Targets were Prepared by Compressing the
           Necessary Amount of the Natural,High Purity Cs-Cl
           Powder.
           Pellets Thicknesses were Obtained by the Weight and
           Area Measurement.  The Weight of Pressed Cs-Cl Pellets,
           Diameter 1.5 Cm,Area 1.76 Cm**2, Varied Throughout the
           Stacked  Thin Cs-Cl Discs According to Necessary Energy
           Loss of Protons in Each Discs.  The Number of Pellets
           Varied  in  Different  Irradiations.   The  Thin Target
           Discs were Then Stacked in Thin-Walled  Aluminum  Tube,
           Which  Used  As  Taeget  Holder,  With  Aluminum  Foils
           Between Each Cs-Cl Discs.

           Advantages of Using I-127-He-3,4 Reactions For
           Production of Cs-127,129 Are Discussed.
