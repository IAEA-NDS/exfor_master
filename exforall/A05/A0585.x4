TITLE      Backscattering of 6-Li and 7-Li ions from oxygen below
           6 MeV

SAMPLE     The sample consisted of a carbon substrate made of
           pyrolytic graphite, and was covered with layers of
           Al/2-O/3 (174.6 nanometers) and Au (10.0 nanometers) on
           top.  The Al/2-O/3 layer was deposited by filtered
           vacuum arc from a pure aluminium cathode in oxygen
           atmosphere.  The gold film was deposited by electron
           beam evaporation and was used as an internal dose
           reference.  The thicknesses of the layers were
           determined by 4He ion backscattering at 2023 KeV
           incident energy.  The atomic ratio of oxygen to
           aluminium was determined to be 3:2 with an accuracy  of
           2%.  A pure carbon sample was used to examine the
           background due to nuclear reactions of incident Li ions
           with the carbon substrate.

FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERGAR)  The terminal voltage of the accelerator
           was calibrated with the well-known resonances of
           the 27Al(p,g)28Si reaction at 992 and 1380 KeV.  The
           energy spread of the beam is below 1 KeV for protons at
           1000 KeV and is assumed to be of the same order for Li
           ions, which are produced with the same source.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The error in the determination of the cross
           section on oxygen is due to the uncertainty in the
           determination of the ratio of the areal densities of Au
           and O, and additionally due to count statistics of the
           oxygen peak and the background due to nuclear reactions
           with the carbon substrate.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of the ratio of the arial
           densities of Au and O.
           (ERR-2) Maximal value of statistical error of the Au
           peak.

           For 7Li, there is good agreement with the data of
           rauhala and raisanen at energies below 5200 KeV. At
           higher energies, however, there is a disagreement by a
           factor of almost two, which is much larger than the
           error bars of the measurements.  The reason for this
           disagreement is not known.  The measurements were
           performed at slightly different scattering angles (165
           versus 170), but it seems unlikely that this small
           difference is able to explain this disagreement.
