SAMPLE     High Purity Natural V in Metallic Form was Used As a
           Target Material For Irradiations.The Thicknesses of V
           Foils were Determined by Weight and Area Measurements
           For Each Individual Foil.The Stack Consisting of 25
           Numbered Circular V Foils (THE FOILS WEIGHED BETWEEN-
            0.8573 G AND 0.8950 G ,HAD THICKNESSES ABOUT 0.5 MM
           AND WERE CUT INTO 19 MM DIAMETER DISCS) Was Exposed to
           an External Proton Beam.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Hybrid Model of Nuclear Reactions Using the Well

FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE).Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT,EXTB)
           (GSPEC)
           a Target Containing 7.7 G/Cm**2 -25 Foils in the Stack
           of Vanadium was Bombarded at a Proton Beam Current of
           160 Nanoamperes Approximately For 406 Hours -During
           Intermittent Bombardment Over a Period of 4.5 Years.
ERR-ANALYS The Total Errors in the Cross Section were Obtained by
           Taking Square Roots of the Sums of the Squares of All
           the Individual Errors,Like Those in the Detection
           Efficiency,Counting Geometry and Statistics,
           Atttenuation Corrections,Irradiation and Cooling Times,
           Proton Beam Monitoring, Decay Schemes,Computer Spectral
           Integration,Etc.The Resulting Total Error  is Thus
           Partly Systematic and Amounts to Between 15-20%.We
           Assumed For the Cross Sections and Yields an Error of
            20%.
           (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
