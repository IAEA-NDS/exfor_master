FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE) Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
SAMPLE     High purity natural V in metallic form was used as a
           target material for irradiations. The thicknesses of V
           foils were determined by weight and area measurements
           for each individual foil. The stack consisting of 25
           numbered circular V foils (the foils weighed between-
            0.8573 g and 0.8950 g ,had thicknesses about 0.5 mm
           and were cut into 19 mm diam. discs) was exposed to
           an external proton beam.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectra from separate foils were
           measured using a computerized gamma-spectroscopy
           system, CICERO-8K equipped with a HPGe detector in JINR
           The spectrometer was calibrated for gamma-ray energy
           using calibrated radionuclide sources of 133Ba
           and 152Eu.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT,EXTB)
           (GSPEC)
           A target containing 7.7 g/cm**2  25 foils in the stack
           of vanadium was bombarded at a proton beam current of
           160 nanoAmperes approximately for 406 hours -during
           intermittent bombardment over a period of 4.5 years.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors in the cross section were
           obtained by taking square roots of the sums of the
           squares of all the individual errors, like those in:
             * the detection efficiency,
             * counting geometry and statistics,
             * attenuation corrections,
             * irradiation and cooling times,
             * proton beam monitoring,
             * decay schemes,
             * computer spectral integration, etc.
            The resulting total error  is thus partly systematic
           and amounts to between 15-20%. Authors assumed for the
           cross sections an error of 20%.
