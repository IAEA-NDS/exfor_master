SAMPLE     Stacks of Pressed Pellet of Anhydrous Cs-Cl of Natural
           Isotopic Composition were Used.
           Pellets Thicknesses were Obtained by the Weight and
           Area Measurement.
           the Weight of Pressed Cs-Cl Pellets Varied Throughout
           the Stacked Thin Cscl Discs According to the Required
           Energy Loss of Protons in  Each  Discs.  About  Twenty
           Pellets were Placed in an Aluminum Target Holder.

FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE).Lu-100 at the Institute For High Energy
           Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA).
METHOD     (STTA) Proton Beam Current was Varied From 30 to 200 Na
           (EXTB) The Duration of Irradiation was 2 - 5 Hours.
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)  The Stacks were Repeatedely Measured Over a
           Period of Several Day.
