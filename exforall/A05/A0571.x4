SAMPLE     Stacks of pressed pellet of anhydrous Cs-Cl of natural
           isotopic composition were used.
           Pellets thicknesses were obtained by the weight and
           area measurement.
           The weight of pressed Cs-Cl pellets varied throughout
           the stacked thin CsCl discs according to the required
           energy loss of protons in  each  discs.  About  twenty
           pellets were placed in an aluminum target holder.

FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSFVE) Lu-100 at the Institute for High
           Energy Physics in Serpukhuv (RUSSIA). The duration of
           Irradiations vas 2-5 hours. Proton beam intensity was
           limited to low currents which varied from lO to 200 nA.
           (SPECC,4ZZZDUB) The amount of 127-Cs and 127-Xe was
           measured by recording ,gamma-ray spectra of each CsCl
           pellet with calibrated Ge(Li) detector after
           transportation the stacks from Serpukhov to J.I.N.R.
           in Dubna.
METHOD     (STTA) Proton beam current was varied from 30 to 200 Na
           (EXTB) The Duration of irradiation was 2 - 5 hours.
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)  The stacks were repeatedly measured over a
           period of several day.

REACTION   (55-CS-133(P,X)54-XE-127,CUM,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total cross sections was obtained by
           summing up in squares all the individual errors
           1.  the data analysis,
           2.  proton flux determination,
           3.  gamma spectroscopy,
           4.  conversion of gamma intensities into reaction cross
           sections and amounted to 13-18%.
           Authors  assumed  for  the cross section and yields the
           error 15%.
