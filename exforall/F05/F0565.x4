           reaction near the resonance at energy 1.726 MeV.

DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Solid angle was 0.002 steradian, detector
           resolution for protons was 13 keV.
SAMPLE     Two samples: First sample was used for shape cross-
           section measurement. It was thin self-supporting foil
           of natural carbon evaporated on thin layer of NI and W.
           Second was used for definition of resonance energy and
           absolute values of differential cross-sections. Thick
           target of carbon evaporated on silicon layer.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,3.,4.) Experimental error of absolute cross
                            section values
HISTORY    (20030204C)
           (20170610A) Digitized data were replaced with author's
           tabular values. Detector was added. Error description
           was changed.
