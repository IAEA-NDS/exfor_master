FACILITY   (LINAC) Vertical accelerator.
SAMPLE     16O2 gas was confined within a differentially pumped
           gas target.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 125 cm**3 (25%) Ge(Li) detector was
           positioned 2 cm from the target and at 90 degrees to
           the beam direction. Then it was moved to an angle of
           127 degrees at a distance of 11.5 cm from the target
           and an 85 cm**3 (16.6%) Ge(Li) detector was positioned
           at 46 degrees  and 10 cm.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
MONITOR    (6-C-12(A,INL)6-C-12,,DA,G)
           Relative efficiency of the 25% detector was measured
           with a 56Co source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
