FACILITY   (CYCLO,4UKRIJD) two cyclotrons U-120 and U-240.
SAMPLE     The target assembly of pure tantalum foils was used.
           The thickness of assembly used on U-120 was of such
           value, that the energies of alpha particles were
           decreased down to 0 MeV. The thicknesses of foils used
           on U-240 were equal to 80 and 200 microns. The energies
           of alpha particles were decreased from 100 MeV down to
           30 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Isomeric ratios were determined by activation
           technique.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Ge-spectrometer with germanium detector was used.
REL-REF    (R,,I.N.Vishnevskiy+,J,YF,41,1435,1985)The calculation
           technique was described in this work.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Uncertainty was determined by special tables
           and by experimental technique.
           (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty was determined by statistic
           accuracy.
