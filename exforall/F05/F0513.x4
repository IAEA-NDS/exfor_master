DETECTOR   (GELI) A 80 cm3 Ge(Li) detector was placed at an angle
           of 90 degr. at a distance of 2.4 cm from the beam axis
           for gamma-ray transitions.
           There were also used Ge(Li) detectors placed around the
           cylindrical jet target chamber at angles of 39, 90 and
           116 degrees at a distance of 5-6 cm from the jet
           stream axis.
           The beam current was monitored with standard current
           integration as well as elastic scattering yields
           observed at the angle of 35, 90 and 145 degr. in the
           laboratory system.
SAMPLE     Neon gas enriched to 99.99% in 20Ne was recirculated
           in differentially pumped gas target systems of the
           extended and quasipoint jet types.
           For neon gas of p0=2.0 Torr pressure in the target
           chamber, the pressure was reduced to 1*10E-2, 1*10E-3
           and 1*10E-6 Torr in the first, second and third
           pumping stages of the system, respectively.
