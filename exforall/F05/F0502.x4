FACILITY   (ACCEL,2FR CSN)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)Alpha particles with energies below 3.5 MeV and
           emission angles between approximately 95 and 150 degr.
           with respect to the beam direction were deflected
           towards the solenoid axis and detected in an array of
           6*4 Si detectors (22 mm*45 mm*0.1 mm).The detectors
           were mounted in cylindrical geometry (internal diameter
           of 4 cm) aligned on the solenoid axis. Alpha particles
           were detected at distances ranging from 18 to 36.5 cm
           from the target.
           (SCIN)Beta particles (Emax=14 MeV) were detected in
           a set of 6 successive cylindrical plastic scintillators
            (diameter 20 mm and thickness 3,3,8,8,8 and 10 mm)
           centered on the field axis and 22 cm away from the
           target.
           The solenoidal superconducting magnet SOLENO
            (3.2 T at the center,1.22 m long,32 cm of internal
           diameter) in order to detect both alpha and beta
           particles with high efficiency (11.5% and 25%,
           respectively) due to the focusing power of the field.
           Off-beam detection was necessary to avoid any
           contamination in both alpha and beta+ coincidence
           spectra arising from the channel
                                      7Li(p,gamma1)8Be*(2alpha).
           The calibration of the silicon detectors was performed
           using the three well-defined peaks observed in the
           singlesprompt spectra from 9Be(p,d)8Be and
           9Be(p,alpha)6Li reactions.
METHOD     (GSPEC,TOF)
SAMPLE     Highly radioactive 7Be target (132 mCi).
CORRECTION Kinematics correction of 9.6% was applied to the
           experimental efficiency value to take into account the
           8Be* in flight decay in the 7Li(p,g1)8Be* reaction.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty on the effective energy is 2.5 keV.
           (DATA-ERR) No information about source of energy
