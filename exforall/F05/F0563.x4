COMMENT    Energy of incident particle (proton) was calculated
           by eq.(1) from the article: Eg=Ep*A/(A+1)+Ebond-Eexc,
           Eg - energy of gamma; Ep - energy of incident proton;
           A - atomic weight; Ebond - bond energy of protons; Eexc
           exciting energy of the final state of the nuclei.
