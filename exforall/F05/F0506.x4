INC-SPECT  Energy spread was 10 keV.
SAMPLE     Mo metallic, self-supporting targets with a high degree
           of homogeneity were employed.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 2 silicon semiconductor detectors mounted on a
           coolable turntable were used in the angular range
           between 7.5 and 168 degrees in steps of 2.5 to 5
           degrees.
MONITOR    Target thicknesses were determined by weighing and by
           measurement of the energy loss of alpha-particles.
           Monitor detectors were used at +-25 degrees.
           Absolute energy calibration was carried out using the
           peak positions of the well-known quadrupole and
           octupole one-phonon states and the ground state.
ERR-ANALYS Absolute integrated cross sections for the elastic
           scattering were fixed to about +-1%.
