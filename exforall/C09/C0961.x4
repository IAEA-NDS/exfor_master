            Induced Uraniun-238 Fission

            isochronous cyclotron.
INC-SPECT  Proton energies (entrance and exit) calculated using
            program RANGE.
SAMPLE     Thin natural uranium foils (99.98% purity), 99.275%
            238U.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (CHSEP) Uranium targets irradiated under vacuum using
            a well-colimated and electrically insulated scattering
            chamber setup. After bombardment, targets were left
            to decay for ~ 3 days prior to radioassays.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty calculated by summing in quadrature
            individual errors including:
           (ERR-1) beam-current integration (5%),
           (ERR-2) target thickness (4%),
           (ERR-S) counting statistics (3%),
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency (5%,

           (ERR-5) decay correction (3%),
           (ERR-6) attenuation corrections (5%),
           (ERR-7) integration errors (4%),
           (ERR-8) recoil losses (5%).
           (EN-ERR) Total uncertainty in proton energy calculated
            by summing in quadrature individual errors including:
            . incident beam energy (2%),
            . proton beam scattering (2%),
            . target thickness (4%),
            . range energy values (3%).
ADD-RES    238U(p,f)99Mo cumulative yield in the 70- to 30-MeV
            region was determined to 77+/-7 MBq/uA-h.
