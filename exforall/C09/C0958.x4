INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron using the
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS).
SAMPLE     The target wheel consisted of nine arc-shaped targets
           with a nominal areal density of ~460 microg/cm2 208Pb
           metal on 35 microg/cm2 natC. A thin <10 microg/cm2
           layer of natC was applied to the downstream side of
           the targets to improve infrared cooling and prevent
           target material loss. The target wheel rotation speed
           was 5-10 Hz.
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SISD) The detection system used consists of a
           multiwire proportional counter upstream of the FPD.
           The FPD is constructed with a five-sided box geometry
           from 58 mm x 58 mm 300 microm-thick Si-strip detector
           cards, each with 16 strips. The focal plane of the
           BGS is made of three cards totaling 48 strips.
METHOD     (ASPEC,REC) The BGS separates out evaporation residues
            (EVRs) from unreacted beam and undesirable reaction
           products by their differing magnetic rigidities in
           dilute He gas. Cross sections were deduced from the
           count of alpha-decay chains. Of the five alpha decays
           of 266Mt observed in these experiments, only two
           registered a full-energy signal in the FPD.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Cross section errors values are at the 68%
           confidence interval.
