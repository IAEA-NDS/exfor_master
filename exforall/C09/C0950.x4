TITLE      Total cross sectionsfor the production of 22Na and
            24Na in proton-induced reactions on 27Al from 0.40 to
            22.4 GeV
FACILITY   (MESON,1USALAS) LANSCE facility at 0.4 and 0.8 GeV.
           (SYNCH,1USABNL) AGS above 0.8 GeV.
SAMPLE     Stack of 3 Al foils, each about 80 mg/cm2 thick.
MONITOR    LANSCE data were normalized to AGS data at 0.8 GeV.
STATUS     Data taken from tables in reference.

REACTION   (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 2 NaI crystals face-to-face with the Al foil
            centered between them and in coincidence with each
            other.
DECAY-DATA (11-NA-22,2.6019YR,DG,1275.,1.0)
MONITOR    Detector efficiency determined using calibrated 22Na
            source.
ANALYSIS   Where there is more than one irradiation at a given
            energy, the data are a weighted average.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . background,
           . decay during irradiation, between irradiation and
             counting, and during counting.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Overall uncertainty, includes random and
            systematic uncertainties.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Number of irradiations.
