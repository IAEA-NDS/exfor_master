SAMPLE     (40-ZR-96,NAT=0.028)
           (79-AU-198,NAT=1.00) High purity natural Zr and 197Au
           metal target foils were wrapped with 0.025mm thick
           super pure aluminum foil. In the first set of
           experiment the weights of the zirconium and gold
           foils were 0.2379 and 0.0525 g, respectively. In the
           second set of experiment, the weights of Zr and Au
           were 0.1808 and 0.1297 g respectively
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resolution of the detector system was 2.0
           keV at 1332.0 keV of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irrad./Cool. = 4-5/2-3 hours
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty propagated from:
           (ERR-S,5.,10.) Counting statistics (5%-10%)
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic error (~3.7%)
           (ERR-1) Photon flux estimation (~2%)
           (ERR-2) The irradiation time (~0.5%)
           (ERR-3) The deflection efficiency calibration (~3%)
           (ERR-4) Half life of the reaction products and gamma
           ray abundances (~2%)
