TITLE      Spectra of gamma rays from thermal-neutron capture by
           Se-78 and Se-80 .
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Horizontal channel of reactor WWR-M
           Thermal neutron flux was 6.E+7 n/cm2/sec at the sample
           site.
METHOD     Direct detection of gamma-rays
DETECTOR   (GELI)     Germanium-lithium detector with sensible
           volume about 1 cm**3 .
           Energy resolution 6-15keV in the Egamma range 0.4-7MeV.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)    Shape analysis
MONITOR    Gamma-rays from Se-77 and Fe-56,Ti-48,S-42,
           Si-28 (n,gamma) reaction
PART-DET   (G)        Gammas
COMMENT    Of compiler.
            Capture c-s for Se-78 - 0.41b and Se-80 - 0.6 b are
           given in the article, but not mention, what reference
           they are from.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty of gamma-line positions Se-77 was 2-3 keV
