TITLE      Absolute measurement of the absorption cross sections
           of neutrons of 24 keV energy.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Antimony-beryllium neutron source with external
            diameter 3.0 cm and with thickness of beryllium shell
            2.mm, 4.mm or 6.mm.
           Source intensity near 1.0 x 10**8 neutrons/sec.
SAMPLE      Spherical layers with internal diameter from
            3.0 cm to 10.cm and external diameter from 5.0 cm to
            30.cm. A part of samples was prepared from pure
            absorbers and a part from absorbers with scatterer-
            lead-bismuth alloy.
METHOD     (SHELT)     Spherical shell transmission
DETECTOR   (LONGC)4 long counters on distance 1.5-2.mm from source
           (FISCH) Water tank with system of fission chambers.
           Integrating fission chamber with U-235 layers.
           The radical distributions of the neutron flux from the
           source in the water were measured by a movable system
           of plane fission chamber.Measurements with and without
           sample.
ANALYSIS    Absorption cross section calculation was carried
            out from transmission in one-velocity transport
            approximation for point neutrons source by Monte-Carlo
            method
MONITOR      No information.
CORRECTION Corrections were introduced on
            * absorption in lead-bismuth alloy (in measurements
              with introduction scatterer into sample),
            * difference of source from point,
            * absorbing properties of neutron source,
            * presence of neutrons group with energy 380.keV,
           For U-238 samples correction was introduced on U-235
           admixture fission.
           In water tank case correction was introduced on
           absorption of thermal neutrons into sample - ~10%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Combination of two independent error groups
           first group- all errors of experiment and correction
           errors
           second group- from inaccuracy of the total cross
           sections (calculation parameter)

COMMENT    Of Authors.
           In SJA,19,858,1965 there was a mistake in correction
           for U-235 content in natural sample -
           in YK-9,44,1972 this correction was applied correctly.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data were taken from YK-9,44,1972
           (DEP,40072037) In Subent 037 - primarily measured data.
HISTORY    (19730914A) Data table was replaced according to the
            authors recommendations by data from YK-9,44,1972,
            Table 3 .

           It's mentioned in the article YK-9,44, Table 2b that
           data of transmission for 6,8,10 mm layers were not
           used to derive cross-sections; were calculated by
           final parameters of Table 1;
           even in title of Table 2b these data are marked as
           "experimental".
