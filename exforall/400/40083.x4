METHOD     (ACTIV)
            Absolute activity of Re-186, Re-188, Au-198, Na-24 was
           defined by 4PI-counting method by proportional
           methane-filled flow-type counter.
            Absolute activity of Re-184, Re-184-M was defined from
           gammas of 895. and 904 keV registered by scintillation
           gamma spectrometer with NaI(Tl) crystal of 900-keV
           gamma registration efficiency (1.00+-0.05) % .
           The identification of activities was done by HLs,
           gamma-spectra, absorption curves in Al, beta spectra
           from scin. beta spectrometer.

            Calculated value 289 mb at Eeff=0.8 MeV - by using
           the data of 40691.
            325+-60 mb and 290+-60 mb at monoenergetic neutrons
           of 0.6+-0.1 and 0.8+-0.1 MeV energy,respectively.
SAMPLE      Natural rhenium
INC-SOURCE .No information
INC-SPECT     Two different spectra, both close to the spectrum of
           fission neutrons. Neutron flux ~10**14 n/cm2;
           irradiation time 3-6 hr.

ANALYSIS   .EN-DUMMY means the energy of monoenergetic neutrons,
           at which the CS of (n,gamma) reaction is equal to the
           cross section obtained with neutron spectrum.
           . Formula and explanation ( how to derive cross-section
           for Re-nat) are not given in the article; cross-section
           is just mentioned as "measured by authors".
COMMENT    Of N.Otsuka ( NDS, IAEA).
           "The cross sections are equal to the sum of the 185Re
            and 187Re neutron capture cross sections measured in
            this work (40083.002 and 006) weighted by their
            natural isotopic abundances."
