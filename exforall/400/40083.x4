TITLE       Cross Section of the Fast-neutron Reactions (n,gamma)
           and (n,2n) for Re isotopes
METHOD     (ACTIV)
            Absolute activity of Re-186, Re-188, Au-198, Na-24 was
           defined by 4PI-counting method by proportional
           methane-filled flow-type counter.
            Absolute activity of Re-184, Re-184-M was defined from
           gammas of 895. and 904 keV registered by scintillation
           gamma spectrometer with NaI(Tl) crystal of 900-keV
           gamma registration efficiency (1.00+-0.05) % .
           The identification of activities was done by HLs,
           gamma-spectra, absorption curves in Al, beta spectra
           from scin. beta spectrometer.

INC-SPECT     Two different spectra, both close to the spectrum of
           fission neutrons. Neutron flux ~10**14 n/cm2;
           irradiation time 3-6 hr.
SAMPLE      Natural rhenium
ANALYSIS    EN-DUMMY means the energy of monoenergetic neutrons,
           at which the CS of (n,gamma) reaction is equal to the
           cross section obtained with neutron spectrum.
