TITLE      Method Of Direct Measurement Of The
           Capture-to-fission Cross-section Ratio
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSKUR) Electron Linear Accelerator
INC-SOURCE  25 MeV Electron Reactions On Uranium Sample
SAMPLE      U-235 Layer of 0.8 mg/cm2 thickness on Aluminum foil
            of 5 microm thickness Was Placed In the Chamber along
            neutron beam. U-235 weight - 24 mg.
METHOD     (TOF)      Time Of Flight, flight path 5 m.
DETECTOR  1(IOCH) Ionization Chamber With 95.0 Percent Of
           Efficiency Of Fission Cases Registration. Argon (95%)
           and C-O2 (5%) mixture as working gas at presure
           130 mm Hg.
          2(NAICR) Capture Was Registreted Simultaneously By Two
            NaI(Tl) Crystals of 200 mm diameter and 100mm lenght
           (BF3)          For Reducing Measurement Series To
           Common Neutron Beam Three Monitors Were Used (Two BF3
           Proportional Counters And One NaI(Tl) Crystal
           Scintillation Counter)
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,ABS),,ALF) In Energy range 0.55-20 eV
            For Determination Of Absolute Alpha Value
           The Calibration Was Made.
