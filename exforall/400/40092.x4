FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSFEI) APS reactor.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Plutonium and uranium fission chambers were
            used at measurements on thermal neutron spectrum
           (SCIN) Scintillation detector with stilbene crystal
            was used for neutron and gammas registration
CORRECTION  Calculated corrections were introduced on
            gammas and neutron absorption and scattering,
            neutron multiplication in sample,
            admixture of their isotopes,
            nonmonochromatic neutron beam.
METHOD     (COINC) Gammas and neutron count quantities
            in coincidence with fissions were determined.
            Total gammas and neutron count quantities
            and count quantity of delayed irradiation gammas of
            fission fragments were also determined.
