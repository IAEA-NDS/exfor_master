TITLE      U-238 NEUTRON RESONANCE RADIATION WIDTH
FACILITY   (REAC)  FAST PULSED REACTOR WITH LINEAR ACCELERATOR
INC-SPECT  RESONANCE NEUTRONS WITH TIME RESOLUTION 6.NSEC/M
SAMPLE     (METAL) METALLIC SAMPLE OF NATURAL URANIUM WITH
           THICKNESS 1.4 MM AND 12.MM AND 190.MM IN DIAMETER
           FOR TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS AND 1.MM THICKNESS AND
           160.MM IN DIAMETER FOR RADIOACTIVE CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS
METHOD     (TOF) TIME-OF-FLIGHT.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  SECTIONAL LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTOR WITH
           VOLUME 250. LITRES AND CYLINDRICAL CHANNEL ON AXIS
           IN RADIATIVE CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS. DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
           WAS CONSTANT IN RESONANCE ENERGY RANGE.
           THAT DETECTOR IN TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS BUT
           MATERIAL WITH LARGE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION WAS
           INTRODUCED INTO AXIS CHANNEL INSTEAD OF SAMPLE
ANALYSIS   (AREA) AREA ANALYSIS WITH ACCOUNTING OF INTERFERENCE
           BETWEEN RESONANCE AND POTENTIAL SCATTERING
MONITOR    FLUX BEHAVIOR WITH ENERGY WAS DETERMINED FROM
           THIN BORON COUNTER MEASUREMENTS. ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION
           OF PRODUCT OF NEUTRON FLUX AND DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
           WAS CARRIED OUT BY DETERMINATION OF RESONANCE GAP AREA
           IN MEASUREMENTS FOR RESONANCES WITH ELASTIC WIDTH
           MORE LESS THAN GAMMA-WIDTH
PART-DET   (G) GAMMA-RAYS FOR RADIATIVE CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS
           (N) NEUTRONS IN TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS

HISTORY    (610617C)
CORRECTION CORRECTION ON NEUTRON CAPTURE AFTER SCATTERING WAS
           INTRODUCED WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY
ERR-ANALYS (EN-RES-ERR) IS DETERMINED BY RESOLUTION
