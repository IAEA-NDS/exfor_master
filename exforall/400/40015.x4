FACILITY   (VDG)      Van de Graaff Accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-T,D-D)  Proton-tritium and deuteron-deuterium
                      reactions
METHOD     (FISCT)    Direct detection of fission fragments
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    Cylindrical glass detector.
           Fission fragments were detected at 10 angles
           from 0 to 90 degree .
           Samples of fissionable isotopes were located at 12.5
           and 150 degrees relative to proton (or deuteron) beam.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied for irregularity of neutron
           beam and effect of centre-mass movement
ANALYSIS              The coefficients of angular anisotropy
                      A=W(0)/W(PI/2)-1  were evaluated by
                      method of least square fit.

HISTORY    (19700813C)
           (20140812S) M.M. Subent 001 was restored.
           Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           Subents 002,003 were deleted due to duplication with
            40277.002, .003.
