TITLE      NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION OF PU-240 NEAR THRESHOLD
EXP-YEAR   (67)
FACILITY   (VDG)      VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      PROTON-TRITIUM
SAMPLE     PLUTONIUM-240 OXIDE LAYER WITH 93.0 PERCENT
           ENRICHMENT (THE REST - PU-239 AND ABOUT 0.1 PERCENT
           PU-241) AND PLUTONIUM-239 OXIDE LAYER WERE USED
METHOD     PU-240 AND PU-239 OXIDE LAYERS ON THE SAME PLANE AT
           ANGLE 45.0 DEGREES TOWARDS NEUTRON BEAM WERE PLACED
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    GLASS DETECTOR
ANALYSIS   EXPERIMENT GEOMETRY GIVEN ANGLE RESOLUTION ABOUT 5.0
           DEGREES.
           ANGULAR ANISOTROPY COEFFICIENT VALUES WERE OBTAINED BY
           METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES
PART-DET   (FF)       FISSION FRAGMENTS
STATUS                NUMERICAL DATA FROM YF 12,(2),260,7008
HISTORY    (711203C)
ERR-ANALYS MEASUREMENT ACCURACY WAS LIMITED BY INSUFFICIENT
           ISOTOPE PURITY OF PU-240 TARGET USED.
