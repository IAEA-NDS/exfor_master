TITLE      Fission of Pu-240 by neutrons near threshold
EXP-YEAR   (1967)
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)      Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      Proton-tritium
SAMPLE     (94-PU-240,ENR=0.93) Plutonium-240 oxide layer with
           93.0% enrichment (the rest - Pu-239 and Pu-241 about
           0.1% ) and plutonium-239 oxide layer were used .
METHOD     Pu-240 and Pu-239 oxide layers on the same plane at
           angle 45.0 degrees relative to proton beam were placed
REL-REF    (M,,A.S.Soldatov+,J,PTE,,(5),226,1968)
            Details of method .
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    Glass detector for fission fragments.
ANALYSIS   Experiment geometry given angle resolution about 5.0
           degrees.
           Angular anisotropy coefficient values were obtained by
           method of least squares
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments
STATUS     (TABLE)  Table of YF,12,(2),260,1970.
ERR-ANALYS Measurement accuracy was limited by insufficient
           isotope purity of Pu-240 target used.
           (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. Even in the text of the article it's
           mentioned, that ALPHA values ( see Eq.1) are presented,
           but really ratio W(0deg)/W(90deg) are given in the
           table and plotted also on Fig.1.
HISTORY    (19711203C)
           (20141115A) SD: Updated to new date formats,lower case.
             Ref. on Engl.transl. of YF added. Data in Subents
             002-003 were restored.
           (20150914A) M.M. Article was checked, BIB information
           was updated in TITLE, SAMPLE,REL-REF,STATUS.
           NUMBER=2 and COMMENT were deleted.
           ANG, ANG-RSL were added in COMMON block.
            REACTION was corrected :
           DA,FF,COS/RSD -> DA,FF,RSD - ratio W(0deg)/W(90deg).
           COMMENT of compiler was added.
