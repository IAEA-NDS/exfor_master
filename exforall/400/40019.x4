TITLE       Relative yields of xenon isotopes in Np-237 and

SAMPLE      Neptunium-oxide, Pu-239 impurity content is less 1.E-4
            -1.E-5 % of weight.
            Two samples of 9.0 mg weight each were heated at 1000-
           110 deg C, then packed in Al capsules.
           1-st samples was irradiated by thermal neutrons of
            6.E+13 n/sec/cm*2 neutron beam during 250 hr.
           2-nd sample was covered by Cd of 1mm and irradiated
           during 500 hr by neutrons of average effective energy
           > 0.5 MeV and 6.E+12 n/sec/cm**2.
