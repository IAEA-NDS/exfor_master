            Details of method.
METHOD      Relative dependence of the fission cross section was
           measured, then the absolute normalization was done at
           a definite neutron energy 270 keV.
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    Fission chamber
           (LONGC)    Long counter was used for flux monitoring;
           calibrated by H-28 Ra-Be standard source.
MONITOR               Standard source  for calibration of
                      flux monitor
CORRECTION Backgrounds:
           proton energy 1299 keV :
            - for U235 at 10deg (EN=342 keV) - 11%,
                       at 140deg (EN=3.4keV) - 40%.
            - for U333 at 10deg - 11%,
                       at 140deg - 45%.
            proton energy 1400 and 1600 keV - less 10-20% .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty of the relative measurement
           includes:
            * errors in the determination in the number of
              fission events in the chamber,including:
              - statistical error,
              - the error in the computation for the probability
                of neutron scattering in the target.
            - Other uncertainties :
           (ERR-2) Error in the extrapolation of characteristics
           of the working U chamber in thermal neutron flux.
           (ERR-3) Error associated with the correction for
            fragment absorption in the uranium layer.
           (ERR-4) Error in the determination of the amount
            of U-235 in the layer of natural uranium.
           (ERR-1,2.,14.) Uncertainty of neutron flux - usually
           2-3 %, for 9 keV - 6%, for 3.4 keV -14.%;
           includes:
           (DATA-ERR1)Uncertainty of intensity of the standard
           neutron source used to define detector efficiency .
           The total error in the determination of the absolute
           fission cross section is approximately 8% for U-235 and
           approximately 9% for U233 (except three points: 3.4,
            9. and 30 keV).

ANALYSIS   Cross sections were determined using the well-known
           ratio of the fission cross sections for these elements
           for thermal neutrons: Sig(U-235)/Sig(U-233)=1.10 to
           define amount of U233 - at additional irradiation by
           subcadmium neutrons.
INC-SPECT   Resolution for incident neutrons
            at energy  3.4 keV was 0.7 keV
            at energy  200 keV was 17  keV
            at energy  340 keV was 9.5 keV
            at higher energies of incident neutrons
            resolution was changed from 10 up to 40 keV
