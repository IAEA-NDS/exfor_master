INC-SOURCE  Fast neutrons of 0.3MeV energy were slowing down in
            paraffin block.
INC-SPECT   Cadmium ratio about 15.
CORRECTION For registration efficiency dependence from place of
            neutron source.
           For energy dependence and angular anisotropy  of
           detector efficiency.
           For discrimination of part of fission events.
           For pulses loses at coincidence registration.
           For background due to admixtures  in samples and
           fission by scattered neutrons.
COMMENT     EN=0.0253 eV energy was supposed by compiler.
