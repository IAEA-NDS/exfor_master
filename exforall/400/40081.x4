SAMPLE      URANIUM-FLUORIDE WAS PLACED ON ALUMINIUM FOIL(NAT.
            URANIUM).SAMPLE THICKNESS WAS 0.1  MM AND SAMPLE
            DIAMETER WAS 19.0 MM.URANIUM ISOTOPE COMPOSITION WAS
            CHECKED ON ALPHA SPECTROMETER. URANIUM WEIGHT WAS
            ABOUT 10.0 MILLIGRAMMES AND WAS DETERMINED BY ALPHA-
            ACTIVITY LAYERS MEASUREMENTS
MONITOR     ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT
INC-SOURCE (D-D)THIN DEUTERIUM-TITANIUM TARGET ON MOLYBDENUM FOIL
           WITH 0.3 MM THICKNESS WAS USED
FACILITY              NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE
METHOD     (ASSOP)    DIRECT DETECTION WITH NEUTRON FLUX DETER-
           MINATION BY METHOD OF ACCOMPANING PARTICLES
