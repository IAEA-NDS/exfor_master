SAMPLE      Uranium-fluoride was placed on aluminum foil(natural
            uranium). Sample thickness was 0.1  mm and sample
            diameter was 19.0 mm. Uranium isotope composition was
            checked on alpha spectrometer. Uranium weight was
            about 10.0 milligrams  and was determined by alpha-
            activity layers measurements
MONITOR     Absolute measurement
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSRI) No information available
METHOD     (ASSOP)    Direct detection with neutron flux
           determination by method of accompanying particles
           (FISCT) Stack of ten layers of U and 5 layers mica,
            each mica layer registered fragments from two layers.
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Five mica layers recorded the FF from ten
            uranium layers.
            Registration efficiency (96.0+-1.0)% .
           (PROPC)        Neutron flux was determined by   He-3
                           proportional counter with low pressure
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information available
CORRECTION Corrections were introduced on
            * efficiency of fission fragments registration by
             mica
            * account from uranium-235 fission fragments - 2.0%
            * shape correction was 1.0%
            * irregularity of neutron flux density in uranium
              layer limits  - 2.0%
            * correction on fissions by scattered neutrons -
               limits - 4.+-1 %
            * correction on efficiency of neutron flux
              registration and its change
            * count-pulse amplitude analysis - (2.0+-1.0)%
