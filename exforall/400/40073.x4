TITLE      ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS OF THE RATIO OF NEUTRON CAPTURE
           CROSS SECTION TO FISSION CROSS SECTION (ALPHA) FOR
           URANIUM-235 AND PLUTONIUM-239 AT NEUTRON ENERGIES FROM
           10.0 KEV TO 1.0 MEV
FACILITY   (VDG) PULSED ELECTROSTATIC ACCELERATOR VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)PROTON-LITHIUM 7.METAL LITHIUM TARGETS WERE USED
           (P-T)PROTON-TRITIUM.STANDARD TRITIUM -TITANIUM TARGETS
           WERE USED
SAMPLE     (METAL) PU-239 OF 40.MM DIAMETER AND 2.9E+21 NUCLEI
           /CM**2 OF DENSITY WITH PU-240 CONTENT OF 0.2 PERCENT
           OXIDE  URANIUM OCTOOXIDE (U3O8) WAS ENRICHED WITH     4
           U-235 TO 90.3 PER CENT .SAMPLE DENSITY WAS EQUAL TO
           4.1E+21 NUCLEI/CM**2
           FOR BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS EQUIVALENT SCATTERING
           SAMPLES OF CARBON AND LEAD WERE USED
METHOD     (TOF) EXPERIMENT WAS MADE ON NEUTRON TIME-OF-FLIGHT
           SPECTROMETER WITH FLIGHT PATH 1.125 M AND TIME
           RESOLUTION 18.0 NSEC/M FOR NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE FROM
           10.0 KEV UP TO 80.0 KEV AND ENERGY RESOLUTION FROM 10.0
           KEV UP TO 30.0 KEV FOR NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE FROM 100.0
           KEV UP TO 1.0 MEV AT WORK ON MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS.
           ALPHA MEASUREMENT METHOD AND EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY
           WERE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN REPORT OF THE SAME AUTHORS
           AT KIEV CONFERENCE IN MAY 1971.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)   LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTOR LOADED
           WITH CADMIUM WAS USED
