TITLE      Measurement of energy spectrum and average number
           of prompt fission neutrons
METHOD     (TOF)   Time-of-flight method for measurement of prompt
           neutron spectra used . TOF base 50 cm. Time resolution
            3.5 nsec.
           (COINC)    Coincidence
           Neutron spectra of investigated isotopes were measured
           intermittently with measurement of U235 fission neutron
           spectrum by thermal neutrons. U-235 spectrum was
           supposed to be proportional to sqrt(E)*exp(-E/T) with
           T=1.29 MeV. Parameters of U-235 spectrum:
ASSUMED    (ASSUM1,92-U-235(N,F)0-NN-1,,KEM)
           (ASSUM2,92-U-235(N,F)0-NN-1,PR,KE)
             Average kinetic energy of prompt
           fission neutrons at fission by thermal neutrons .
            NU is given in Subents 002-007 as MONIT.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     Scintillation detectors:
           -Gas scintillation chamber - for fission fragments
           registration. 40 cm diameter, 40 cm long, filled with
           helium, connected with FEU-53.
           -Plastic scintillator - for neutrons registration .
            100 mm diameter, 30 mm long, connected with FEU-63,
           Protected by 15 mm lead layer. Detector threshold was
           constantly controls by 59.6 keV gammas of Am-241.
           Neutron detector efficiency dependence from energy was
           determined by U-235 neutron spectrum, taking into
           account T=1.29 MeV.
