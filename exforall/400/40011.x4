MONITOR     No information.
           Absolute counting of fission events.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           Initially, this MONITOR was compiled in 1970 by reactio
             (U-235(N,F),,DE,FF,REL)=1. .
            In 2014 reaction is
             "(U-235(N,F),,AKE,FF) =1. at thermal fission" ,
            what is wrong, because AKE,FF at thermal fission is
           about 170 MeV (TKE) .
FACILITY   (VDG,4ZZZDUB)      Van de Graaff EG-5
            Proton current ~20-30 microA.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)   Thickness of Li target is 0.38 mg/cm2,
                     diameter is equal to 1cm .
            Energy resolution at all points is about 0.08 MeV.
            For fast neutrons in 0.15 MeV - 1.68 MeV energy range.
            - Thermal neutrons were obtained by slowing-down in
           paraffin block.
SAMPLE     Two samples in ionization chamber. Diameter 9.2 cm .
           Thickness ~ 1.8 mg/cm2 .
METHOD     (FISCT)
           Cyclic measurements at fast and thermal neutron beams
           about 30 min at each beam.
           2PI geometry in combination with samples rotation at
           45 deg to avoid influence from angular anisotropy of
           fission fragments.
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission-fragments
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Double ionization fission chamber.
           Registration discrimination thresholds 55-60 MeV and
           20 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation.

ANALYSIS    Relative yield W of fission fragments was defined as:
           W=(N1fast/N2fast)/(N1thermal/N2thermal),
           N1 - number of counts in 1st sample with high
           discrimination threshold E1=55-60 MeV,
           N2 - number of counts in 2nd sample with low
           discrimination threshold E2=20 MeV; corrected for
           backgrounds due to alpha-particles
            ( average background ~ 2count/min).
           fast - for fast neutrons,
           thermal - for thermal neutrons.
           Maximal counts rate in measurement at thermal neutrons
            about 200 count/sec.
EN-SEC     (E1-MIN,FF) High discrimination threshold E1=55-60 MeV.
           (E2-MIN,FF) Low discrimination threshold E2=20 MeV.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           On Fig.1 these data are given in two Y scales:
           left - W ( see ANALYSIS), right - deltaEk, where
           deltaEk - average deviation of fission fragments
             kinetic energy at fission by fast neutrons EKfast
             from one at fission by thermal neutrons EKthermal,
             EKfast-EKthermal.
            Scale values correspondence:
           W,no-dim   deltaEk,MeV
           0.96       -0.8
           0.98       -0.4
           1.00       0.
           1.02       0.4
           1.04       0.8
           So, to define deltaEk (MeV) from W values (no-dim),
           a formula could be applied:
           deltaEk= (W-1.)*20  .
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary measurement.
