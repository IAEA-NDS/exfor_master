DETECTOR   (SCIN)     SCINTILLATION DETECTOR UNSENSIBLE TO GAMMAS
                      ON BASE OF EALIER ELABORATED DETECTOR,
                      PTE,3,56,1965. IN ORDER TO USE DETECTOR
                      FOR INELASTIC CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT
                      ITS CRYSTAL WAS REDUCED TO 1.1 CM IN DIAM,
                      AND 0.95 CM IN HEIGHT BESIDES THAT
                      PHOTOMULTIPLIERS WERE MOVED OFF 15 CM
                      FROM IT.
CORRECTION   CORRECTIONS WERE MADE ON  FINITE GEOMETRY
             AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) ARE-MAINLY STATISTICAL.
