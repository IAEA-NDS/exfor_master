TITLE      Gamma ray spectra produced upon capture of thermal
           neutrons by the nuclei Zn-64,66,67,68
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIFU)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Horizontal channel of reactor.
           Converging collimator 1950 mm long with entrance and
           exit aperture diameters 30 and 14 mm, respectively.
           Filters of 55mm single-crystal silicon and 30mm bismuth
           were inserted in collimator to reduce the fast-neutron
           and gamma-ray backgrounds.
INC-SPECT  Flux of thermal neutrons to the sample was
           6.E+7 n/sec/cm2. The cadmium ratio of 6.was determined
           by Au of 4 mg/cm2 thickness.
METHOD     Direct detection of gamma-rays
DETECTOR   (GELI) Germanium-lithium drift detector with sensitive
                      volume 1 cm**3
           Energy resolution of spectrometer was 6 keV at E-gamma
           1 MeV and 11-15 keV at E-gamma 3-7 MeV.
            55 mm distance from detector center to sample center.
           Detector was protected:
           - against scattered thermal neutrons and gamma rays by
           6 mm Li6(2)CO and 2 mm lead;
           - against exp.background by 50 mm of lead and 200 mm of
           paraffin with boric acid.
           Spectrometer was calibrated in energy by gamma lines of
           Cl-36, Ti-49,S-33, Si-29; absolute values of these
           gamma-lines (as given by different authors) differ by
           as much as 10 keV.
           Absolute efficiency of the detector was determined in
           the measured range of gamma energy by the known
           intensity of reliably identified gamma-lines of the Zn
           isotopes.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)    Shape analysis
MONITOR    Gamma-line intensity of Zn isotopes were used for
           determination of absolute efficiency of the detector
           data from G.A.Bartholomew et al. Nucl.Data,3,4-6,367,
           1967 and L.V.Groshev et al. J,IZV,30,1136,1966

REL-REF     Two REL-REFs for intensities of Zn isotopes
           gamma-lines, used to define detector efficiency:
           (R,,G.A.Bartholomew+,J,ND/A,3,(4-6),367,1967)
            Energies of cascades were used.

           In ICD-1,14 data are from:
           (R,,S.K.Mangal+,J,NP,36,(4),542,1962)
ERR-ANALYS Absolute energy-error was 10 keV .
           Relative energy-error was 2-4 keV in dependence of the
           gamma-rays intensity.
