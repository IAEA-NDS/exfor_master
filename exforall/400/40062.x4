           indicated. Cadmium neutron spectrum limit was supposed
           to be equal to 0.4 eV

REACTION   (95-AM-242(N,F),,RI)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The samples were irradiated by flux 5.E+07
              neutron/cm**2/sec.
SAMPLE     A few micrograms of Am-241 (99.9 % of Am-241 and
           0.1 % of Pu-239) on backing of beryllium or titanium
METHOD            Counter ratio.For determination of thermal cross
           sections samples were irradiated with cadmium cover and
           without one
DETECTOR   (FISCH) In experiments double ionization chamber
           was used
           (SI) For alpha-activity measuring
