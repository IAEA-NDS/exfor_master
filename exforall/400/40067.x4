TITLE      Relative yields of delayed neutrons from Uranium238
           fission by neutrons with energies in the range
           3.9-5.1 MeV .
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)  Van de Graaff KG-2.5
SAMPLE     Metal. sample. Weight 30 gram
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Ti-D target of 1mg/cm2 thickness , 45mm diameter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 300 sec.
           Decay curves of the delayed neutrons were recorded
           for 1024 sec with a channel width 1 sec.
ANALYSIS   Expansion on exponents by Least Square Method
PART-DET   (N) Neutrons
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean Square Error

REACTION   ((92-U-238(N,F),DL/GRP,NU)//(92-U-238(N,F),DL/GRP,NU))
            Relative to the first group of delayed neutrons
ANALYSIS   Defined from data of 2 series, each of 30 measurements.
           The decay curves were expanded by the least-squares
           method fro specified half-life values.
