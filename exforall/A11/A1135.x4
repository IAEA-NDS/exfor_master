REFERENCE  (J,BAP,1,(2),93(M2),1956)
AUTHOR     (L.Stewart,G.M.Frye Jr,L.Rosen)
TITLE      Zero-degree cross sections for the D(d,n)3He reaction
           between 1.15 and 4.60 MeV and for the T(p,n)3He
           reaction 8.8 to 11.4 MeV
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALAS)
METHOD     (REC) The shape of the spectrum was determined by a
           range analysis of the proton recoil projected into a
           rectangular pyramid of half-angle 17 degree
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford C-2 emulsions
ANALYSIS   Corrections were applied for relative humidity,escape
           probability and emulsion attenuation
