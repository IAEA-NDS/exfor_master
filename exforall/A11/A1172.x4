TITLE      Effective cross section measurement of D(t,n)4He
           reaction in deuteron energy range 40 to 730 keV
FACILITY   (CCW,4RUSLEB)
PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Two proportional counters
METHOD     (BCINT)
COMMENT    -By authors.  Registration of alpha-particles was
           carried out simultaneously from a gas target and from
           the solid one by different counters.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties were calculated as average
           for statistical deviations in different runs and
           possible systematic errors:
           (ERR-1) The influence of geometry;
           (ERR-4) The uncertainty of beam current.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of beam energy has been
           determined by accelerator voltage instability.

METHOD     (EXTB) HT+ beam was used.
COMMENT    -By compiler of CAJAD. The measurements were produced
           with tritium beam, but measured data were recalculated
           by authors for deuteron energy.
