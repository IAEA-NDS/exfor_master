TITLE      A Note on the He-3+D Nuclear Reaction Cross Section
AUTHOR     (W.Moller,F.Besenbacher)
INSTITUTE  (2DENAAU)
REFERENCE  (J,NIM,168,111,198001)
SAMPLE     The Deuterium Targets were Prepared by Ion Implantation
           Of Deuterons Into Silicon Wafers
METHOD     (PHD)
FACILITY   (VDG,2DENAAU)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two surface-barrier detectors were positioned
           at the laboratory angles 90. and 135. degr., each
           with a depletion depth of 300 mu-m.
MONITOR    (1-H-2(D,P)1-H-3,,SIG)
           The absolute total cross section was then found by
           comparing the results to the product of the relative
           total cross sections(3He + D)/(D + D) measured in the
           second run and the literature values of the D+D cross
                                                          section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,,3.) The statistical errors of the individual
           points are <3% (standard deviation) except for the
           point at 200 keV (7%).
           (ERR-1,,1.5) The error introduced by the normalizing
           procedure is not larger than 1.5%,
           (MONIT-ERR) the absolute D(d, p)T cross section is
           assumed to be known to within -+3%.

REACTION   (1-H-2(HE3,P)2-HE-4,,SIG)
           Integral cross section was calculated from differential
           cros section using formula: dSig=Sig/(4*Pi)*Fa, whereas
              Fa - anisotropy factor written in terms of Legendre
              polynomials.
REL-REF    (N,C0987002,J.L.Yarnell+,J,PR,90,292,1953)
            Up to 1 MeV, the angular dependence is sufficiently
            described by three Legendre coefficients, which
            have been derived from the angular distributions of
            Yarnell et al., using a fitting procedure.

STATUS     (TABLE) From IBANDL Data Base.
COMMENT    - By CAJAD - Data Table in IBANDL Data Base Does not
           Contain Data Uncertainty.  Therefore Former Value of
           Absolute Uncertainty has Been Saved.
HISTORY    (20110814A) SD: Units for energy corrected: MEV -> KEV
            DATA-ERR deleted - no any relation between table and
            this value.
