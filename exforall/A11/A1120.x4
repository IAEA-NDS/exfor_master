TITLE      Neutrons from the D-D reactions
FACILITY   (VDG,1USALAS)
SAMPLE     A gas target was 6 cm long, filled with D2 gas at a
           pressure of 60 cm of Hg, and sealed off from the
           vacuum system by a nickel foil 1.5mu thick.

           (1-H-2(D,N)2-HE-3,,DA)
            The two parts of the curve given by the two reactions
           were normalized to each other in the region several
           Mev wide in which they overlap. By means of the
           sensitivity curve obtained in this way,it is then
           possible to compare directly the yields obtained for
           the breakup neutrons and the neutrons from the reaction
           D(d,n)3He in terms of the known cross section of the
           latter reaction
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are the sum of the statistical
           uncertainty and an additional error, which is hard
           to estimate, due to inaccuracy of the background
           subtraction.
           (DATA-ERR1) The uncertainty in the absolute value of
           the cross-section scale is due to the uncertainty of
           the normalizing procedure just referred to, and to the
           uncertainty in the cross section of the D(d,n)HE-3
           reaction.
