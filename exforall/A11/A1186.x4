TITLE      2H(p,g)3He reaction using polarized and
           unpolarized protons
SAMPLE     CD2 targets (92% enrichment) were fabricated by
           dissolving
           CD2 powder in xylene and then allowing the xylene to
           boil off in a glycerine bath
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) For gamma
MONITOR   1(6-C-12(P,G)7-N-13,,SIG)
           The 12C(p,g)N13 was used at Eg=15.07 MeV (0.833+-0.22*
           *10**-19) photons/incident proton to determine the
           efficiency of the spectrometer to be 0.17+-0.012
          2(1-H-2(P,EL)1-H-2,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors reported here were obtained by
           multiplying the standard deviations by the value of hi.
           (DATA-ERR1) Absolute error

ANALYSIS   (4PI1A) At the paper was given the coefficient a0, and
           sigma(total)=4*pi*a0 calculated by compiler
FLAG       (0.) Standard description
           (1.) The cross section is nearly zero at 0 and 180 degr
           a second fit was performed in which the cross section
           was constrained to be essentially zero at these angles
           but with errors taken to be indicative of the errors in
           the present experiment.
