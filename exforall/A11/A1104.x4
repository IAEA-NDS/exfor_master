TITLE      Range distribution of charged particles from the D-D
           reactions for 10 MeV deuterons: differential elastic
           cross section at 40 degrees, 60 degrees and 80 degrees
           in the center-of-mass system

SAMPLE     A gas target, contained 99.4% deuterium. Three
           different gas targets were used, one for each of the
           angles investigated, the reaction products being
           simultaneously recorded by two cameras, one on each
           side of the target, with the exception of the 40
           degree target for which only one camera was used.
METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Each camera contained a 100-micron Ilford C-2
           plate behind a thin aluminum window at the front of
           the camera.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the number of incident beam
           particles that passed through the target
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in the number of tracks appearing
           on a swath of accurately known width
           (ERR-3) Accuracy in the width of swath
