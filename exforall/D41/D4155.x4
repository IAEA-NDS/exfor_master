           induced nuclear reactions for light element analysis

FACILITY   (VDG,3HUNDEB)
SAMPLE     Thin film samples were prepared onto Ta and Al
           substrate simultaneously.
           For the chemical and thickness analysis of the thin
           layers Rutherford backscattering spectrometry was
           applied using focused ion beams of a few tens of
           micrometer size. DIGE measurements were performed also
           on the samples with aluminium substrate at 1.8 MeV
           deuteron energy, approximately on the same areas as
           the RBS measurements. Comparing the measured gamma
           yields, the number density of a certain isotope on the
           tantalum substrate could be deduced from the RBS
           results for the same isotope on the aluminum foil.
METHOD     (SITA,GSPEC,TTM)
           The DIGE measurements were carried out on the right
           30 degree beamline of the 5 MV Van de Graaff
           electrostatic accelerator of ATOMKI.
           The experimental set-up was specially designed in order
           to provide ideal circumstances for the measurements.
           Provision was made to minimize background gamma
           radiation.
           The sample was positioned in the middle of an
           electrically insulated chamber, which served as an
           ideal Faraday cup. The current dose was measured on
           the chamber by an ORTEC 439 digital current integrator.
           The measurement on each thin target was started at a
           beam energy of 2 MeV and continued downwards with
           energy steps of 50 keV until 0.6 MeV. In some cases,
           to see certain parts of the yield curves more detailed,
           measurements at further energy points were made. To
           check the stability of each target, control
           measurements were also made after completing a series
           of measurements in the 2-0.6 MeV range. The applied
           beam current was gradually increased from 2 nA to
           10 nA conforming to the decreasing cross-section values
           with decreasing deuteron energy.
ANALYSIS   The method that was applied for the accurate
           determination of gamma-ray production cross-section is
           based on the basic formula of yield calculus in thick
           and intermediate thick targets, utilizing thick target
           yields measured on compounds and also the measured
           thin target gamma-ray yield curves.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma radiation was detected by a HPGe
           detector, placed at an angle of 60 degree to the beam
           axis and at a distance of 10 cm from the target.
           Nominal relative efficiency: 40%, resolution: 2 keV
           at 1.33 MeV gamma-energy. Length and diameter of the
           Ge crystal: 61.5 mm and 59.5 mm.
           The absolute efficiency (the product of the intrinsic
           efficiency and the solid angle of the detector) was
           determined by a 152Eu radioactive source, placed at
           the target position.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) From the excitation curve measurement on a
           thick target a beam energy spread of 1.5 keV was
           deduced and an energy shift of 2 keV from the earlier
           calibration was observed. These shifts cause generally
           less than 0.5% relative error in the measured cross-
           section values, and this error does not exceed 2% even
           at the steepest section of the curves, thus it is
           negligible in comparison to the other error values.
           (ERR-S) The statistical error of each presented value
           was calculated according to the well-known rule of
           error propagation. Namely, it was derived from the
           errors of the measured thin target yields and that of
           K which depends on the thin/thick target yields.
           The statistical uncertainty of net peak area values was
           0.5-2% except some thin target spectra at low
           bombarding energy where it reached 6-8%.
           Accuracy of the cross-section data is affected through
           the following factors:
            * certified concentration of the analyzed element
              in the thick target <1.0%,
            * accumulated charge <0.3%,
            * absolute efficiency of the gamma-ray detection ~3%,
            * stopping power of the sample for the bombarding
              particle ~3%.
           The fact that the samples have finite thickness can
           introduce further error which have to be taken into
           consideration at the 11B(d,p)12B reaction. The
           contribution is less than 2% above 1.2 MeV but can
           reach 5-10% at low deuteron energies.
           From the above-mentioned data it follows that the
           overall accuracy of cross-section determination is
           less then 7% in the case of the 6Li(d,p)7Li,
                                           9Be(d,n)10B,
                                           16O(d,p)17O and
                                           19F(d,p)20F reactions
           and less than 9% at the 11B(d,p)12B reaction, except
           some low energy data of minor analytical importance.
ADD-RES    Fitting adequate functions to the measured values
           below 1 MeV, the yield curves were extrapolated to the
           0-0.6 MeV energy range and then converted into
           cross-sections.

SAMPLE     Titanium-oxide layer was deposited onto Ta substrate
           by DC reactive magnetron sputtering from pure (99.999%)
           Ti target. During the deposition the oxygen was added
           to the argon plasma.
