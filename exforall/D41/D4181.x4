TITLE      Investigation of activation cross sections of the
           proton induced nuclear reactions on natural iron at
           medium energies

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Large stacks containing more than 70 high-purity foils
           of different materials and thicknesses were irradiated.
           Al and Cu foils were put into the stack both for
           monitoring and for energy degradation purposes.
           Irradiation time: 30 to 60 min.
           The stacks were disassembled after the irradiation and
           the foils were measured individually several times,
           just after the irradiation and after a shorter and a
           longer cooling time to follow the decay properties of
           the different isotopes produced.
           In several cases decomposition of the complicated
           peaks was necessary.
           Nondestructive measurement without chemical separation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The irradiated samples were measured off-line
           by high-resolution gamma spectrometry.

           The energy degradation along the stack was determined
           by calculation on the basis of Andersen and Ziegler.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) It is not specified.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
