SAMPLE     High purity foils, thicknesses:  Er 32., Yb 30.,
           Al 25.5, Ti 12. micron.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Two stacks of natural erbium and two stacks of natural
           ytterbium target foils were irradiated, each
           interlarded with Ti monitor foils. At the beginning of
           one of the two stacks an Al degrader foil was placed
           to ensure a small energy shift.
           Incident alpha energies: 37.5, 37.9, 38.5 and 39.0 MeV,
           beam currents: 119.5, 108.8, 136.9 and 127.6 nA,
           irradiation times:  2.00, 2.58, 1.55 and 1.58 hours
           in the case of the two erbium and two ytterbium stacks,
           respectively.
           No chemical separation.
           The gamma spectra of the target foils were registered
           by a PC-coupled HPGe detector system just after the
           end of bombardment and again a month later to get
           information for the radionuclei of short and long
           half-life as well and to follow cumulative processes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           The sample-detector distance was chosen carefully to
           avoid pile-up effects and coincidence losses. The
           detector efficiency was determined placing standard
           sources at different distances from the detector.

           The mean bombarding energy of the beam in the
           subsequent foils was calculated following the
           polynomial approximation for stopping power of
           Andersen and Ziegler.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from WWW Table of Radioactive
           Isotopes by Ekstrom and Firestone, database version:
           2/28/99.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainty of the beam at the
           first foil is 0.3 MeV which increases along the stack
           due to the energy straggling and the uncertainty of
           target thicknesses and reaches 1.5 MeV at the last
           foil.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties of the cross sections were
           determined in the standard way: the linearly
           contributing independent processes were taken into
           account extracting square root of quadratically summed
           relative uncertainties, namely:
            * number of the bombarding particles (7%),
            * number of the target nuclei (3%),
            * decay data (3%),
            * detector efficiency (7%) and
            * peak area (1-10%).
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections and the results of the model calculations
           integral yields were calculated and compared to
           experimental yields taken from the literature.
