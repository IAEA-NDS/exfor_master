SAMPLE      Evaporated highly enriched 106Cd and natural Cd.
                     Enriched target composition
                     106Cd      96.47%
                     108Cd       2.05%
            other Cd isotopes    1.48%

            Targets were prepared by evaporation onto Al backing.
            Thicknes was determined by weighting. Irradiation was
            done at VdG from 2.4 to 3.6 MeV and at cyclotron beams
            from 3.6 to 4.8 MeV for 10 hours 500nA. Beam current
            was constant and recorded in 10 s time steps.
            Target stability was monitored by measuring the
            backscattered protons.
            Decay of 107In and 109In was followed by gamma
            measurement.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) For beam and target stability monitoring
           (HPGE) For gamma measurements
ERR-ANALYS  Only the detector efficiency error was given 9%.
