METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Stacked target technique was used. Irradiations were
           done in vacuum at 10, 12, 14, 18.5, 20 and 45 MeV at
           CV28 cyclotron, and the injector cyclotron of COSY
           synchrotron Julich and MGC20E cyclotron, Debrecen.
           High resolution gamma spectrometry was applied without
           chemical separation.
           The stacks contained besides the target foils Cu
           monitor foils and Al energy degrader foils.
           Beam current was measured in Faraday-cup 100-200nA
           and was also monitored by nuclear reactions on Cu.
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           tables of Williamson et. al. 1966.
           Energy scale and beam intensity along the stacks were
           corrected according to the applied monitor reactions.
           The whole excitation functions of the monitor reactions
           was remeasured and compared to the recommended values.
SAMPLE     Targets were Tm2O3 thulium(III)oxide powder prepared by
           sedimentation technique (99.9% pure).
           Tm2O3 powder was suspended in EtOH/H2O and sedimented
           onto 100micron thick Al backing, than covered by 10
           micron Al.
           Target layer varied between 10 and 20 mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam 0.3 MeV.
           (ERR-T) Total errors were given. Correction of the beam
           was made using the monitor reactions.
                Contributing errors:
                sample weighting                  1%
                uniformity of the sample          5%
                beam intensity                 9-11%
                detector efficiency             3-4%
                peak area and statistical error 5-6%
                nuclear data                  0.1-1%

STATUS     Data were taken from Table 2. and
           (APRVD) approved by S. Takacs.
