TITLE      Study of the 192Os(d,2n) reaction for production of the
           therapeutic radionuclide 192Ir in no-carrier added form

SAMPLE     Enriched 84.5% 192Os electrodeposited on 25 micron
           thick Ni backing. Also Ti monitor foils were inserted
           into the stack. Sample thickness 4-10 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Stack target technique
           deuteron energy:21 MeV.
           beam intensity: 300 nA.
           The charge was measured in a Faraday-cup type target
           holder.
           The energy degradation was calculated by using the
           semi empirical formula of Andersen and Ziegler (1977).
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT (Kinsey et al 1997).
           Samples and monitor foils were measured
           non-destructively.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NUDAT (Kinsey et al 1997).
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)  The uncertainty of the average energy of the
           foils of the stack, was calculated from the
           uncertainties of the foil thickness, the energy
           degradation and the uncertainty of the primary energy
           of the beam.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty included the usual
           individual uncertainties and amounted to 12% ~50%.

METHOD      The spectra were taken after the total decay of the M1
            isomeric state. Contribution from the decay of the M2
            isomeric state was neglected.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from Table 2 of the ref.

METHOD      Contribution of the secondary neutrons induced (n,g)
            reaction was neglected since no activity was measured
            in the Os foil placed beyond the range of the deuteron
            beam.
