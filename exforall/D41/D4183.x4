SAMPLE     High purity Pd foils, thickness: 12.14 and 7.99 micron.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Pd foils were stacked with Al and Cu monitor foils.
           Incident proton energies: 70 MeV at CYRIC in Japan,
                      37.3, 28.5 and 15.9 MeV at VUB in Belgium.
           beam intensities: 100-200 nA,
           irradiation time: 0.1-1.0 hours.
           The beam intensity, the incident energy and the energy
           degradation were controlled by a method based on flux
           constancy via normalization to the parallel measured
           excitation functions of the monitor reactions.
           The measurements started after a few hours after the
           end of bombardment at VUB and after one and half day
           at CYRIC.
           The beam currents were deduced from the monitor
           reactions, the number of the target nuclei from the
           precise mass and surface determination of the target
           foil.
           The calculated energy degradation of the incident
           beam was checked and corrected on the basis of the
           monitor reactions.
           Nondestructive measurement without chemical separation.

           Energy degradaton in the stacks was calculated by using
           the stopping power data and polynomial approximation of
           Andersen and Ziegler.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from the ENSDF, NuDat data files.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) For estimation of the uncertainties of the
           cross sections the linearly contributing processes were
           taken into account by equal sensitivities. The errors
           of nonlinear parameters (time) were not considered but
           their contribution was minimal compared to other
           processes.The typical total resulting errors were
           around 8-13%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) Calculations for the excitation functions using
           the ALICE-IPPE code were performed with a view to
           estimate the weight of the different contributing
           reactions and to check the trend and the magnitude of
           the obtained experimental data.
