TITLE      New experimental data on excitation functions for
           practical applications of alpha induced nuclear
           reactions on Ta up to 30 MeV.

SAMPLE     Natural Ta foils (8.6 microns)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked targets were irradiated
           with alpha beam of 20 and 36 MeV primary energy.
           Stacks contained Ta (8.6 microns) and Cu (7.6 microns)
           foils. Gamma spectrometry was used without chemical
           separation. Beam current was measured in Faraday cup
           and also monitored with reactions on Cu. Incident beam
           energy was determined by magnetic deflection and time
           of flight. Foils thickness was determined by measuring
           the weight and area of the samples. Nuclear data were
           taken from the Lund database
           http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/
           Experimental data were assigned to the mid energy point
           in the target foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) GeLi and HpGe  gamma detectors
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Ziegler's stopping formula was used to
           estimate the energy and its uncertainty.
           (ERR-T) Total errors were given taking the square root
           of the of the sum of the square of the individual
           contributing errors.
