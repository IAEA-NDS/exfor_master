METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Stacked gas target technique was used. Cylindrical
           stainless steel cells 20mm in diam. 25 mm length.
           15 micron thick kapton (polyimid) and 25 and 50 micron
           thick Al windows were used. Gas pressure 0.42-0.92 bar.
           Ti (12.5 and 20 microns) and Cu (10 micron) foils were
           used as monitor foils.
           Beam intensity was 100-200nA and was measured in
           Faraday cup. Maximum difference between the values
           measured by Faraday cup and deduced from monitor
           reacrions was 20%
           Primary energies were between 7.4 and 14.3 MeV.
           Nine irradiations were done.
           High resolution gamma spectrometry was applied without
           chemical separation. Spectra were measured after the
           total decay of the short lived isomer states.
           The stacks contained 3-5 cells.
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           polynomial approximation of Andersen and Ziegler.
           Energy scale and beam intensity along the stacks were
           corrected according to the applied monitor reactions.
           Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone
           Table of Isotopes.

           was made using the monitor reactions. Detector
           efficiency was 5%.
