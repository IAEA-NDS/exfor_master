METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           - Stacked gas target technique was used.
           - Cylindrical stainless steel cells 20mm in diam. 25
             mm length.
           - 15 micron thick kapton (polyimid) and 25 and 50
             micron thick Al windows were used.
           - Gas pressure 0.42-0.92 bar.
           - Ti (12.5 and 20 microns) and Cu (10 micron) foils
             were used as monitor foils.
           - Beam intensity was 100-200nA and was measured in
             Faraday cup.
           - Maximum difference between the values measured by
             Faraday cup and deduced from monitor reactions was
             20%.
           - Primary energies were between 7.4 and 14.3 MeV.
           - Nine irradiations were done.
           - High resolution gamma spectrometry was applied
             without chemical separation. Spectra were measured
             after the total decay of the short lived isomer
             states.
           - The stacks contained 3-5 cells.
           - Energy degradation was calculated by using the
             polynomial approximation of Andersen and Ziegler.
           - Energy scale and beam intensity along the stacks
             were  corrected according to the applied monitor
             reactions.
           Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone
           Table of Isotopes.
