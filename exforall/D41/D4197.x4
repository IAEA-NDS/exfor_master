TITLE      Formation of the isomeric pairs 139Ndm,g and
           141Ndm,g in proton and 3He-particle induced nuclear
           reactions

SAMPLE     Pr2O3 and CeO2 oxide in powder form
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Samples were prepared by sedimentation onto 25
           micron thick Cu backing than were covered by 10
           micron Al foil. For 141Ndm sigle target with Cu
           monitor foil was irradiated. Primary proton
           energies: 12.16 and 20 MeV. For 3He beam the primary
           energies were: 25 and 36 MeV. Ti foils were used as
           monitors. Al absorber foils were used to modify the
           bombarding energy. Irradiations were done at the
           CV28 cyclotron of Juelich. For 139mNd stacked target
           technique was used. Five samples, absorbers and
           monitor foils were staked together. Primary proton
           energy was 44 MeV at the COSY cyclotron and 20 MeV
           at CV28 cyclotron. Average of 100nA beam current was
           used. Gamma-spectara were recorded several times to
           check the half life and follow the decay. Detector
           sample distance was about 10 cm.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone, Table of
           Isotopes, CDROM version 1.0, 1996.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of  model calculation STAPRE.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) no details are given.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty on the measured cross
           sections was 15-20%, the uncertainty of the
           calculated isomeric cross section ratio was about 25%.
