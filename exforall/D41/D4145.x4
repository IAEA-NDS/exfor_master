SAMPLE     Target was solid boron nitride BN samples 0.2 mm thick.
           Al foils micron thick were used as energy degrader.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) BN samples were irradiated with
           30-170nA beam at 26 MeV for 3 minutes.
           The beam current was measured in Faraday cup and was
           also monitored with Cu foils. No numerical monitor
           values were given in the article.
           Decay was followed for several half life to identify
           the produced radioisotopes.
           The energy degradation was calculated by the method of
           Williamson (1966). Decay data were taken from Browne
           and Firestone (1986).
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curve analysis of the annihilation peak
           was applied.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HpGe  high purity germanium gamma detector
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Total error of the data were up to 15-20%.
