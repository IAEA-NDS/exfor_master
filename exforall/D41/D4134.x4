           (CYCLO,3HUNDEB) MGC 20E Cyclotron of Debrecen
SAMPLE     Targets were natural neon gas. Pressure was 1 bar for
           deuteron irradiation and 3 bar for p, 3He and alpha
           irradiation.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           used max 3 cells were placed in one stack. Cell window
           was made of Al, Ti or Ag. Beam current was determined
           by Faraday-cup and by using monitor reactions.
           The max. difference between the two method was about
           30%. The difference in the beam current determined by
           by two monitor reactions was about 5%.
           For deuteron irradiation the cells were irradiated
           individually
           Decay data were taken from E.Browne, R.Firestone, Table
           Of Radioactive Isotopes, V.S.Shirley [Ed], Wiley,
           London, 1986.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity Ge gamma detector
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty was determined by using the
           primary uncertainty, the sraggling effect, stopping
           uncertainty and it ranges from 0.5 to 3.2 MeV.
           (ERR-T)Total error was estimated in average about 17%
              statistical error and peak area     1-20%

              membrane effect of the target windows  3%
