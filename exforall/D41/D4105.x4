TITLE      Comparison between reactions of alpha particles with
           Scandium-45 and deuterons with Titanium-47.
AUTHOR     (K.L.CHEN,J.M.MILLER)

           (1USABNL)Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY
REFERENCE  (J,PR,B134,1269,1964)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABNL) 60-inch cyclotron of BNL.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP) Conventional stacked foil
           technique was used with bombarding deuteron and alpha
           beams. Beam current was measured in Faraday cup. The
           energy of the beam was monitored using copper foils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) To measure 48V beta-proportional counter was
            used.
ERR-ANALYS The uncertainty of the incident alpha energy was
           0.2 MeV. No error bars are given to cross section
           points. The main contributing error sources in
            cross sections are estimated to be:
                      target thickness        1-5%
                      beam current              5%
                      detector efficiency    5-15%
