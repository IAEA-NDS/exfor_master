SAMPLE     Targets were made by evaporating natural metallic Ge
           on thin, high purity Al foils. The thickness of the
           targets varied between 50 and 290 mu-g/cm2,
           corresponding to a proton energy loss of ~2 keV at
           Ep=4.4 MeV and ~25 keV at Ep=1.6 MeV, respectively.
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           The irradiations were carried out at the Van de Graaff
           and cyclotron accelerators of ATOMKI. The energy range
           was Ep=1.6 to 4.4 MeV covered with 400 keV steps.
           Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was used to monitor
           the target stability with a surface barrier detector
           at 150 degree. Faraday cup was used to collect
           the charge using a proton beam current less than 500nA.
           Secondary electron supression was used with -300 V.
           Irradiation lasted between 3 and 11 h. Measurements
           started 0.5h after end of irradiations.
           The energy loss was calculated using the SRIM code.
           Cross sections and astrophysical S factor were derived
           from the primary data.
           Reaction Rates were calculated from the measured data.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
                  values of Optical Model calculation.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from Nucl. Data Sheets:
           68,579,1993 and 74,63,1995.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainties of the center-of-mass
            energies correspond to the energy loss in the target
            calculated with the SRIM code and for the energy
            stability of the beam.
           (ERR-T)The uncertainty in the cross section (S factor)
            values is the quadratic sum of the following partial
            uncertainties in counting statistics 0.8 to 11% and
            uncertainties described in ERR-1 - ERR-4
           (ERR-1) efficiency of the HPGe detector
           (ERR-2) number of target atoms
           (ERR-3) current measurement
           (ERR-4) uncertainties of the level parameters
