SAMPLE     High purity metallic foils (>99.9%) from Goodfellow.
                  Mo 11.98 micron
                  Al 26.0  micron
                  Ti 12.05 micron
                  Ni 25.6  micron
                  Cu 23.83 micron
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           used. Stacks contained foils in a Mo-Al-Cu-Ni-Ti
           seguence. Al foil served as energy degrader and catcher
           Cu-Ni-Ti foils were used as monitors. Beam current was
           measured in Faraday-Cup. Irradiation lasted about 30
           min. With 200 nA beam current at 25 and 39.1 MeV.
           Decay data were taken from E.Browne, R.Firestone, Table
           of Radioactive Isotopes, V.S.Shirley [Ed], Wiley,
           London, 1986.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity Ge gamma detector
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
           (28-NI-0(P,X)28-NI-57,,SIG)
           (22-TI-0(P,X)23-V-48,,SIG)Several monitor foils
           and target foils were placed in the same stack. This
           way the whole excitation function of the monitor
           reaction was remeasured and compared with the
           recommended values. It made possible simultaneous
           determination of the bombarding energy and beam
           intensity. Also in to check the energy degradation
           along the stack.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The uncertainty of the primary beam energy was
           +-0.3 MeV. The energy attenuation was calculated by
           using the polynomial approximation of Andersen and
           Ziegler along the stacks. The mean energy uncertainty
           varies from +-0.3 to +-0.8 MeV along the stacks.
           (ERR-T)Total error of the data varied from 9% to 12%.
           Main contributing error components are:
               Beam intensity                     5-8%
               Detector efficiency                3-6%
               Peak area and counting statistics  1-5%
               Separation of complex peaks       5-15%
               Number of target nuclei              1%
               Nuclear data                         3%
STATUS     Numerical data were taken from Table 4. of the
           publication.
