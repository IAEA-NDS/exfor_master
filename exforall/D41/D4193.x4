TITLE      New measurement and evaluation of the excitation
            function of the 186W(p,n) nuclear reaction for
            production of the therapeutic radioisotope 186Re

METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Two stacks containing 21 um thick natural W foils were
            irradiated with 15 MeV and one stack with 35 MeV
            protons using stack target technique.
           The charge was measured in a Faraday-cup type target
            holder.
           The energy degradation was calculated by using the
            semi empirical formula of Andersen and Ziegler (1977).
           Samples and monitor foils 12 um Ti were measured
            non-destructively.
           The final beam intensity and irradiation energy was
            determined by using the excitation function of the
            natTi(p,x)48V monitor reaction remeasured over the
            whole energy range.
           All foils were measured without any chemical processing
            by using high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry (HPGe)
           The measurements of the samples were started about
            1 day after the end of the bombardment and repeated
            after 5 days.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the average energy
            calculated from the uncertainties of the foil
            thickness, the energy degradation and the uncertainty
            of the primary energy of the beam.
           (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainty included the usual
            individual uncertainties (12%-50%)
