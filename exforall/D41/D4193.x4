SAMPLE     (74-W-0,NAT=100)Natural Tungstan foils 21 micron
           thick. Also Ti monitor foils were inserted
           into the stack.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Two stacks containing 21 micrometer thick natural W
           foils were irradiated with 15 MeV and one stack with
           35 MeV protons using stack target technique.
           The charge was measured in a Faraday-cup type target
           holder.
           The energy degradation was calculated by using the
           semi empirical formula of Andersen and Ziegler (1977).
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT (Kinsey et al 1997).
           Samples and monitor foils 12 microns Ti were measured
           non-destructively.
           The final beam intensity and irradiation energy was
           determined by using the excitation function of the
           natTi(p,x)48V monitor reaction remeasured over the
           whole energy range.
           All foils were measured without any chemical processing
           by using high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry (HpGe).
           The measurements of the samples were started about 1
           day after the end of the bombardment and repeated
           after 5 days.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NUDAT (Kinsey et al 1997).
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)  The uncertainty of the average energy of the
           foils of the stack, was calculated from the
           uncertainties of the foil thickness, the energy
           degradation and the uncertainty of the primary energy
           of the beam.
           (ERR-T) The total uncertainty included the usual
           individual uncertainties and amounted to 12% ~50%.
