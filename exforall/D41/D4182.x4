SAMPLE     High purity natural nickel foils,
           thickness: 23.7 micron.
           Two stacks were irradiated, in one of the stacks Ni
           served as backing for electro-deposited Os used in a
           separate evaluation.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Interleaved with the Ni or Os/Ni foils, Ti foils were
           inserted as monitor for determination of reliable beam
           characteristics (energy and intensity) and for checking
           the energy degradation along the stack. The stacks were
           irradiated in a Faraday-cup like target holder,
           equipped with a long collimator for precise definition
           of beam diameter and with a negatively polarized guard
           electrode to suppress secondary electrons.
           Incident deuteron energy: 20.5 MeV,
           beam intensity: 200 nA,
           irradiation time: 0.5 h.
           The count rate was in all cases low so that corrections
           for pile up effects and dead time could be implemented
           through the acquisition and analyzing software.
           The charge on target was first derived from the
           Faraday-cup measurement. Adaptations in beam current
           and energy were made, based on parallel remeasuring of
           the excitation function for the monitor reaction over
           the whole energy region.

DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from NUDAT2 database.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam energy is
           0.2 MeV. The uncertainty on the average energy of the
           last foil of a stack, due to the uncertainty on the
           foil thickness and to energy degradation is estimated
           at 2.5 MeV.
           (ERR-T) For estimation of standard uncertainty on the
           cross section values the individual uncertainties
           included in the propagated error are:
            * number of target nuclei including
              non-uniformity (8%),
            * incident particle intensity (5%),
            * detection efficiency (5%),
            * peak areas including statistical errors (5-15%),
            * gamma decay data (1-5%).
           The total uncertainty of 10-20% is obtained as
           positive square root of a sum of the contributing
           sources in quadrature.
           The non-linear effects of the possible uncertainty of
           the half-lives were not taken into account.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared
           with earlier literature values.
           (THEO) The predictive capability of the ALICE-IPPE,
           EMPIRE-II and GNASH model codes was tested.
           (TTY-C) Thick target yields were deduced from the
           experimental cross sections

REACTION   (28-NI-64(D,2N)29-CU-64,,SIG)
COMMENT    Only the reaction 64Ni(d,2n)64Cu can contribute to the
           production of 64Cu in a deuteron irradiation of natNi.
DECAY-DATA (29-CU-64,12.7HR,DG,1345.,0.0047)
METHOD     The larger statistical uncertainty due to the low
           intensity cannot be fully compensated by long
           measurement times as the limited half-life of 64Cu and
           the need to measure all foils of the stack preferably
           twice within two or three half-lives, puts a limit on
           the measurement time. The main advantage over the
           traditional assessment method (measuring the
           annihilation radiation) is the absence of interference
           and background signals.
