SAMPLE     Thin osmium samples were prepared by electrolytic
            deposition of enriched 192Os (chemical purity: 99.9+%,
            isotopic composition: 84.5% 192Os, 15.2% 190Os, 0.3%
            189Os) on 25 micron thick Ni foils (99.9% pure) from
            an alkaline solution.
           The absence of all oxides could be confirmed.
           The osmium deposit was covered by a 10 micron thick Al
            foil. Monitor foils: Ti and Cu (both >99.6% pure)
            with thicknesses of 10 and 25 micron.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Several stacks consisting of a few 192Os samples and
            thin Ti and Cu monitor foils were irradiated.
           Primary alpha energy: 28 MeV.
           The beam flux was measured by charge integration as
            well as via monitor reactions.
           A chemical separation procedure was applied to isolate
            the radioplatinum from the background activity, thus
            enabling the preparation of a clean and thin source
            suitable for X-ray counting.
           The yield of radiochemical separation was between 60%
            and 90%. The gamma-ray analysis also showed that the
            contamination of radioplatinum by non-isotopic
            radionuclidic impurities (56,58Co, 65Zn, etc.) was
            <0.01%.
           Spectra were recorded several times to check the half-
           life of the products.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           An HPGe detector with a thin Be-window (a special
            detector for low-energy gamma-rays) was used.
           The sample to detector distance was 3 cm.
           For measuring the activity of each monitor foil as
            well as for determining the radiocontaminants in each
            radioplatinum sample, standard gamma-ray spectrometry
            using a large-size HPGe detector was applied.
           The sample to detector distance was between 10 and
            50 cm in the case of monitor foils, and between 3 and
            5 cm while measuring the chemically separated
            radioplatinum samples.

METHOD     The activity of the radiochemically separated 195mPt
           was determined using a gamma-ray at 98.9 keV and also
           a K-alpha X-ray of energy 66.8 keV. The threshold of
           the 192Os(a,3n)193mPt reaction lies at about 23 MeV.
           For the calculation of the cross-section of the
           192Os(a,n)195mPt reaction above 23 MeV only the
           gamma-ray was used.

REACTION   (76-OS-192(A,3N)78-PT-193-M,,SIG)
DECAY-DATA (78-PT-193-M,4.33D,XR,66.8,0.074)
METHOD     The K-alpha X-ray line at 66.8 keV was used to
           determine the activity of 193mPt, after subtracting
           the contribution of 195mPt.
           It should be pointed out that at 23.5 MeV, besides
           the reaction 192Os(a,3n)193mPt the reaction
           190Os(a,n)193mPt may also contribute to the formation
           of 193mPt. However, considering the low abundance of
           190Os in the enriched 192Os sample and assuming the
           cross-section of the 190Os(a,n) reaction to be similar
           to that of the 192Os(a,n) reaction, the contribution of
           the 190Os(a,n) reaction to the formation of 193mPt was
           estimated to be <10% of that of the 192Os(a,3n)
           process, i.e. within the limits of experimental
           uncertainties. At energies >24 MeV this contribution
           becomes negligible.
