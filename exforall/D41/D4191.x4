FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) CV 28 cyclotron of Juelich
SAMPLE     Samples for charged particle irradiations were high
           purity (>99.99%) nat-SrCo3, nat-CeO2, Pr2O3, nat-Nd2O3
           and Tm2O3 powder prepared by sedimentation technique.
           The fine powder was suspended in water-free acetone
           and in some cases 3 to 5% cellulose nitrate.
           200 microliter suspension was used for each sample.
           Target backing was 25 um thick Cu foil 13 mm in
           diameter. The resulting target layer was 10 mm in
           diameter. The deposited layer was covered by 10 um
           of Al foil.
           Preparing the nat-RbCl target the powder was pressed
           on an Al foil of 10 um thickness under a pressure of
           6 ton/cm2 for 15 min then was covered by 10 um thick
           Al foil.
           For neutron irradiations the samples were 1.5 to 2.5 g
           of nat-Eu2O3 mixed with 2.5 g KCl and pressed at
           10 ton/cm2 to a pallet of 2 cm diameter and 0.3 mm
           thickness.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Stack target technique
           proton energies:12, 16, 20 MeV
           He-3 energies: 25, 36 MeV
           He-4 energy:26.5 MeV
           Stacks containing Ti and Cu monitor foils were
           irradiated with beam of 100 nA. The charge was measured
           a Faraday-cup type target holder.
           The energy degradation was calculated by using formula
           of Wiliamson et al. CEA-R 3042(1966).
           Samples and monitor foils were measured
           non-destructively.

METHOD      No details were given about the data measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)  The uncertainty of the average energy of the
           foils of the stack, was calculated from the
           uncertainties of the foil thickness, the energy
           degradation and the uncertainty of the primary energy
           of the beam.
           (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainty included the usual
           individual uncertainties and amounted to 10% 50%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from Table 4 of the ref.
