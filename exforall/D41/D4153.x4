SAMPLE     Targets were high purity natural Pd foils of 12.14 and
           7.99 microns from GoodFellow.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)
           Stacked target technique was used. Initial energies:
           20.5 and 15.1 MeV for deuterons and 37.3, 28.5 and
           15.9 MeV for protons.
           Ti, Cu and Ni were used as monitor foils.
           Beam intensity was 100-200nA and was also measured in
           Faraday cup.
           Five irradiations were done.
           High resolution gamma spectrometry was applied without
           chemical separation. Spectra were measured after the
           total decay of the short lived isomer states.
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           polynomial approximation of Andersen and Ziegler.
           Energy scale and beam intensity along the stacks were
           corrected according to the applied monitor reactions.
           Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam 0.3 MeV.
           The enrgy uncertainty in the last foil of a thich stack
           was 1.7 MeV for protons.
           (ERR-T) Total errors were given. Correction of the beam
           was made using the monitor reactions.
