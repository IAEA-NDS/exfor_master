SAMPLE     Targets for cross section measurements were prepared by
           evaporating 2-10 microns of high purity 209Bi onto 8.3
           micron Cu backings. Targets for production yield were
           prepared on 1 mm thick Al and Cu backings with
           thickness of 35-300 microns.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           used. Stacks were irradiated at 28 MeV with 120 nA for
           1-1.5 hours. Production targets were irradiated with
           0.5-2.0 microA for 2 hours. Beam current was measured
           in Faraday-cup and was also monitored by reactions on
           Cu 63Cu(3He,x)61Cu and 65Cu(3He,x)66Ga. The initial
           beam energy was determined by using monitor reactions.
           No monitor values are given.
           Decay data were taken from E.Browne, R.Firestone, Table
           of Radioactive Isotopes, V.S.Shirley [Ed], Wiley,
           London, 1986.
           Chemical separation of astatine was applied for the
           samples irradiated for determining the production yield
            (Dry-distillation). No experimental yield values are
           given. Calculated yields are given in graphycal form.

          2(29-CU-65(HE3,X)31-GA-66,,SIG)Several monitor foils
           and target foils were placed in the same stack. This
           way the whole excitation function of the monitor
           reaction was remeasured and compared with the
           recommended values. It made possible simultaneous
           determination of the bombarding energy and beam
           intensity. Also in to check the energy degradation
           along the stack.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The primary energy was determined by iteration
           based on monitor reactions. The energy attenuation was
           calculated by using the method of Williamson.
           (ERR-T) Total error of the data is around 12-17%.
           Main contributing error components are:
               Beam intensity                      10%
               Detector Efficiency                  5%
