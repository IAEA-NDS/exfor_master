SAMPLE     Targets for cross section measurements were prepared by
           electrolytic deposition of 99.0% enriched 120Te on 25
           micron Ti foils. The target homogenety was checked
           under microscope. The deposited Te (1.8-3.8mg) was
           covered by 40microg/cm2 Levaprene and 10micron Al foil.
           Targets were same that were used in experiment 1998
           Exfor entry: D4121 (J,ARI,49,1493,1998)
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Five stacks were irradiated
           each containing 4 or 5 Te samples with 100nA deuteron
           beam at 13.5+-0.2MeV primary particle energy. The
           natTi(d,x)48V reaction in the backing was used to
           monitor the beam. Stacks were irradiated for 20min at
           the Cv28 cyclotron.
           No numerical monitor values are given.
           The energy degradation was calculated by the method of
           Williamson (1966). Decay data were taken from Browne
           and Firestone (1986).
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(P,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,S.TAKACS+,J,ARI,48,657,1997) No monitor cross
           section values are given.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Details are given in (J,ARI,49,1493,1998)
           The primary energy was determined by using
           the cyclotron parameters. The energy attenuation was
           calculated by using the method of Williamson.
           (ERR-T) Details are given in (J,ARI,49,1493,1998)
           Total error of the data is around 17-22%.
           Main contributing error components are:
               Target thickness                     5%
               Target inhomogenety                 10%
               Beam intensity                      10%
               Detector Efficiency                  5%
               Peak area                         5-15%
