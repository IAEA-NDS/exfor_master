SAMPLE     Target was high purity  natural N2 gas filled in gas
           cells at pressure of 2 bars. Also solid boron nitride
           BN samples 0.2 mm thick were prepared. Al foils 50-700
           micron thick were used as energy degrader.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Individual gas cells and
           several gas cells stacked together were irradiated
           with 30-170nA beam at 12, 16 and 20 MeV for 3 minutes.
           Additionaly six BN sapmles were irradiated with the
           same beam parameterrs.
           The beam current was measured in Faraday cup and was
           also monitored with Cu foils. No numerical monitor
           values were given in the article.
           Decay was followed for several half life to identify
           the produced radioisotopes.
           The energy degradation was calculated by the method of
           Williamson (1966). Decay data were taken from Browne
           and Firestone (1986).

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary energy was
           +-0.2MeV as determined by using the cyclotron
           parameters and increased up to 1.1MeV along the stacks.
           The energy attenuation was calculated by using the
           method of Williamson (1966).
           (ERR-T)Total error of the data were up to 15-20%.
           Main contributing error components are:
               Number of target nuclei           5-10%
               Decay data                           3%
               Beam intensity                      10%
               Absolute activity                 7-12%
               Peak area                          2-7%
