SAMPLE     Natural metal foils of Mo, Nb, Zr, Y were used.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,STTA)
           Standard stacked foil irradiation method was used.
           Each stack contained other high purity metallic foils
           such as Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, W that allowed accurate
           assessment of the beam intensity and the energy
           degradation along the stacks and a cross-check of the
           measured cross sections.
           Primary proton energy: 80MeV
           Primary deuteron energy: 21, 30, 40, 50 MeV,
           Irradiations were done with low intensity external
           beams of the cyclotrons <200nA, irradiation times were
           less than 1h.
           Gamma spectra were measured non-destructively on a
           HPGe detector.
           Decay data were taken from NUDAT on-line database.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature and results of model
           calculations.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections and selected data taken from the literature
           integral yields were calculated and plotted in
           Figs. 8 and 9 of the reference.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Uncertainties of the beams (0.5-3.0 MeV) were
           estimated combining the uncetainties of the primary
           energy of the beam, the energy degradation and the
           energy straggling.
           (ERR-T) Uncertainties of the cross sections were
           estimated in the knowledge of relative uncertainties:
           number of the bombarding particles (7%), number of the
           target nuclei (3%), decay data (3%), detector
           efficiency (5%), peak area (1-10%). The total error
           was 10-15%.
