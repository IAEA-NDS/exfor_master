TITLE      Production of positron-emitting 110mIn via the
           110Cd(3He,3n)110Sn-110mIn process

SAMPLE     Enriched Cd-110 target material was used in metallic
           form 200mg diameter 13mm thickness 0.14mm. Uniformity
           of the target foi was +-5%.
                  106Cd  0.02%         112Cd     1.99%
                  108Cd  0.05%         113Cd     0.76%
                  110Cd  91.5%         114Cd     1.45%
                  111Cd  4.00%         116Cd     0.21%
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,CHSEP) The target was irradiated at
           36 MeV with 3He+ particles for 1 hour at beam currents
           of 1-5microA.
           The energy degradation was calculated by the method of
           Williamson (1966). Decay data were taken from Browne
           and Firestone (1986).
