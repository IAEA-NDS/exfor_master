FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB) CGR 560 cyclotron
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)  External deuteron beam of
            CGR 560 cyclotron of VUB, Brussels was used to
           irradiate stacks at 21.1 and 15.1 MeV.
           The stack contained the target foils and Ti
           12.1 micron monitor foils. The irradiation was done
           for half an hour at 200 nA beam current.
           The beam parameters was determined by using the
           monitor foils.
           Samples were measured three times. Two measurements
           close to EOB and one measurement 1 month after EOB to
           allow decay of short lived products.
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the
           polinomial formula of Andersen and Ziegler, 1977.
           The whole excitation functions of the monitor reactions
           was remeasured and compared to the recommended values.
SAMPLE     High purity Pt foils 12.1 and 13.4 micron thick were
           used from GoodFellow.
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(D,X)23-V-48,,SIG) The complete excitation
           function of the used monitor reactions was remeasured
           and compared with the recommended curve.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the primary beam 0.3 MeV
           and the estimated mid-energy of the target foils
           reached max. 2.0 MeV at the low energy side.
           (ERR-T) Total errors were given. Correction of the beam
           was made using the monitor reactions.
                Contributing errors:
                number of target nuclei            1%
                beam intensity                     7%
                detector efficiency                5%
                peak area and statistical error 1-10%
                nuclear data                     1-5%
ADD-RES    (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.
