SAMPLE     Enriched 54Fe in oxide powder form mixed with Al powder
                Isotopic composition:
                   Fe-54            91.6%
                   Fe-56             8.2%
                   Fe-57             0.2%
           Impurities: Mg, Al, Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Sb < 50 ppm
                       Si, Ca, Cr < 300 ppm
           The mixture of powder was pressed into pellets with
           thickness about 0.25 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC,CHSEP) The pressed samples were
           placed in a Cu backing and covered by 100 micron thick
           Cu foil. Targets were irradiated individually with
           14 MeV primary deuteron beam of 4 microA.
           The effective on-target deuteron energy was
           12.6-5.0 MeV. Irradiation time was 3 hr.
           After irradiation chemical separation was done to
           separate the 55Co and 52Mn.
