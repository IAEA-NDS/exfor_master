SAMPLE     High purity platinium and gold foils,
           Pr2O3 and CeO2 oxide in powder form prepared by
           sedimentation onto Cu backing.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Pr2O3 and CeO2 samples were prepared by sedimentation
           onto 25 micron thick Cu backing. 30 - 60 minutes
           irradiations were applied. The prmary 3He energies were
           27.7 and 36.9 MeV. Primary proton energies were 20 and
           45 MeV. Monitor foils were used to check the beam
           current and beam energy.
           Irradiations were done at the CV28 and at COSY
           cyclotrons of Juelich.
           Gamma-spectara were recorded several times to
           check the half life and follow the decay. Detector
           sample distance was about 10 cm.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone, Table of
           Isotopes, CDROM version 1.0, 1996.
ADD-RES    (COMP)Measured cross sections were compared to the
           values of  model calculation STAPRE and EMPIRE.
ERR-ANALYS The individual uncertainties of the cross sections and
           cross section ratios were combined in quadrature,
           taking into account the correlation of the data, to
           obtain an overall uncertainty of 9-31% and 9-50% for
           the cross sections and for the isomeric cross-section
           ratios, respectively.
