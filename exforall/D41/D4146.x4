           niobium.

SAMPLE     Targets were 7.5 micron thick high purity Nb foils from
           Goodfellow.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was
           applied. Beam current was measured in a Faraday-like
           target holder. 9 microns of Al foils were used to
           separate the Nb target foils. Al foils served as energy
           degraders and catcher foils. A Nb foil and the
           following Al foil were measured together.
           Irradiation was done at 10 MeV for 1 hour with 300-500
           nA deuteron beam.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HpGe  high puriy germanium gamma detector
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy uncertainty was calculated including
           the uncertainty of the primary beam, the energy loss
           and the straggling.
           (ERR-T)Total error of the data were given.
