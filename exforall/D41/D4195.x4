TITLE      Measurement and analysis of excitation functions for
           the reactions 165Ho(a,xn) (x=1-3) in the energy range
           10-40 MeV

SAMPLE     Natural holmium foils, thickness: 10.55 mg/cm2,
           spectroscopically pure, self supporting.
           The target stack contained aluminum degraders.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Alpha-beam energy: 40 MeV,
           beam current: 100 nA,
           irradiation time: 2 h.
           The flux was calculated from the charge collected in
           the Faraday cup: 1.97x10(11) particles/s/cm2.
           Diameter of the beam: 10 mm,
           after a tantalum collimator: 8 mm with uniform spatial
           distribution.
DETECTOR   (GELI) High resolution 100 cm3 detector coupled to a
           multichannel analyzer, calibrated using various
           standard sources including 152Eu which was also used
           for determining the efficiency.
REL-REF    (N,,L.C.Northcliffe+,J,ND/A,7,233,1970)
           The stopping power tables of this ref. were used for
           evaluating alpha-particle energy at successive foils
           of the stack.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy spread was obtained from the
           energy loss in the actual foil thickness as well as
           the inherent energy uncertainty of the beam.
           As the size of the circle on figures includes the
           magnitude of the statistical errors, it was impossible
           to scan cross section uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared to the
           results of the theoretical model code
           ACT (Hauser-Feshbach plus exciton model)
           and EXIFON.
