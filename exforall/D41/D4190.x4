TITLE      Nuclear reactions induced by alpha particles on
           natural ytterbium
AUTHOR     (A.S.M.A.Romo, A.A.Sonzogni, D.A.Rodriguez Sierra,

           Buenos Aires
REFERENCE  (J,RCA,57,57,1992)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
SAMPLE     Natural ytterbium foils,
           purity: 99.9%, thickness: 15.83 mg/cm**2;
           wrapped in aluminum, thickness: 3.72 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC)
           Incident energy of the alpha beam: 84.32 MeV,
           intensity: 3.2 microA.
           The beam current was determined using monitor
           excitation functions.
           The irradiation lasted 240 minutes.
           Photopeak areas were obtained by adjusting the peak
           distribution with a gaussian shape plus a straight
           background.
CORRECTION Data given by the authors in the ref. are multiplied by
           summa(ai*Ai)=173.096 to get production cross sections,
           where ai and Ai are the abundance and the atomic weight
           of the ith isotope of natural ytterbium.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           The detector was calibrated in energy and efficiency
           using a set of radioactive sources with well-known
           activities: 22Na, 57Co, 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(A,X)30-ZN-65,,SIG)
           (13-AL-27(A,X)11-NA-22,,SIG)
           Cu foils, thickness: 26.85 mg/cm**2;
           Al wrapping, thickness: 3.72 mg/cm**2.

           (B0040001,H.P.GRAF+,J,JIN,36,3647,1974)
           (B0174003,H.J.PROBST+,J,ARI,27,431,1976)
REL-REF    (N,B0009001,BOWMAN+,J,NP/A,131,513,1969)
           The calculations and the energy distribution in the
           stack were made using the code STP.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the cross sections arise
           essentially from the errors in the peak areas and the
           efficiency calibration.
           The contribution of the first factor depends on the
           peak area and the background, and was estimated to be
           around 5% to 8%.
           The second contributes with 5%.
           Therefore, the data are affected by an overall error
           of 15%.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The experimental data were compared with the
           independently interacting excitons, the Index model,
           which can explain both the equilibrium and
           pre-equilibrium effects.
