           (C,2005BRUSS,,52,2005) Abstract book. Preliminary data
           were presented at the conference.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB)
           (CYCLO,2JPNTOH)
SAMPLE     Natural iridium foils.
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,ACTIV,GSPEC)
           Two irradiations,
           initial deuteron energies: 40 and 21 MeV,
           irradiation times: 27 and 23 min,
           beam currents: 128 and 120 nA,
           counting started: 20 and 2 hours, respectively, after
           the end of bombardment and continued for several weeks.
           Nondestructive measurement without chemical separation.
           Stopping and energy degradation were calculated using
           the Andersen-Ziegler polynomial approximation.
ANALYSIS   The complex gamma spectra were analyzed with the FGM
           software developed in Dubna and iterative data
           evaluation (corrections for contribution of
           contaminating signals) was used.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from WWW Table of Radioactive
           Isotopes by L.P.Ekstrom and R.B.Firestone,
           database version: 2/28/99.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Estimated combining the uncertainties of the
           energy degradation depending on the thickness of the
           target foils in the stack and energy straggling.
           (ERR-T) Error sources:
              * number of the bombarding particles (7%),
              * number of the target nuclei (3%),
              * decay data (3%),
              * detector efficiency (5%),
              * peak area (1-10%).
           The linearly contributing independent processes were
           taken into account extracting square root of
           quadratically summed relative uncertainties.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.
