           (C,2007NICE,,137(#255),2007) Preliminary data
           for 169Yb.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB) CGR-560 cyclotron
EXP-YEAR   (2006)
SAMPLE     High purity natural foils, thicknesses:  Er 32.,
           Al 25.5, Ti 12. micron.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)
           Two stacks of 7 natural Er foils, interleaved with
           7 natural Ti monitor foils. In front of one of the
           two stacks an Al degrader foil was placed to ensure
           a small energy shift.
           Incident alpha energy: 38 MeV,
           beam currents: 119.5, 108.8 nA,
           irradiation times:  2.0, 2.6 h, respectively.
           No chemical separation.
           The spectra were registered on a PC-coupled HPGe gamma
           spectrometer. The acquisition started within 15 min
           after the end of bombardment. Each target foil was
           measured three times over a period of a month which
           rendered possible getting information about short and
           long half lived radionuclei and to follow cumulative
           processes as well.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           The samples were placed at a proper distance from the
           detector to avoid pile-up effects and coincidence
           losses. The detector efficiency was determined
           carefully by using standard sources.

           The mean bombarding energy of the beam in the
           subsequent foils was calculated following the
           polynomial approximation for stopping power of Ziegler.
DECAY-DATA Decay data were taken from WWW Table of Radioactive
           Isotopes by Ekstrom and Firestone, database version:
           2/28/99.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainty of the beam at the
           first foil is 0.3 MeV which increases along the stack
           due to the energy straggling and the uncertainty of
           target thicknesses and reaches 0.9 MeV at the last
           foil.
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties of the cross sections were
           determined in the standard way: the linearly
           contributing independent processes were taken into
           account extracting square root of quadratically summed
           relative uncertainties, namely:
            * number of the bombarding particles (7%),
            * number of the target nuclei (3%),
            * decay data (3%),
            * detector efficiency (7%) and
            * peak area (1-10%).
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured experimental data were compared to
           those found in the literature.
           (THEO) The measured experimental data were compared to
           and analyzed with theoretical calculations based on
           the model code ALICE-IPPE.
           (TTY-C) On the basis of the new experimental cross
           sections integral yields were calculated.

           Although formation of 172Er is energetically allowed
           it could not be identified in the measured spectra in
           spite of its two strong gamma lines so the feeding of
           172Tm by this parent nucleus is negligible.
