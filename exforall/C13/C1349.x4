TITLE      Hole states in the tin isotopes observed by the (p,t)
            reaction
FACILITY   (ISOCY,1USAMSU) The Michigan State University
           isochronous cyclotron.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Solid state detector telescope
           (NAICR) NaI monitor detector at a fixed laboratory
            angle of 90 degree.
           Enge split-pole spectrograph
MONITOR    The absolute cross section was obtained by measuring
           the elastic scattering at 8., 10., and 12. degr. and
           comparing with an optical model calculation.
           Calibration was performed using the known low lying
            states of the lighter tin isotopes, the oxygen and
            carbon impurities in the tin targets and also the
            58Ni(p,t) and 64Ni(p,t) reactions.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute cross sections are
           accurate to better than 10%, one of the largest
           uncertainties in extracting the cross section for the
           broad feature arises from the background subtraction.
           An estimate of this error was made by repeating the
            extraction of the peak a number of times with
           different backgrounds.
