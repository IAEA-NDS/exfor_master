TITLE      The 3H(d,n)4He reaction: A possible source of
            intermediate energy neutrons
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) K= 500 superconducting cyclotron at
            Texas A&M
INC-SOURCE 3He beams produced by the Texas A&M University 224-cm
            Cyclotron irradiated CDz targets. Typical beam spots
            at the target were 2 mm square
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
           (SCIN) Enge split-pole spectrograph by a 20-cm long,
            resistive wire proportional counter, which provided
            both position and dE information, backed by a plastic
            scintillator E detector .
SAMPLE     The measurements at 81.2 and 99.5 MeV were performed
            with a 2.25 +/- 0.08 mg/cm2 thick CD2 target. The
            128.6 MeV measurement was performed with a
            2.44 +/-0.06 mg/cm2 thick target.
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (EDE,BCINT)
MONITOR    A motor-driven Faraday cup at the exit from
           the scattering chamber allowed to compare the
           measured beam intensities before and after transport
           through the spectrograph
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT-ERR) 10% as a conservative estimate of the
            overall normalization error in cross sections
CORRECTION The background rate in the neighborhood of the
            2H(3He, alpha)1H peak was estimated by replacing the
            CD2 targets by = 9 mg/cm2 thick polyethylene and mylar
            targets.
