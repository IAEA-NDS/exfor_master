TITLE      The 3H(d, n)4He reaction: A possible source of
            intermediate energy neutrons
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) K= 500 superconducting cyclotron at
            Texas A&M
INC-SOURCE 3He beams produced by the Texas A&MUniversity 224-cm
            Cyclotron irradiated CDz targets. Typical beam spots
            at the target were 2 mm square
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
           (SCIN) Enge split-pole spectrograph by a 20-cm long,
            resistive wire proportional counter, which provided
            both position and DE information, backed by a plastic
            scintillator E detector .
SAMPLE     The measurements at 81 .2 and 99.5 MeV were performed
            with a 2.25 +/- 0.08 mg/cm2 thick CD2 target . The
            128.6 MeV measurement was performed with a
            2.44 +/-0.06 mg/cm2 thick target.
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (EDE)
MONITOR    10% as a conservative estimate of the overall
            normalization error in our cross sections
CORRECTION The background rate in the neighborhood of the
            2H(3He, alpha)1H peak was estimated by replacing the
            CD2 targets by = 9 mg/cm2 thick polyethylene and mylar
            targets.
