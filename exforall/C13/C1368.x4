TITLE      Heterogeneous vibrations in 112Sn
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAKTY) the 7-MV accelerator at the University of
            Kentucky
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Target was bombarded with nearly monoenergetic
            neutrons (DE = 60 keV). Neutrons were produced by use
            of the 3H(p, n)3He reaction (Q = -0.764 MeV)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) a BGO Compton-suppressed HPGe detector with a
            relative efficiency of about 55% and an energy
            resolution of 2.1 keV (FWHM) at 1332 keV.
SAMPLE     A 4-g cylindrical metallic sample (height = 1.6 cm,
            diameter = 0.7 cm) enriched to 99% in 112Sn.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (TOF)
MONITOR    The energy calibration was monitored with 24Na and
            137Cs radioactive sources. Efficiency and energy
            nonlinearity curves were determined with a 226Ra
            source placed at the scattering sample position.
