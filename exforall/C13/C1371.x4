TITLE      Fusion cross sections for 12C + 12C, 12C + 13C and
            13C + 13C at low energies
FACILITY   (VDGT,1CANLUQ) 7.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator of
            Universite Laval
INC-SOURCE Beam of the 12C++ and 13C++
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two NaI detectors, 12.7 cm diameter x 10.2 cm
            thick, placed on either side ofthe target chamber,
            consisting of a cross made from stainless steel tubing
            of 1.59 cm external diameter and 0.254 mm wall
            thickness.
SAMPLE     The 12C+ t2C measurements were performed in 100-200 keV
            steps with 30 microg/cm2 thick carbon (99.9 % 12C)
            foils. The 12C+13C reaction was studied carefully in
            several sets of measurements, with 12C and 13C targets
            (99.7 %), 30 microg/cm2 and 100 microg/cm2 thick.
PART-DET   (G)
METHOD     (TOF)
           Thick-target inverse-kinematics technique
MONITOR    The beam was monitored by charge integration and by
            elastic scattering.
