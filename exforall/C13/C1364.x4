TITLE      Non-Rutherford backscattering analysis of nitrogen
            content in titanium substrates
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALAS) the 3 MV tandem accelerator at the
            Ion Beam Materials Laboratory at Los Alamos National
            Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Standard Si surface barrier detectors were
            used. The typical energy resolution was about 20 keV.
            The solid angle of the detector was approximately
            2 msr.
SAMPLE     Targets for the cross section measurement were
            prepared by implanting nitrogen into a thin zirconium
            layer prepared by e-beam evaporation. The surface
            layer contained 1.86 x1El7 Zr/cm2.
PART-DET   (A)
MONITOR    The resonance at 8.81 MeV was used to measure the
            nitrogen content of laser treated titanium. The Ti
            samples, Annealed Commercial Pure Ti, were laser
            processed using pulsed excimer laser radiation at 248
            nm from a KrF laser. The samples were translated in
            front of the beam at a calibrated rate to provide
            a given number of laser pulses per position on the
            sample.
CORRECTION  Typical dead time corrections were 3-7%.
