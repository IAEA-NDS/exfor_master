SAMPLE     The target was a metallic self-supporting foil produced
           by rolling to a thickness of 100 mum. It was
           isotopically pure to 99%. Its thickness was a
           compromise between count rate and energy resolution.
           It was optimized to 100 mum, which corresponds to an
           energy resolution of 1 MeV.
COMMENT    *By authors*.It was not possible to separate and to
           distinguish between the ground state and the first
           excited state of Be-7.
           The number of Be-7 nuclei is expected to be small so
           that particle identification is important to
           distinguish between frequent background and rare
           events. Therefore, particle identification was
           performed by redundant methods.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The recoiling Be-7 nuclei were detected with
           the magnetic spectrograph Big Karl (see Rel-Ref)
           (MWPC) Detectors used to measure the reaction-product
           position, and their emission direction was two
           multiwire avalanche chambers (MWACs), each of size
             70*8 cm**2.
           (SCIN) Two layers of plastic scintillators. The first
           one was a bar with dimensions 60*8 cm**2. It had a
           thickness of 0.5 mm and served as a delta-E detector as
           well as a start detector for a TOF measurement.
           The second layer was a stack of four scintillators
           of 70*2 cm**2, each 2-mm thick. It served as an
           E-detector as well as a stop detector for the TOF
           measurement.
