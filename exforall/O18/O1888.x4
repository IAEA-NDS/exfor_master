SAMPLE     A liquid hydrogen target, thickness of 85 mg/cm**2, was
           used.
DETECTOR   (MWDC) The Multi-wire chamber (MW) and slits were used
           to guide the beam.
           (SCIN) The first scintillator (start) was used to
           account for the beam dose. The beam-halo particles and
           misaligned trajectories were rejected with the veto
           scintillator (15 mm bore) placed just before the target
           entrance.
           (IOCH) Two Multi-Sample Ionization Chambers (MUSIC),
           measured the energy loss of the particles passing
           through them. They were used to identify reactions of
           Ta-181 produced only in the hydrogen target, and not in
           any other layer of matter placed along the beam line.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) The heavy-ion synchrotron.
           (FRS,2GERGSI)
METHOD     (TOF)
CORRECTION Correction for background and target-foils was made.
