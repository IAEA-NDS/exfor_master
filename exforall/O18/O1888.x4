SAMPLE     The target consisted of a liquid hydrogen cell
            85 mg/cm**2 inside a container with 100 mum titanium
           windows and a cryostat for liquefying the hydrogen.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) The Multi-wire chamber (MW) and thick iron slits
           were used to collimate the 181Ta beam at the target.
           A first scintillator detector (start) placed upstream
           of the target, determined the beam flux.
           (IOCH) Two Multi-Sample Ionization Chambers (MUSIC),
            200 mm*80 mm window surface and 460 mm of active
           length, which measured the energy loss of the tantalum
           beam particles and that of the products of the
           reaction, respectively. These ionization chambers,
           has almost 100% efficiency for the detection of
           relativistic heavy nuclei.
           A veto scintillator with a 15 mm diameter hole placed
           just before the target allowed the rejection of beam-
           halo particles and misaligned beam trajectories.
           (SCIN) The two fission fragments were detected
           independently, but in temporal coincidence, by a double
           paddle scintillator, placed downstream of the target,
            300 mm*70 mm and 3 mm thickness each paddle.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) The SIS18 synchrotron.
           (LINAC,2GERGSI) the UNILAC linear accelerator
METHOD     (TOF)
CORRECTION Finally, the respective fission yields were normalized
           to the number of projectiles and the number of nuclei
           in the target per unit area.
