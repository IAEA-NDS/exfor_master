           oxide targets for the production of As-71 and As-72.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The incident proton energies used in
           irradiations were 45 MeV at the Injector of COSY and
                             17 MeV at the BC 1710, Juelich.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (CHSEP)
SAMPLE     The target material GeO(2)-1 g in the form of powder
           was pressed with 10 tons/cm**2 to a 13-mm diameter
           pellet, which was then placed into an Al capsule.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-resolution HPGe detectors.
ERR-ANALYS  The various factors affecting the experimental
           yields-uncertainty in the beam current measurement,
           radiation damage effect, loss in radiochemical
           separation and etc.
