FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKLN)  TANDEM accelerator of the University
                           of Cologne.
SAMPLE     Metallic isotopically-enriched molybdenum targets of
           about 400 mug/cm**2 thickness were used.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current was determined by the charge
           deposited in a Faraday cup behind the target
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 13 HPGe detectors at the Cologne gamma-ray
           detector array HORUS. Each detector features a relative
           efficiency between 40% and 80% compared to
           a 7.62*7.62 cm**2 NaI detector. The detectors were
           mounted as close as possible around the target chamber,
           so that an excellent absolute photopeak efficiency of
           almost 5% for photons of energy E(g)= 1332.5 keV could
           be provided.
           (SI) Silicon detector was placed at 135. degr. backward
           angle to monitor the stability of the target thickness
           during the experiment by measuring the Rutherford-
           scattered protons from the target
