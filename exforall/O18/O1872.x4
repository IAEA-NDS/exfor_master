TITLE      Radiative proton capture to discrete states in N-13 at
            98 and 176 MeV.

SAMPLE     A 50.0 mg/cm**2 carbon target was used.
REL-REF    (I,,B.Hoeistad+,J,NIM/A,295,172,1990) A comprehensive
           description of PACMAN spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The experimental set-up consists of a magnetic
           pair spectrometer PACMAN, a beam monitoring system
           including two threefold scintillation telescopes aimed
           at the target and two ion chambers placed in the beam
           behind the scattering chamber.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2SWDUPP) Gustav Werner cyclotron.
METHOD     (EXTB) The beam was focused to a 5 mm diameter beam
           spot.
CORRECTION Corrections according to the instrumental acceptance
           function, for losses due to the analyzing procedure,
           for overall detection inefficiencies.

STATUS     (TABLE).Table 1 of J,NP/A,621,754,1997
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS).The total systematic error to about 11%.
           The track reconstruction efficiency is determined,
           for each run, from a sample of recorded events, and it
           is therefore subjected to statistical fluctuations.
           This leads to a typically 4% error that is not included
           in the systematic error, but rather is added directly
           to the statistical error in the differential cross
           section.
           (ERR-1).Error in the target -5%
           (ERR-2).Error in the beam intensity-7%,
           (ERR-3).Error in the acceptance calculation-7% and the
           (ERR-4).Error in intensity-independent detection
           efficiency-2%.
           (ERR-S).Statistical error is reported by authors in
           table.
ADD-RES    (THEO) Model calculation.
