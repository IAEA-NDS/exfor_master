            Technique for measuring total reaction cross-
           sections is similar to the method used in this
           reference, where a silicon detector is used as both
           target and detector.

DETECTOR   (TELES,SILI,MCPLT) The final active target was a
           silicon detector,lithium compensated Si(Li), that was
            3000 mum thick. The detector active surface was
            200 mm**2 with a gold thickness on the front entrance
           window.
SAMPLE     Silicon as detector and target. (see above)
INC-SOURCE *EN-RSL-FW*.A good energy resolution on the Si(Li)
           detector of 70 keV(FWHM) at 15 MeV was obtained.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYLNS) The Li-7 beam was provided by the SMP
           TANDEM accelerator of LNS at E(lab)=12.0, 13.0, 14.6,
            15.0 and 16.0 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF) a path length for time of flight(TOF) of 86 cm.
           (EDE)
COMMENT    *By authors*.A different coincidence technique,
           inserting a micro channel plate(MCP) in line with the
           active target Si(Li) detector and measuring the TOF
           between the two detectors, was used.
           *By authors*.Two different and complementary pulse
           pile-up rejection methods were used during the
           experiment.

CORRECTION The extracted total number of reaction events was
           corrected for backscattering contamination.
COMMENT    *By compiler*.The excitation function of the total
           reaction cross-section in the energy range
             12<E(lab)<16 MeV was reported as full line on fig.9.
           The compiler use this curve with step 1 MeV.
