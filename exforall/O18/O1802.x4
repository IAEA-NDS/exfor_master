SAMPLE     (64-GD-156,ENR=0.9358) Isotopically enriched gadolinium
           metal evaporated onto carbon backings was used to form
           targets   of 100-150 mug/cm**2 thickness.
           The purity of the enriched materials is-
           Gd-156 93.58%, Gd-153 less than 0.05%,
           Gd-154 0.13%, Gd-155 1.99%, Gd-157 2.57%,
           Gd-158 1.27%, Gd-159 0.46%.

           The experimental cross sections divided by the
           Rutherford cross section were found to be  1.0 +- 0.1
           and 0.55 +- 0.05 at 60. and 90. degr., respectively.
           Theoretical calculations of these ratios with the same
           optical-model parameters which were used for the DWBA
           calculations of the (3He,alpha) cross sections give
           values of 0.92 and 0.50 in good agreement with the
           measured values.
