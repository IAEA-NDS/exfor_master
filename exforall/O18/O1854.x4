COMMENT    *By authors*.The effective energy E was determined from
           the centroids of the gamma lines for capture to the
           ground state and to the 6792 keV state and leads to
            2.0-2.4% uncertainty.

SAMPLE     A natural Mg target has been produced by evaporation of
           metallic magnesium of natural isotopic composition on
           a Ta-backing.The Mg target on Ta has been cut into two

COMMENT    *By authors*.Numerator-AMS measurement-pointer 2,
           Denominator-BGO measurement-pointer 1,
           *By authors*.A high-quality AMS measurement is possible
           and no systematic difference exists between AMS result
           and gamma-ray data.
METHOD    1(GSPEC)
          2(AMS)
SAMPLE    1A natural Mg target has been produced by evaporation of
           metallic magnesium of natural isotopic composition on
           a Ta-backing.The Mg target on Ta has been cut into two
           pieces for the HPGe detector and the BGO crystal
           measurement, respectively
          2The Mg-25 targets for these AMS measurements were
           prepared by reducing enriched MgO mixed with zirconium
           powder and evaporation with an electron gun. The target
           thickness was between 40 and 60 mug/cm**2 corresponding
           to an energy loss of 20 and 30 keV at the resonance
           energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The AMS measurement has an uncertainty of 2%
           arising from the normalization to the reference samples
           Additional systematic errors take into account the
           uncertainties of the carrier weight-0.2% and the
           efficiency of the chemical treatment of the samples-1%.
           This leads to an overall systematic uncertainty of 2.5%
           for the AMS measurement.
           The uncertainties of the corresponding gamma-ray
           measurement are given by the absolute efficiency
           determination for the BGO detector-3%,
           the decay scheme-3%, the ground-state probability
           f(0)-1%: a total systematic error of 4%. The
           uncertainty of the effective stopping power and the
           charge integration represent common uncertainties to
           both methods and therefore, were not taken into account
           in the error estimate for the wg ratio.
