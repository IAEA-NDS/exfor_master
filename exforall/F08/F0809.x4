DETECTOR   (SI) Reaction products were detected by four Si
           detectors located at backward angles.
SAMPLE     A 1 mm thick tantalum foil. The target was implanted
           up to the deuteron saturation density corresponding to
           the chemically stable stoichiometry TaD.
METHOD     (TTM)
COMMENT    Thick-target yield for the reaction 2H(d,p)3H were
           obtained by integration over the experimentally
           determined angular distribution. A reduced reaction
           yield was calculated. The reduced yield was normalized
           to the reduced yield value obtained by monitor
           measurements at the deuteron energy 25 keV to minimize
           uncertainties in the stopping power and the deuteron
           density.
