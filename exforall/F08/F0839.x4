COMMENT      Data presented on fig. 1(a)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) Angular dependencies of
           differential cross section were measured in an
           independent experiment by a single telescope
           constructed from semiconductor detectors and arranged
           outside the scattering chamber. The angular
           resolution of the detector was +- 1 degr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The error in the absolute values of the
           cross sections was about 10% and was determined
           primarily by the errors in estimating target thickness
           and in calibrating the current integrator. The
           uncertainty in target thickness was 5%.
           (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainties
