INC-SOURCE To obtain a monochromatic beam of neutrons, a calcite
           mono-crystal cut at an angle of 12.degr. was used, the
           reflection occurring from the cleavage planes.
           The wavelength of the reflected neutrons
                                                was 1.161 Angstr.
METHOD     (REFL)     Total reflection from mirrors

SAMPLE     In order to estimate the depth of penetration of the
           neutrons in the mirror, copper layers of various
           thickness were deposited in vacuum on 300x80x30 mm
           glass mirrors.
           The thickness of the copper layer varied between
           12x 10**(-6) g/cm2 and 100 x 10**(-6) g/cm2.
MONITOR    None
COMMENT    Measured at lambda =1.161A.
