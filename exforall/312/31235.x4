COMMENT    Author's comment: "As no 5.5 MeV level was observed in
           this work, its cross section for inelastic scattering
           of 14. MeV neutrons must be much less than 1.9 mb/sr
           estimated by Regis et al., but this does not provide
           evidence against its existance, since the known higher
           energy levels were not seen."
