INC-SOURCE (A-BE) A 100 mc Ra-alpha-Be neutron source
           was placed at the centre of an aluminium sphere which
           was filled with paraffin wax. The radius of the sphere
           was 10-30 cm which corresponds to the optimum thermal
           neutron output from a paraffin wax moderator
INC-SPECT   Thermal spectrum.
SAMPLE     Precise B-10 abundance in sample is unknown.
           Three defferent concerntrations
           of the boric acid solution (1.254,1.481, and
           1.675 g/100 c.c of solution)
METHOD     (TRN) Spherical transmission method
DETECTOR   The outcoming neutrons were detected by an indium foil
           of thickness 110 g/cm2. The indium foil was activated
           for nearly five half-lives of 116In, and the induced
           activity was followed for 1.5 hrs. The counting rate
           was extrapolated to zero time. Initial activity due to
           thermal neutrons only was obtained by the cadmium
           difference technique.
