INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) A 100 mc Ra-alpha-Be neutron source was placed
            at the centre of an aluminium sphere which was filled
            with paraffin wax. The radius of the sphere was 10-30
            cm which corresponds to the optimum thermal neutron
            output from a paraffin wax moderator
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum.
SAMPLE     Precise B-10 abundance in sample is unknown.
           Three different concentrations of the boric acid
            solution (1.254,1.481 and 1.675 g/100 c.c of solution)
METHOD     (TRN) Spherical transmission method
DETECTOR   The outcoming neutrons were detected by an indium foil
            of thickness 110 g/cm2. The indium foil was activated
            for nearly five half-lives of 116In, and the induced
            activity was followed for 1.5 hrs. The counting rate
            was extrapolated to zero time. Initial activity due
            to thermal neutrons only was obtained by the cadmium
            difference technique.
