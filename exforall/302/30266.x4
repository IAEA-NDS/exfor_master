TITLE      CROSS SECTION OF RH-103(N,N')RH-103M FOR 2.7 AND 14.8
           MEV NEUTRONS AND FOR NEUTRON SPECTRA FROM CF-252 AND
           PU-ALPHA-BE SOURCES
EXP-YEAR   (73)
SAMPLE     THE SELF-ABSORPTION OF K X-RAYS WAS DETERMINED USING
           DIFFERENT SAMPLE THICKNESSES FROM 43 TO 150 MG/CM**2
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD
DETECTOR   (SOLST) HIGH RESOLUTION SI(LI) X-RAY SPECTROMETER. THE
           SHAPE OF THE EFFICIENCY CURVE IN THE 20 KEV ENERGY
           REGION WAS CALCULATED FROM THE RELATIVE INTENSITY OF
           K-ALPHA AND K-BETA LINES OF IN AND RH. A U-235 SOURCE
           OF KNOWN ACTIVITY WAS USED FOR CALIBRATION.
MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,INL)49-IN-115-M,,SIG)
            .FOR RH-103M, THE INTENSITY OF THE 20 KEV K X-RAYS WAS
             TAKEN FROM H.ING AND W.G.CROSS (J.OF APPLIED RAD.AND
             ISOT.24(1973)437) TO BE = 0.0712+-0.0021 K X-RAYS PER
             DISINTEGRATION OF THE ISOMER.
            .FOR IN-115M, THE INTENSTY OF THE 25 KEV K X-RAYS WAS
             CALCULATED TO BE 0.311 K X-RAYS PER DISINTEGRATION OF
             THE ISOMER.
