TITLE      P-wave neutron capture in heavy nuclei at 25 keV
AUTHOR     (K.Siddappa,J.Rama Rao,M.Sriramachandra Murty)
INSTITUTE  (3INDAUW)
SAMPLE     Metal powders or oxides with purity greater than 99.9%
           kept in cylindrical perpex tubes 13 cm in diam.
MONITOR    (53-I-127(N,G)53-I-128,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,J.C.Robertson,J,NP,71,417,196509)
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) SB-BE photoneutron source of 20 Curies.
           Given neutron energy in J. Phys., 5A, 877, June 1972
           is 25 +- 5 kev. given neutron energy in J. of Annals of
           Phys., 83, 355, 1974 is 23 +- 5 kev.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method plus absolute gamma counting
           effective photopeak and total efficiencies of detector
           were determined experimentally and used in the
           evaluation of the cross sections
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7F8 Harshaw well-type NaI(Tl) crystal.
CORRECTION The degradation of energy of kev neutrons within the
           target material is considered negligible.
ERR-ANALYS Error includes as follows:
            - statistical error in the photo peak area varies from
              1-3% depending upon the statistics
            - errors associated with the cross section
              measurement, errors in the weights of the sample,
              duration of irradiation, periods of counting etc.,
              are usually small (less than 1%)
            - errors in the efficiencies (approx.5% for gamma rays
              greater than 200 kev and approx. 7% for lower energy
              gammas)
            - errors in half lives (less than 2% usually
              and 5% in few cases)
            - errors in gamma abundances (5 - 10%)
            - errors in internal conversion coefficients (range
              from 1-10%)
            - errors in standard iodine cross section  (3.1%)
COMMENT    S-wave neutron contributions were evaluated making use
           of the low energy resonance parameters available in
           literature. P-wave capture cross section obtained by
           subtracting S-wave capture contribution from the
           measured total cross sections.
STATUS     (TABLE) Due to the discrepancy of the results published
           in different sources, the main reference(s) which (on
           compiler's opinion) contains the final data is given
           in each subentry
