TITLE      EXCITATION ENERGY OF SPONTANEOUSLY FISSIONING
           ISOMER 242(M)-AM.
FACILITY   (CYCLO)  CYCLOTRON, PULSED OPERATION
INC-SOURCE (D-D)    D(D,N)HE-3 REACTION,  GASEOUS D-TARGET
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION, PULSED N-BEAM OF 28 MSEC LENGTH
           IN 56MSEC INTERVALS BETWEEN PULSES DETECTION OF
           ISOMERIC FISSION
DETECTOR   12 FISSION FRAGMENTS MICA DETECTORS ROTATING BEFORE
           THE TARGET SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE CYCLOTRON
PART-DET   (FF) FISSION FRAGMENTS
COMMENT    THE NEUTRON ENERGY CORRESPONDING TO THE REACTION
           THRESHOLD WAS FOUND TO BE 9.2 +- 0.3 MEV IN C.M.SYSTEM
           THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS VALUE AND THE THRESHOLD
           OF THE REACTION LEADING TO THE GROUND STATE IS
           CONSIDERED AS THE EXCITATION ENERGY OF THE SPONTANEOUS-
           LY FISSIONING STATE OF 242-AM.
           EXCITATION ENERGY = 2.9 +- 0.4 MEV

ERR-ANALYS LARGEST PART OF ERRORS IS DUE TO COUNTING STATISTICS.
           ERRORS ALSO DUE TO  UNCERTAINTIES IN THE DETERMINATION
           OF THE NEUTRON FLUX, THE EFFICIENCY OF FISSION FRAGMENT
           DETECTION AND THE AMOUNT OF 243-AM IN THE TARGET.
