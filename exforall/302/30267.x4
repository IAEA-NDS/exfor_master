TITLE      Some U-238 fission yields for 14.4 MeV neutrons
SAMPLE     930 mg/cm2 thick and 19 mm in diameter natural U3-08
           sample, irradiated between two Al foils 0.1 mm thick
           and covered with cadmium
METHOD     Direct gamma spectrometry of the sample without chemi-
           cal separation or applying the recoil effect.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 28 cm3 Ge(Li) detector with following specifi-
           cations =

             .Efficiency = experimentally determined in the
              60-2450 keV region
ANALYSIS   Determination of the gamma intensities as well as the
           analysis of decay curves were performed using computer
           least squares fitting method
MONITOR    The number of fissions was calculated from =
          1(13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
            used for determining the neutron flux,

COMMENT    The yields presented in the table below are the direct
           experimental results before averaging. Thus, for a
           number of nuclides, are given the yields obtained from
           different gamma lines or for various gamma intensities.
           Averaged-recommended- values are given in subentry 2.
FLAG       (2.) The gamma transition measured belongs to the
           grand-daughter of the fission product
           (3.) The yield was calculated using 2 different values
           for the intensity of the measured gamma transition
           (4.) The yield was calculated using 2 different values
           for the intensity of the measured gamma transition
           which here belongs to the grand-daughter of the fission
           product
