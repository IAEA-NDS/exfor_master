TITLE      SOME U-238 FISSION YIELDS FOR 14.4 MEV NEUTRONS
SAMPLE     930 MG/CM**2 THICK AND 19 MM IN DIAMETER NATURAL U3-08
           SAMPLE, IRRADIATED BETWEEN TWO AL FOILS 0.1 MM THICK
           AND COVERED WITH CADMIUM
METHOD     DIRECT GAMMA SPECTROMETRY OF THE SAMPLE WITHOUT CHEMI-
           CAL SEPARATION OR APPLYING THE RECOIL EFFECT.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 28 CM**3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH FOLLOWING SPECIFI-
           CATIONS =
             .RESOLUTION = 7 KEV FWHM AT 661.6 KEV
             .EFFICIENCY = EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED IN THE
              60-2450 KEV REGION
ANALYSIS   DETERMINATION OF THE GAMMA INTENSITIES AS WELL AS THE
           ANALYSIS OF DECAY CURVES WERE PERFORMED USING COMPUTER
           LEAST SQUARES FITTING METHOD
MONITOR    THE NUMBER OF FISSIONS WAS CALCULATED FROM =
