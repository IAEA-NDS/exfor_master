           ARE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR CHARACTERISTIC GAMMA-RAY
           TRANSITION ENERGIES AND THE LEAST SQUARE ANALYSIS OF
           THE DECAY CURVES.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  7.6*7.6 CM NAI(TL) CRYSTAL. THE PHOTOPEAK
           EFFICIENCIES WERE TAKEN FROM THE TABLES OF CROUTHAMEL,
           APPLIED GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY, PERGAMON PRESS 1960.
           (CSICR) CHANGES IN THE NEUTRON FLUX WERE MEASURED BY
           COUNTING THE PROTONS RECOILED FROM A POLYETHYLENE FOIL
           IN A CSI SCINTILLATION COUNTER

            THE 2.58 HOURS ACTIVITY OF THE 847 KEV
           GAMMA-RAYS OR BETA- FOLLOWING THE DECAY OF MN-56 WAS
           MEASURED. CROSS-SECTION NUMERICAL VALUES WERE TAKEN
