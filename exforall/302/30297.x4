TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS OF
           CARBON, YTTRIUM AND BISMUTH IN THE ENERGY REGION FROM
           1.0 TO 5.0 MEV.
FACILITY   (VDG) 7 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) LI-7(P,N)BE-7 REACTION.
INC-SPECT  NEUTRON ENERGY RESOLUTION LIES BETWEEN 20 AND 80 KEV.
           HOWEVER PRIV.COMM. FROM AN AUTHOR GIVES 30 KEV AS
           ENERGY RESOLUTION (COMPILER).
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH PULSE SHAPE N,GAMMA DIS-
           CRIMINATION.  FLIGHT PATH = 4 M.  PULSE-WIDTH OF 1.5 TO
           2.3 NSEC, AND A REPETITION RATE OF 1 MHZ.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE 213 LIQUID SCINTILLATOR (2 IN.DIAM. AND 2 IN.
           THICK) COUPLED TO A PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE 56AVP.
MONITOR    ABSOLUTE, TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT.
PART-DET   (N) NEUTRONS.
HISTORY    (750701C) KO
CORRECTION CORRECTION FOR ROOM-SCATTERED BACKGROUND WAS 10 PERCENT
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) AVERAGE STATISTICAL ERROR OF 3 PERC. IS
           GIVEN. SINCE THE INSCATTERING ERROR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
           LESS THAN 1 PERC., THE ESTIMATED TOTAL ERROR WAS LESS
           THAN 4 PERCENT.
