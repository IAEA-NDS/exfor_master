REFERENCE  (J,NSD/B,5,23,6910) DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENT,GRAPHS
           (R,AECD/EP-18,7012) COMPILATION OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA
SAMPLE     SOLID IRON CYLINDER 1.90 CM IN DIAMETER AND 1.99 CM
           LONG,WITH A TRANSMISSION OF ABOUT 70 PERCENT.
FACILITY   (VDG) 3 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF
INC-SOURCE (P-T) PROTON-TRITIUM, TARGET THICKNESS=285 MICROG/CM2
METHOD     TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT
DETECTOR   (HORBU) ZNS-PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR (NE451) PLACED AT AN
           ANGLE OF 0 DEGREES TO THE DIRECTION OF INCIDENT BEAM.
CORRECTION MEASURED TRANSMISSION WAS CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND
           NEUTRONS
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL DEVIATION
COMMENT    OBSERVED FLUCTUATIONS IN MEASURED CROSS SECTION MAY BE
           INTERPRETED TO BE DUE TO VARIATIONS IN LEVEL WIDTHS AND
           DENSITIES
           INTERMEDIATE STRUCTURE WITH A WIDTH OF ABOUT 200 KEV
           FOUND BY MEANS OF AUTOCORRELATION METHOD.
STATUS     TOTAL CROSS SECTION VALUES TAKEN FROM AECD/EP-18 D/70
           STRENGTH FUNCTION VALUE TAKEN FROM NSP/B 5 23 0/69
