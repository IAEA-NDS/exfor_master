TITLE      Excitation of isomeric activities in Ge-71, Br-78 and
           Br-79 using 14.8 MeV neutrons.
EXP-YEAR   (1969)
FACILITY   (CCW) 200 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)  T(d,n)alpha reaction.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method. The gamma-ray activity was
           counted while the deuteron beam was deflected off the
           tritium target by the beam pulsing system.
           (ASSOP) Neutron intensities were monitored by counting
           the alpha particles from the t(d,n)alpha reaction.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 1.5x1 in. Nai(Tl) crystal and 400 channel
           Victoreen analyser.
MONITOR    Unknown

            The value given is the cross-
           section divided by (1 + alpha(tot)), where alpha(tot)
           is the unknown total conversion coefficient.

            (Br3-C6-H4-N) powder pressed into flat tablets
           of known weight and area.
