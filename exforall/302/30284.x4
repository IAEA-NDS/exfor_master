TITLE      EXCITATION OF ISOMERIC ACTIVITIES IN GE-71, BR-78 AND
           BR-79 USING 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS.
EXP-YEAR   (69)
FACILITY   (CCW) 200 KV COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)  T(D,N)ALPHA REACTION.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION METHOD. THE GAMMA-RAY ACTIVITY WAS
           COUNTED WHILE THE DEUTERON BEAM WAS DEFLECTED OFF THE
           TRITIUM TARGET BY THE BEAM PULSING SYSTEM.
           (ASSOP) NEUTRON INTENSITIES WERE MONITORED BY COUNTING
           THE ALPHA PARTICLES FROM THE T(D,N)ALPHA REACTION.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 1.5''*1'' NAI(TL) CRYSTAL AND 400 CHANNEL
           VICTOREEN ANALYSER.
