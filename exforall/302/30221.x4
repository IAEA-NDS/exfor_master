CORRECTION For isotopic abundance, growth factor, counting
           efficiency, gamma ray self-absorption and for the x-ray
           escape peak yields a ratio of (n,p) cross sections
           in Ni-58 and Ni-61 of about 60 to 1 .
ERR-ANALYS The major source of error in the Co-51 activity came
           from the determination of the gamma ray self absorption
           factor in nickel.

REACTION   (30-ZN-67(N,P)29-CU-67,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   184 keV gamma masked by the backscattering peak at
           175 keV due to the annihilation radiation of Cu-64
           with 12.8 Hours half-life. Both from the decay constant
           of the broad maximum at 175 keV and the shape of the
           pulse-height distribution measured at different time
           intervals after the end of the irradiation, an estimate
           was made of the Cu-67 activity. From this result, an
           upper limit of 10 % was assigned to the ratio of
           cross sections of (n,p) reactions in Zn-67 and Zn-64,
           respectively.

REACTION   (26-FE-54(N,P)25-MN-54,,SIG)
ANALYSIS        As the 840 keV gamma ray from the Mn-54 decay
           has about the same energy as the 810 keV gamma ray
           in Co-58 decay, a comparison was made between the
           induced radioactivities in iron and nickel.
           From the intensity ratio of the photopeaks of the Mn-54
           and Co-58 gamma rays of about 1 to 50, the ratio of
           integrated neutron flux, the difference in number of
           target nuclei and growth factor, the cross sections
           of (n,p) reactions in Fe-54 and Ni-58 were found to Be
           the same within 10 %.

COMMENT    A gamma ray of 845 keV with a decay time of 2.6 hours
           was attributed to Mn-56 from neutron capture by
           manganese, which in a small quantity was present. Thus
           the measurement of the Mn-54 activity was started two
           days after the end of the irradiation so that Mn-56
           had decayed completely.
