TITLE      MEASUREMENT ON BERYLLIUM WITH POLARIZED NEUTRONS
           OF THE ENERGY 2.60 - 2.77 MEV.  (IN GERMAN)
FACILITY   130 KEV DEUTERON BEAM
INC-SOURCE (D-D)    D(D,N)HE-3 REACTION,ROTATING HEAVY ICE TARGET
METHOD     IN SHORT TIME INTERVALS SPECTRA ON THE RIGHT SIDE
           AND ON THE LEFT SIDE MEASURED WITH AND WITHOUT
           SCATTERER.
           SCATTERING ANGLE 50.0 +- 0.2 DEG LAB SYSTEM
           MEASURED ASYMMETRY P1*P2 = (L-R)/(L+R)
           P1  POLARIZATION OF NEUTRONS
