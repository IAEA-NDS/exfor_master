TITLE      MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVATION RESONANCE
           INTEGRAL OF ND-146,ND-148 AND ND-150
INC-SOURCE (REAC) CENTRAL GRAPHITE REFLECTOR OF REACTOR RA-1
SAMPLE     NEODYMIUM-GOLD SAMPLES 3MG/CM2 THICK CONTAINING 3 PARTS
           OF GOLD PER 10000 PARTS OF NEODYMIUM.
METHOD     THE CADMIUM RATIO TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE
           THE RATIO OF THE REDUCED EPITHERMAL RESONANCE INTEGRAL
           TO THE THERMAL CAPTURE CROSS SECTION
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   THE REDUCED RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS OBTAINED BY
           MULTIPLYING THE EPITHERMAL INTEGRAL BY A CORRECTION
           FACTOR,F,WHICH REPRESENTS THE RATIO OF EPITHERMAL
           NEUTRON CAPTURES IN A 1/E SPECTRUM TO THE EPITHERMAL
           NEUTRON CAPTURES IN THE ACTUAL REACTOR SPECTRUM.
           A CALCULATION AND AN EVALUATION OF THE REDUCED
           EPITHERMAL AND RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN
           TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RESONANCE PARAMETERS OBTAINED FROM
           DIFFERENT PUBLISHED TIME OF FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS. A
           CALCULATION OF THE UNRESOLVED RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS
           MADE USING HIGH ENERGY RADIATIVE CROSS SECTIONS
           OBTAINED FROM PUBLISHED STATISTICAL MODEL CALCULATIONS.
MONITOR    RATIOS OF REDUCED CAPTURE RESONANCE INTEGRAL TO THERMAL
           CROSS SECTION DETERMINED RELATIVE TO GOLD,WITH A GOLD-
           CADMIUM RATIO OF 1.684+-0.003 AND A VALUE OF THE RATIO
           OF RESONANCE INTEGRAL TO THERMAL CROSS SECTION OF GOLD
           OF 15.7
