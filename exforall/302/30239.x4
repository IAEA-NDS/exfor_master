TITLE      Measurement and evaluation of the activation resonance
           integral of Nd-146,Nd-148 and Nd-150
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Central graphite reflector of reactor RA-1
SAMPLE     Neodymium-gold samples 3mg/cm2 thick containing 3 parts
           of gold per 10000 parts of neodymium.
METHOD     The cadmium ratio technique was applied to determine
           the ratio of the reduced epithermal resonance integral
           to the thermal capture cross section
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   The reduced resonance integral was obtained by
           multiplying the epithermal integral by a correction
           factor,F,which represents the ratio of epithermal
           neutron captures in a 1/E spectrum to the epithermal
           neutron captures in the actual reactor spectrum.
           A calculation and an evaluation of the reduced
           epithermal and resonance integral was also undertaken
           taking into account resonance parameters obtained from
           different published time of flight experiments. A
           calculation of the unresolved resonance integral was
           made using high energy radiative cross sections
           obtained from published statistical model calculations.
MONITOR    Ratios of reduced capture resonance integral to thermal
           cross section determined relative to gold,with a gold-
           cadmium ratio of 1.684+-0.003 and a value of the ratio
           of resonance integral to thermal cross section of gold
           of 15.7

           Reduced resonance integral obtained from epithermal

           F=0.77+-0.05
COMMENT    Calculated epithermal and resonance integral values
           were 2.92 barn and 2.24 barn respectively.
           A good agreement is observed in the calculated resolved
           integral using resonance parameters obtained from two
           time of flight experiments. The calculated unresolved
           integral is comparable in magnitude with the resolved
           one.

           Reduced resonance integral obtained from epithermal
           integral value by multiplying by correction factor
           F = 0.90+-0.02
COMMENT    Calculated epithermal and resonance integral values
           were 28.73 barn and 25.76 barn respectively.
           Activation resonance integral is about half of the
           value recommended by walker and of the calculated one.
           Comparison of radiative width obtained by different
           time of flight experiments shows that this value is
           uncertain by a factor of two or more, and suggests
           that the calculated value may be in error.
