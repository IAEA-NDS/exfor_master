TITLE      EXCITATION FUNCTION OF THE U-235 FISSION CROSS-SECTION
           IN THE ENERGY RANGE 0.017 EV TO 0.15 EV.
EXP-YEAR   (72)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) VVR-S REACTOR AT BUCHAREST
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT.
            FOR EACH ENERGY GROUP OF NEUTRONS, THE RATIO
            N-FIS(E)/N-GAM(E) WAS DETERMINED, WHERE=
             .N-FIS(E) IS THE NUMBER OF EVENTS DETECTED BY THE
                FISSION CHAMBER,
             .N-GAM(E) IS THE NUMBER OF EVENTS DETECTED BY THE NAI
                SPECTROMETER WHICH COUNTED THE 447.4 KEV GAMMA
                RAYS OF LI-7 (FROM B-10(N,ALFA)LI-7).
            THE FISSION CROSS-SECTION SIG(E) FOR EACH ENERGY GROUP
            WAS DETERMINED USING THE FOLLOWING RELATION=
           SIG(E) = SIG(0)*(N-FIS(E)/N-GAM(E))/(N-FIS(0)/N-GAM(0))
            WHERE SIG(0), N-FIS(0) AND N-GAM(0) ARE THE VALUES AT
            2200 M/SEC.

            FOR THE ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION OF THE
           U-235 FISSION CROSS-SECTION FOR 2200M/SEC NEUTRONS USED
