FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) APSARA reactor
SAMPLE     Electrodeposited target of 241Am (~20 ug) were covered
           with superpure aluminum  catcher foil and together were
           wrapped in 1 mil cadmium foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Samples were assayed gamma-spectrometrically
           an 8% HPGe detector coupled to a 4096 channel analyser
           The resolution of the detector is 2.1 keV at 1332 keV
           in live time mode.
METHOD     (CHSEP) The aluminum foil was dissolved in sodium
           hydroxide. Five milliliters of this solution assayed
           for the activity of tellurium isotopes without radio
           chemical separations.
           The rest of the solution was used for the separation
           of fission product iodine by using solvent extraction
           technique.
INC-SPECT  Neutron flux 8 X 10**12 n/cm2/sec2 for suitable length
           of time (t = 30-150 min.)

           - decay constants
           - times of irradiation and cooling
ANALYSIS   Isomeric ratio of 132Te and 133Te were assumed to be 1.

COMMENT    By SO, NDS, accodring to the latest decay data;
           T1/2=55.4min in Table 2 for Te-133 is equal to that of
            Te-133-M and gamma line intensity 80% at 912 keV is
            not in the latest dacay scheme. It is very likely that
            the yield reported here is for Te-133 is for Te-133-M.
