INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The lithium foil of thickness 8.0 mg/cm2 was
           encased with 3.7 mg/cm2 Tantalum from the front where
           the proton beam was targeted, and a thick Ta foil of
           thickness 4.12 mg/cm2 from the backside.
           The proton beam energies were 7.0, 15.0 and 18.8 MeV
SAMPLE     Natural 159Tb sample of thickness ~2.0 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector was pre-calibrated with 152Eu
           standard source and was connected to a PC based 4 K
           multichannel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample of 159Tb in different set of irradiation
           placed at 2.1 cm distance from Li target.
