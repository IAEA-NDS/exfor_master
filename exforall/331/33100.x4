TITLE      Determination of 55Mn(n,g)56Mn reaction cross-section

SAMPLE     About 0.0657 gm (for 3.12 MeV) and 0.0166 gm (for 4.12
           MeV) of MnO2 powder and 1 mm thick natural indium
           metal foils of same size were wrapped separately with
           0.025 mm thick super pure Al foil. The size of the
           Al wrapped MnO2 powder sample was 1.0 cm2 with a
           thickness of 29.3 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector coupled to a
           personal computer-based 4K channel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The Li metal foil with a thickness of 3.7
           mg/cm2 was sandwiched between two tantalum foils of
           different thicknesses. The front tantalum foil was of
           thickness 3.9 mg/cm2 and the back tantalum foil was
           of 0.025 mm thick, which was sufficient to stop the
           proton beam. The incident proton energies are 3, 4, 5,
           6 MeV corresponding to 1.12, 2.12, 3.12 and 4.12 MeV
           respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty (5.8-15.8%)
           (ERR-S,3.1,5.5) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS,4.9,14.8) The systematic errors are due to
           uncertainties in:
           (ERR-1) Irradiation time(~0.1%)
           (ERR-2) The detection efficiency (~3%)
