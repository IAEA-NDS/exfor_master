FACILITY   (MICRT,3INDPOO) 6-MeV racetrack microtron accelerator-
           based neutron source.
SAMPLE     Powders of pure chemical compounds of manganese
            (MnO2,99% purity) and copper sheet(99% purity) were
           used. The sample were packed a known weight in a
           polyethylene bag using microbalance. The size of each
           sample was ~6 cm x ~3 cm and ~0.1 cm thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high-purity germanium detector-based gamma
           ray spectroscopy was used for the measurement of
           induced gamma activity. The HPGe detector was
           connected through computer-based multichannel analyzer.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) A 6 MeV energy electrons beam interact with
           tungsten target, produce bremsstrahlung radiation,
           which further interact with beryllium target to
           produce continuous energy spectrum.
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectrum was simulated by FLUKA
