           235U by 3-MeV neutrons

SAMPLE     The uranium target prepared by electroplating 235U on
           a 10 mg/cm2 Al backing. The uranium coating was about
           1 mg/cm2 .
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Three silicon surface barrier type solid-
           state detectors were used to detect the long-range
           alpha particles.
           The active area of the detector was about 200 mm2, and
           was operated with a positive bias of 100 V.
           Two thin detectors, D2 and D3, were used to detect
           alpha particles emitted at 0 degree and 90 degree with
           angular resolution of about +- 18 degree.
           (SCIN) The fission fragments were detected by a gas
           scintillation counter.
PART-DET   (FF,A)
METHOD     (COINC) The long-range alpha particles detected in
           coincidence with the fission fragments.

COMMENT    The anisotropy of the angular distribution was obtained
           by considering the alpha particles spectrum above 8 MeV
           in both the 0 degree and 90 degree directions.
           The value was found to be equal to 1.27 +- 0.25 and
           1.33 +- 0.13 before and after the interchange of
           0 degree 90 degree  respectively.

CORRECTION The long-range alpha particles spectrum in the 3-MeV
           neutron fission of 235U has been corrected for the loss
           of energy in the aluminum backing of the target.
