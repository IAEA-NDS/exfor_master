SAMPLE     Electrodeposited target of 241Pu (~30 ug) was covered
           with superpure aluminum foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The samples were assayed gamma-spectrometrically
           using HPGe detector coupled to 4096 channel analyser
            (resolution 2.1 keV at at 1332 keV) in live time mode.
INC-SPECT   The neutron flux of 5 X 10**12 n/cm/sec.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainty

METHOD     (CHSEP) The cooled aluminum foil was dissolved in
           NaOH solution where five ml of this solution was used
           to assay the activity of tellurium without
           radiochemical separation.
           The fission product iodine was separated from rest
           solution using solvent extraction technique.
           (ACTIV) Target was irradiated for 30 minutes.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Isomeric ratio of 134I was assumed to be 1.

           131Te and 133Te isomeric yield ratio are taken.
COMMENT    By SO, NDS, accodring to the latest decay data;
           T1/2=25.0min in Table 2 for Te-132 seems to be for
            Te-131,
           T1/2=55.4min in Table 2 for Te-133 is equal to that of
            Te-133-M and gamma line intensity 80% at 912 keV is
            not in the latest dacay scheme. It is very likely that
            the yield reported here is for Te-133 is for Te-133-M,
           T1/2=14.8min in Table 2 for Te-134 might be typo for
            41.8min.
