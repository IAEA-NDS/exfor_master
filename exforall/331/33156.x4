DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray counting of irradiated samples was
           performed using detector coupled with a PC-based
           4096 channel analyzer.
           The resolution of detector was 1.82 keV at 1332.50 keV
           gamma-line of 60Co.
           The dead time of detector was <5%.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium foil of thickness ~6.8 mg/cm2
           was used as target, sandwich between two tantalum
           foils of thickness ~4 mg/cm2 front side and 0.1 mm
           in back side of Li to stop the proton beams.
           The proton beam energies were 13, 16, 19 and 22 MeV.

           Al metal foil (purity 99.99%) with dimension of
           10 x 10 mm2 and 0.1 mm thick have been used as monitor
           to measure the neutron flux.
           The samples were wrapped in a 0.025 mm thick
           aluminum foil.
