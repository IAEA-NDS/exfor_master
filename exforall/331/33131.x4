SAMPLE     Molybdenum metal foils of thickness 0.1 mm were placed
           at a distance of 2.1 cm, aligned at zero degree with
           respect to proton beam.
           An aluminum metal foil of thickness 0.1 mm was placed
           together with each Mo to evaluate the neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe detector coupled to a PC based multi-
           channel analyzer calibrated with a standard source
           152Eu source.
           The resolution of the detector was 1.82 keV for
           1332 keV of 60Co.
           The dead time of detector was below 2%
METHOD     The irradiation for each sample was carried out for
           about 7-8 hours.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) A Li target of thickness ~6.8 mg/cm2 was used
           in between two Ta foils of different thickness.
           A Ta foil of thickness ~4 mg/cm2 was used at the front
           of the Li foil and the other Ta foil of thickness
           0.1 mm was used back of the Li to prevent proton from
           striking the target.
