SAMPLE     Two cobalt metals weighing (0.38 and 0.2171 g) were
            wrapped with 0.025 mm thick Al foil.
           Two indium metal foils (0.0675 and 0.0737 g) were
            wrapped separately with 0.025 mm thick foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A pre-calibrated 80-cc HPGe detector was
           coupled to a PC-based 4094 channel analyzer. The
           resolution of the detector was 1.8 keV at 1332.5 keV
           of 60Co and dead time of detector always kept less
           than 5%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The stacks were irradiated with effective
           neutron energies of 11.98 and 15.75 MeV for the
           duration of 7 and 11.17 hours, respectively.
           Irradiated foils of cobalt were cooled for 22.8 and
           12.4 hours, respectively. The foils of indium were
           cooled for 2.9 and 1.1 hours, respectively.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium foil (3.7 mg/cm2 thick)
           sandwiched between two Ta foils (3.9 mg/cm2 thick for
           front, 0.025 mm thick for back).
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) Neutron energy resolution (FWHM) corresponding
           to the 7Li(p,n)7Be neutron distribution divided by 2.36
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty
