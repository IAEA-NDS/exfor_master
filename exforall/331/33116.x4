SAMPLE     A 232Th sample of thickness ~0.025 mm  was wrapped with
           pure aluminum foil of thickness 0.025 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A pre-calibrated 80 cm3 HPGe detector was
           coupled to a PC-based 4094 channel analyzer.
           The resolution of the detector was measured as 2.0 keV
           at 1332 keV of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Each sample was irradiated for about 5-8 hours
           at proton energies of 13, 16, 17 and 21 MeV,
           respectively.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li foil of thickness ~7.8 mg/cm2 was
           sandwiched between two Ta foils of different
           thickness.
           Thin Ta foil of thickness 3.2 mg/cm2 was used beam
           side, while a Ta foil more than 0.025 mm thick was used
           at the back of the Li foil to stop the proton beam.
