SAMPLE     The chemically pure (99.99%) Au sample of weight
           0.037 g of size 0.4 cm X 0.4 cm and Mo sample of
           weight 0.0251 g of size 0.6 cm X 0.5 cm wrapped in two
           different aluminum foil of thickness 0.025 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiated Au sample was cooled for
           2.77- 139.77 hours, whereas Mo samples were cooled for
           20.733-189.12 hours.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The natural Li foil with a thickness of 3.7
            mg/cm2 was sandwiched between two tantalum foils of
            different thicknesses.
           The front tantalum foil was of thickness 3.9 mg/cm2
            and the back tantalum foil is thicker than 0.025 mm,
            which was sufficient to stop the proton beam.
SAMPLE     The Mo metal foil (0.2916 g at 11.9 MeV and 0.0490 g
            at 14.75 MeV) was wrapped with 0.025 mm thick Al
            foil.
           The chemically pure (99.99%) Au and In metal foils of
            0.0324 and 0.0737 g weight were wrapped separately
            with 0.025 mm thick Al foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated for 7-11 hours with
           a neutron beam. The irradiated samples of In, Au and Mo
           were cooled for 1.12-2.43, 149.33-243.2 and 97.65-
           192.5 hours, respectively for different sets of
           measurement.
CORRECTION The cross sections have been corrected by removing the
           contribution due to the tail part of the neutron
           spectra. The folding of cross-sections from TALYS with
           neutron flux distributions was done by using the
           neutron spectrum.
