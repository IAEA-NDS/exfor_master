SAMPLE     Two Co metal foils of radius 0.25 cm and 0.3 cm were
           wrapped separately with Al foil of thickness 0.025 mm.
           Similarly, In metal foils of size 0.5 cm X 0.6 cm and
           0.8 cm X 0.6 m were separately wrapped with Al foils
           of same thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A pre-calibrated 80 cm3 HPGe detector was
           coupled to a PC-based 4096 channel analyzer.
           The resolution of the detector system had a full-width
           at half-maximum of 2 keV at 1332.5 keV of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The two stacks were irradiated for 7 and
           11.17 hours, respectively.
           The irradiated cobalt foils from the two stacks were
           allowed to decay for 22.8 and 12.4 hours, respectively.
           The irradiated indium foils were allowed to decay for
           2.9 and 1.1 hours, respectively.

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium foil of thickness 3.7 mg/cm2,
           and the two tantalum foils were of different
           thicknesses.
           The front tantalum foil facing the proton beam was
           3.9 mg/cm2.
           The back tantalum foil of thickness more than 0.025 mm
           was used to stop the proton beam.
