SAMPLE     The samples natTa and natAu metal foils having
           weights 239.12 mg and 334.30 mg with purity 99.97%
           respectively.
           The samples of area 1 X 1 cm2 were separately wrapped
           with Al foil of thickness 0.011 mm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray counting of the irradiated samples
           were perform using a Baltic HPGe detector coupled with
           PC-based 4k channel analyzer.
           The resolution of the HPGe detector was measured as
           1.8 keV at 1.33 MeV of 60CO.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The stack of Ta-Au placed at a distance
           of 1.5 cm from the neutron generating (T-Ti) target
           at zero degree angle relative to the beam direction.
           The stack foils of Ta-Au were irradiated for 1.5 hour
           and after irradiation cooled for 0.3 hour.
