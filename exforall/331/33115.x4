SAMPLE     Two thorium metal foils of purity more than 99.99%
           weighing 0.9005+/-0.0003 and 0.3955+/-0.0003 g were
           wrapped with 0.025 mm thick Al foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A pre-calibrated 80-cc HPGe detector was
           coupled to a PC-based 4096 channel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The irradiated foils of thorium from two
           stacks were cooled for 34.96 and 69.1 hours,
           respectively.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium foil of thickness 7.8 mg/cm2
           sandwiched between two Ta foils.
           The front tantalum foil facing the proton beam was
           3.2 mg/cm2 thick. The back tantalum foil of thickness
           41 mg/cm2 was used to stop the proton beam.

COMMENT    By compiler (2019-12-10):
            It is not clear why the authors needed to propagate
            the uncertainties in the average atomic mass and
            sample weight. They are used as the reaction and
            monitor samples, and therefore should not contribute
            to the uncertainty propagation.
