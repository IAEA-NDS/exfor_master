TITLE      STUDY OF THE CROSS SECTION OF THE REACTION
            CU-63(GAMMA,N) ON THE BEAM OF QUASIMONOCHROMATIC
            ANNIHILATION PHOTONS IN ENERGY RANGE 12-25 MEV.

FACILITY   (LINAC,4CCPJIA)
INC-SOURCE (QMPH,ARAD). QUASIMONOENERGETIC PHOTONS WERE OBTAINED
           BY ANNIHILATION OF POSITRONS IN FLIGHT.
METHOD     (ACTIV). POSITRON ACTIVITY OF CU-62 NUCLEI WAS
           MEASURED.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) TWO CRYSTALS WERE USED FOR THE
            DETECTION OF POSITRON ACTIVITY OF CU-62 NUCLEI.
           (IOCH) TO MONITOR POSITRON AND ELECTRON BEAMS THIN
            WALL IONIZATION CHAMBERS WERE USED.
PART-DET   (B+)
MONITOR    THE ABSOLUTE EFFECTIVITY OF THE SPECTROMETER WAS
            MEASURED BY USING A STANDARD F-18 SOURCE OF BETA
            ACTIVITY.
ADD-RES    (COMP) WITH DATA OF EARLY EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS.
           THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF CROSS SECTION IN THIS
           EXPERIMENT APPEARED TO BE LESS THAN IT IN BREMSSTRAH-
           LUNG EXPERIMENTS.
           THE VALUE OF EFFICIENCY OF G-QUANTA DETECTION WAS FOUND
           TO BE 0.061+-0.004.
ANALYSIS   PHOTONEUTRON YIELDS WERE MEASURED BOTH ON POSITRON AND
            ELECTRON BEAMS WITH  STEP 1. MEV IN THE ENERGY RANGE
            FROM 10 UP TO 25  MEV.  THE MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE
            SEVERAL TIMES.  THE RESULTS WERE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
