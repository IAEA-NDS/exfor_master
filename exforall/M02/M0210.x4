COMMENT    The Szilard-Chalmers reaction has been developed as a
            sensitive detector for the  comparison  of  neutrons
            from sources of different primary energy and angular
            distribution.  Using sodium permanganate solution, a
            detection  efficiency  of  approximately 7%  for all
            neutrons in the energy range 0 - 5 MeV was  obtained
            and high accuracy achieved.
           The method of detection  was  employed  to  make  the
            following  measurements:  (I) the neutron yield from
            the spontaneous fission of natural uranium was found
              to be
             1.56(0.12)*10**(-2)*n*sec**(-1)**(-1).
            (ii) the cross section for the reaction Li-6(gamma,n)
             at 6.2 MeV was found to be (3.+-2.)*10**-28 cm**2.
            (iii) the cross section for the reaction Be-9(n,2n)
             induced by Ra-Be and Ra-Be sources of neutrons was
             found to be 0.37(0.06)*10**-24 cm**2.
            (iv) a limit was placed onthe cross-over transition
             from the 2.5 MeV state to theground state in Co-60.
             The transition  probability  was  found  to  be   <
             1.10**-6  of that for the cascade consisting of the
             two gamma rays.
