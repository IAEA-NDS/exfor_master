COMMENT    THE SZILARD-CHALMERS REACTION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A
            SENSITIVE DETECTOR FOR THE COMPARISON OF NEUTRONS FROM
            SOURCES OF DIFFERENT PRIMARY ENERGY AND ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION. USING SODIUM PERMANGANATE SOLUTION,
            A DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF APPROXIMATELY 7% FOR
            ALL NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 0-5 MEV WAS OBTAINED
            AND HIGH ACCURACY ACHIEVED.
           THE METHOD OF DETECTION WAS EMPLOYED TO MAKE THE
            FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS:
            (I) THE NEUTRON YIELD FROM THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF
             NATURAL URANIUM WAS FOUND TO BE
             1.56(0.12)*10**(-2)*N*SEC**(-1)**(-1).
            (II) THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION LI-6(GAMMA,N)
             AT 6.2 MEV WASFOUND TO BE (3.+-2.)*10**-28 CM**2.
            (III) THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION BE9(N,2N)
             INDUCED BY RA-BE AND RA-BE SOURCES OF NEUTRONS WAS
             FOUND TO BE 0.37(0.06)*10**-24 CM**2.
            (IV) A LIMIT WAS PLACED ONTHE CROSS-OVER TRANSITION
             FROM THE 2.5 MEV STATE TO THEGROUND STATE IN CO60.
             THE TRANSITION PROBABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE < 1.10**-6
             OF THAT FOR THE CASCADE CONSISTING OF THE TWO GAMMA
             RAYS.

STATUS     (APRVD). THE DATA HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN FORM OF THE
