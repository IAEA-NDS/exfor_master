SAMPLE     Weight = 19 g.
DETECTOR   (PLATE),Ilford C2 emulsion, thick=200 mu.
REL-REF    (M,M0310001,G.Cortini+,J,NC,9,85,1958) The
            experimental procedure was described.
ADD-RES    (THEO,COMP) An evaporation theory was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The difference  between  the  two  spectra shows that
            above 24 MeV photon energy the neutrons are  emitted
            mainly  by  a  direct process.  This process gives a
            relevant contribution  (> 25%)  to the  photoneutron
            yield at 30 MeV.
