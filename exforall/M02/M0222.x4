COMMENT    The capture reaction H-3(He3,g)Li-6 has been  studied
            for  He-3  bombarding  energies  from  9  to 26 MeV.
            Transitions to the ground  and  first  four  excited
            states   in   Li-6  are  observed.  The  90  degrees
            differential cross  section  for  the  ground  state
            transition decreases smoothly from 9 to 26 MeV.  The
            90 degrees differential cross section for the  first
            excited  state  transition  shows  a  broad  maximum
            centered  at  E(He-3)=20.6(0.4)  MeV  indicating   a
            possible resonance in Li-6 at Ex=26.2(0.4) MeV.  The
            excitation function for the transition to the  third
            excited state also shows a broad maximum centered at
            Ex=26.6(0.4) MeV.  The excitation functions for  the
            transitions   to  the  second  (t=1.0+)  and  fourth
            (t=1.2+) excited states have also been measured. The
            former does  not show any resonance structure, while
            the  latter  shows  a  broad  maximum  indicating  a
            possible  resonance  in  Li-6  at  Ex=26.7(0.4) MeV.
            These  results   are   compared   with   theoretical
            predictions.
