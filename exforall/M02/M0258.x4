COMMENT    The 90-degree yield of the d(3He,gamma)5Li reaction
            has been measured from 2.3 to 11.2 MeV 3He energy.
           No clear evidence of a level in 5Li has been found
            over this energy range.
           The upper limits for the resonance integrated cross
            section  and  gamma-ray width were estimated to be
            about 15 micro-b*meV and 100 eV, respectively.
