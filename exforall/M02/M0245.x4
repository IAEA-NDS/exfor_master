SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.928) Targets  used  in  the experiments:
            1  cm  square  samples of 6Li and natural Li containg
            approximately equal numbers  of atoms with masses  of
            34 mg   and  42  mg,   respectively.   The  6Li   was
            92.8%, while the natural Li was 92.6% 7Li, 7.4% 6Li.

COMMENT    The photodisintegration  of  Li-6  by  bremsstrahlung
            radiation   of   17.3-MeV   end-point   energy   was
            investigated by use  of  coincidence  techniques  to
            detect    neutron-proton    coincidences    and   by
            measurement of the photoproton energy  spectra.  The
            Li-6(gamma,n)  reaction  is  found to Be responsible
            for 0.58(0.13) of the photoneutron yield measured by
            Romanowski    while   the   Li-6(g,p)He-5   reaction
            contributes 0.31(0.04) of the  yield.  No  angularly
            correlated neutron-proton coincidences were detected
            which would support a deuteron-alpha-particle  model
            for   the   Li-6(g,np)He-4   reaction;   however,the
            possible  existence  of   this   reaction   is   not
            eliminated.
