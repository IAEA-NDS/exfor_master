TITLE      Energy and angular distributions of photoneutrons
           produced by 70-MeV X-rays.

            The length of the X-ray pulse is about 200 microsec.
ANALYSIS   Angular distributions were approximated with a form
            A + B*sin**2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    For the  heavy elements the angular distributions are
            essentially isotropic,  indicating the  predominance
            of  the  evaporation  process,  while  for the light
            elements there  is  also  an  anisotropic  component
            peaked at 90 degrees.  The energy distributions show
            that most  of  neutrons  can  be  attributed  to  an
            evaporation  process which is governed by a constant
            nuclear temperature.
           A high-energy tail is attributed to direct interaction.
