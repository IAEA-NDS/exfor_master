COMMENT    THE PHOTONUCLEAR REACTION CROSS SECTION 63CU(G,N)62CU
            HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED AS THE STANDARD FOR (G,N)
            REACTIONS.  THE DIFFERENT MEASURED VALUES DO NOT AGREE
            WITH ONE ANOTHER AND CAN BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO
            GROUPS, NAMELY, A GROUP AT ABOUT 100 MB AND A GROUP AT
            ABOUT 50 MB.  IT APPEARS THAT THE FORMER GROUP
            CONTAINS THE VALUES OBTAINED MAINLY BY MEASUREMENTS
            USING BREMSSTRAHLUNGS BEAMS, WHILE THE LATTER CONTAINS
            THOSE OBTAINED MAINLY WITH LI-P GAMMAS.
           THE EXPERIMENT ATTEMPTS TO RE-DETERMINE THE (G,N) CROSS
            SECTION FOR COPPER, ZINC, SILVER BY LI-P GAMMA-RAYS.
           ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF GAMMA-QUANTA WAS PERFORMED BY
            HOUGH'S METHOD, AND REACTION YIELDS WERE DETERMINED BY
            THE ACTIVATION METHOD IN WHICH THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS OF
            ACTIVATED NUCLEI IN SAMPLES WERE DETERMINED BY
            MEASURING THE BETA-RAY WITH A 4PI-PROPORTIONAL COUNTER
            AND APPLYING THE 'METHOD OF EXTRAPOLATION'.
           THE CROSS SECTIONS OF CU63, ZN64 AND AG109 FOR 17.6 MEV
            GAMMA-RAYS WERE FOUND TO BE 42.5(15%) MB, 23.3(18%) MB
            AND 61.5(16%) MB RESPECTIVELY.
