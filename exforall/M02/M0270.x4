FACILITY   (CCW)  Li  metal  targets  of   0.5  mm   thick  were
            were  bombarded  with  magnetically analysed protons
            which were accelerated to 500  keV  by  a  Cockcroft
            generator and whose intensities were about 50 mu-A ~
            100 mu-A
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The gamma-ray intensities  were  measured  by
            using  an end-window Geiger counter with a 5 mm lead
            converter on the front and its  counting  efficiency
            for Li-p gamma-ray was calibrated by Hough's method
             - Beta counting at the end of Geiger window
           (BF3) + parafin for neutron detection. Ra+Be used for
            neutron detector calibration

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error is the roots of square sum of:
           (ERR-1) Error of the absolute gamma quanta.
           (ERR-2) Error of the calculation of the solid angle of
            the sample subtended to the gamma-source.
           (ERR-3) Error of the shift of the position of the
            gamma-source.

COMMENT    The photonuclear reaction cross section 63Cu(gamma,n)
            has   been  frequently  used  as  the  standard  for
            (gamma,n) reactions.  The different measured  values
            do  not  agree  with  one another and can be roughly
            divided into two groups,  namely,  a group at  about
            100  mb and a group at about 50 mb.  It appears that
            the former group contains the values obtained mainly
            by  measurements using bremsstrahlungs beams,  while
            the latter contains those obtained mainly with  Li-p
            gammas.
           The experiment attempts to re-determine the (gamma,n)
            cross section  for  copper,  zinc,  silver  by  Li-p
            gamma-rays
           Absolute measurement of gamma-quanta was performed by
            Hough's method,  and reaction yields were determined
            by  the  activation  method  in  which  the absolute
            numbers  of  activated  nuclei   in   samples   were
            determined   by   measuring   the  beta-ray  with  a
            4pi-proportional counter and applying the 'method of
            extrapolation'.
