SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.993) Self-supporting 6Li foils of 99.3%
            isotopic purity,  2.4 mg/cm2 thick.  The target foil
            was obtained  by  rolling  lithium  to  the  desired
            thickness. Two targets were used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
           (ERR-SYS) The   total   systematic   error  is  15  %
            attributable chiefly to uncertainties in the  target
            thickness.

REACTION  1(3-LI-6(G,X)1-H-1,,DA) Oxided target was used.
          2(3-LI-6(G,X)1-H-1,,DA) unoxided target was used.
ANALYSIS   Differential cross  section  was  calculated from the
            spectrum,  measured at 30.6 MeV energy  of  incident
            electrons.
