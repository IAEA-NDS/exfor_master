COMMENT    Tritons resulting  from  the electrodisintegration of
            Li-7  have  been  measured  at  90  degrees  for  an
            incident  electron energy of 23.8 MeV over an energy
            range which ensured that only tritons emitted in the
            two-body      channel     were     detected.     The
            electrodisintegration cross sections were  converted
            to  equivalent photodisintegration data and compared
            to  earlier   results.   Large   discrepancies   are
            observed.  It  is  found  that  the  (g,H-3) channel
            contributes appreciably to the electric  dipole  sum
            rule for Li-7.
