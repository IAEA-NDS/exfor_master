COMMENT    TRITONS RESULTING FROM THE ELECTRODISINTEGRATION OF
           LI-7 HAVE BEEN MEASURED AT 90 DEGREES FOR AN INCIDENT
           ELECTRON ENERGY OF 23.8 MEV OVER AN ENERGY RANGE WHICH
           ENSURED THAT ONLY TRITONS EMITTED IN THE TWO-BODY
           CHANNEL WERE DETECTED. THE ELECTRODISINTEGRATION
           CROSS SECTIONS WERE CONVERTED TO EQUIVALENT PHOTO-
           DISINTEGRATION DATA AND COMPARED TO EARLIER RESULTS.
           LARGE DISCREPANCIES ARE OBSERVED. IT IS FOUND THAT THE
            (G,H-3) CHANNEL CONTRIBUTES APPRECIABLY TO THE
           ELECTRIC DIPOLE SUM RULE FOR LI-7.
