            nucleus giant resonance disintegration.

            English translation of VMU,28,(1),24,1987.
FACILITY   (BETAT,4RUSMOS) 32 MeV betatron.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Obtained in internal 0.1 mm platinum target.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) Measurement of gamma-ray spectra obtained
            at disintegration of giant dipole resonance  of  the
            final  nuclei  31P  and  32S  was  made in identical
            conditions.
DETECTOR   (GELI) With  volume of 100 cm**3 placed at a distance
            of 35 cm from the beam axis.  Energy  resolution  is
            3.5 keV for gamma-rays with energy 1.332 MeV.
ANALYSIS   To obtain  the  absolute  value  of  integral   cross
            sections   the   relative   method   was  used:  the
            experimental gamma-spectra were compared  with  well
            known spectrum (gamma,x gamma') reactions.
ERR-ANALYS Errors of this experiment were summed as  statistical
            errors   of   the  experimental  gamma  spectra  and
            probabilities of gamma transitions in final nuclei.
COMMENT    The aim  of this work was to estimate the probability
            of semidirect disintegration in partial photonuclear
            channels  for  23Na  nucleus. The  integrated  cross
            section for 23Na(gamma,p(I)) and 23Na(gamma,n(I))
            reactions and the semidirect components were obtained.
