INC-SOURCE (BRST)
INC-SPECT  Diameter of beam is 30 mm.
SAMPLE     A spherical target of 50 mm diameter. Weight=90 g.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford L-4,thick=400 mu. A mean distance
            from the target is 17 cm.

REL-REF    (N,,V.Emma+,J,NC,22,135,1961) Detail  description  of
            experimental     arrangements     and     introduced
            corrections.
CORRECTION Due to:
           a) dependence of the (n,p) cross section on neutron
              energy;
           b) the  probability  that  a  proton  track  ends  in
            emulsion;
           c) background,  which  was quite negligible for E > 3
              MeV and was of the order of 10%  in the region E =
              (2 - 3) MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    In the  neutron  spectrum  a  hight-energy tail and a
            wide peak around 5.5 MeV show that  other  processes
            besides  evaporation  occur in the neutron emission.
            The direct interaction may account for about 30%  of
            the emitted neutrons.
