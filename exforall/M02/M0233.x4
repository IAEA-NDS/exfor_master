TITLE      PROTON POLARIZATION IN GAMMA HE3,4 - PX REACTIONS AND
           QUASIDEUTERON MODEL.

INSTITUTE  (4CCPKFT)
REFERENCE  (J,YF,47,1505,88)
FACILITY   (LINAC,4CCPKFT). IT WAS 2 GEV ACCELERETOR LUE-2.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) WITH END-POINT ENERGY 600 MEV.
INC-SPECT  THE SIZE OF THE PHOTON BEAM WAS MADE AS 16*16 MM-SQ.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA). THE INCLUSIVE PROTON POLARISATION IN
           PHOTON INTERACTION WITH HE-3 AND HE-4 NUCLEI WAS
           PRODUCED.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
PART-DET   (P)
SAMPLE     THE LIQUID TARGET WITH 120 MM IN A LONG AND 25 MM
           IN A DIAMETER WAS USED.
ANALYSIS   THE POLARIZATION WAS INDEPENDENT FROM THE MINIMUM ANGLE
           OF THE SECONDARY PROTONS SCATTERING ON THE HE-3 AND
           HE-4 NUCLEI. AS THE RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS THE ANGLE OF
           POLARIZATION WAS TAKEN TO EQUAL 5. DEGREES.
ADD-RES    (COMP). COMPARISION WITH POLARIZATION VALUES MEASURED
           IN THE GD - PN REACTION UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
           DISTRIBUTION OF PI-MESONS WAS LESS THAN 2%.
           DISTRIBUTION OF PROTONS FROM A TARGET WALL WAS
           LESS THAN 65%.
COMMENT    ANG-MIN IS THE MINIMUM VALUE OF SCATTERING ANGLE.
           ANG-MAX IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF SCATTERING ANGLE.
