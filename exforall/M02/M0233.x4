FACILITY   (LINAC,4UKRKFT). It was 2 GeV accelerator LUE-2.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) With end-point energy 600 MeV.
INC-SPECT  The size of the photon beam was made as 16*16 mm-sq.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA). The inclusive proton polarisation in
           photon interaction with He-3 and He-4 nuclei was
           produced.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
PART-DET   (P)
SAMPLE     The liquid target with 120 mm in a long and 25 mm
           in a diameter was used.
ANALYSIS   The polarization was independent from the minimum angle
           of the secondary protons scattering on the He-3 and
           He-4 nuclei. As the result of the analysis the angle of
           polarization was taken to equal 5. degrees.
ADD-RES    (COMP). Comparison with polarization values measured
           in the Gd - pn reaction under similar conditions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
           Distribution of pi-mesons was less than 2%.
           Distribution of protons from a target wall was
           less than 65%.
COMMENT    Ang-min is the minimum value of scattering angle.
           Ang-max is the maximum value of scattering angle.
