TITLE      DISCOVERY OF ACTIVATION LEVEL OF ENERGY 3.55 MEV IN
           THE PHOTOEXCITATION OF ISOMERIC STATE (T(1/2)=18
           MICROSEC) BY BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM IN TA-181 NUCLEI.

INSTITUTE  (4CCPFTI)
REFERENCE  (J,IZV,51,40,87)
FACILITY   (BETAT,4CCPFTI). 4 MEV BETATRON WAS USED FOR ACTIVATION
INC-SOURCE (BRST) WITH END-POINT ENERGY FROM 2.8 MEV UP TO 4. MEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (NAICR).   A LARGE NAI CRYSTAL 150*100 MM-SQ WAS USED
           TO RAISE OF EFFECTIVITY OF G-QUANTA DETECTION. IT
           WAS PLACED IN LEAD BLOCK, WHICH WAS PROTECTED FROM
           THE DIRECT BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM BY LEAD FILTER.
PART-DET   (G)
SAMPLE     THICKNESS IS OF ABOUT 4 G/CM-SQ. THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLE
           IS EQUAL TO 120*120 MM-SQ. IT WAS PLACED AT THE ANGLE
           OF 45 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE
           BREMSSTRAHLUNG BEAM.
ADD-RES    (G-SPC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    THE YIELD CURVE WAS ANALYSED BY USING HI-2 METHOD FOR
           DETERMINING THE ACTIVATION LEVEL ENERGY.
           THE EXISTENCE OF THE 3.55 MEV LEVEL WAS DETERMINED BY
            THE CHANGE OF THE YIELD CURVE SLOPE.
