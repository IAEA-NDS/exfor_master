TITLE      Discovery of activation level of energy 3.55  MeV  in
            the  photoexcitation  of  isomeric  state (T(1/2)=18
            microsec) by bremsstrahlung beam in Ta-181 nuclei.

INSTITUTE  (4RUSFTI)
FACILITY   (BETAT,4RUSFTI) 4 MeV betatron.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) End-point energy from 2.8 MeV up to 4.0 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A large NAI crystal 150*100 mm-sq was used to
            raise of effectivity of g-quanta detection.  It  was
            placed  in lead block,  which was protected from the
            direct bremsstrahlung beam by lead filter.
PART-DET   (G)
SAMPLE     Thickness  is  of  about 4 g/cm-sq.  The size  of the
            sample  is  equal to 120*120 mm-sq. It was placed at
            the  angle  of  45  degrees   with  respect  to  the
            direction of the bremsstrahlung beam.
ADD-RES    (G-SPC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The yield curve was analysed by using hi-2 method for
            determining the activation level energy.
           The existence of the 3.55 MeV level was determined by
            the change of the yield curve slope.
