COMMENT    The mechanism of the three-particle photonuclear
            reaction 7Li(gamma,p2t) MeV has been investigated at
            Eg < 27 MeV on the basis of the identified stars
            measured in nuclear emulsion.
           The formation of protons and two tritons in the
            reaction is explained using the feynman diagram
            mechanism with the virtual cluster (n-6Li) or (p-6He)
            states of 7Li nucleus. The gamma-quantum absorption by
            the a=6 cluster with disintegration into two A=3
            fragments, and rescattering of virtual nucleon at the
            A=3 nucleus with formation of final particles is taken
            into consideration.  To identify the mechanism of the
            simplest feynman diagrams the usage of correlations
            between the energies of incident and emitting
            particles in virtual processes was suggested.
