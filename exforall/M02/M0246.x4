TITLE      ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF PHOTO-PROTONS FROM LI, AL, S,
           NI, AND CU.
AUTHOR     (M.MASUDA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNOSA)
REFERENCE  (J,JPJ,16,(10),1801,61)
FACILITY   (BETAT,2JPNOSA)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (SCIN). TWO ZN-S SCINTILLATORS FIXED AT 180 DEGREES
           WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER, WERE USED   THE OVER-
           ALL ANGULAR  REGION BEING FROM 30 TO 330 DEGREES.
ANALYSIS   THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION WAS  ANALYSED BY LEAST SQUARE
           FIT ASSUMING THAT :
                 A+B*(SIN(TETA))**2*(1+C*COS(TETA))**2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
ADD-RES    (THEO). THE RESULT WAS COMPARED WITH THE THEORY
           BASED ON THE 'TWO-STAGE MECHANISM'.
COMMENT    THIN FOILS OF LITHIUM, SULFUR, ALUMINUM, NIKEL
           AND COPPER HAVE BEEN IRRADIATED, AND THE ANGULAR
           DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOPROTONS WAS OBTAINED.
           THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOPROTONS THUS
           OBTAINED CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO BROAD TYPES, ONE
           ISOTROPIC AND THE OTHER FORWARD ASYMMETRIC.
           THE  ANGULAR  DISTRIBUTION  FOR  ALUMINIUM  AND
           NICKEL (21 MEV) BELONG TO THE FORMER TYPE; WHILE THAT
           FOR   LITHIUM, SULFUR, NICKEL (18 MEV) AND COPPER FALL
           UNDER THE LATTER TYPE, WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY THE
           THEORETICAL FORM, A+B*SIN(TETA)**2*(1+C*COS(TETA))**2.
           AS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE, COPPER HAS SHOWN AN ABNORMAL
           ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION HAVING A MAXIMUM IN THE FORWARD
           DIRECTION AND ALSO A RISE UP IN THE BACKWARD DIRECTION.
           THE FUNCTIONAL FORM WHICH FITS BEST TO THIS
           DISTRIBUTION HAS BEEN CALCULATED BY A BENDIX COMPUTER
           AND COMPARED WITH THE RECENT THEORY OF PHOTONUCLEAR
           REACTIONS.
