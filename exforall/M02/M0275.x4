TITLE      Electro- and photodisintegration cross sections of
            Cu-63.
AUTHOR     (M.B.Scott,A.O.Hanson,D.W.Kerst)
INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,100,209,1955)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
FACILITY   (BETAT,1USAUI) With high energy 22 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     Sample thickness 46.9 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4Pi scintillator was used.
DECAY-DATA (29-CU-62,9.55MIN,B+).
ADD-RES    (COMP) With  data of early experimental measurements.
           (THEO) The  ratio  of  photon  induced  activity   to
            electron  induced  activity was found to be 5 to 10%
            above  that  predicted   for   a   magnetic   dipole
            excitation.
           (DECAY) T1/2(62Cu) = 9.55+/-0.15 min.
COMMENT    The activity curve was measured in the experiment.
           The electrodisintegration   and   photodisintegration
            cross sections were calculated.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The   main   sources   of   error  was  those
            associated with absolute measurements of charge with
            the Faraday cage,  the determination of the absolute
            rates. These errors were estimated to be 3%.
           (ERR-T) The total errors were estimated to be 5%.

REACTION   (29-CU-63(E,N)29-CU-62,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are less than the size
            of the points except where they are shown.
