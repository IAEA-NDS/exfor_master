TITLE      ELECTRO- AND PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS SECTIONS OF
           CU-63.
AUTHOR     (M.B.SCOTT,A.O.HANSON,D.W.KERST)
INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
REFERENCE  (J,PR,100,209,55)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
FACILITY   (BETAT,1USAUI) WITH HIGH ENERGY 22 MEV.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
SAMPLE     SAMPLE THICKNESS 46.9 MG/CM-SQ.
DETECTOR   (SCIN). 4PI SCINTILLATOR WAS USED.
PART-DET   (B+) FROM DESINTEGRATION OF CU-62.
ADD-RES    (COMP) WITH DATA OF EARLY EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS.
           (THEO) THE RATIO OF PHOTON INDUCED ACTIVITY TO ELECTRON
            INDUCED ACTIVITY WAS FOUND TO BE 5 TO 10% ABOVE THAT
            PREDICTED FOR A MAGNETIC DIPOLE EXCITATION.
COMMENT    THE ACTIVITY CURVE WAS MEASURED IN THE EXPERIMENT.
           THE ELECTRODISINTEGRATION AND PHOTODISINTEGRATION CROSS
            SECTIONS WERE CALCULATED.
ERR-ANALYS THE MAIN SOURCES OF ERROR WAS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH
           ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS OF CHARGE WITH THE FARADEY CAGE,
           THE DETERMINATION OF THE ABSOLUTE RATES. THESE ERRORS
           WERE  ESTIMATED TO BE 3%. THE TOTAL ERRORS WERE
           ESTIMATED TO BE 5%.
