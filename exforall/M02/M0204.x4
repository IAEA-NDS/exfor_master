REFERENCE  (J,NC,19,(5),864,61)
FACILITY   (BETAT,3BZLUSP)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
INC-SPECT  THE TOTAL DOSE WAS 990 R.
METHOD     (REC)
SAMPLE     A CYLINDRICAL TARGET OF BI (THICKNESS=1.5 CM,
           DIAMETER=1 CM).
DETECTOR   (PLATE).A 400 MU THICK ILFORD C2 EMULSIONS.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   DATA ARE NORMALIZED FOR EQUAL SCANNED VOLUMES.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
CORRECTION FOR A)EFFICIENCY OF THE SCANNERS(OF THE ORDER OF 70PC),
               B)BACK-GROUND(FROM 10 TO 20 PC),
               C)GEOMETRICAL LOSSES,
               D)VARIATION OF (N,P) CROSS-SECTIONS WITH ENERGY.
ADD-RES    (THEO).THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS CAN BE DESCRIBED BY
           THE FORMULA A+B*SIN**2+C*COS. THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE
           RATIO B/A IS 0.68 WITH ERROR 0.15 AND THE AVERAGE
           VALUE OF C/A=0.155 WITH ERROR 0.056.
COMMENT    AN EXCESS OF HIGH ENERGY NEUTRONS OVER THE EVAPORATION
           SPECTRUM EXISTING AT ALL ANGLES WAS MEASURED.
           THE VARIATION OF B/A WITH ENERGY WAS STUDIED. THE DATA
           INDICATE A MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE RATIO B/A AROUND
           5.5 MEV.
STATUS     (CURVE)
HISTORY    (860527C).DATA WERE COMPILED IN SCJAD OF SARATOV STATE
           UNIVERSITY.
