TITLE      Fast photoneutrons from bismuth.

FACILITY   (BETAT,3BZLUSP)
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
INC-SPECT  The total dose was 990 r.
METHOD     (REC)
SAMPLE     A cylindrical target of Bi (thickness = 1.5 cm,
            diameter = 1 cm).
DETECTOR   (PLATE) A 400 mu thick Ilford C2 emulsions.

ANALYSIS   Data are normalized for equal scanned volumes.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
CORRECTION For: a) efficiency of the scanners(of the order of
            70%),
                b) back-ground(from 10 to 20%),
                c) geometrical losses,
                d) variation of (n,p) cross sections with energy.
ADD-RES    (THEO) The  angular distributions can be described by
            the formula A+B*sin**2+C*cos.  The average value  of
            the  ratio  B/A  is  0.68  with  error  0.15 and the
            average value of C/A = 0.155 with error 0.056.
COMMENT    An excess   of   high   energy   neutrons   over  the
            evaporation spectrum  existing  at  all  angles  was
            measured.
           The variation of B/A with  energy  was  studied.  The
            data  indicate  a  maximum  value  of  the ratio B/A
            around 5.5 MeV.
