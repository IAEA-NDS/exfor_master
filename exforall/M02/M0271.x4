COMMENT    THE CROSS SECTION OF THE REACTION CU-63(G,N)CU-62 FOR
            LI GAMMA RAYS WAS MEASURED IN ORDER TO DISCOVER SOME
            CAUSES OF THE EXISTING DISCREPANCY BETWEEN VALUES
            MEASURED BY BREMSSTRAHLUNGS AND BY NUCLEAR GAMMA RAYS.
            EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT WERE
            MUCH IMPROVED AS COMPARED WITH THOSE USED IN PREVIOUS
            MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED IN LABORATORY FOR THE SAME
            PURPOSE.
           THE PRESENT RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOWS:
              SIGMA(LI-G)=62(4) MB (FOR LI GAMMA RAYS), AND
              SIGMA(EG=17.6)=76(5)  B FOR 17.6 MEV GAMMA-RAYS.
           THIS VALUE IS ABOUT 30% LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE CROSS
            SECTION VALUE DETERMINED BY PHOTON DIFFERENCE METHOD
            IN SEVERAL BREMSSTRAHLUNG' EXPERIMENTS.
           THEREFORE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE MODIFIED SPECTRUM METHOD
            PROPOSED BY PENFOLD AND LEISS MIGHT ELIMINATE NOT ONLY
            THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DISCREPANCY BUT ALSO THE
            DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
            VALUES IN THE FORM  SIG**(-2), AS POINTED OUT BY
            LEVINGER.
