METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR)
           The positron activity was determined by a coincident
            detector consisting of two 7.6 cm diameter by 7.6 cm
            long NAI crystals set on the annihilation radiation
            photopeaks.
           Gamma-rays were monitored by a 23 cm diameter by 23 cm
            long NAI crystal. The gamma-ray energy resolution was
            better than 110 keV over the whole energy range.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are presented.
COMMENT    The Zn-64(g,n)Zn-63 cross section has been measured
            over the energy range Eg=20.43 to Eg=21.94 MeV using
            monoenergetic gamma-quanta.
           The structure reported by other experimenters, was not
            observed.
