INC-SOURCE (MPH=(1-H-3,(P,G)2-HE-4))
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA)
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR)
           THE POSITRON ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED BY A COINCIDENT
            DETECTOR CONSISTING OF TWO 7.6 CM DIAMETER BY 7.6 CM
            LONG NAI CRYSTALS SET ON THE ANNIHILATION RADIATION
            PHOTOPEAKS.
           GAMMA-RAYS WERE MONITORED BY A 23 CM DIAMETER BY 23 CM
            LONG NAI CRYSTAL. THE GAMMA-RAY ENERGY RESOLUTION WAS
            BETTER THAN 110 KEV OVER THE WHOLE ENERGY RANGE.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL ERRORS ARE PRESENTED.
COMMENT    THE ZN-64(G,N)ZN-63 CROSS SECTION HAS BEEN MEASURED
           OVER THE ENERGY RANGE EG=20.43 TO EG=21.94 MEV USING
           . THE STRUCTURE REPORTED BY OTHER EXPERIMENTERS, WAS
             NOT OBSERVED.
