            behaviour of  the  bremsstrahlung  spectrum near the

COMMENT    Measurements are presented of the photofission cross
            section  and  mean number nu of neutrons per fission
            for  Th-232  made  using  bremsstrahlung  from   the
            harwell  electron  linear  accelerator  helios and a
            high efficiency neutron detector to  record  neutron
            multiplicity  distributions.  The  cross  section is
            interpreted in terms of fission barrier with shallow
            wells  in  two separate outer barriers.  Interesting
            structure is observed in nu as a function of  photon
            energy.

COMMENT    The effective  photon energy spectrum was constructed
            from linear combination of bremsstrahlung spectra at
            different   endpoint  energies.  The  width  of  the
            resolution function (FWHM) was about 80 keV. The raw
            data  comprise  the  set  of  pairs  of photoneutron
            multiplicity  nu  distributions   corresponding   to
            neighboring  bremsstrahlung  endpoint energies.  The
            set of difference distributions was then regarded as
            a  set  of  yield  difference  curves,  one for each
            multiplicity,  and  these  curves  were   separately
            unfolded   to   give   cross   sections   for   each
            multiplicity as a function  of  photon  energy.  The
            final  stage  in  the  data  analysis was to fit the
            cross sections for individual multiplicities at  the
            same  photon energies with the TRDG (an extension of
            the terelly  neutron  multiplicity  distribution  to
            accomodate  separate  consideration  of two  fission
            fragments)  neutron  multiplicity  distribution   to
            obtain the number of fissions and hence sig(g,f) and
            nu.
