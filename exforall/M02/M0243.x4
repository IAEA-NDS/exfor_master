SAMPLE     THE TH-232 TARGET WITH THICKNESSES BETWEEN  2 MG/CM**2
            AND 4 G/CM**2.

            UNFOLDING METHOD  WITH  SPECIFICALLY  ACCOMODATES THE
            DETAILED BEHAVIOUR  OF  THE  BREMSSTRAHLUNG  SPECTRUM
            NEAR   THE  ENDPOINT.  THE  EFFECTIVE  PHOTON  ENERGY
            SPECTRUM WAS CONSTRUCTED FROM LINEAR  COMBINATION  OF
            BREMSSTRAHLUNG    SPECTRA   AT   DIFFERENT   ENDPOINT
            ENERGIES. THE WIDTH OF THE RESOLUTION FUNCTION (FWHM)
            WAS  ABOUT  80 KEV.  THE RAW DATA COMPRISE THE SET OF
            PAIRS OF PHOTONEUTRON MULTIPLICITY  NU  DISTRIBUTIONS
            CORRESPONDING  TO NEIGHBORING BREMSSTRAHLUNG ENDPOINT
            ENERGIES.  THE SET OF  DIFFERENCE  DISTRIBUTIONS  WAS
            THEN  REGARDED  AS  A SET OF YIELD DIFFERENCE CURVES,
            ONE FOR EACH  MULTIPLICITY,  AND  THESE  CURVES  WERE
            SEPARATELY  UNFOLDED  TO GIVE CROSS SECTIONS FOR EACH
            MULTIPLICITY AS A  FUNCTION  OF  PHOTON  ENERGY.  THE
            FINAL STAGE IN THE DATA ANALYSIS WAS TO FIT THE CROSS
            SECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MULTIPLICITIES  AT  THE  SAME
            PHOTON ENERGIES  WITH  THE  TRDG (AN EXTENSION OF THE
            TERELLY NEUTRON    MULTIPLICITY    DISTRIBUTION    TO

COMMENT    MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED OF  THE PHOTOFISSIION CROSS
            SECTION AND  MEAN  NUMBER  NU OF NEUTRONS PER FISSION
            FOR TH-232 MADE USING BREMSSTRAHLUNG FROM THE HARWELL

            EFFICIENCY NEUTRON   DETECTOR   TO   RECORD   NEUTRON
            MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTIONS.   THE  CROSS  SECTION  IS
            INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF FISSION BARRIER WITH  SHALLOW
            WELLS IN  TWO  SEPARATE  OUTER BARRIERS.  INTERESTING
            STRUCTURE IS OBSERVED IN NU AS A FUNCTION  OF  PHOTON
            ENERGY.
