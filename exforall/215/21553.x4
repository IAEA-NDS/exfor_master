AUTHOR     (H.Gaeggeler,H.R.Von Gunten)
TITLE       Cumulative yields of rare earth elements in the
            thermal neutron induced fission of Cf-249.
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMNZ) TRIGA II Reactor, Mainz.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal reactor neutrons.
INC-SPECT  Maxwellian distribution of thermal neutrons.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Measurement of gamma activity of
           chemically separated products. The fission products
           were trapped in a NH4NO3 recoil catcher foil,
           dissolved and separated in a Dowex exchange column.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Calibrated Ge(Li) and intrinsic Ge planar
            detectors.

REACTION   (98-CF-249(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,MXW)
            Yields are described in table 1 as chain yields
            but are in fact cumulative yields. (PDJ)

ANALYSIS   .Quoted values are weighted means of five independent
            measurements.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)98-CF-249(N,F)60-ND-147,CUM,FY,,MXW)
           to a cumulative yield of 3.27 pc/fis.
           Experiments 1-3 were normalized to yield 3.27% of
           Nd-147. In experiments 3-5 the Sm-Er fraction was
           normalized to the yield 0.60% for Eu-156 obtained in
           experiment 2.
MONIT-REF  (40145002,B.V.Kurchatov+,J,SNP,14,528,1972)
CORRECTION .Yields are corrected for decay and growth.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) One standard deviation, including stat.
            uncertainties and uncertainties in detector
            calibrations and decay schemes. Other systematic
            errors are less than 5 percent.

           (20150825A) M.M. Data were corrected as given in
           Table 1: Ho-167 and Er-171 yields were moved in
           DATA-MAX, their errors ( 100%, the same values as data)
           were deleted (absent in Table 1).
