TITLE       Estimation for production of Molybdenum-99
            using (n,gamma) reaction.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) Thermal reactor JRR-2.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor.
SAMPLE     .Sample and monitor were packed in aluminium
            and/or cadmium foils. The monitor was a gold
            foil of 19.3 mg/cm2 thick, 5 mm * 5 mm surface,
            purity 99.99%. The sample was natural Mo,
            102 mg/cm2, 7 mm wide, 12 mm long. The Al plate
            was 135 mg/cm2 thick 2S Al. The Cd plate was
            303 mg/cm2 thick, with a purity of 99.99%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation analysis.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (GELI ) Ge(Li) detector. No further details.
            Connected to a 400 channels pulse height analyzer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) .Statistical average only.
PART-DET   (DG) Decay gammas.
