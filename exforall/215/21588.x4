TITLE       Inelastic scattering of 14 MeV neutrons by
            heavy nuclei
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNKYU) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium reaction with 200 keV
            deuterons.
           (D-D) The D(d,n)3He reaction also was used as neutron
           source to obtain the detector efficiency for low energy
           neutrons.
SAMPLE     .Cylindrical, 2.54 cm diam, 2.54 cm long, at 7.3 cm
            from the neutron source, natural elements, isotopic
            compositions given in table 1 of NST,11,(12),523,1974
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight method to measure the
            scattered neutron spectra. 80 cm flight path.
            Overall time resolution about 2 ns.
           (ASSOP) Associated particle method.
           (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination to discriminate
            against gammas.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) Liquid organic scintillator, NE-123, 5.08 cm
            diam, 5.08 cm long, connected with two 56 AVP
            photomultipliers.
