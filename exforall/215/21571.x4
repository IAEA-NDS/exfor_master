TITLE       Absolute neutron flux measurements and determination
            of the undisturbed resonance integral of the
            239Pu(n,f)-reaction with a solid state fission counter
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) FRM-reactor of Munich.
SAMPLE      The samples of U-233 and Pu-239 as thick as
            10-30 mg/cm**2 are prepared by molecular electoplating
            techniques from organic solutions on Al-foils.
            The effective surface of the fissile material on
            the target was about 80 mm**2.
INC-SPECT  Neutron flux was about 2 x 10**7 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (ASSOP) Counting of alpha particles and fission
            fragments.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Surface barrier counter with 100 micro-
            meters depleted depth and 100 mm diameter. The
            detector was placing in a home made vacuum chamber.
ANALYSIS    By measurements of the relative alpha desintegra-
            tion rate and fission reaction rate of the target
            and monitor nuclide with the fission counter, the
            effective cross section of the Pu-239(n,f)-reaction
            was determined by using the Westcott convention.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI) Resonance
            integral including the 1/v part.
CORRECTION .For the scattering and self absorption effects.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Average statistical errors.
