TITLE      -ABSOLUTE NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENTS AND DETERMINATION
            OF THE UNDISTURBED RESONANCE INTEGRAL OF THE 239-PU
            (N,F)-REACTION WITH A SOLID STATE FISSION COUNTER-.
FACILITY   (REAC ) FRM-REACTOR OF MUNICH.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES OF U-233 AND PU-239 AS THICK AS 10-30
            MG/CM**2 ARE PREPARED BY MOLECULAR ELECTOPLATING
            TECHNIQUES FROM ORGANIC SOLUTIONS ON AL-FOILS.
            THE EFFECTIVE SURFACE OF THE FISSILE MATERIAL ON
            THE TARGET WAS ABOUT 80 MM**2.
METHOD     (ASSOP) COUNTING OF ALPHA PARTICLES AND FISSION
            FRAGMENTS.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SOLID STATE FISSION COUNTER WITH 100 MICRO-
            METERS DEPLETED DEPTH AND 100 MM DIAMETER. THE
            DETECTOR WAS PLACING IN A HOME MADE VACUUM CHAMBER.
ANALYSIS   .BY MEASUREMENTS OF THE RELATIVE ALPHA DESINTEGRA-
            TION RATE AND FISSION REACTION RATE OF THE TARGET
            AND MONITOR NUCLIDE WITH THE FISSION COUNTER, THE
            EFFECTIVE CROSS SECTION OF THE PU-239(N,F)-REACTION
            WAS DETERMINED BY USING THE WESTCOTT CONVENTION.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-M+G,,RI/SUM) RESONANCE
            INTEGRAL INCLUDING THE 1/V PART.
