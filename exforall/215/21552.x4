COMMENT    Preliminary yields were not corrected for contributions
           by the second order reaction and deviate from the
           values given here.

           (REAC,2GERMNZ) Cf-249 irradiation in TRIGA Mark II
INC-SOURCE (REAC) SAPHIR: Irradiation was 6.0 hr in a preliminary
           measurements and 5-10 min in a subsequent experiments.
           Thermal flux was  3 to 5 x 10*13 n/cm*2/sec.
           TRIGA: Irradiation was 6.0 hr and thermal flux
           was  6 x 10*11 n/cm*2/sec.
INC-SPECT  Maxwellian thermal neutron spectrum.
SAMPLE     In a preliminary set of experiments solutions of
           uranium and plutonium (10-30/ug) were evaporated and
           wrapped in aluminium foils.
            For subsequent experiments 1-10 mg samples of uranium
           and plutonium oxides (sealed in aluminium or quartz
           tubes) were used.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Measurement of gamma activity after
           chemical separation of promethium.
DETECTOR   (GELI) a 50. cm3 coaxial Ge(Li)-gamma spectrometer was
           used in experiments with uranium and plutonium and
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector, 44. cm3, coaxial, was used
           in experiments with 249Cf.
ANALYSIS    Values given are weighted means of several independent
            measurements.
CORRECTION  Corrected for second order neutron capture reactions.
            This data supersedes the uncorrected values
            published before (see references).
ADD-RES     Values of the measured independent yield divided by
            the chain yield in the literature (see REL-REF) are
            presented.

SAMPLE      An isotopically clean recoil source of Cf-249
            of about 10 ug was used in the Mainz irradiation.
           The irradiation time was 6.0 hr and the thermal neutron
           flux 6 x 10**11/cm/sec. The fission fragments recoiling
           from the 249Cf-target were collected in a layer of
           ammonium nitrate. The target was protected against
           self-transfer of 249Cf by a 10. ug layer of aluminium.
