TITLE       The thermal neutron induced fission cross-section
            of 243-Am
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) Cold neutron beam of the high flux
            reactor of Grenoble.
SAMPLE      243-Am oxide (30.60+-0.15 micrograms) and natural
            uranium oxide (44.20+-0.88 micrograms). The mass
            analysis for the Am material was - 99.969% wt for
            Am-243, 0.031% wt for Am-241 and less than 0.00003% wt
            for Am-242 and Am-244.
METHOD      The fission fragments were recorded with a Multi-8
            data recording system.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Fission fragments were detected by two
            surface barrier detectors.
ANALYSIS    70000 fissions per day for Am-243 targets. The Am-243
            Maxwellian cross section was calculated by
            comparison of the corresponding fission events of
            Am-243 and natural uranium targets.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
CORRECTION  A correction for about 0.5% was applied
            for the Am-241 contribution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error given is composed of the
            uncertainties in the weights of the materials and
            the fission cross section of U-235.

INC-SPECT  Cold neutron beam with Maxwellian energy distribution
           at 25 K. The equivalent thermal neutron flux (at 300K)
           at the target position was ~ 5. x 10**9 n/cm2/sec, with
           a ration to epithermal~ 5. x 10**4.
