TITLE      -THE THERMAL NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION CROSS-SECTION
            OF 243-AM. -
FACILITY   (REAC ) COLD NEUTRON BEAM OF THE HIGH FLUX REACTOR
            OF GRENOBLE.
SAMPLE     .243-AM OXIDE (30.60+-0.15 MICROGRAMS) AND NATURAL
            URANIUM OXIDE (44.20+-0.88 MICROGRAMS). THE MASS
            ANALYSIS FOR THE AM MATERIAL WAS - 99.969 WT PER
            CENT FOR AM-243, 0.031 WT PER CENT FOR AM-241 AND
            LESS THAN 0.00003 WT PER CENT FOR AM-242 AND AM-244.
METHOD     .THE FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE RECORDED WITH A MULTI-8
            DATA RECORDING SYSTEM.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE DETECTED BY TWO
            SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS.
ANALYSIS   .70000 FISSIONS PER DAY FOR AM-243 TARGETS. THE AM-
            243 MAXWELLIAN CROSS SECTION WAS CALCULATED BY
            COMPARISON OF THE CORRESPONDING FISSION EVENTS OF
            AM-243 AND NATURAL URANIUM TARGETS.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
STATUS     .TAKEN FROM ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY 6(1979)561.

CORRECTION .A CORRECTION FOR ABOUT 0.5 PER CENT WAS APPLIED
            FOR THE AM-241 CONTIBUTION.
ERR-ANALYS .THE ERROR GIVEN IS COMPOSED OF THE UNCERTAINTIES
            IN THE WEIGHTS OF THE MATERIALS AND THE FISSION
            CROSS SECTION OF U-235.
