TITLE       The cross section of the reaction S-33(n,p)P-33
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) FRM.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Fission neutrons in reactor core.
SAMPLE      (NH4)2SO4 and K2so4 with and without cadmium
            cover.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation analysis. Measurement 80 days
            after the irradiation of 4 days in FRM. Beta-
            absorption curves measured. Contribution from
            P-32 determined by the shape of the absorption
            curve and subtracted. 3 independent measurements
            were done - 1 irradiation in the reactor core with
            cadmium using (NH4)2SO4, 1 without cadmium, and
            1 using K(2)-S-O(4) in the reactor core without
            cadmium.
DETECTOR    4*Pi beta counter, no further details.
MONITOR    (16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG,,FIS)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The mean deviation of the single
           measurements is given, which is greater than the
           errors of the single measurements.
