AUTHOR     (M.BOSMAN,A.BOL,J.F.GILOT,P.LELEUX,P.LIPNIK,

TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE
            H-1(N,G)H-2 REACTION BETWEEN 37 AND 72 MEV.-
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) SYNCHRONOUS CYCLOTRON CYCLONE OF
            LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 3 MICRO-AMPERE PROTON BEAMS OF 40, 50, 55,
            60, 65 AND 75 MEV IMPINGING ON 4 MM THICK LI-TARGET.
SAMPLE     .LIQUID H(2) TARGET, 4.5 MM OR 6.5 MM THICK, 4 CM
            DIAM, 3 M DOWNSTREAM THE NEUTRON PRODUCTION TARGET.
            ITS VACUUM JACKET HAS HAVAR WINDOWS OF 5 MG/CM*CM
            AND 10 MG/CM*CM RESPECTIVILY.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT MEASURED BETWEEN BEAM PICK-OFF
            AND DETECTOR S1, BETWEEN S1 AND S2, AND BETWEEN S1
            AND S5.
           (COINC) FAST PROTONS ARE DETECTED BY A COINCIDENCE
            PC1(-),PC2(+),S1(+),S2(+),S3(+),S4(-),S5(+), WHERE
            + MEANS SIGNAL AND - MEANS NO SIGNAL. DEUTERONS AND
            SLOW PROTONS ARE DETECTED BY PC1(-),PC2(+),S1(+),
            S2(+),S3(-). THESE 2 KINDS OF COINCIDENCES TRIGGER
            THE RECORDING OF AN EVENT, WHICH IS THEN STORED ON
            MAGNETIC TAPE WITH THE PARAMETERS IS (1) THE KIND OF
            COINCIDENCE, (2) THE PULSE HEIGHTS FROM PC1, PC2,
            S1,S2,S3,S4,S5, AND (3) THE TIME-OF-FLIGHTS MENTIONED
            ABOVE.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) TWO PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS ARE USED : PC1, PC2.
            PC1 - GAS PROPORTIONAL COUNTER IN FRONT OF THE LIQUID
                  HYDROGEN TARGET TO REJECT CHARGED PARTICLES
                  CONTAMINATING THE NEUTRON BEAM (ABOUT 1.E-4).
                  FILLED WITH ISOBUTANE-METHYLAL-ARGON MIXTURE,
                  5 MG/CM*CM HAVAR-WINDOWS.
            PC2 - GAS PROPORTIONAL COUNTER BEHIND THE H(2)-
                  TARGET, 2 CM THICK, TRIGGERS ON CHARGED
                  PARTICLES FROM THE TARGET REGION, FILLED WITH
                  SAME GAS AS PC1, 2.7 MG/CM*CM AL-WINDOWS.
           (SCIN ) FIVE SCINTILLATION COUNTERS : S1,S2,S3,S4,S5.
            S1  - DE-COUNTER JUST BEHIND PC2. 0.1 OR 0.5 MM THIN.
            S2  - E-COUNTER, THICKNESS ADJUSTED TO MAXIMUM RANGE
                  OF THE DEUTERONS, COVERING THE HOLE LABORATORY
                  ANGLE OF DEUTERON EMISSION ( 7. DEGREES).
            S3  - SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN S2 AND JUST BEHIND IT.
            S4  - BEHIND S3 AT A LAB-ANGLE OF 3.3 DEGREES, WITH A
                  3 CM DIAM HOLE IN IT, DEFINING THE SOLID ANGLE
                  OF S5 JUST BEHIND IT.
            S5  - 5 CM THICK, 5 CM DIAM.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) ELASTICALLY SCATTERED PROTONS
            AT 3.3 DEGREES LAB-ANGLE, I.E. 173. DEGR. CMS-ANGLE.
            ONLY KNOWN WITH A PRECISION OF ABOUT 5 PERC AND SO
            THE MAIN SOURCE OF ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENTS.
