TITLE      -REACTOR NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF 60.3
            DAY SB-124.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) REACTOR JRR-3.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR NEUTRONS.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN NEUTRON SPECTRUM FROM
            REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .1.2 CM DIAM, 4 CM LONG, ENCAPSULATED TIGHTLY IN
            AN AL CASE. FOR COUNTING THE SAMPLE WAS SHAPED TO
            A SIZE OF ABOUT 1 MM DIAM AND THICKNESS. THE WEIGHT
            WAS 2.02 MG.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 283.5 H IRRADIATION OF NATURAL SB, FOLLOWED
            BY 3.50 YEARS COOLING TIME. THE RATIO OF THE
            SB-124 AND SB-125 DECAY GAMMA ACTIVITIES
            GIVES THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO OBTAIN THE
            (N,G) CROSS SECTION OF SB-124 FROM OTHER DATA.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) 50 CC COAXIAL GELI-DETECTOR AT 5 CM FROM
            SAMPLE SURFACE.

ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTY IN THE CROSS SECTION ESTIMATED FROM
            7.5 PERC ERROR IN THE ACTIVITY RATIO MEASUREMENT,
            AND 7.8 PERCENT IN THE NEUTRON FLUX DETERMINATION.
            THE ERROR IN THE ACTIVITY RATIO RESULTS FROM 5 PERC
            ERROR IN THE PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY AND 5.6 PERC IN
            THE GAMMA RAY INTENSITY IN THE DECAY. THE ERROR
            IN THE FLUX MEASUREMENT CONTAINS 5.2 PERC FROM
            PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY, 3 PERCENT FROM EPITHERMAL
            ACTIVATION CORRECTION AND 5 PERC IN DETERMINATION
            OF NUMBER OF CO-59 ATOMS.
