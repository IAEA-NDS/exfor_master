TITLE      -Reactor neutron capture cross section of 60.3
            day Sb-124.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) Reactor JRR-3.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) Reactor neutrons.
INC-SPECT  -Thermal Maxwellian neutron spectrum from
            reactor 6.E+12 n/cm**2/sec (nominal).
            Thermal neutron flux obtained by Co was
            (4.92+-0.38)*10**12 n/cm**2/sec at sample position.
SAMPLE     - 1.2 cm diameter, 4 cm long, encapsulated tightly in
            an Al case. After cooling,for counting the sample was
            shaped to a size of about 1 mm diam and thickness.
            The weight was 2.02 mg.
            Cobalt impurity included in antimony sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 283.5 h irradiation of natural Sb, followed
            by 3.50 years cooling time. The ratio of the
            Sb-124 and Sb-125 decay gamma activities
            gives the necessary information to obtain the
            (N,G) cross section of Sb-124 from other data.
           (GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectrum measurement during
                   259.732 sec (about 3 days).
DETECTOR   (GELI ) 50 cc coaxial Ge(Li)-detector at 5 cm from
            sample surface. For gamma-ray spectrum measurement

ERR-ANALYS  Uncertainty in the cross section estimated from :
           (ERR-1) Error in the activity ratio 7.5 %,
           (ERR-2) Error in the neutron flux determination 7.8 % .
            The error in the activities ratio results from :
           (ERR-3) Error in the photopeak efficiency 5.%
           (ERR-4) Error in the gamma ray intensity in the decay
                   5.6 % .
            The error in the flux measurement contains :
           (ERR-5) Error from Co-60 activity 5.2 %,
           (ERR-6) Error from epithermal activation correction 3%,
           (ERR-7) Error in determination of number of Co-59
                   atoms 5.%.
CORRECTION At neutron flux determination the factors of correction
           for diminution of Co-59 and Co-60 during irradiation -
           0.997 (estimated from irradiation time 283.5 h) and
           for epithermal activation of Co-59 - 1.02 (obtained by
           using cadmium ratio 52 for Co, calculated from cadmium
           ratio 7.5 for Au at the irradiation hole of JRR-3).

            Photo-peak of 1.333 MeV Co-60 was used for thermal
            neutron flux determination. Photo-peak yield 4683
            counts, photo-peak efficiency 9.6E-4 for 1.33 MeV
            gamma-ray.
ANALYSIS    Photo-peak yields ratio of Sb-125 to Sb-124 was used
            to estimate the effective thermal neutron capture
            cross section of Sb-124. Values of detector efficiency
            3.4E-03 and 8.6E-4 were used for 428-keV and 1.691-MeV
            gamma-rays, respectively.Photo-peak yields in spectrum
            were 121824 and 18695 counts for 428 keV and 1.691 MeV
            gammas, respectively.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Activities Ratio of Co-125 to Co-124.
           (MISC2) Error of MISC1.
COMMENT    Of authors. Antimony sample was activated in the
           irradiation hole of JRR-3.No irradiation covered with
           cadmium was carried out. Obtained result gives the
           reactor neutron capture cross section, that is not
           thermal but effective (including epithermal) neutron
           capture cross section. It is  therefore considered that
           the present cross section value is a maximum value for
           the thermal neutron capture cross section of Sb-124.
