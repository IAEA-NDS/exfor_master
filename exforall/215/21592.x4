TITLE      -Cumulative fission yields from Cf-252 -.
FACILITY   .Spontaneous fission source.
SAMPLE     .Sample was 3 micro-gm Cf-252, deposited on a nickel
            foil, 0.3 mm thick. The source strength was 5 10*6
            fissions per second. Irradiations were for 1 to 17
            days duration.
METHOD     .Method of terrell. An aluminium foil, 4.5 mg/cm*2
            thick is placed above the Cf-252 source, shielded
            from direct contact with the Cf-252 by a thin foil
            of formvar, thickness equivalent to 1 mg/cm*2 of
            aluminium. Fission products are collected on the
            aluminium foil, and chemically seperated into
            fractions containing rare earths, alcalies,
            alkali-earths, ruthenium and zirconium and niobium.
           .Individual fission products were measured by
            gamma spectroscopy.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) Coaxial Ge(Li) detector, 45 ml volume,
            efficiency of 7 percent relative to NaI,
            resolution 2.5 KeV at 1.3 MeV.
ANALYSIS   .Summation of yields for masses 125 to 157 is
            normalised to 100, giving a yield for the Ba-140
            monitor of 6.05 pc/fis.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F)56-BA-140,CUM,FY) Value taken
            as 6.05pc.
STATUS     .Table 5, page 121, JPC,26,107.

           (20060708A) Date is corrected, reference changed - SM
           (20060708U) Last checking has been done.
CORRECTION .Mention is made of correction for daughter product
            yields using a gaussian distribution within each
            isobaric chain. This correction is small except for
            Cd-177.
            .The quoted yields are not cumulative yields
            for individual isotopes but are mass chain yields.
ERR-ANALYS .One standard deviation.
