TITLE      -INDEPENDANT YIELDS OF PM-148M,PM-148G AND PM-146
            FOR THERMAL NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-233
            AND U-235 -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) GRAPHITE MODERATED MUNICH RESEARCH REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) IRRADIATION IN THE GRAPHITE  REFLECTOR.
SAMPLE     .U-235 SAMPLE WAS 3-5 GM URANIUM ENRICHED TO 90 PERCENT
            U-235 AS URANIUM METAL CHIPS WRAPPED IN ALUMINIUM FOIL
           .U-233 SAMPLE WAS 0.1 GM OF U308 ENRICHED TO 99.7
            PERCENT, WRAPPED IN ALUMINIUM FOIL.
            AFTER A DECAY TIME OF THREE DAYS THE PM ISOTOPES
            AND THE BA MONITOR WERE CHEMICALLY SEPERATED AND
            PURIFIED.
METHOD     .CHEMICAL SEPERATION AND PURIFICATION AFTER IRRADIATION
            GAMMA ACTIVITY MEASURED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) COAXIAL GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH 16.9 PERCENT
            PHOTOPEAK EFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO 3 BY 3 NAI.
            THE DETECTOR WAS SHIELDED BY 20 CM LEAD TO REDUCE
            BACKGROUND FROM K-40.

ERR-ANALYS .ERRORS INCLUDE STATISTICAL ERRORS IN ACTIVITY
            MEASUREMENTS, UNCERTAINTIES IN DECAY SCHEMES,
            DETECTOR CALIBRATION ERRORS, CHEMICAL YIELD ERRORS
            AND FISSION RATE NORMALISATION UNCERTAINTY.
            FOR U-235 THESE TOTAL ERRORS ARE FURTHER INCREASED
            TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE UNCERATINTY ASSOCIATED
            WITH THE SECONDARY NEUTRON CAPTURE REACTION ON
            PM-147, THESE ADDITIONAL ERRORS ARE ESTIMATED AS
            FIVE AND FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR THE YIELDS OF THE
            PM-148 METASTABLE AND GROUND STATE RESPECTIVELY.
