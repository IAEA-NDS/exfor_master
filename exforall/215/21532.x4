INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux was 1.8 x 10**13 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     (92-U-233,0.997) The 233U sample of 0.1 g of
             233U (99.7%) as U3O8
           The 233U3O8 sample was divided into 4 portions of
           approx. 25 mg, each of which was wrapped in aluminum
           foil. These 4 portions were then embedded in aluminum
           powder contained in the small aluminum capsule which
           again was sealed in a larger aluminum can.
MONITOR    (92-U-233(N,F)56-BA-140,IND,FY,,MXW) Normalised to
            a value of 6.32 pc/fis for the independent yield of

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) .Errors include:
           (ERR-S)  statistical errors in counting of sample
           (ERR-1) For U-233 total errors are further increased
            to take account of the uncertainty associated
            with the secondary neutron capture reaction on
            Pm-147, these additional errors are estimated as
            five and fifteen percent for the yields of the
            Pm-148 metastable and ground state respectively.
           (ERR-2) error in detector efficiency
           (ERR-3) chemical yield errors
           (ERR-4) fission rate normalisation uncertainty.
           (ERR-5) uncertainties in intensity of gamma-ray
           (ERR-6) uncertainties in isomeric transition
             No errors for the half-lives of the Pm isomers are
            included.

SAMPLE     (92-U-235,0.90) The 235U samples consisted of 3-5 g
           of enriched 235U (90%) as uranium metal.
           The 235U sample was made up of approx. 80 chips of
           35-65 mg of uranium metal. Each chip was wrapped in
           aluminum foil (20 mu-m thick). 8-10 of these chips
           were embedded in coarse-grained aluminum powder and the
           mixture was sealed in small aluminum capsules (inner
           diameter 9 mm, length 60 mm).
