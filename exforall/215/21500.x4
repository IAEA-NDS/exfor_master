TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF (N,2N) CROSS SECTIONS USING
            THE FERMI WATER-TANK METHOD.- (IN GERMAN).-
FACILITY   (CCW  ) 150 KEV COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR,
            BUILD BY HEUSCH.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION. TRITIUM TARGET
            SUPPLIED BY DR.H.FABIAN, VIENNA.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL BISMUTH, HOLLOW SPHERE, INNER DIAM 2.5 CM,
            OUTER DIAM 7.4 CM.
METHOD     .FERMI WATER TANK METHOD. THE NEUTRON SOURCE IS
            IN THE CENTRE OF A SPHERICAL SAMPLE. NEUTRONS
            COMING OUT OF THIS SAMPLE ARE SLOWED DOWN IN
            THE SURROUNDING WATER. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION
            OF THESE SLOWED DOWN NEUTRONS IS MEASURED BY
            GOLD ACTIVATION ANALYSIS. NEUTRONS ORIGINATING
            FROM NONELASTIC REACTIONS HAVE A MEAN ENERGY OF
            ABOUT 2 MEV.
            THE ORIGINAL NEUTRON FLUX IS MONITORED BY AN
            ACTIVATION MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRONS WHICH ARE
            ELASTICALLY SCATTERED FROM THE SAMPLE OR HAVE
            LEFT IT WITHOUT ANY REACTION (ENERGY 14 MEV)
            HEREFORE ALUMINIUM FOILS ARE USED (WHICH HAVE
            A TRESHOLD, ELIMINATING THE NEUTRONS ORIGINATING
            FROM NONELASTIC REACTIONS). USING THESE DATA AND
            THE EQUATIONS DERIVED IN THE TEXT, THE (N,2N)
            CROSS SECTION CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE CROSS
            SECTION FOR THE NONELASTIC NEUTRON PRODUCING
            REACTIONS.
DETECTOR   (MTANK) SEE METHOD. THE FOILS ARE BETA COUNTED
            WITH A C-H(4)-GAS-FLOW DETECTOR.
            DIMENSIONS OF THE TANK ARE 2 * 3 * 1.5 M**3.
