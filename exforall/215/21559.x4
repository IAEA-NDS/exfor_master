TITLE      -RANGE MEASUREMNTS OF PRIMARY FISSION PRODUCTS FORMED
            BY SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252 -.
FACILITY   .SPONTANEOUS CF-252 FISSION SOURCE.
SAMPLE     .A THIN CF-252 SOURCE OF ABOUT 1 MICRO-GM CF-252
            WAS DEPOSITED ON A 20 MM DIAMETER PLATINUM FOIL,
            WITH AN ACTIVE AREA OF ABOUT 5MM DIAMETER.
METHOD     .FOR THE MASS CHAIN 144 THE FRACTIONAL INDEPENDANT
            YILEDS WERE DERIVED BY AN ITERATIVE METHOD. AN
            EXTRAPOLATION METHOD WAS USED ASSUMING A GAUSSIAN
            DISTRIBUTION TO EVALUATE THE INDEPENDANT YIELD OF
            CS-144, WHICH COULD NOT BE MEASURED DIRECTLY.
            THE ABUNDANCE OF THE 397 KEV GAMMA OF LA-144 WAS
            DETERMINED TO BE 0.82+-0.05.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) NO DETAILS.

CORRECTION .MEASUREMENTS OF CUMULATIVE RANGES OF FISSION
            PRODUCTS IN THIN MYLAR FOILS WERE CORRECTED USING
            THE BATEMAN EQUATION.
ERR-ANALYS .NO ERRORS GIVEN, BUT AT LEAST TEN PERCENT CAN BE
            ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE ABUNDANCE OF
            THE 397 KEV GAMMA IN LA-144.
