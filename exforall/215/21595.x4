TITLE       Mass yields in the fission of uranium-235 and
            plutonium-239 in the neutron spectrum of a gas-cooled
            fast reactor

FACILITY   (REAC,2SWTWUR) PROTEUS fast reactor, Wuerenlingen.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Gas-cooled fast reactor.
INC-SPECT   Gas-cooled fast reactor spectrum with a flux
            of 3 10*9 n/cm*2/sec. A graph of the spectrum is
            shown with a broad peak from 0.01 MeV to 1.0 MeV.
            The median energy is quoted as 180 keV.
SAMPLE      Several 40 mg samples of uranium dioxide, enriched
            to 97.5% U-235, and plutonium dioxide, enriched
            to 92.1% Pu-239.
             Irradiation were performed in the fast zone of the
            PROTEUS reactor. The uranium and plutonium samples
            were irradiated for 1 and 2 hours, respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Gamma-ray spectroscopy of fission products
            after chemical separation of fission products in
            aqueous solution. Only zirconium, niobium, tellurium
            and iodine were partially separated, all other
            products were fully extracted.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 40 cm*3 Ge(Li) spectrometer, resolution
            of 2.0 keV at 1.3 MeV. Counting started 80 min after
            the irradiation and continued for 10 days.
ANALYSIS    Relative yields are converted to absolute yields by
            normalizing the total fission yields of all nuclides
            in the heavy peak to 100%. The measured yields
            amount to 66% of the total yields in the heavy peak,
            yields of missing mass chains were interpolated
            An error of 10 to 20% was assigned to the
            interpolated yields.
