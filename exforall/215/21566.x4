TITLE      Direct measurement of the spin dependent thermal
           neutron absorption and scattering by 6Li
AUTHOR     (M.Fourmond)
INSTITUTE  (2FR PAR) Universite Paris-Sud (Orsay)
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR SAC) Channel H2 of EL3 pile of CENS Saclay.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,REAC)Polarized neutron source. Monochromatic
           and polarized neutron beam obtained by Bragg
           reflection on a Fe-Co-crystal using a (2,0,0)
           reflection. The polarization is 0.995 +- 0.004. The
           flux is 10**6 n/cm*cm*sec. A flipping magnet is used
           with an efficiency of 99.1 +- 0.7 %.
SAMPLE     Metallic Li at 43.5E-03 deg-Kelvin, 2.28 cm thick,
           and Li-F, 1.15 cm thick, containing 7.52% 6Li.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission through metallic sample or Li-F
           yields capture cross sections. NMR-techniques yield
           scattering lengths (NMR - Nucl.Magn.Resonance).

           Weighted average of the transmission measurements with
           the metallic sample and the Li-F sample.
           The measured quantity is :
               sigma(n-,g) - sigma(n+,g)
           where n+ and n- are up- and down-spin incoming neutrons
