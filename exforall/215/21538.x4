TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE THERMAL NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION
            CROSS SECTION OF PA-231.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) 87 M CURVED NEUTRON GUIDE OF HFR,
            INCLINED BEAM HOLE IH1, THERMAL FLUX 5.E+09 NEUTRONS
            /CM*CM*SEC, CD-RATIO 5.E+04.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .PREPARED BY THE CHEMISTRY DIVISION OF AERE-HARWELL.
            THEY CONSITED OF A CIRCULAR SPOT, 10 MM DIAM,
            EVAPORATED ONTO A 133 MICRO-GRAMS/CM*CM NI-FOIL.
            LAYER THICKNESSES OF 35.16 +- 0.17 MICRO-GRAMS/CM*CM
            PA-231-O(2) AND 44.9 +- 0.9 MICRO-GRAMS/CM*CM
            NATURAL U(3)-O(8). THE PA-231 SAMPLE WAS PURIFIED
            IMMEDIATLY PRIOR TO THE SOURCE PREPARATION IN ORDER
            TO HAVE THE BASIC MATERIAL COMPLETELY FREE OF
            DAUGHTER PRODUCTS. IT WAS ALSO COMPLETELY FREE OF
            FISSILE ISOTOPES AS U-235 AND PU-239.
METHOD     (COINC) COINCIDENCE.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SOLST,SOLST) TWO 300 MM*MM SURFACE BARRIER
            DETECTORS DETECTING THE TWO COMPLEMENTARY FISSION
            FRAGMENTS IN COINCIDENCE, TO REDUCE THE BACKGROUND.
