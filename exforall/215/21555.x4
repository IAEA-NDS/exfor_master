TITLE      -THERMAL NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF RA-226 -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) HEAVY WATER MODERATED REACTOR OF K.U.R.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) THERMAL COLUMN, FLUX 1.6 10*9 N/CM*2/SEC.
SAMPLE     .RA-226 CHLORIDE SOLUTION, FROM UK, EVAPOURATED TO
            DRYNESS ON THE GOLD SURFACE OF THE SOLID STATE
            DETECTORS. A TOTAL OF 9.7 MICRO-CI FROM COUNTING
            THE 186 KEV GAMMAS IN DECAY.
METHOD     .PROMT DETECTION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) TWO GOLD PLATED SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS,
            2.5 CM DIAMETER, FACE TO FACE IN A SCATTERING
            CHAMBER, 0.6 CM APART. DETECTORS WERE OPERATED BOTH
            IN SINGLES AND COINCIDENCE MODE.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G,,SIG,,MXW) THERMAL FLUX
            MONITORED USING A VALUE OF 98.8B.
           .THE CADMIUM RATIO OF THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS
            MEASURED TO BE GREATER THEN 10,000.
