TITLE      -STUDY OF SHORT LIVED RU ISOTOPES PRODUCED IN THERMAL
            NEUTRON FISSION OF U-235 -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR-1 GRAPHITE REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THERMAL GRAPHITE REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .AQUEOUS SOLUTION CONTAINING 250MG U-235 AS URANYL
            NITRATE AND RUTHENIUM TRACER IRRADIATED. RU FISSION
            PRODUCTS SEPERATED BY OXIDATION TO VOLATILE RUO4
            BY CL GAS. IRRADIATION TIMES OF 5 TO 250 SECS, WITH
            GAMMA COUNTING STARTING 10 SECS AFTER IRRADIATION.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) GE(LI) DETECTOR FOR GAMMA COUNTING OF
            SEPERATED RU ISOTOPES.
COMMENT    .GAMMA DECAY LINES ARE ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS RU
            ISOTOPES FROM A=107 TO 110, OR TO THEIR DAUGHTER
            PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF HALF LIVES, INTENSITY
            RATIOS AND KNOWN LEVEL PROPERTIES. RU-111 IS
            IDENTIFIED WITH A HALF-LIFE OF 1.5+-0.3 SECS.
STATUS     .TABLE 6, FISSION YIELDS.

ERR-ANALYS .UNCERTAINTIES ARE ONE STANDARD DEVIATION, PRIMARILLY
            STATISTICAL FROM THE SET OF MEASUREMENTS COMBINED
            WITH UNCERATINTIES IN ABSOLUTE GAMMA INTENSITIES,
            DISCREPANCIES IN DECAY PARAMETERS SUCH AS
            HALF-LIVES, UNKNOWN ISOMERIC STATES AND INTER-
            CORRELATION OF RESULTS COULD LEAD TO MUCH LARGER
            ERRORS.

            MORE PRECISELY, THE 105 CUMULATIVE MASS YIELD
            USED IN THIS MEASUREMENT WAS THAT OF TC-105
            AS THE IRRADIATIONS ARE TOO SHORT TO SHOW ANY
            CONTRIBUTION FROM 4.4HR RU-105.. TO THIS AN
            INDEPENDANT FISSION YIELD CONTRIBUTION OF 1 PC
            FOR RU-105 WAS ADDED.
