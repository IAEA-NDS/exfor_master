TITLE      -Study of short lived Ru isotopes produced in thermal
            neutron fission of U-235 -.
FACILITY   (REAC ) BR-1 graphite reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) Thermal graphite reactor.
INC-SPECT  .Thermal maxwellian spectrum.
SAMPLE     .Aqueous solution containing 250mg U-235 as uranyl
            nitrate and ruthenium tracer irradiated. Ru fission
            products seperated by oxidation to volatile RuO4
            by Cl gas. Irradiation times of 5 to 250 secs, with
            gamma counting starting 10 secs after irradiation.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) Ge(Li) detector for gamma counting of
            seperated Ru isotopes.
COMMENT    .Gamma decay lines are assigned to various Ru
            isotopes from a=107 to 110, or to their daughter
            products on the basis of half lives, intensity
            ratios and known level properties. Ru-111 is
            identified with a half-life of 1.5+-0.3 secs.
STATUS     .Table 6, fission yields.

           (20090315U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS .Uncertainties are one standard deviation, primarilly
            statistical from the set of measurements combined
            with unceratinties in absolute gamma intensities,
            discrepancies in decay parameters such as
            half-lives, unknown isomeric states and inter-
            correlation of results could lead to much larger
            errors.

            Value taken from meek and rider as 0.99 pc/fis.
            More precisely, the 105 cumulative mass yield
            used in this measurement was that of Tc-105
            as the irradiations are too short to show any
            contribution from 4.4hr Ru-105.. To this an
            independant fission yield contribution of 1 pc
            for Ru-105 was added.
