INSTITUTE  (2FR BRC)
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR BRC) 4 MeV, 1 ns puls-width, 1 MHz repetition
            rate, 3 to 4 uA  average current.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Solid target of 430 ug/cm2, proton
            energy 2.35 MeV for production of 600 keV neutrons.
           (D-D) Deuteron-deuterium reaction on gaseous
            target, 1 cm long, at 2. atm. pressure, deuteron
            energy 4 MeV, entrance window of havar of 2 microns
            thickness for the production of 7 MeV neutrons. The
            energy loss in the target is 34 keV.
SAMPLE     Massif U hollow cylinder, 2 cm outer diam, 1 cm inner
           diam, 3 cm high, 93.5% enriched in U-235 for the
           sample method. 100 disks of stainless steel, 80 mm
           diam, 0.2 mm thick at distances of 1 mm, with 1 mg/cm2
           fissile material, in the fission chamber method.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight to detect the fission neutron
            energy. Two methods of measurement were used. The
            sample method (2 m flight path, 600 keV neutrons)
            uses a massif sample. The fission chamber method uses
            thin deposits (1.4 m flight path, 600 keV and 2 m
            flight path, 7 MeV). In this method the incoming
            neutron energy is also measured by TOF.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) Liquid scintillator NE213, diam=10 cm,
            thickness 5 cm, coupled to a fast photomultiplier (PM)
            XP1041 at an angle of 90 degr. With respect to the
            neutron beam, at 2 m from the sample. Its efficiency
            was determined in 3 ways.
           (SCIN) For neutron flux measurements, liquid
            scintillator, NE102, 1 in * 1 in, PM-tube 56AVP.
           (FISCH) Fission chamber filled with 80% argon,
            20% methane, under 4 kJ pressure.
COMMENT     The fission neutron spectrum does not have a
            Maxwellian shape, due to an excess in the low
            energy part of the spectrum. The two methods of
            measurement are compared in table 3 of the
            publication. Also different energy intervals
            are considered to determine the average neutron
            energy.
CORRECTION  Off time slow neutron-induced fission background
            (by a delayed random coincidence method) and
            secondary effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical + systematic (efficiency)
            errors.
