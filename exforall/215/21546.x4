TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE FISSION NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRA
            FOR THE FAST NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-235 AND
            U-238.-(IN FRENCH).--
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR BRC) 4 MEV, 1 NS PULS-WIDTH, 1 MHZ REPETITION
            RATE, 3 TO 4 MICRO-AMPERE AVERAGE CURRENT.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) SOLID TARGET OF 430 MICROGRAMS/CM*CM, PROTON
            ENERGY 2.35 MEV FOR PRODUCTION OF 600 KEV NEUTRONS.
           (D-D  ) DEUTERON-DEUTERIUM REACTION ON GASEOUS
            TARGET, 1 CM LONG, AT 2. ATM. PRESSURE, DEUTERON
            ENERGY 4 MEV, ENTRANCE WINDOW OF HAVAR OF 2 MICRONS
            THICKNESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 7 MEV NEUTRONS. THE
            ENERGY LOSS IN THE TARGET IS 34 KEV.
SAMPLE     .MASSIF U HOLLOW CYLINDER, 2 CM OUTER DIAM, 1 CM
            INNER DIAM, 3 CM HIGH, 93.5 PERC ENRICHED IN
            U-235 FOR THE SAMPLE METHOD.
           .100 DISKS OF STAINLESS STEEL, 80 MM DIAM, 0.2 MM
            THICK AT DISTANCES OF 1 MM, WITH 1 MG/CM*CM FISSILE
            MATERIAL, IN THE FISSION CHAMBER METHOD.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TO DETECT THE FISSION NEUTRON
            ENERGY. TWO METHODS OF MEASUREMENT WERE USED. THE
            SAMPLE METHOD (2 M FLIGHT PATH, 600 KEV NEUTRONS)
            USES A MASSIF SAMPLE. THE FISSION CHAMBER METHOD USES
            THIN DEPOSITS (1.4 M FLIGHT PATH, 600 KEV AND 2 M
            FLIGHT PATH, 7 MEV). IN THIS METHOD THE INCOMING
            NEUTRON ENERGY IS ALSO MEASURED BY TOF.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR NE213, DIAM=10 CM,
            THICKNESS 5 CM, COUPLED TO A FAST PM, XP1041 AT
            AN ANGLE OF 90 DEGR. WITH RESPECT TO THE NEUTRON
            BEAM, AT 2 M FROM THE SAMPLE. ITS EFFICIENCY WAS
            DETERMINED IN 3 WAYS.
           (SCIN ) FOR NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENTS, LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR, NE102, 1 IN * 1 IN, PM-TUBE 56AVP.
           (FISCH) FISSION CHAMBER FILLED WITH 80 PERC ARGON,
            20 PERCENT METHANE, UNDER 4 KG PRESSURE.
COMMENT    .THE FISSION NEUTRON SPECTRUM DOES NOT HAVE A
            MAXWELLIAN SHAPE, DUE TO AN EXCES IN THE LOW
            ENERGY PART OF THE SPECTRUM. THE TWO METHODS OF
            MEASUREMENT ARE COMPARED IN TABLE 3 OF THE
            PUBLICATION. ALSO DIFFERENT ENERGY INTERVALS
            ARE CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE THE AVERAGE NEUTRON
            ENERGY.
