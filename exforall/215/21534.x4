            UNIVERSITY, OPERATED AT 250 KW.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .0.5 MM THICK  ANALYTICAL GRADE NI-FOIL OF CARLO
            ERBA AND SODIUM FREE AL-WIRE (FROM BHD, ANALAR,
            ANALYTICAL REAGENT) FOR FLUX CONTROL. 0.1 G
            SAMPLES OF SODIUM CARBONATE (FROM UCB, ANHYDROUS,
            REAGENT GRADE). CA-F(2) FROM UCB, REAGENT GRADE,
            SAMPLES OF 20 AND 10 MG. ALL SAMPLES PACKED IN
            FLAT HEAT-SEALED POLYETHYLENE BOXES. THE SODIUM
            CARBONATE SAMPLES ARE ENCLOSED IN CD-BOXES, 0.76
            MM THICK.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION ANALYSIS. USE IS MADE OF A RABBIT
            SYSTEM WITH A TRANSMISSION TIME OF 2.0 SEC.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) CALIBRATED GE-LI DETECTOR, DESCRIBED IN JOURN.

            DETECTOR IN N-16 MEASUREMENTS.
ERR-ANALYS .ERROR GIVEN IS CALCULTED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF
            THE INDIVIDUAL RESULTS. 2* SIGMA IS GIVEN. IT
            DOES NOT INCLUDE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS FROM THE
