TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON-NEUTRON SCATTERING
            LENGTH FROM THE H-2(N,NP)N REACTION AT BOMBARDING
            ENERGIES BETWEEN 17 MEV AND 27 MEV.-
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERBON) ISOCHRONOUS CYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) 28 MEV DEUTERON BEAM (10 MICRO-AMPERES)
            ONTO A LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED HIGH PRESSURE
            (90 BAR) DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET.
            NEUTRONS EMITTED IN FORWARD DIRECTION WERE
            COLLIMATED TO PRODUCE A BEAM OF 22 MM DIAM WITH
            AN INTENSITY OF 1.65E+06 NEUTRONS/MEV*CM*CM*S
            ON THE TARGET FOR THE HIGHEST ENERGIES.
SAMPLE     .C-D(2) TARGET, 50 MG/CM*CM THICK IN THE FIRST,
            AND 30 MG/CM*CM IN THE SECOND AND THIRD PART OF
            THE EXPERIMENT. IT HAD THE FORM OF AN ELLIPSE
            WITH HALF-AXES OF 15 MM AND 10 MM, RESPECTIVELY,
            SO THAT IT APPEARED AS A CIRCULAR DISC TO THE BEAM.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TO DETERMINE THE INCOMING NEUTRON ENERGY,
            AND TO DETERMINE THE PROTON ENERGY (TO DISCRIMINATE
            AGAINST DEUTERONS AND OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES).
           (PHD  ) PULSE-HEIGHT DISCRIMINATION TO DO THIS
            REJECTION OF OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES ON THE
            BASIS OF THEIR TOF.
           (REC  ) PROTON RECOILS ARE MEASURED TO MONITOR
            THE INCOMING NEUTRON FLUX.
           (PSD  ) PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION IS USED TO
            DISTINGUISH NEUTRONS FROM GAMMA-RAYS.
DETECTOR   (TELES) PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE TO MONITOR THE
            INCOMING NEUTRON FLUX.
           (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) BREAK-UP NEUTRONS ARE DETECTED AT
            50 DEGREES WITH A WELL SHIELDED NE213 SCINTILLATOR
            IN COINCIDENCE WITH BREAK UP PROTONS EMITTED AT 48
            DEGREES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BEAM. THESE
            PROTONS ARE DETECTED IN A NE104 PLASTIC
            SCINTILLATOR.
            THE NE104 SCINTILLATOR HAD A DIAM OF 110 MM.
            THE NE213 SCINTILLATOR WAS 76 MM THICK, WITH A
            DIAMETER OF 127 MM.
           (COIN,SCIN,SOLST) IN A 2ND+3TH PART OF THE EXPERIMENT
            THE NE104 PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR WAS REPLACED WITH
            SIX 450 MM*MM SI SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS, MOUNTED
            IN TWO VERTICAL ROWS AT 47. AND 49. DEGR
            RESPECTIVELY, IN EACH OF WHICH THE THREE DETECTORS
            WERE ELECTRONICALLY TREATED AS ONE.
           (SCIN ) THE PROTONS PASS THROUGH A SCINTILLATION
            FOIL OF 1.5 MG/CM*CM TO PRODUCE THE TOF START
            SIGNALS FOR THE PROTON ENERGY MEASUREMENT.
ANALYSIS   .IS DONE BY FITTING THE RESULTS OF MONTE CARLO
            CALCULATIONS OF THE PROCESS IN POINT GEOMETRY
            FOR DIFFERENT POSSIBLE VALUES OF THE SCATTERING
            LENGTH TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA.

COMMENT    .THE EFFECTIVE RANGE WAS KEPT FIXED AT ITS CHARGE
            SYMMETRIC VALUE OF 2.8 FM. VARIATION OF THIS VALUE
            BETWEEN 2.5 AND 3.5 FM DOES NOT CHANGE THE
            SCATTERING LENGTH BY MORE THAN 0.1 FM.
