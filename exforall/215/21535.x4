TITLE      -STUDY OF ALPHA PARTICLES PRODUCED IN THERMAL
            NEUTRON INDUCED REACTIONS ON U-235.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) HIGH FLUX REACTOR OF THE ILL.
            87 M CURVED NEUTRON GUIDE. FLUX 1.E+9 N/CM*CM*SEC,
            CD-RATIO 1.E+6, DIRECT GAMMA RAY FLUX FROM REACTOR
            REDUCED BY FACTOR 1.E+6.

SAMPLE     .U-235 TARGET PREPARED AT CBNM, GEEL, BY EVAPORATION
            OF 97.663 AT. PERC. ENRICHED U-F(4) ON A 10 MICRONS
            THICK AL-FOIL. THE THICKNESS OF THIS LAYER IS 3.6
            MICROGRAMS/CM*CM. THE COMBINATION OF SUCH A THIN
            TARGET AND AN INTENSE NEUTRON BEAM AMELIORATES THE
            SIGNAL (I.E. NEUTRON INDUCED ALPHAS) TO BACKGROUND
            (I.E. SPONTANEOUS DECAY ALPHAS). BESIDES, THE ENERGY
            LOSS OF THE ALPHA PARTICLES WITHIN THE TARGET IS
            NEGLIGIBLE.
METHOD     (EDE  ) ALPHA PARTICLES IDENTIFIED BY E-DE DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) TELESCOPE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR
            E-DE-MEASUREMENTS. BOTH DETECTORS ARE SI(AU) SURFACE
            BARRIERS. THE FULLY DEPLETED DE-DETECTOR IS 33.9
            MICRONS THICK, WITH AN ACTIVE AREA OF 300 MM*MM, AN
            ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 30 KEV FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS. THE
            E-DETECTOR IS 500 MICRONS THICK, ACTIVE AREA 450
            MM*MM, 40 KEV RESOLUTION. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS PARTICLE
            IDENTIFICATION AND VERY GOOD BACKGROUND REDUCTION.
            THE DETECTOR SYSTEM IS CALIBRATED WITH THE 9.43 MEV
            ALPHAS FROM THE ND-143(N-TH,A) REACTION.
ANALYSIS   .A SHARP ALPHA LINE SUPERIMPOSED ON THE TERNARY ALPHA
            SPECTRUM AT 10.93 MEV IS LOOKED FOR AND NOT FOUND
            WITHIN THE STATISTICAL ERROR 3*SIGMA GIVEN.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),TER,SIG,,MXW) NO VALUE GIVEN.
COMMENT    .THE MEASURED TERNARY ALPHA SPECTRUM DEVIATES FROM
            A GAUSSION SHAPE IN THE LOW ENERGY PART. THIS
            DEVIATION CAN ACCOUNT FOR DESCREPANTIES IN B/T-
            RATIOS REPORTED FROM TWO DIFFERENT METHODS.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM PUBLICATION.

ERR-ANALYS .VALUE GIVEN IS UPPER LIMIT IMPOSED BY THE STATISTICAL
            ACCURACY OF THE MEASUREMENT IS 3*SIGMA.
