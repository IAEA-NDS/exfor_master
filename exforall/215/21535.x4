TITLE       Study of alpha particles produced in thermal
            neutron induced reactions on U-235
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) High flux reactor of the ILL.
            87 m curved neutron guide. Flux 10.**9 n/cm*cm*sec,
            Cd-ratio 10.**6, direct gamma ray flux from reactor
            reduced by factor 10.**6.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) H.F.R.
SAMPLE      U-235 target prepared at CBNM, Geel, by evaporation
            of 97.663% enriched U-F(4) on a 10 mu-m thick Al-foil.
            The thickness of this layer is 3.6 mu-m/cm2.
            The combination of such a thin target and an intense
            neutron beam ameliorates the signal (i.e. neutron
            induced alphas) to background (i.e. spontaneous decay
            alphas). besides, the energy loss of the alpha
            particles within the target is negligible.
METHOD     (EDE) Alpha particles identified by E-dE detector.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Telescope detection system for
            E-dE-measurements. Both detectors are Si(Au) surface
            barriers. The fully depleted dE-detector is 33.9 mu-m
            thick, with an active area of 300 mm*mm, an energy
            resolution of 30 keV for 5.5 MeV alphas. The
            E-detector is 500 mu-m thick, active area 450 mm*mm,
            40 keV resolution. This system allows particle
            identification and very good background reduction.
            The detector system is calibrated with the 9.43 MeV
            alphas from the Nd-143(n-th,alpha) reaction.
ANALYSIS    A sharp alpha line superimposed on the ternary alpha
            spectrum at 10.93 MeV is looked for and not found
            within the statistical error 3*sigma given.
COMMENT      (92-U-235(N,F),TER,SIG,,MXW) used for energy position
            calibration .The measured ternary alpha spectrum
            deviates from a Gaussian shape in the low energy part.
            This deviation can account for discrepancies in
            B/T-ratios reported from two different methods.
