INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI)
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSRI) Heavy water reactor of AS USSR.
INC-SOURCE  A disc (81.8mm diameter, 2 mm thickness, 200 g weight)
           of 50% enriched in U-235, placed in thermal column.
INC-SPECT  Neutrons produced at U-235 fission by thermal neutrons.
SAMPLE     . ~ 1 microgram, mass was determined by alpha-activity.
           Placed inside ionization chamber, served for fission
           events counting.
           . ~ 300 mg, mass was determined by weighting.
           Placed outside ionization chamber.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) For fission events registration. Working gas Ar.
           (D4PI) Beta activity was measured by a 4PI counter or b
           an end-window counter (window thickness
           0.005+-0.001 mg/cm2).
METHOD     (CHSEP) Irradiation time 10-20 hr,
            cooling time usually < 1-1.5 half-life of isotope.
            Yield of isotope was determined from 6-8 independent
           measurements.
MONITOR     Au-foil (8-10 mg/cm2) stacked to thick sample was
           served as integral neutron flux, beta-activity of
           Au-198 was measured by end-window counter.
ANALYSIS   Number of fission events in thick sample was calculated
           by number of fissions in thin sample and mass ratio
           for thick and thin samples.
CORRECTION For neutron flux difference in thin and thick samples
           ~5%.

COMMENT     Of authors. Sr-89 and Zr-95 yields were determined
           from relative measurements using known yield of Mo-99.
           Other yields were determined in absolute measurements.
