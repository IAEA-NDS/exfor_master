SAMPLE      Pd-107 was obtained by the irradiation
           of the metallic parallelepiped 1.35*4.0*8.1 mm3
           which contained 96.3 % of Pd-106, 1.9 % of Pd-105,
           0.5 % of Pd-104, 1. % of Pd-108, 0.3 % of Pd-110,
           0.1 % of Pd-102.
           This initial sample was irradiated by fluence
           3.5E+21 neutrons/cm2.
            Pd-107 content in irradiated sample was
           2.7E+19 nucl/cm2.
