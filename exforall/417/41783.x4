           neutrons was determined as 3/2 * T, where T is
           temperature of neutron spectrum.

ANALYSIS   Temperature was determined by fitting of measured
           neutron spectrum by Maxwellian distribution in energy
           range 0.7 - 10 MeV.
            Measured at 0.010 - 10 MeV energy range spectrum is
           presented on Fig. (low quality for digitization) of
           page 141 in R,INDC(CCP)-060,139,1974.
COMMENT    Of authors.
            At energy range below 0.7 MeV the measured spectrum
           is higher than Maxwellian due to delayed neutrons.
