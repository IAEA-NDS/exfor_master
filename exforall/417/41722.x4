            Definition of isomeric ratio.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4ZZZDUB) Electron accelerator Microtron MT-25.
           The average electron current 15 microA,
           irradiation time 90 min.
INC-SOURCE  The neutrons were simultaneously obtained through
            (gamma,n) reaction of Be ,
            (gamma,f) photo-fission and (gamma,n) reactions on U
           with the 24 MeV end-point energy bremsstrahlung
           produced by an electron beam from the accelerator.
           The photon-neutron uranium-beryllium converter
           in a 120 x 120 x 120 cm3 graphite cube was served as
           the main neutron moderator to thermal and resonant
           energy neutrons.
INC-SPECT  . Resonant neutrons (sample with Cd foil).
           . Mixed thermal-resonant neutrons (sample without Cd
           foil).
SAMPLE     .  99.99% purity PdO powder, packed in polyethylene
           wrap in disk shape of 1 cm diameter.
           The sample mass was 0.3230 g.
           Sample was placed at 40 cm distance from the center of
           the graphite cube.
           Measurement without and with Cd foil of 2 mm thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial p-type HPGe detector (Canberra) with
           60.5 mm diameter and 31 mm length, connected to a PC
           based 8192 channel analyzer for the data processing.
           The Canberra software GENIE 2000 was used for the data
           acquisition and gamma-ray spectra analysis.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
MONITOR     Au foils were used for neutron flux monitoring.
