TITLE       Determination of Cs130 and Ba139 independent yields
           at U238 fission by 14-MeV energy neutrons
AUTHOR     (I.T.Krisyuk,G.P.Lepnev,N.B.Platunova)
REFERENCE  (J,RAK,2,743,1960) Issue 6.
INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI)
FACILITY    No information in the article.
INC-SOURCE  No information in the article.
INC-SPECT   14 MeV neutrons.
SAMPLE       Uranil chloride (3-6 g per 5 ml) water solution.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 1 min.
           Gas products were removed by Ar flow (2.2 l/min)
           through the sample solution during the irradiation.
           Cooling time 25-30 sec.
           (CHSEP) Ba-139 separation from Cs-139 was finished
           after 1.5 - 2 min from the end of irradiation.
           3 methods of radiochemical cleaning of Ba-139 were
           applied during 30-60 min.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Double end-window counter.

DECAY-DATA (53-I-139,2.7SEC)  Precursor of Xe-139
           (54-XE-139,41.SEC) Precursor of Cs-139
           (55-CS-139,9.5MIN) Precursor of Ba-139
           (56-BA-139,85.MIN) Precursor of La-139(stable)
ANALYSIS    La-139 yield was not taken into account, estimated as
           < 0.5%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
