INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI)
FACILITY   (REAC,4RUSRI) Heavy water reactor of AS USSR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Central channel.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutrons. Ratio of number of neutrons with
           energy > 1.5 MeV to number of neutrons with
           energy > 2.5 MeV - 4+-1.5.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Irradiation time 52.2 hr.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Beta spectra were measured using Al filters of
           different thicknesses - 3 mg/cm2, 60 mg/cm2.
           (SOLST) Mica detectors for Mo-99 absolute activity.
