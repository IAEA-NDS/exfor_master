TITLE       The energy dependence of the temporal parameters of
           delayed neutrons from the neutron-induced fission of

             Charge particle induced data of this article.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSFEI) 6-MeV electrostatic accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) For neutron energy 0.42 - 2.92 MeV.
            Targets - LiF evaporated on 0.5-mm thick copper
           backings.
           (D-D)   For neutron energy 4 - 8 MeV.
            Targets - deuterium absorbed in ~1 mg/cm2 thick Ti
           layer deposited on 0.5 mm thick copper backings.
           .Energy loss in the target does not exceed the neutron
           kinematic energy spread.
INC-SPECT   Spectra are presented on Figs.2 (p-Li7),3 (d-d).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cyclic irradiation followed by the measurement
           of the time dependence of delayed neutron activity.
           Irradiation time was 180 and 15s, DN counting time was
           600 and 500 s, respectively; sample delivery time
           200 ms.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 4PI neutron detector - assembly of 21
           proportional He3-counters distributed in polyethylene
           moderator. Surrounded by Cd sheet and borated
           polyethylene (10 cm thick).
           Energy dependence of the 4PI detector absolute
           efficiency was determined by 252Cf calibrated source
           and calculated by Monte Carlo method. See Fig.6 .
           Average efficiency (weighted by the 252Cf prompt
           neutron spectrum) - 34.96+-0.81.
           (FISCH) Fission chamber with Pu-239 deposit of
           100 microg/cm2 was used as neutron flux monitor.
SAMPLE      No information about U-235 sample in the article.
            239Pu deposit of 100 mug/cm2 was used as the neutron
            flux monitor.
CORRECTION  For background.
            For break-up neutrons.
            For non-monoenergetic component of incident neutrons.
            For background.

ANALYSIS   Analysis of DN decay curve was done by iterative
           least-square method in frames of 6-group model.
           Obtained data of HL(En) were used to estimate DN yield.
ADD-RES     Delayed neutrons precursors average HL dependence from
           incident neutron energy HL(En) is on Fig.10.
ERR-ANALYS  Relative uncertainties of the activity values:
                  Uncertainty of the number of atoms in the
                  sample ~ 1.%.
                  Uncertainty of total delayed neutron yield ~5%
                  Uncertainty of neutron detection efficiency 2.3%
                  Uncertainty of U235 fission cross section 1%
                  Uncertainty of flux density 5.3 %
           (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty was not explained by
            the authors.
