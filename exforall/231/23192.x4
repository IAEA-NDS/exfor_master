FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) N0 beam line in Research Center for
           Nuclear Physics, Osaka University.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons. 300 MeV protons.
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectra measured by TOF at 0 and 30 degrees
           respective to the proton beam are on Fig.2 of
           J,KPS,59,(2),1916,2011.
           The quasi-monoenergetic neutron spectrum obtained by
           subtracting the spectrum on 30deg from the one on 0deg.
DETECTOR  1(SCIN) Neutron energy spectra were measured by an NE213
           liquid scintillator placed at 17.10 or 16.13 m from
           Li-target at 0 or 30 degrees, respectively.
          2(HPGE) HPGe detector for gamma rays measurement.
PART-DET  1(N)
          2(G)
SAMPLE     Samples were placed at 8.05 or 7.05 m from Li-target at
           0 or 30 degrees, were irradiated 26 hr or 18 hr,
           respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
          1(TOF) For neutron beam.
          2(GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectrometry of irradiated samples.

ANALYSIS   Activation reaction rates R were estimated by the peak
           counts of gamma-ray spectra, the peak efficiency of
           HPGe detector (calculated by EGS4 code), the self-
           absorption of gamma-rays in samples, the beam current
           fluctuation during irradiation.
           Cross-sections were estimates as:
           SIG=(R(0deg)- f*R(30deg))/F, where
           f- is factor for the correction in subtraction of
              neutron spectrum,
           R - reaction rate at given angle,
           F- neutron fluence rate per beam current.
CORRECTION  For contribution of the low energy tail in the neutron
           spectrum by subtracting the activities produced in the
           samples placed on 30deg from those on 0deg.
           For self-absorption in sample by EGS4 code.
           For the beam current fluctuation during the irradiation
