FACILITY   (NGEN,2TUKSTU) SAMES T-400 neutron generator.
           Beam current is kept at about 300 microA with
           accelerator voltage of 250 kV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Solid tritium target.
           The angles of the irradiation positions to the deuteron
           beam were 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 130, which correspond to
           the neutron energies 14.83, 14.75, 14.52, 14.15, 13.75,
           13.57 MeV.
INC-SPECT   The effective energy of incident neutron at each
           irradiation position were determined by the ratio of
           90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+,1982)
           and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway,1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis and
           Zieba, 1980) and are given in detail in Subasi+,1996.
           Neutron fluxes are measured in each irradiation place
            (70mm from the neutron source )from 9.E+7 to 1.1E+8
           n/cm2*s, depending on the neutron target condition.

SAMPLE      Sm-152 isotopic ambulance (26.75+-0.16) %.
           Sample pellets(13mm diameter,8.5mm thickness, about 2g
           weight) were pressed from the natural,high-purity
            (99.9%) Sm2O3 and Al2O3 powders. Water contents in the
           samples were removed by heating the oxide materials up
           to 105 deg C, then 0.5h cooled down to the room
           temperature, were filled in dry stainless steel
           capsules, pressed to form a dense pellet, were tightly
           packed into thin polyethylene(PE) boxes and sealed-of.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cyclic irradiation.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) During irradiation, the neutron flux was
           monitored with plastic scintillation detector NE102A,
           placed under the neutron-producing target. The monitor
           was calibrated with the standard reaction irradiating
           Al2O3 sample placed in the same irradiation position.
           (HPGE) Gamma activities induced in the Al sample was
           measured by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer.
           In all gamma-ray measurements an acrylic plate of 10mm
           thickness was placed in front of the detector to block
           the beta particles from the samples.
CORRECTION For dead time and the self-absorption of the gamma ray
           in the pellet(4%).
           Neutron flux was corrected for the neutron flux
           variations.
           For low energy neutron contribution to the investigated
           reactions - up to 10%.
           The effect of low energy neutron in sample pellets
           packed in thin polyethylene boxes was performed by the
           MCNP5 Monte Carlo code (X-5MonteCarloTeam,2003) and
           found less than 1% that can be neglected.

            Gamma-ray intensity (31.3+-2.0) % .
CORRECTION For self-absorption (73% for 121.8 keV, 18% for 340.4
           keV), attenuation of the gamma rays in the acrylic
           beta absorber and dead time.
           The contribution from the Sm-154(n,t)Pm-152m,g and
           Sm-154(n,3He)Nd-152 (Pm-152m,g via beta- decay) were
           ignored, because cross sections of these reactions
           for 14.5 MeV neutron are less than 10**-6 barn and
           10**-18 barn (JEFF-3.1, 2009), respectively.
ANALYSIS   Full energy peak (FEP) areas, mass of sample,
           the concentration of the element, Avogadro number,the
           atomic weight of the element, isotopic abundance, the
           relative gamma-ray intensity, effective flux measured
           by calibrated Al foil monitor, counting solid angle
           with self-absorption correction, FEP efficiency of the
           gamma-ray detector, decay constant, the number of
           cycles were used to cross-section calculation by the
           cyclic activation formula.
           For 152gPm radionuclide, gamma energy line 121.8keV
           is contributed from Pm-152m (intensity 45%),this
           contribution was subtracted from total photo-peak area
           counts and cross sections were calculated for
           Sm-152(n,p)Pm-152g reaction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Error of sample weight.
           (ERR-2) Error of concentration of the element.
           (ERR-3) Error of isotopic abundance.
           (ERR-4) Error of relative gamma-ray intensity.
           (ERR-5) Error of counting solid angle and intrinsic
           efficiency of the gamma detector.
           (ERR-6,10.,25.) Error of full energy photo-peak area.
           (ERR-7) Error of neutron flux fluctuation.
           (ERR-8) Error of effective neutron flux (reference
           cross-section).
           (ERR-9) Error of irradiation, cooling and measuring
           times.
            Uncertainties were assumed to be uncorrelated.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainties in the cross section values
           could be determined by adding the experimental errors
           and the uncertainties of nuclear data in the quadratic
           form.
