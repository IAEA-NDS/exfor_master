FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDUPP) Medley setup at the TSL neutron beam
           facility in Uppsala University.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Quasi mono-energetic neutrons generated by
            7Li(p,n)7Be reaction.
INC-SPECT   Incident neutron spectrum was measured using the same
           setup with both 5mm-thick polyethylene (CH2) target of
           25mm diameter and 1mm-thick carbon target of 22mm
           diameter by means of conventional proton recoil method.
           Obtained neutron spectrum is shown in Fig.1 of
           S,JAEA-C-2011-002,125,2011.
           Peak neutron energy 175.4+-0.7 MeV, FWHM 14.8+-0.8 MeV.
SAMPLE      Double silicon wafer discs of 0.96mm thick, 25 mm
           diameter.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,CSICR) Eight telescopes placed at angles
           from 20 to 160 deg in steps of 20 deg. Each telescope
           consisted of two silicon surface barrier detectors
            (50-60 microm and 1000 microm) as the deltaE detector
           and a CsI(Tl) detector as the E detector.
           To measure energy and angular distributions of light
           ions produced from the silicon target.
           Energy calibration of all detectors was made using the
           relation between measured pulse height and calculated
           energy deposition in each detector.
METHOD     (REC) Proton recoil method to measure neutron spectrum.
           (TOF) Time-of-flight measurements were used in the
           off-line analysis to reduce the contribution of
           low-energy tail neutron in the accepted incident
           neutron spectrum.
           (EDE) dE-E particle identification technique.
CORRECTION Efficiency correction due to the reaction losses in
           CsI(Tl) scintillator.
           TCORR code was used to correct effects of targets
           thickness of energy-loss and particle loss of generated
           light ions.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
           The number of the net counts due to np scattering is
           obtained using measurement at 20 deg for both
           polyethylene and carbon targets. The np scattering
           spectrum is deduced by subtracting the contribution of
           C(n,xp) reaction from polyethylene measurement.
           Differential np scattering cross section is
           taken from NN-online: SAID Nucleon Nucleon scattering
