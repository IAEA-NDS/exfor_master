            Weighting function technique.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2NOROSL) Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory using the
           CACTUS and Silicon Ring detectors.
INC-SOURCE  Beams of deuterium and 3He at bombarding energies of 1
            2 and 24 MeV, respectively.
SAMPLE      968 microg/cm2 target of 232Th.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (COINC) All coincidence events involving at least one
           dE strip and at least one E detector were written to
           disk along with any coincident gamma-ray data, if
           present. During the 2 weeks of beam time (about 1 week
           for d at 0.7 nA and 1 week for 3He at 0.4 nA) a total
           of 351E+6 and 135E+6 dE-E coincidence events for d, and
           3He beams, respectively, were recorded.
            The final nucleus decay probabilities were measured
           using the weighting function technique.
PART-DET   (G) Gammas and LCP
DETECTOR   (SPEC,NAICR) CACTUS spectrometer -48 array of 28
           high-efficiency lead-collimated NaI detectors arranged
           in a spherical geometry.The total detection efficiency
           of CACTUS is approximately 15% with each cylindrical
           NaI detector of diameter 12.35 cm and 12.35 cm length,
           the front face being situated 22 cm from the central
           target position. For gamma-ray detection.
            The response matrix for the CACTUS array was found by
           performing detailed MCNP5 simulations of the CACTUS
           detectors, the Pb collimators, the target and frame,
           the vacuum chamber, and the detector casings for many
           different energies and then interpolating between them.
           The response was broadened with a broadening function
           to provide the correct NaI detector resolution.
           (COIN,SI,SI) Silicon Ring detector- for LCP emitted
           at backward angles from the beam direction.
           Consist of ring of eight wedge-shaped detector modules,
           each with eight arced dE strips of 130 microm thickness
           placed in front of a single E detector of 1550 microm
           thickness. The eight annular rings of the silicon
           detectors were at angles of 124 deg for the outermost
           ring and 138 deg for the innermost, giving an angular
           resolution for charged-particle detection of slightly
           less than 2 deg. The total solid angle covered by the
           Silicon Ring was approximately 12% of 4PI sr.
           An aluminum absorber of thickness 10.5 microm was
           placed in front of the silicon detectors to block
           electrons.
           The energy resolution for detection of LCP assuming a
           2-mm beam spot size was 80 keV.
           For the (d,p) channel the best calibration coefficients
           were obtained by using the elastic scattering peaks on
           232Th(d,d') and 16O(d,d'), a target contaminant. For
           the (3He,a) and (3He,t) channels the silicon detector
           calibration coefficients were obtained from elastic
           scattering peak of 232Th(3He,3He') and the position of
           the 232Th(3He,a)231Th* ground state.
CORRECTION For the energy losses in the target, aluminum absorber,
           and the kinematics of the reaction.
           For backgrounds.
           For (n, n') events.
           For target contaminants, frequently 16O and 12C.
           For deuterium breakup.
ERR-ANALYS Systematic uncertainties in the measurement technique
           due to effect of imperfect weighting functions owing
           to the presence of gamma-detection thresholds and the
           fact that the detectors do not have isolated hit
           probability of 100% were estimated
           -of the order 2% for relative (when comparing one
           cross section with another) and
           - 5% in the absolute value.

REACTION   (90-TH-232(N,G)90-TH-233,,SIG,,,DERIV)
REL-REF    (O,22931002,G.Aerts+,J,PR/C,73,054610,2006)
           In the range 500 keV-1 MeV there is very good agreement
           with variations typically of the order of 15%.
           Above 1 MeV the fission cross section begins to
           increase and because we are unable to distinguish
           events in which fission occurs, fission gamma rays will
           begin to contaminate our spectra.
           Above 1 MeV the surrogate data increasingly
           overestimate the ENDFB7 database values.
           The major discrepancy between our measurements and
           ENDFB7 occur in the range 0-500 keV, where there is a
           large and increasing disagreement toward low energy as
           high as 400%.
           This discrepancy probably occurs for two reasons:
           1) the mismatch in spin distributions between the
           indirect and direct reactions leading to an
           overestimation of the cross section because decay of
           higher final nuclear l waves favors decay by gamma
           emission;
           2) the finite resolution of silicon detectors smooths
           out the step function at the neutron binding energy
           that we are attempting to measure and thus the measured
           decay probabilities are the most incorrect in this
           region where the decay probability is varying extremely
           rapidly.

           of measured gamma emission probability using the
           transfer reaction Th-232(d,p)Th-233 .

           obtained from TALYS optical model calculations with
           input parameters adjusted to accurately reproduce the
           experimental total cross sections.

           there is misprint in transfer reaction:
