SAMPLE     Two sample were mounted in the center of vacuum clamber
           back-to-back on support plate.
           B-10 sample - to monitor neutron beam by (n,alpha) .
           Cm-oxide sample of 141+-3 microg, deposited on Al
           30 microm backing, of 15 mm diameter.
           Isotopic composition:
           Isotope    Number of Atoms       At.%
           Cm-244      3.11x10**15           0.901
           Cm-245      3.41x10**17          98.685

           Cm-247      2.75x10**15           0.008
           Cm-248      6.85x10**15           0.002
           U-235 99.94% enriched sample, with a diameter of 15 mm
           ,mass of (193.29+1.33)microg, deposited on a 30 microm
           thick Al backing; used to determine neutron flux and
           detection efficiency.
ANALYSIS    Deviation of a 1/v behavior is given by the so-called
           Westcott factor, which depends on the temperature of
           the neutron spectrum. The Westcott factors for U-235 =
           0.9772+0.0008 and for Cm-245 = 0.954+0.033 were used
           from REL-REF of S.F.Mughabghab.
           Our result overlaps within the error bars with the
           previous results and it shows a deviation of about 6%
           from the value adopted by the nuclear data libraries.
CORRECTION For 1.6% contribution from SF to the spectrum.
           For 2.6% contribution from the epithermal component to
           the (n,f) spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty due to Cm-245 Westcott factor.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty 0.9 %.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematical uncertainty 4.1% .
