INC-SOURCE (D-D) Monoenergetic neutron beam was produced via the
           2H(d,n)3He reaction. Deuterium gas target was bombarded
           with deuteron beam at energies varied from 2 to 2.6MeV
           with step 0.2MeV, at currents around 500 nA - 1 microA.

INC-SPECT  The achieved flux was about 5*10**4 n/(cm2*s) in all
           four runs performed.
DETECTOR   (DRFTC) MicroMegas detector.
           Each actinide target served as the detector drift
           electrode and was covered by a 0.5mm thick Al mask with
           a hole of 4 cm diameter. Each Micro-bulk consists of
           5 microm perforated copper foil ('micromesh') on 25 or
           50 microm thick kapton pillars deposited on 5 microm of
           a bulk copper foil ('anode'). Detector was filled with
           mixture of 80% Argon and 20% CO2 at approximately
           atmospheric pressure and the gas was circulated at a
           constant flow of 6-8 nl/h.
           (SIBAR) The activity of each target was measured with
           two silicon surface barrier detectors with different
           active surfaces - for mass measurement. Small detector
           of 50mm2 area was used to achieve a good resolution,
           a big detector of 3000mm2 area -to increase statistics.
           Calibration of the spectra was done with the use of a
           triple 241Am/239Pu/244Cm source.

SAMPLE      237Np and the reference targets 238U and 235U are thin
           disks of NpO2 and U3O8, deposited on 100 microm Al
           backing via the painting technique; were provided by th
           Institute of Physics and Power Engineering, Obninsk, an
           the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia,
           for nTOF collaboration.
           Thickness and homogeneity measurements were done via
           the Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS)
           technique at the external ion-beam setup of the 5.5MV
           HV TN-11 Tandem accelerator. Targets were found to be
           homogeneous, the 238Ufront within 16%, the 238Uback
           target within 14%, the 237Np target within 10%, the
           235U target within 15%.
