FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNJAE) 4 MV Pelletron accelerator 4UH-HC,
            equipped with Duoplasmatron ion source.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7.
            Proton beam energy was calibrated using the
            Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction at the threshold energy within
            uncertainty of 1 keV. Typical average proton beam
            current about 5 microA, repetition rate 4 MHz, pulse
            width 3.3 nsec (FWHM).
            Li-7 neutron production target of thickness about
            100 mg/cm**2 was made by evaporating lithium fluoride
            on copper disk with thickness of 0.5 mm.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic pulsed neutrons.
                12<= En <=103 keV.
            Typical neutron energy spectrum obtained by blank
            sample is shown on Fig. 2 .
DETECTOR   (SPEC,NAICR) Anti-Compton NaI(Tl) spectrometer to
            detect discrete gamma-rays promptly emitted from the
            neutron-capture of a nucleus.
            Spectrometer consisted of a central NaI(Tl) detector
            of 22.9 cm diameter and 20.3 cm length and annular
            NaI(Tl) detector of 33.0 cm diameter, 27.9 cm length.
            Low-background photomultiplier tubes - to reduce
            background due to the gamma-rays from beta-decay of
            K-40 (at 1.461 MeV).
            Spectrometer was shielded with Li-6-H (30cm thickness)
            and borated polyethylene to prevent neutrons scattered
            by sample and Pb against gamma-rays produced by
            thermalized neutron-capture reactions by materials
            placed in the measurement room.
            Energy resolution of the central NaI(Tl) detector was
            7% at 662 keV.
            Spectrometer was set at 100 degrees with respect to
            the proton beam direction.
            The distance between sample position and the front
            face of the central NaI(Tl) detector was 119 cm.
            Energy calibration of the central NaI(Tl) detector was
            made using gamma-ray standard sources- Na-22, Co-60,
            Y-88, and gamma-rays from H-1(n,gamma)H-2 and
            Fe-56(n,g)Fe-57 reactions.
           (GLASD) Li-6-glass scintillation detector with diameter
           of 50mm, thickness of 12 mm -to measure TOF neutron
           spectrum. Placed 30 cm downward from the Li-7 neutron
           production target.
           Energy resolution of system 2.6%(FWHM) at 6.1 MeV.
SAMPLE      Natural lead sample of 90 mm diameter, 8 mm thickness.
            Gold sample of 90 mm diameter, 2mm thickness - for
            normalization.
           Pb-nat and Au samples were placed 12.7 cm downward from
           Li-7(LiF) neutron production target.
             Pb sample abundances: Pb-204 - 0.0138+-0.0003,
            Pb-206 - 0.2479+-0.0020, Pb-207 - 0.2150+-0.0016,
            Pb-208 - 0.5233+-0.0041 .
METHOD     (TOF) Flight path 12.7 cm.
            Corresponding resolution in neutron energy is 4.2 keV
            at 30 keV.
            TOF spectrum of neutrons produced by
            Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction was measured by the efficiency
            calibrated .
           (TRN) Neutron transmission of gold and Pb-nat was
            measured.

MONIT-REF  (,P.G.Young+,3,ENDF/B-VI,,1984)
CORRECTION -For overestimation of the gamma-ray yield due to the
            multiple-scattering effect and the shielding of the
            incident neutrons in sample - calculated using the
            Monte-Carlo code, TIME-MULTI.
           -For the gamma-ray absorption by the sample.
           -For the finite size of the sample.
           -Background subtraction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) uncertainty is the result of the combined
            uncertainties on :
           (ERR-S,2.,5.) Uncertainty of statistics of gamma-ray
                        yield(2-5%);
           (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty of the absolute cross-section
                       of Au.
