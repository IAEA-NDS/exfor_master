INC-SOURCE (D-T) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons were produced via
            1-H-3(d,n)2-He-4 reaction at 1-4 MeV incident deuteron
            energy.
            Solid-state  titanium-tritium target of 2 mg/cm**2
            thickness on Au backing.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons with energies 16.1 - 20.7
           MeV in forward direction and down to 13 MeV at backward
           angles. Typical neutrons fluxes up to 10**8 n/sr/s .
           Spectra were measured by TOF.

SAMPLE      Three natural Cr samples (4.345 % abundance of Cr-50)
           as discs of 5 mm thickness, 30 mm diameter, about 25 g
           mass were irradiated at the same time. Placed at 95,
           81, 63 deg relative to incident deuteron beam.
           Corresponding neutron energies are 15.0+-0.6,
           16.0+-0.4, 17.3+-0.4 MeV.
           Zr of 0.15 mm thickness and Nb of 0.05 mm thickness
           foils were used as beam monitor; place in front and
           behind each Cr sample.
ANALYSIS    EGS4 Monte Carlo code (W.R.Nelson+, SLAC report 265,
            1985) was used to simulate the full energy peak
            efficiencies of HPGE detectors.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty is contributed from:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of efficiency determination,
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty due to inhomogeneous activity
           distribution in Cr sample (estimated by EGS4 code),
           (ERR-S,2.,7.) Statistical uncertainty of Gaussian fit
           of gamma-peaks.
            Uncertainties of measurement time, half-life,
           gamma-emission probability are negligible, less 0.1% .
STATUS     (UNOBT)
           (PRELM) Considered by compiler as preliminary - first
            publication at C,2010KRAKOW.
            Data are on Fig.16 of C,2010KRAKOW,225,2010 for
            neutron energies 15.0+-0.6, 16.0+-0.4, 17.3+-0.4 MeV.
