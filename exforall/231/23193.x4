FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE) Japan Proton Accelerator Research
           Complex (J-PARC). Beam line (BL04) of the Materials
           and Life science experimental Facility (MLF).
           The proton beams were accelerated by the linear
           accelerator and the rapid-cycling synchrotron at a
           repetition rate of 25 Hz.

             Beam line details.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons. Spallation neutrons were
           slowed down in a super-critical hydrogen moderator.
           The neutron-beam line BL04 consists of lead shadow
           bars of total thickness of 37.5 mm, resonance filters,
           disk chopper made of boron carbide, 95wt% isotopically
           enriched 10B(4)C, collimators, beam ducts.
           Neutron beam of 10 mm diameter at the sample position.
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectrum was measured by detecting the 478-keV
           gamma rays from the first excited state of 7Li produced
           by the 10B(n,alpha1) reaction; deduced using 1/v
           dependence.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,GE) Large acceptance Ge spectrometer and NaI(Tl)
           spectrometer are placed at a 21.5-m and 27.9-m distance
           from the hydrogen moderator. Called s Accurate
           Neutron-Nucleus Reaction measurement Instrument(ANNRI).
           Two cylindrical NaI(Tl) scintillators, 330 mm in
           diameter and 203 mm in length, located at the angles of
           90 deg with respect to the neutron-beam.
           Three photomultiplier tubes (HAMAMATSU R877) were
           attached to the NaI(Tl) scintillator.
           Plastic scintillators are 403(354)mm in outer (inner)
           diameter and 330 mm in length for 90 deg detector, and
           266(225) mm in outer (inner) diameter and 254 mm in
           length for 125deg detector.
           Multi-stop time-to-digital converter (TDC) module
           resolution was 1 micros/channel.
SAMPLE     - 237Np sample purchased from the Scientific Research
           Institute of Atomic Reactors,Russia, was 227 mg of Np
           dioxide (NpO2) powder mixed with 625 mg of metal Al
           powder. The isotopic purity > 99.8%.
           The wall thickness of the sample container was 0.4 mm
            (108 mg/cm2) and the thickness of the Al powder mixed
           in the 237Np dioxide was 199 mg/cm2.
           Isotopic analysis was made by combination of mass and
           alpha spectrometry. Impurities : 236Np <0.18%, 239Pu
           < 0.07% in atomic ratio to 237Np, 38Pu and 240Pu - of
           the order of 10**-3%.
           Sample powder was pressed into a pellet shape with a
           diameter 20 mm. The thickness of the 237Np sample is
           63.7 mg/cm2. The pellet was packed in Al container with
           0.4-mm-thick walls.
           - Sintered natural boron of a 105-mg/cm2 thickness and
           10.8-mm diameter was used for neutron spectrum
           measurement via 478-keV gamma-rays from the first
           excited state of 7Li produced by the 10B(n,alpha1)
           reaction.
           - C-nat sample (93.0 mg/cm2, 10mm diameter) was used as
           neutron scatterer - to subtract a background.
MONITOR    (93-NP-237(N,G)93-NP-238,,SIG) Present data were
            normalized to c-s at 0.489 eV resonance energy
           referred from JENDL-4.0.
           The normalization factor was determined by a method of
           least squares in the energy range from 0.40 to 0.58 eV.
MONIT-REF  (,,3,JENDL-4.0,,2010)
METHOD     (TOF)
ANALYSIS   Pulse-height weighting technique was applied to data
           analysis.
           The energy dependence of the cross-section, or the
           relative cross-section, was deduced by dividing the
           capture yield by the neutron spectrum. Absolute
           cross-section was obtained by normalizing the relative
           cross-section to the evaluated value of JENDL-4.0 for
           T=300 K at the first resonance.
CORRECTION -Correction for the impurities was not performed .
           -The dead-time correction for 237Np was 3.8% at the
           first resonance of 0.489 eV.
           -For frame-overlap background - about 4% at the first
           resonance and 40% at 25.3 meV- (includes the
           time-constant component).
           -For background from aluminum materials (estimated by
           the measurement using the identical aluminum container,
           the background due to the blank was about 2.5% at
           25.3 meV and about 0.5% at the first resonance).
           Including correction for neutron attenuation.
           The background due to the Al materials was about 7% at
           25.3 meV and about 0.2% at the first resonance.
           - For background due to scattered neutrons from 237Np
           less than 0.2% at both 25.3meV and the first resonance.
           -Correction of self-shielding and multiple scattering,
           estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation code using
           c-s of JENDL-4.0.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
           The considered systematic uncertainties due to:
           (ERR-1) Dead time 1.7%
           (ERR-2) Evaluated data 5%
            (evaluated data for the el.scattering c-s of 237Np,
           natB, natC, for the capture c-s of 237Np, for the c-s
           of the 10B(n,alpha1) were used).
           (ERR-3) Frame overlap BG for 237Np typically 1.6%
           (ERR-4) Frame overlap BG for natB typically 6.0%
           (ERR-5) Thicknesses of Al container 2.5%
           (ERR-6) Thicknesses of Al powder 1.0%
           (ERR-7) Thicknesses of 237Np 1.1%
           (ERR-8) Thicknesses of natB 2.2%.
           Systematic uncertainties described above are
           independent with each other. The total uncertainty was
           obtained as a quadratic sum of them.
            The uncertainty of the normalization factor due to the
           counting statistics was about 0.5%.

ANALYSIS    The cross-section at the thermal energy was derived by
           fitting the exp.data between 10 and 40 meV with a
           function of a*EN**-b, where the uncertainty due only to
           the counting statistics was taken into account.
ADD-RES    Westcott's g-factor was obtained as
           0.988+-0.004(stat)+-0.009(sys) .
           The error of the g-factor was estimated to be 0.009
           which is the quadratic sum of 0.003 due to the sample
           thickness of natB and 0.008 due to the frame-overlap
           background.
