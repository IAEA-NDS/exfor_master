FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) CYCLONE - Louvain-la-Neuve cyclotron
                                     facility.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced by protons impinging
           on a 5 mm thick Li target.
INC-SPECT   Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons .
           At the sample positions, the fluence rate of peak
           neutrons was about 10**5 1/cm**2/sec.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Multi-section Frisch-gridded ionization chamber
                  as a fission fragment detector.
METHOD     (PHD) The post-neutron fragment energy in lab-system
           was obtained from the anode pulse height.
           (TOF) Time-of-flight technique - to distinguish the
           fission events induced by peak neutrons.
ANALYSIS   The double kinetic energy method based on conservation
           laws of mass and linear momentum was used to determine
           fragment masses.
           Pre-neutron fragment masses and energies were
           determined in an iterative procedure.
           Absolute energy calibration was done by using alpha
           particles from Cf-252 source and a high precision pulse
           generator.
           To subtract the wrap-around background, the fission
           event time distributions were simulated by Monte-Carlo
           folding of the neutron-induced fission cross-sections
           of Th-232 from ENDF evaluated library and REL-REF of
           P..W.Lisowski+ 6] and of U-238 from ENDF evaluated
           library and REL-REFs of A.D.Carlson with the neutron
           spectrum of REL-REF H.Schuhmacher+ .
           Evaluation of REL-REF of A.C.Wahl was used to calculate
           the mass distributions corresponding to the overlapping
           low energy neutrons.
CORRECTION For the grid inefficiency, detector pulse-height-defect
           and fragment energy losses in the target material and
           backing.
           For background.
