METHOD     (TOF) Capture cross section measurements were carried
           out by the TOF method.
           Pulse-height weighting technique was applied to
           observed gamma-ray spectra to determine the capture
           yields.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Pair of C6D6 liquid scintillators for capture
           gamma-ray measurement.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)
            Energy dependent neutron flux was derived with the
           standard cross sections of the 10B(n,ag) reaction.
           Detection efficiency for the 478-keV gamma-ray was
           calculated with the EGS5 code.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Photo-neutron target of Ta was adopted as
           pulsed neutron source.
SAMPLE     The samples of 151Eu and 153Eu were packed in aluminum
           foils 20 mm in diameter and 0.08 mm in thickness.
           The sample of 10B was packed in an Al case of 25 mm
           diameter, 0.4mm thickness.

           was 12.1+-0.02 m.
CORRECTION  Correction for the neutron self-shielding and multiple
           scattering in each sample was made by the MCNP-4C
           (Monte-Carlo Code for Neutron and Photon Transport,
           version 4C) [2] with the nuclear data taken from
           JENDL-4.0.

CORRECTION    Correction for the capture yields due to the
           isotopic impurity in the sample was done by using
           the present results of 151Eu (Subent 002).
