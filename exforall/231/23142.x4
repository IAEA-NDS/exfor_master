INC-SOURCE (D-D,D-T)  Deuteron beams on deuterium gas and solid
           tritium targets .
           The D2 gas-target had a gas pressure of 100 kPa, a gas
           cell length of 40 mm, a Mo entrance foil thickness of
           5 um and a 1 mm Ta beam stop. The T/Ti-target had a
           Ti thickness of 2.245 mg/cm2 (5% uncertainty), a
           nominal T/Ti ratio of 1.4 and a gold backing of 0.5 mm
           thickness.
INC-SPECT   Neutron fluence was measured by Nb foils using the
           Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92 activation reaction (En >14 MeV) or
           by a proton recoil detector (En<9MeV). Nb foils of
           2.0 cm diameter and 0.5cm thick were irradiated at a
           fixed angle of 60 deg. and 8cm from the target center.
           The measured neutron fluence in the reference position
           was rescaled to the actual fluence at the position of
           the SCD detector using the EnergySet program:

DETECTOR   (SCIN) Diamond detector used was produced by Diamond
           Detector Ltd (UK). It consists of a high purity single
           crystal detector packed in Al housing with a male SMA
           connector. The SCD is mounted over a 8mm hole on a
           Rogers 4003 PCB substrate.The detector is a single
           crystal of 4.7x4.7x0.5 mm**3 and a nitrogen impurities
           level smaller than 5ppb. The electrical contacts are
           4.5 mm in diameter and are made with a metallization,
           top and bottom, of diamond like carbon (DLC)/Pt/Au
           layers.
           The SCD detector was located at different angles with
           respect to the deuteron beam at 8cm distance from the
           center of the target.
           To determine the energy linearity and resolution of the
           detector its response for charged particles produced in
           the C-12(n,a)Be-9 reaction was studied.
           Experimental measured efficiency was 1.9E-4 counts/cm2
           at 8.3 MeV neutron energy (maximum measured value) and
           2.5E-5 counts/cm2 at 19 MeV neutron energy (minimum
           measured value).
           Measurements lasted typically 30 min and after each run
           the high voltage was switched off and on - to avoid the
           polarization effects.
           Intrinsic energy resolution about 56 keV (FWHM).
           (TELES) The proton recoil telescope was positioned at
           an angle of 21 deg. and 40cm from the target center.
           For neutron flux measurement.
CORRECTION For background and possible interfering peaks.
ADD-RES           Total energies of the produced charged particles
           versus mean neutron energy were calculated, are given
           in Table 1 of S,AIP-1412,121,2011.
