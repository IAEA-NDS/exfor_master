FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)   3.7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Four activations with three samples.
           Run  Sample Irradiation time  Integrated flux x10**13
           I   Zn-1      174 min         1.12 +- 0.04
           II  Zn-1     2640 min         14.2 +- 0.5
           III Zn-2     1182 min         7.4  +- 0.3
           IV  Zn-3     1242 min         4.9  +- 0.3
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton beam with an energy of Ep = 1912 keV.
           30 microm thick metallic Li layers evaporated onto
           water-cooled copper backings.
SAMPLE     (30-ZN-64,NAT=0.48268) (48.268+-0.214)%
           (30-ZN-68,NAT=0.19024) (19.024+-0.082)%
           (30-ZN-70,NAT=0.00631) (0.631+-0.006)%
            Three metallic natural Zn samples:
            Zn-1 - 409.19 mg, 12 mm diameter;
            Zn-2 - 181.71 mg, 8 mm diameter;
            Zn-3 - 800.72 mg, 12 mm diameter.
            The samples were sandwiched between 0.03 mm thick gold
            foils of the same diameter, which served as neutron
            flux monitors. Samples were placed completely inside
            the neutron cone in contact with the neutron target at
            the position of highest flux.
            Relative isotope abundance ratios of samples:
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Activities of the gold foils were measured with
           a well calibrated, passively shielded 76 cm3 HPGe
           detector, with 1.7 keV resolution at 1.33 MeV gamma-ray
           energy and a relative efficiency of 30%.
             Zn activities were counted with two clover-type HPGe
           detectors facing each other in close geometry. Each
           clover detector (Eurisys Measures) consists of four
           independent n-type Ge crystals in a four-leaf-clover
           arrangement with 0.2mm gaps in between. The originally
           cylindrical crystals of 50 mm diameter, 70 mm length;
           active volume of about 145 cm3 per crystal.
           (GLASD) Neutron flux was continuously monitored and
           recorded in time steps of typically 60 s by means of
           6Li-glass detector at 1 m distance from the target.
           The individual Ge crystals have resolution of typically
           2.0 keV at 1.33 MeV. At 122 keV, the peak-to-total
           ratio is about 45 . The efficiency of the clover setup
           was determined with a set of pointlike calibration
           sources (22Na, 54Mn, 60Co, 65Zn, 88Y,131Ba, and 137Cs)
           complemented by a detailed Monte Carlo simulation using
           a full model of the setup - see REL-REF of S.Dababneh+.

           normalized to the value for kT = 25 keV of W.Ratynski

ADD-RES    (DECAY) New value of Zn-71-m HL was measured in this
           work from the decay curves of three (386, 487, 620 keV)
           gamma transitions in 71Ga to be 4.125 +-0.007 h.
           Combining this new result with the values of previous
           measurements, weighted average of 4.120+-0.007 h was
           obtained .
