TITLE       Systematic Study on keV-neutron Capture Cross Sections
            and Capture Gamma-ray Spectra of Pd Isotopes.

FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) 3 MV Pelletron accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Pulsed proton beams from the accelerator
           produce a 1.5 nsec pulsed neutron beam via the
            7Li(p,n)7Be reaction.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Anti-Compton NaI(Tl) spectrometer.
           (GLASD) The incident neutron energy spectra were
           measured by a time-of-flight method with a 6Li-glass
           scintillation detector.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight (TOF) and Pulse Height(PH) data
           were measured.
           Measurements cyclically for Pd sample, Au sample, and
            "no sample" scenario (a blank run).
           Pulse height weighting technique was applied to the net
           PH spectra to obtain the capture yields of Pd and Au.

            "As for the numerical data of cross sections and
            spectra, we have not yet published them in a journal
            paper. Therefore, we would like to send you them
            after publication".
