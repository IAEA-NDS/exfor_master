            Details of extraction of particle-gamma coincidence
            spectra.
SAMPLE     Dy-161,162,163 targets were self-supporting and
           isotopically  enriched to approximately 95% in the
           isotope of interest with thicknesses of
           approximately 2 mg/cm**2. An 11-day experiment
           on the Dy-164 target was carried out with 38-MeV He-3
           ions at the Oslo Cyclotron Lab. The Dy-164 target,
           enriched to approximately 98.5% in isotope of interest,
           was prepared as a self-supporting foil of approximately
           1.7 mg/cm**2 thickness.
METHOD     (COINC) Particle-gamma coincidence.
           (EDE)
            SRM- surrogate reaction method.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SILI,SI) CP were detected with eight particle
           telescopes, each  consisting of a front Si dE
           detector and a back Si(Li) E detector with
           thicknesses of 140 and 3000 microm, respectively,
           placed at an angle of 45  degrees relative to the
           beam direction.Intrinsic particle energy resolution was
           determined using Am-241 source to be 50 keV at
           Ealpha=5.486MeV.
           Average energy resolution of the particle detectors
           200 keV over entire particle energy region.
           (NAICR) Array of 28 NaI gamma-ray detectors, which
           intercepted a solid angle of 15% of 4PI, surrounded
           the target and particle detectors. FWHM of the detector
           output varied from 80 keV at alpha-ray energy of
           1.33 MeV up to 250 keV at alpha-ray energy of 8 MeV.
COMMENT    Of author Bethany Goldblum (28.09.2010, 07.10.2010):
           "I don't recommend using the data in Fig.1a and Fig.2a,
           because the trend suggests that the gamma-ray energy
           threshold removes contributions to decays from discrete
           states and thus improves the agreement of the surrogate
           measurement with the directly-measured work.
           It does not make sense to include the data from Fig1(a)
           and 2(a) in the EXFOR database, because they do not
           accurately reflect the physics. They were presented to
           show the effect of the gamma-ray energy threshold on
           the extracted cross section, but the contribution from
           discrete states in Fig. 1(a) and 2(a) data skews the
           result. The presentation in the manuscript was meant to
           be illustrative of this effect."

            ENDF/B-VII.0 as a function of neutron energy obtained

           then shifted into equivalent neutron energy by

           nucleus (Sn=8196.9 keV) from excitation energy.
