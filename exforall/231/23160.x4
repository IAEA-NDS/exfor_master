           combination with a Fast Sample Transfer System (FSTS),
           deliver the sample from the irradiation position to
           HpGe detector or vice versa within 0.5 s.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)   H-3(D,N)He-4 reaction
INC-SPECT  At the irradiation place (70 mm from neutron source),
           neutron fluxes are ranged from 0.9E+7 and 1.6E+7
           n/cm2/s, depending on the neutron target condition.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Five different positions around the target
           holder inclined at 45 deg were used. The angles of
           the irradiation positions along the deuteron beam were
           0, 30, 60, 120, 130 deg,which correspond to the neutron
           energies 14.83, 14.75, 14.52, 13.75, 13.57 MeV,
           respectively. The effective energies of the incident
           neutrons at each sample position were determined by the
           ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+, 1982) and
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway, 1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis+, 1980)
           and were given in detail in Subasi+(1996).
           Acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front of
           the detector to block the beta particles from samples
           and to minimize the photon absorption and production of
           bremsstrahlung.

           and adopted for ENDF/B-VII.0.
SAMPLE     Sample pellets of 13 mm diameter, 8.5 mm thickness,
           about 2 g weight were pressed from the natural,
           high-purity (99.9%) Ce2O3, and Al2O3 powders.
           Water contents in the samples were removed by heating
           the oxide materials up to 105 deg C, then they were
           kept in a desiccator for 0.5 h to cool down to the room
           temperature; after that, they were filled in dry
           stainless steel capsules and pressed to form a dense
           pellet; the pellets were tightly packed into thin
           polyethylene boxes and sealed-off.
CORRECTION Self-absorption corrections are obtained from solid
           angle calculation with absorption as 4%, 7% for gamma
           rays of irradiated Al and Ce samples respectively.

           Contributions from low energy neutrons (about 5%).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total error includes errors due to:
           (ERR-1) Sample weight,
           (ERR-2) Concentration of the element,
           (ERR-3) Isotopic abundance,
           (ERR-4) Counting solid angle and intrinsic efficiency
           of the gamma detector,
           (ERR-S,22.,41.) Statistical uncertainty (full energy
            photo-peak area),
           (ERR-5) Neutron flux fluctuation,
           (ERR-6) Effective neutron flux ( including reference
             cross section),
           (ERR-7) Irradiation, cooling and measuring times.
            The uncertainties were assumed to be uncorrelated, so
           the total uncertainties in the cross section values
           could be determined by adding the experimental errors
           and the uncertainties of nuclear data in the quadratic
           form.
