FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  High-flux reactor ILL, Grenoble.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Cold polarized neutron beam
           (POLNS) Supermirror polarizer.
           For measuring the triple correlation the spin
           was oriented longitudinally along the beam.
           In parity non-conserving (PNC) experiments the neutron
           spin was turned perpendicularly to the beam and
           pointing towards the FF detectors.
INC-SPECT   Broad spectrum with an average wavelength of
           4.5 Angstrom. The polarization achieved was (95+-1)%,
           flux density 6*10**8 n/cm**2/s.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Two multiwire proportional counters mounted
           symmetrically on opposite sides of the beam on a
           common axis with the target - for FF.
           Two arrays of 16 PIN diodes of 3x3 cm**2 in size -
           for ternary particles (TP).
           Alpha detectors were calibrated with an Am-241 source.
METHOD     (COINC)  Coincidence between LCP and FF
           (TOF) Time-of-flight (TOF) difference between two
           correlated FFs - to separate reasonably well light
           and heavy fragments.
           (SFLIP) Spin flip technique. Every second the neutron
           spin was flipped by 180. Setup allowed to measure in
           parallel the coefficients for four independent
           combinations of detectors yielding four independent
           values for the coefficients. Guide fields were inverted
           typically once per day. Thus a total of eight
           independent measurements is available for evaluation.
           It was checked that for a depolarized neutron beam the
           asymmetries indeed vanish within exp. uncertainty.
ANALYSIS   From the number of counts N+ and N- in the two spin
           positions the asymmetry coefficients are obtained as
           the difference of counts normalized to the sum of
           counts (N+ - N-)/(N+ + N-).
CORRECTION -The energy spectra of alpha particles measured in
           present experiments were corrected for the energy
           loss in the Al foil protecting the PIN diodes.
           - For the geometry of the experimental setup.
           - For finite resolving power in the separation of light
           and heavy fragments.
           - For finite polarization of the neutron beam .
           - For coincidences.
