INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Protons impinging on a neutron production
           target consisting of 99.98% Li-7.
INC-SPECT  The neutron spectrum consists of a peak at 96+-0.5 MeV
            (1.2 MeV FWHM) and a low-energy neutron tail that can
           be suppressed by time-of-flight techniques.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2SWDUPP) Neutron beam facility at The Svedberg
           Laboratory (TSL) in Uppsala before the neutron facility
           was upgraded in 2004.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) SCANDAL consists of two identical
           arms positioned on each side of the neutron beam and
           covering the angles 10-50 deg and 30-70 deg.
           Detection of scattered neutrons is based on conversion
           to protons in an active plastic scintillator and
           measurement of the full energy of the outgoing protons
           in an array of CsI detectors.
ANALYSIS    The spectrum obtained at 96 MeV (the incident energy)
           was shifted downwards in steps of 1 MeV in the
           analysis. This strategy was based on studies of the
           ratio between the np scattering and the 12C(n,p)
           reaction, which was found to be fairly constant over
           the relevant energy interval.
CORRECTION  For background.
            For the energy dependence of the np cross section and
           for variations in proton detection efficiencies in
           different CsI crystals.

            Elastic scattering data.
            For the present data, novel analysis procedure was
           applied, allowing cross sections for inelastic neutron
           scattering to be extracted from the same data sets.
           For attenuation and multiple neutron scattering in the
           scattering targets based on Monte Carlo codes.
           Response correction.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Error due to contribution from the fact that
           the H(n,p) and the C(n,p) have different energy
           dependence.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in the cross section ratio between
           the highest and lowest energy in the present analysis.
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in the cross section
           normalization.
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty due to the attenuation and multiple
           scattering corrections.
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic uncertainty
SAMPLE      No information.
ADD-RES     The excitation-energy spectra were also measured for
            C-12 and Y-89 inelastic scattering.
