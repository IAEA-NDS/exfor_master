FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) 295-MeV proton beam at the Research
           Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) of Osaka University.
             (n,p) facility.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutron beam at 293 MeV with an intensity of
           1E+6 s-1 was produced by using a proton beam with
           a current of 300 nA through the 7Li(p,n) reaction.
COMMENT    The experiments were performed at RCNP, Osaka Univ.
           under the Experimental Programs No.E272, No.E290.
           This work was supported financially in part by a
           Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research
           No.17002003 of the Ministry of Education, Culture,
           Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.
STATUS     (COREL,E2379001) 116Cd(p,n) reaction data.
HISTORY    (20120818A) M.M.
            Request for the data was sent from JCPRG - reply
           from Naoya Furutachi 20 August 2012:
           "We have already sent a e-mail to the first author
            M.Sasano in early August (e-mail in Japanese),
            however, we have not received reply yet. Now we are
            contacting the coauthor T.Uesaka."

EN-SEC     (E-EXC,49-IN-116)
SAMPLE     (50-SN-116,ENR=0.996) Three enriched 116Sn (99.6%)
           target foils with thicknesses of 310+-12, 338+-13,
           419+-16 mg/cm2 mounted in a multitarget system.
METHOD       The spectra obtained over angular range of 0-12 deg
           were divided into 12 spectra of double-differential
           cross sections in 1 deg bins. The overall energy
           resolution was about 2.2 MeV in (n,p) spectra.
ADD-RES      By MD analysis, the cross sections are decomposed
           into multipole components from changing the angular
           momentum dL = 0 to 3.
           GT (Gamow-Teller) strengths for the transitions to the
           intermediate 1+ states up to 30 MeV in 116In, in the
           beta- and beta+ directions via the 116Cd(p,n) and
           116Sn(n,p) were obtained.
           The strengths integrated up to 30 MeV including the
           IVSM component are 40 +-6 and 11 +-1 in the beta- and
           beta+ directions, respectively. The GT strength from
           the 116Cd ground state to the 116In ground state is
           deduced to be 0.28 +-0.03.
