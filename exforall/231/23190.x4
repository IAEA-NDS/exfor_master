REACTION   (64-GD-0(N,G),,SIG)
ANALYSIS   The measurements have been analyzed in the framework of
           the exact perturbation theory with the PIMS dedicated
           tool based on the APOLLO2 deterministic code, 281 group
           energy mesh and the Method of Characteristics for flux
           solving photopeak.
CORRECTION Correction to subtract the reactivity worth from other
           materials .
           For 3D effects, self-shielding.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
           Correlation between each series due to systematic
           uncertainties coming from the calibration by 10B or 6Li
           were taken into account.
           Uncertainty due to the absorption cross section of 10B
           or 6Li about 0.3%.
           Major uncertainty sources on the reactivity worth
           include:
           - the repeatability and reproducibility of reactivity
           measurement,
           - the mass amount of gadolinium (or 10B/6Li for the
           calibration samples),
           - the diameter of the sample clad which impacts the
           mass of water inside the oscillation rod.
