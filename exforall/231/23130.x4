FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP)   TSL cyclotron at Svedberg Lab.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 179.3+-0.8 MeV proton beam on enriched Li-7
           target of 23.5 mm thickness.
           Residual proton beam current monitoring by Faraday cup.
           Cylindrical  and conical iron collimators.
           Distance between Li-7 target and center of Medley
           chamber - 4618 mm, where neutron beam has 42.08 mm
           diameter.
INC-SPECT  Quasi-monoenergetic - neutron peak at 175.0+-2.5 MeV
           and low energy tail. Spectrum is given on :
           Fig.3 of J,KPS,58,(1270),2011.
           Present TOF cut select 78 % of all events, half of them
           in 175 MeV peak, another half in low energy tail.
           Contribution of the low energy wrap-around peak < 2%.
METHOD     (REC) Neutron spectrum was measured with proton recoil
           technique, at 20 degrees in the lab. system , using
           5-mm thick CH2 target.
           (TOF) TOF - to select peak neutrons and reject tail
           neutrons.
           TOF of each CP from reaction target at Medley centre
           to first SIBAR is subtracted from the total TOF.
           (EDE) DeltaE-E technique for particle identification
           and energy measurement.
           Instrumental background was measured without sample.
DETECTOR   (TFBC) TFBC and IOCH - for relative neutron beam
           (IOCH) intensity monitoring, both utilizing neutron
           induced fission of U-238.
           (SPEC,TELES,SIBAR,CSICR)
           Medley spectrometer consist of eight three-elements
           telescopes mounted in evacuated cylindrical chamber of
           90 cm diameter. Each telescope consists of two fully
           depleted silicon surface barrier detector (served as
           deltaE detector, 1-st 50-60 microm thick, second -
           1000 microm thick) and CsI(Tl) scintillator (as E
           detector, 50 mm diameter, 100 mm length) with
           18x18 mm**2 Hamamatsu S3204-08 photodiode.
           Medley can detect protons  from 2 up to 170 MeV,
           Thresholds for other ions are higher, up to 9 MeV for
           alphas.
           Exp. data themselves were used for calibration.
SAMPLE     122 mm diameter, 0.5 mm thick, 1153+-1 mg weight  disk
            of SiO2 as oxygen target.
           22 mm diameter,1.0 mm thick, 1132+-1 mg weight disk
           of silicon-for the subtraction of silicon contribution.
           Polyethylene CH2 of 24 mm diameter, 5.0 mm thick ,
           2293+- 1 mg weight- for absolute c-s normalization.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) For neutron spectrum, using CH2
           target and kinematics calculation.
           n,p scattering c-s were taken from:
           R.Arndt,W.Briscoe,R.Workman,I.Strakovsky,M.Paris,
           SAID Partial-Wave Analysis Facility,
            http://gwdac.phys.gwu.edu/
ANALYSIS   Absolute double-differential cross-sections are
           obtained by normalizing the target-in data to the
           number of recoil protons emerging from CH2 target.
           Background and C-12(n,xp) events were subtracted
           from measured proton production at 20 deg.
           C-s for oxygen were obtained after subtraction of
           silicon data from SiO2 data with proper normalization
           to the number of Si nuclei in two targets.
