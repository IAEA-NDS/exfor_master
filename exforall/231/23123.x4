FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) Research reactor FRM at Technical
            University of Muenich.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Set of filters : 40 cm Fe-56, 97 or 127 cm Al,
           7 cm S installed in horizontal tube P2 gives the
INC-SPECT  quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam of about 24 keV energy
           with admixture of other energies of only 1 %.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) two proportional hydrogen counters for neutron
           detection.
METHOD     (FNB) Filtered neutron beam.
           (TRN) Neutron transmission.
           (PHD) Pulse amplitudes were analyzed by two-channel
            spectrometer.
            Measurement with and without sample in the beam.
            Four independent curves of transmission were
           calculated separately for each amplitude channel.
            200 hours running.
CORRECTION  For dead time, using approximation of dead time by
            (4.7+0.0037*I)+-1.0 microsec, derived from several
           transmission measurement with different neutron beam
           intensities.

HISTORY    (20101130C) M.M.
            Entry was sent 01.12.2010 to O.Gritzay to approve.

REACTION   (82-PB-208(N,TOT),,SIG)
SAMPLE      Pb-208 sample of 98.3 % enrichment, 99.98 % purity is
            metallic cylinder of 15 mm diameter, 20.8 mm thick
            (0.068717 +- 0.000033 1/b).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error, but components are not
                      specified.
COMMENT    Of author O.Gritzay.
           In the article the data were mentioned as preliminary,
           but this experiment was stopped and no new analysis of
           data is planned.
