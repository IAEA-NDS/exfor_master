ANALYSIS    Gamma-ray spectra were analyzed using the software
            package Genie2000 of Canberra.
            Energy calibration  was made by standard sources:
           Am-241 (Egamma=59.5 keV), Cd-109 (Egamma=88 keV),
           Co-57 (Egamma= 122.1, 136.5 keV),
           Cs-137 (Egamma= 661.66 keV), Mn-54 (Egamma= 834.8 keV),
           Zn-65 (Egamma= 1115.5 keV)
            for different radial positions and detector-source
            distance.
            The efficiency of the detection setup was determined
           by Monte Carlo simulation using the code MCNP5
           taking into account the entire detection geometry.
           Results of simulation were compared with measured
           values and efficiency curves by fitting experimental
           points with polynomial logarithmic functions. Detector
           geometry parameters have been optimized to obtain
           agreement between measurements and simulations within
           the uncertainty limits.

ANALYSIS   The intensities of the two main gamma-rays emitted in
           the decay of 240-Am were measured as a function of
           cooling time after irradiation. The results confirm
           that the 987.79-keV gamma-line is free of interference,
           while the 888.85 keV gamma line is contaminated by the
           natural activity of the sample itself. Only 987.79 keV
           gamma line was used for the 241Am(n,2n)240Am reaction
           cross section measurement.

           to 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively.
