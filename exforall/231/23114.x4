INC-SOURCE Typical beam current on the target 10 uA.
           (D-D) 8.34 and 9.15 MeV neutrons by 5.5, 6.3 MeV
            deuterons using D2 gas target cell of 4 cm length,
            4 cm diameter, with Mo entrance window at 120 kPa.
            Samples were placed 1.5 cm from neutron production
            target.
           (D-T) 16.1 to 20.6 MeV neutrons from solid-state
            Ti/H-3 target of 2 mg/cm2 thickness on Ag backing of
            0.4 mm thickness.
            Samples were placed at 0 deg at 2 cm distance from
            neutron production target.
           13.3 MeV neutrons by 1 MeV deuterons.
            Sample were placed at 125 deg at 3.9 cm distance from
            neutron production target.
INC-SPECT  Quasi-mono-energetic neutron flux 5.E+7 n/sec/cm2.
           Mean neutron energy and yield distributions were
            calculated by code ENERGYSET based on
            - cross section evaluations of H.Liskien+ (1973);
            - energy-loss estimates with stopping powers of
              H.H.Andersen et al., "Hydrogen stopping powers and
              ranges in all elements", Pergamon, New York, 1977.
           To account for contribution of low threshold energies
            reaction, neutron flux density distributions were
            determined using previously measured TOF spectra
            combined with the spectral index method involving
            various reactions used for unfolding:
             115In(n,n')115mIn (A.B.Smith+, 1990),
             27Al(n,a)24Na (M.Wagner+, 1990),
             93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (M.Wagner+, 1990),
             27Al(n,p)27Mg (ENDF/B-VI),
             56Fe(n,p)56Mn (ENDF/B-VI),
             58Ni(n,p)58Co (ENDF/B-VI) .
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Pb/Sn/Cu shielding of 5/3/3 mm thickness,
            respectively, to reduce 241Am natural activity to
            limit the dead time of the system to <15% (between
            7% and 15%, typically).
           Co-60 standard source was used to check correctness of
            dead time given by acquisition system Maestro (Ortec).
           Additional shielding of 10-mm-thick Cu cylinder to
            avoid detection of scattered gamma-rays.
           Gamma-ray spectra were analyzed using the software
            package Genie2000 of Canberra.
           Energy calibration was made by standard sources:
            241Am(59.5 keV), 109Cd(88 keV), 57Co(122.1,136.5 keV),
            137Cs(661.66 keV), 54Mn(834.8 keV), 65Zn(1115.5 keV)
            for different radial positions and detector-source
            distance.
           The efficiency was determined by MCNP5 taking into
            account the entire detection geometry.
           Results of simulation were compared with measured
            values and efficiency curves by fitting experimental
            points with polynomial logarithmic functions.
           Detector geometry parameters have been optimized to
            obtain agreement between measurements and simulations
            within the uncertainty limits.
           (BF3) BF3-counter operated in multichannel-scaling
            acquisition mode - to record the time profile on
            neutron flux.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
           The intensities of the two main gamma-rays emitted in
            the decay of 240Am were measured as a function of
            cooling time after irradiation.
SAMPLE     The Am samples were prepared at JRC, ITU, Karlsruhe,
            by method based on production of porous alumina
            granules by powder metallurgy.
           Resulting powder was pressed into pellets of 12 mm
            diameter, 2mm thickness.
           Sample weight was on average 400 mg, average Am
            content was 40 mg. Encapsulated in Al containers.
