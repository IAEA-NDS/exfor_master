TITLE      Fission Product Yields of 233-U, 235-U, 238-U and
           239-Pu in Fields of Thermal Neutrons, Fission Neutrons
           and 14.7-MeV Neutrons.
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR SAC) Thermal column of the EL-3 heavy
           water-cooled reactor (decommissioned in 1982) at CEA
           in Saclay.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)
INC-SPECT   Flux at the irradiation point was 10**9 neutron/cm2/s.
SAMPLE      Thin deposits ( made by electroplating) - for fission
           chambers;
            thicker ones (made by electrospraying) - for fission
           products analysis.
METHOD    1(FISCT) Fission counting
          2(GSPEC) Gamma-spectrometry of the irradiated targets.
DETECTOR  1(FISCH) Plane fission chamber for the measurements
            of the numbers of fissions.
           Efficiency of 100 % was confirmed by two measurements:
           counting of alpha-activity of the sample;
           measurement at thermal flux by gold and cobalt foils.
          2(GELI ) Calibrated Ge-Li spectrometers.
           Volume 1 cm**3 (planar), 40 cm**3 (coaxial).
           Energy resolution from 0.6 at 0.9 keV at 122 keV,
           from 1.9 to 1.33 keV at 1.33MeV, depending on detector.
           Shielded with 10 cm lead.
           The efficiency curves of the detectors were determined
           by standard sources of 51Cr, 54Mn, 57Co, 60Co, 85Sr,
           88Y, 109Cd, 113Sn, 137Cs, 139Ce, 141Ce, 144Ce, 203Hg,
           241Am; 166Hom, 169Yb, 182Ta; Eu-152.
           Overall uncertainty on the efficiency taking into
           account solid angle correction (2 sigma) 2.0% .
ANALYSIS   Final value for each fission product is the combination
           of these different measurements through weighted
           averages, the weight being defined as the inverse of
           the square of the statistical uncertainty associated
           with each individual measurement.
           Old yields data were updated as:
            Y-new=Y-old(w1*(I1-old/I1-new)+w2*(I2-old/I2-new)),
           w1, w2 - normalized weights corresponding to each gamma
           line:
           95Zr 724 keV 50%, 757 keV 50%;
           97Zr 658 keV 50%, 743 keV 50%;
           140Ba 163 keV 50%, 537 keV 50%;
           147Nd 91 keV 50%, 531 keV 50%;
