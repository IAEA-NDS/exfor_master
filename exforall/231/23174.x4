SAMPLE     Cf-252 of 5E+5 fis/min, deposited on thick Pt backing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) ORTEC surface barrier detector, 8 mm diameter.
            For FF detection.

           Details of electronic equipment.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight path 6m, 3m, 1.5 m - geometry 1,2,3.
           Time resolution about 6 ns FWHM.
           At distance of 1.5 m measurements were also made with
           lead shield between Cf source and NaI(Tl) detector -
           geometry 4.
           For measurement in nano and subnanosecond region -
           recoil distance method was used - NaI(Tl) detector at
           50 cm distance from Cf source,  40 cm long lead
           collimator; two series of measurements were made - with
           collimator widths of about 8mm and 2 mm in geometries 5
           and 6 (data set 5 and 6), respectively.
ANALYSIS   Data were normalized to gamma-rays per prompt gamma-ray
           per channel(0.57ns) by setting the area of prompt
           gamma-ray peak ( from -10 to 12.5 ns) to unity.
           Data obtained with path 6m ( in range 45-120 ns) and
           3 m ( in range 30-54 ns) were accepted for analysis
            -data set 1 and 2, respectively.
CORRECTION  For finite time resolution.

            Yield of gamma-rays with energies greater 100 keV,
            per one fission.
EN-SEC     (E-MIN,G) Minimal energy of gamma-rays.
ANALYSIS   Defined from area of prompt gamma-ray peak in the time
           distribution measured in geometries 1,2,3 up to time of
           120 ns after fission.
           Attenuation of gamma-rays in air was taken into account
           by extrapolating the number of gamma-rays to zero
           distance.
