            Details of setup.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERZFK) Superconducting Electron Linac.
INC-SOURCE (BRST) nELBE source fast neutrons from 0.1 to 10 MeV.
           Electrons are accelerated up to 40 MeV using
           Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low
           Emittance ELBE.
           Bremsstrahlung radiation is induced by impinging
           a high intensity electron beam on a liquid lead loop.
           (PHOTO) Fast neutrons are generated via photonuclear
           reactions on lead.
           Conical collimator with an entrance diameter of 2 cm,
           exit diameter of 3 cm is used to let a defined beam
           of neutrons pass through the 2.4 m thick wall.
INC-SPECT  Neutron energy distribution of the nELBE neutron source
           was measured with U-235 fission chamber at flight path
           of 430 cm, shows Maxwellian type.
           The neutron source strength at the nominal beam current
           was calculated with MCNP-4C3 to be 10**13 neutrons/s.
           Experimental spectrum extends from 200 keV to 10 MeV
           peaking at around 2 MeV; is given on Fig.2 of
           J,EPJ/CS,8,07007,2010; Fig.4 of S,ISINN-18 .
           Neutron intensity on target was 4*10**4 n/s/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) U-235 fission chamber to measure primary
           neutron flux.
           (COIN,SCIN,BAF2) Array of 5 plastic scintillators of
           100 cm length, 4.2 cm width, 1.1 cm thickness with low
           detection threshold to detect the scattered neutron.
            Array of up to 42 BaF2 hexagonally shaped
           crystals (length 20 cm, inner diameter 53mm) to detect
           the de-excitation gamma-rays.
           All detectors have time resolutions of about 600 ps.
           Energy resolution about 1 % at EN about 1 MeV.
           Efficiency of the unshielded plastic scintillators was
           measured with quasi-monoenergetic neutrons at the PTB,
           Braunschweig, at five different neutron energies
           between 29 and 1202 keV. In addition, the efficiency
           was measured in situ relative to the fission chamber
           to cover the whole energy spectrum - plastic
           scintillators were surrounded by 1 cm thick Pb shield.
SAMPLE     Cylindrical slab of natural iron.
           Isotopic composition: Fe-54 - 5.85%, Fe-56 - 91.75%,
            Fe-57 - 2.12%, Fe-58 - 0.28%. Mass 19.82 g.
METHOD     (TOF) Double-time-of-flight method.
           Flight path several meters.
           (COINC) Gammas-neutrons coincidence.
ANALYSIS    Sample-out measurement was normalized to the same
           count rate like in the sample-in measurement, at
           energies higher than inelastic scattering signature.
           Then the normalized sample-out measurement was
           subtracted from the sample-in measurement. From the
           resulting distribution, the incoming neutron flux
           measured by the U-235 fission chamber and the
           efficiencies of the different detectors one can
           calculate the cross section.
CORRECTION Corrections for multiple scattering in the target,
           scattering of neutrons on air and on the angular
           correlation of the emitted gamma-ray and scattered
           neutron still have to be included.

           Nuclear Data measurements) and by the German federal
           ministry of education and research (BMBF) under project
           number 02NUK013A.
