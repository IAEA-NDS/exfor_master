TITLE       The thermal neutron capture cross-section of Np-237
AUTHOR     (F.Brown, G.R.Hall)
INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
REFERENCE  (J,JIN,2,205,1956)
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) BEPO pile.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (CADMB) Contribution from epi-Cd region (>0.4eV)
            neutrons was obtained by irradiating foils and flux
            monitors inside Cd boxes.
           (ACTIV) Foils of Np-237 and Au-198 monitor gold wires
           or foils were irradiated in BEPO at least 20 days.
           (ASPEC) Alpha-pulse-height analysis.
           (CHSEP) Activity of gold was obtained by dissolving the
            metal in acid, diluting and counting aliquots.
           (STTA) Sandwich targets irradiation.
DECAY-DATA (93-NP-237,2.20E+6YR) HL=(2.20+-0.04)*10**6 years.
           (93-NP-238,2.1D)
           (94-PU-238,89.6YR,A,5490.) HL=89.6+-0.4 years.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) 4-pi-type proportional methane flow beta-counter
           to measure gold activity.
           (IOCH) Gridded ionization chamber to measure Np foils
            activity.
SAMPLE      Eight Np-237 samples on thin Al disks, contamination
            of about 1% of alpha-activity from Pu-239 and Am-241.
            Au flux monitors : weighed wire of 0.127 mm diameter
            or weighed foils of thickness 0.0052 mm, 10 mg/cm**2.
            Assembly was wrapped in Al foil of thickness 0.007 mm,
            1.8 mg/cm**2 .
           For Cd run - Cd boxes of wall-thickness about 0.1 cm.
ANALYSIS    Reaction chain analysis with the help of ROOT MERCS
CORRECTION  For self-shielding for neutrons for gold wire - 4.6 %.
            For Am-241 presence in sample before irradiation.
            For dead-time, in observe counting-rates.
            For loss of beta-counts in 250-microg/cm**2 Al films -
            1% .
            For self-absorption of samples - 0.5+-0.5 % .
HISTORY    (20100511C) M.M.
           (20130203U) SD: Title of the journal in ref. was
            corrected (INC -> JIN).
