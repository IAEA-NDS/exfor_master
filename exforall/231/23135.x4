INC-SPECT  Mono-energy neutrons, excluding 10 MeV neutrons - not
           purely mono-kinetic neutrons (correction was done to
           take into account low energy continuous component at
           10 MeV EN).
METHOD     (EXTB) 5 min continuous irradiation period to reach the
           equilibrium, followed by a large number of cycles
           composed of irradiation sequences with Tirr=7 s and
           counting sequences with Tcounting = 1 s.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 12 gas detectors filled with He-3 (pressure
           4bar)are inserted in hollow cylinder (inner diameter
           12 cm, outer diameter = 32 cm, length 37 cm) of
           polyethylene. Moderator was covered by 1mm thick Cd.
           The detection efficiency to neutrons (between 100 keV
           and 1MeV) emitted in Th sample is simulated with the
           MCNPX transport code. Since the He-3 pressure in the
           tubes being not well known, the results of simulations
           had to be normalized to the efficiency for Cf-252
           neutron spectrum measured using two calibrated Cf-252
           sources (1.521+-0.025)*10**5 1/s and
            (3.821+-0.080)*10**3 1/s at different positions.
           The global detection efficiency of DN is defined to be
           0.092 +- 0.003 ; 2 MeV measurement was performed with a
           higher electronic threshold resulting to a lower
           efficiency 0.0501 +- 0.0011 .
             Two detectors were used to determine neutron fluence:
           (TELES) proton recoil telescope (PRT) placed at 0 deg.
           with respect to the ion beam line;
           (LONGC) fixed long counter placed around 6m from the
           neutron source at 98 degrees with respect to the ion
           beam line.
SAMPLE     Cylindrical thorium sample (2.55 cm diameter, 3.64 cm
           length, mass 182.2+-0.5 g ) was placed inside the
           neutron detector at zero degree with respect to the ion
           beam direction at distance of 75 mm from production
           target.

CORRECTION  For scattered neutrons, effect was measured during
           runs with and without DN detector in place, correction
           factor approximately 7%.
           For background.
           Three energy domains have been defined corresponding to
           fissions induced by neutrons coming directly from the
           source (mono),neutrons with lower energy (down) and
           neutrons with higher energy (up). The relative
           contributions to the total number of fissions of the
           three energy domains (Table 3 of J,ANE,76,514,2014):
           E(MeV) Mono (%) Down (%) Up (%)
            2.    98.71     0.79     0.50
            3.    94.56     5.10     0.34
            4.    92.15     7.63     0.22
            6.    94.67     5.19     0.14
            7.    97.33     2.60     0.07
            10.   89.80    10.19     0.01
            16.   93.64     6.36     0.00
           Corrections due to the fissions in the "up" and "down"
           zones depend on the energy but are in any case (except
           at 10 MeV) smaller than 8%.
           At 10 MeV incident neutron energy - correction due to
           the break-up component and the target thickness -
           around 10%.
           Correction for finite duration of irradiation (cycle:
           6.9sec beam on - 1.1s beam of; number of cycles >100)
           - 94% ..
ANALYSIS   Number of delayed neutrons at t = 0 (beam-off switching
           time) is determined by fitting the decay time spectrum
           with the function defined in Eq.(1) of ANE,76,514,2015
           and the parameters from REL-REF of G.R.Keepen+:

           Only the contributions of the groups 4, 5, 6 were
           considered to fit the curve since their contribution is
           predominant. The contribution of the groups 1- is
           considered as constant .
           Number of fissions in the sample was obtained from the
           fluence measurement combined with MCNPX transport code
           calculations using a detailed model of the set-up
           containing the thorium sample, the DN detector and the
           neutron source. Neutron source angular and energy
           distributions were calculated with DROSG code

           Data are in quite good agreement with published data
           between 2 MeV and 3 MeV and are a little bit higher at
           16 MeV.
           ENDF and the JENDL library underestimate this data at
           low energy but are in good agreement for energy greater
