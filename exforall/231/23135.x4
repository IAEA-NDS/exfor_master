            Data of G.Keepin+ used in analysis:
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERPTB) Low-Scatter Hall at PTB Ion Accelerator
           (CYCLO,2GERPTB) Facility.
             Van De Graaff accelerator and the cyclotron CV28
           depending on the energy of the neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (P-T,D-D,D-T) H-3(p,n)He-3, H-2(d,n)He-3, H-3(d,n)He-4.
INC-SPECT  Mono-energy neutrons, excluding 10 MeV neutrons - not
           purely mono-kinetic neutrons (correction was done to
           take into account low energy continuous component at
           10 MeV EN).
METHOD     (EXTB) 5 min continuous irradiation period to reach the
           equilibrium, followed by a large number of cycles
           composed of irradiation sequences with Tirr=7 s and
           counting sequences with Tcounting = 1 s.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) 12 gas detectors filled with He-3 are inserted
           in hollow cylinder (inner diameter 12 cm, outer
           diameter = 32 cm, length 37 cm) of polyethylene.
           Delayed neutrons detection efficiency is about 22%.
           The detection efficiency to neutrons (between 100 keV
           and 1MeV) emitted in Th sample is simulated with the
           MCNPX transport code. Since the He-2 pressure in the
           tubes being not well known, the results of simulations
           had to be normalized to the efficiency for Cf-252
           neutron spectrum measured using two calibrated Cf-252
           sources at different positions.
             Two detectors were used to determine neutron fluence:
           (TELES) proton recoil telescope (PRT) placed at 0 deg.
           with respect to the ion beam line;
           (LONGC) fixed long counter placed around 6m from the
           neutron source at 98 degrees with respect to the ion
           beam line.
SAMPLE     Cylindrical thorium sample (2.55 cm diameter, 3.64 cm
           length, mass 182.23 g ) was placed inside the neutron
           detector at zero degree with respect to the ion beam
           direction at distance of 75 mm from production target.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) For neutron fluence.
CORRECTION  For scattered neutrons, effect was measured during
           runs with and without DN detector in place, correction
           factor approximately 7%.
           For background.
           Corrections due to the fissions in the "up" and "down"
           zones depend on the energy but are in any case (except
           at 10 MeV) smaller than 7%.
           At 10 MeV incident neutron energy - correction due to
           the break-up component and the target thickness -
           around 10%.
ANALYSIS   Number of delayed neutrons at t = 0 (beam-off switching
           time) is determined by fitting the decay time spectrum
           with the function defined in Eq.(1) of J,EPJ/CS,8,07010
           and the parameters from REL-REF of G.R.Keepen+:

           Only the contributions of the groups 4, 5, 6 were
           considered to fit the curve since their contribution is
           predominant.
           Number of fissions in the sample was obtained from the
           fluence measurement combined with MCNPX transport code
           calculations using a detailed model of the set-up
           containing the thorium sample, the DN detector and the
           neutron source. Neutron source angular and energy
           distributions were calculated with DROSG code

           Data are in quite good agreement with published data
           between 2 MeV and 3 MeV and are a little bit lower at
           16 MeV. Predictions of the ENDF and the JENDL library
           are in good agreement with data of this experiment.
