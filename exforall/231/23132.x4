           Description of the method and of the calculation of
            weighting function
SAMPLE     Temperature at the sample position was continuously
           monitored. The average temperature was used in the
           resonance shape analysis to account for Doppler effect.
          1 Samples of thickness
            - 10.0 microm (5.861E-5 at/b),
              20.0 microm (1.163E-4 at/b),
              50.0 microm(2.906E-4 at/b)
           using 50 Hz frequency and natural Cd filter to prevent
           overlapping between neutron bunches;
            - 3.0 mm (1.757E-2 at/b) using 800 Hz frequency and
            B-10 filter to prevent overlapping between neutron
            bunches.
          2 At 12.5 m flight path (and 50 Hz frequency) - samples
           of thickness 0.5 mm (3.097E-3 at/b) using Co,Bi,Na
           filters for background, with and without natural Cd
           filter to prevent overlapping between neutron bunches.
           At  30 m flight path:
           - 50 Hz frequency and natural Cd filter to prevent
           overlapping, samples of thickness
           1.0mm(6.007E-3 at/b) using Na filter for background,
           0.5mm(3.097E-3 at/b) using W,Co,Na filters for
           background,
           0.5 mm (3.097E-3 at/b), 0.1 mm (5.945E-4 at/b),
           50.0 microm (2.906E-4at/b), 10.0 microm (5.861E-5at/b),
           5.0 microm (2.772 at/b) using Na filter for background;
           - 800 Hz frequency and B-10 filter to prevent
           overlapping, samples of thickness
           1.0mm (6.07E-3at/b), 0.5 mm(3.097E-3 at/b),
           0.1 mm (5.940E-4 at/b);
           0.1 mm (5.940E-4 at/b) using Na filter for background;
           0.1 mm (5.940E-4 at/b) using S filter for background.
          3 0.1 mm thick Au foil was placed at a 7 m distance from
           the neutron producing target. The areal density of the
           Au filter (5.886E-4 at/b) was similar compared to the
           one of the capture sample (5.945E-4 at/b).
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) GELINA at IRMM .
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Pulsed white neutron source. Electron pulses
            (max.repetition rate 800 Hz, peak current up to 12 A
           in 10 ns time interval) are accelerated up to 150 MeV.
           Post-acceleration magnet compresses electron bunches
           to width < 1 ns (peak current 120 A).
           Electrons generate bremsstrahlung in rotating uranium
           target - neutrons were mainly produced by gamma,n and
           gamma,f reactions.
           Water-filled Be containers as moderators.
INC-SPECT  Direct - fast neutron spectrum with very good time
           resolution.
            Moderated - slow neutron spectrum at reduced energy
           resolution.
METHOD     (TOF)  0.5 ns resolution.
          1(TRN) Neutron detectors were placed at 49.345+-0.006 m
           distance from neutron producing target. Samples were
           placed almost halfway between detector and neutron
           producing target. Angle between the flight path and
           the normal to the moderator was -9 deg.
           (FNB) Sample changer was also used to place black
           resonance filters (i.e. S, Na, Co, W, and Ag) for
           background determination applying the black resonance
           technique. All measurements have been performed
           with at least one fixed black resonance filter in beam.
           The background level at 4.9 eV for a sample out
           measurement was < 1% and about 10% for measurements
           with a 10 microm thick Au sample in the beam.
           30mm diameter neutron beam at the sample position.
           (PHD) Pulse-height window selects the alpha-peak of
           Li-6(n,alpha) reaction to distinguish a neutron event
           from background events.
          2 Capture measurements at nominal flight path distances
           of 12.5 m, 30 m , 60 m (angle between the flight path
           and the normal to the moderator is 18, 0 and 9 degrees,
           respectively).Moderated neutron beam was collimated to
           75 mm diameter at the sample position.
           At about 1m from the sample a shielding of boron-oxide
           and paraffin together with a 10 cm thick lead wall,
           was placed to reduce the background.
           Pulse height weighting technique was used to create
           detector response proportional to the energy of the
           registered gamma.
          3 Self-indication measurements at 30 m flight path using
           the same setup as for capture measurements.
           Au filter (squared metal disc 21.7x22.0 cm, areal
           density of 5.886*10-4 atoms/barn,nominal thickness
           0.11 mm) was placed at the beginning of the neutron
           beam pipe, far from the measurement station.

           resolution function.
          1(BF3) BF3 proportional counters - to monitor
           output and stability of the accelerator and to
           normalize the sample-in and sample-out measurements to
           the same total neutron intensity.
           (GLASD) Li-glass scintillator (NE 912), enriched to 95%
           in Li-6 of 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness, 4 inch(101.6mm)
           diameter, viewed by a photo-multiplier.
           Background as a function of TOF was derived by black
           resonance technique.
          2(SCIN) C6D6 liquid scintillator array. Each detector
           was positioned at an angle of 125 degrees with respect
           to the direction of the neutron beam.
           Each scintillator was coupled to a quartz windowed
            (boron free) photomultiplier.
           Threshold for the deposited energy of the detection
           system at 12.5 m, 30 m, and 60 m was set to 200 keV,
           150 keV and 150 keV, respectively.
           Linearity and resolution of the C6D6 detectors were
           monitored on a weekly basis by measurements of the
           2.6 MeV gamma-ray from the Th-232 decay chain.
           (IOCH) B-10 Frisch gridded ionization chambers placed
           at 80 cm before the capture sample -to monitor shape of
           neutron spectrum. Double chamber was used with cathode
           loaded with two back-to-back layers of about
           40 microg/cm2 B-10, effective diameter of 84 mm,
           evaporated on a 30 microm thick aluminum backing.
           Chambers were operated with continuous flow of mixture
           of argon (90%) + methane (10%) at atmospheric pressure.
ANALYSIS   To derive the transmission and the capture yield from
           the raw TOF spectra the data reduction package AGS
            (Analysis of Geel Spectra) developed at the IRMM was
           used - C.Bastian, AGS,"set of UNIX commands for neutron
           data reduction", Proc.Int.Conf. on Neutron Research and
           Industry, Crete, Greece, 1996, Ed. G.Vourvopoulos,
           SPIE - International Society for Optical Engineering,
           Vol. 2867, 611, 1997 :
           AGS code controls the most important spectra
           manipulations: dead time correction, background fitting
           and subtraction and normalization; performs full
           propagation of uncertainties, starting from the
           uncorrelated uncertainties due to counting statistic;
           includes complete covariance matrix accounting for both
           uncorrelated and correlated uncertainty components.
           Resonance shape analysis code REFIT is used to
           parameterize the data in terms of resonance parameters.
           The code is based on the Reich-Moore approximation of
           the R-matrix formalism and accounts for self-shielding,
           multiple scattering and Doppler effects, the resolution
           of the spectrometer, neutron sensitivity of the capture
           detection system and attenuation of gamma-rays in
           sample.
           Normalization of capture yields and self-indication
            data was done by means of the saturated resonance
            technique applied to the 4.9-eV Au resonance.
           For capture measurements with thin samples the
            normalization was derived from nearby resonances,
            for which the resonance parameters were determined
            from the thick sample data.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)   C-s were used to drive
           (5-B-10(N,TOT),,SIG)       capture yields.
CORRECTION For dead-time - maximum correction for neutron energies
           below 500 eV was 2%.
            In capture measurement for the flux measurements the
           dead time was 3500 ns, with a maximum dead-time
           correction less than 1% at the two stations. The dead
           time for the capture measurement systems was 2800 ns.
           For the measurements at the 12.5m and 30m station
           maximum dead-time corrections were < 20% and 5%,
           respectively.
           For the attenuation in the exit window of ionization
           chamber and the attenuation due to the 80 cm air
           between ionization chamber and target.
           For background. In transmission measurement
           - for sample-out < 1%,
           - for sample-in up to 10% at 4.9 eV .
           In capture measurement time-dependent background was
           monitored during runs having only the sample holder in
           the neutron beam; additional 0.5 mm thick Pb-208 sample
           measurement was done to estimate the background due to
           scattered neutrons.

ANALYSIS   (MLA) REFIT code, based on the Reich-Moore
           approximation of the multi-level R-matrix formalism,
           was used to calculate the resonance parameters
           performing a simultaneous fit of several data sets.
           Adjusted parameters: energy, neutron and radiation
           width.Resonance energy was determined from transmission
           data at 49.34 m, where the time-energy calibration was
           adjusted to the U-238 resonance at 6.673 +- 0.001 eV.
