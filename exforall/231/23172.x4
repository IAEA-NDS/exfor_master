FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE)  Japan Proton Accelerator Research
           Complex (J-PARC), beam line  BL04 in materials and life
           science experimental facility (MLF), the accurate
           neutron-nucleus reaction measurement instrument (ANNRI)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) 3 GeV proton spallation.
           Beam power was 120 kW, the repetition rate 25 Hz.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) 4PI Ge spectrometer is composed of two cluster
           Ge detectors and six coaxial (or four clover) Ge
           detectors surrounded by BGO anti-coincidence shields.
           Response functions were deduced based on the developed
           method using the Monte Carlo simulation code EGS5 and
           were checked by Cs-137 source (661 keV gamma).
METHOD     (TOF) Distance between neutron source and spectrometer
            21.5 m. Neutron beam tube was filled by He-4 gas.
           Measurement - 37 hours for the 241Am sample and 4 hours
           for a blank case made of Al .
REL-REF    (N,,H.Utsunomiya+,J,NIM/A,548,455,2005).
           (N,,H.Harada+,J,NIM/A,554,306,2005)
           Two references for method of response function deducing
CORRECTION Dead time and self-shielding factor will be corrected
           in future.
ADD-RES     Ag sample of 22 mm (22 times of 1mm; 51.8% Ag-107,
           48.2% Ag-109) was used to measure TOF spectrum at KURRI
           -neutron resonances 16.3 and 5.19 eV were clearly shown
           for Ag-107 and Ag-109, respectively - to demonstrate
           performance as sum energy spectrometer to identify
           resonances.
           U natural sample of 11.05 g was used at electron linear
           accelerator of KURRI to measure gamma-ray intensity -
           neutron resonances 6.67, 20.87, 36.68 eV were
           identified in TOF and gamma-rays spectra
            (counts/channel, figures only).

REACTION   (95-AM-241(N,G)95-AM-242,,SIG) Capture c-s.
SAMPLE     241-Am sample (7.5 mg in weight and 10 mm in diameter)
           in chemical form of AmO2 covered with an Al case.
MONITOR      5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7 was used to measure energy
           dependence of incident neutron flux using 478.keV gamma
           ray.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data.

           "I have not yet finalized the Am-241 capture data.
            As soon as I finish it, I will send it".
