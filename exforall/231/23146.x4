INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beam is collimated to diameter of 2 cm
           by sandwich of 0.5-cm-thick boron carbide (B4C) neutron
           absorber, followed by a 1-cm-thick polyethylene (CH2)
           layer, 2-cm-thick lead (Pb) gamma-attenuator placed
           1.8 m upstream from the target. Second collimator of
           1-cm-thick B4C and 5-cm-thick Pb layer is placed 25 cm
           from the target to eliminate neutrons scattered on the
           first collimator.
INC-SPECT   Cold neutron beam.
            Initial neutron flux of 1.5E+9 n/cm**2/s for mean
           energy of 4.5 meV and angular spreading of 0.4 degree.
           Using the value and the Lu-176m activation measurement,
           neutron flux of (1.71+-0.16)*10**8 n/cm**2/s was
           obtained on the target.
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR SAC) Neutron multidetector array at the
           ORPHEE 14-MW reactor facility. G3.2 experimental area
           located about 40 m away from the reactor core.
           (REAC,2FR ILL) HFR reactor - to produce Lu-177m sample.
SAMPLE     Natural lutetium foil (25 microm thickness) of mass
           10.24+-0.01 mg in Al capsule was irradiated during
           6 days at the high flux reactor (maximum neutron flux
           around 1.5E15 n/cm**2/s) to produce Lu-177m by the
           Lu-176 radiative capture reaction. After 150-day
           cooling time it was put inside thin pure Al envelope
           of 20 microm thick. The number of (1.03+-0.05)*10**14
           isomers was accurately measured by gamma-spectroscopy
           right before the experiment at the ORPHEE facility.
           The activity of this radioactive target was 13.22 MBq.
           A similar nonirradiated natural lutetium foil from the
           same natural Lu sample used for the isomer target was
           used as a blank target.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 10-bar pure He-3 proportional counter of outer
           diameter 2.54 cm, active length 25 cm. Neutron array
           consists of 12 proportional 3He counters placed inside
           the cylindrical polyethylene moderator.
           Inner part of the vacuum chamber is shielded by
           2-mm-thick Cd layer to suppress the neutrons scattered
           by the target. 1-mm-thick Cd layer covers the moderator
           to stop thermal neutrons from the background or cold
           neutrons scattered by the collimator.
           Detection efficiency of the neutron array was obtained
           from MCNP code simulations - mean efficiency of 19.8%.
           Cf-252 source spontaneous fission neutron spectrum was
           measure and simulated by MCNP code to define
           correction factor. Corrected detection efficiency is
             (18.4+-0.9)%.
           (SPEC) Low-energy photon spectrometer (LEPS) was used
           to measure the 88.361-keV gamma-ray from the beta-decay
           of Lu-176m. Gamma detection efficiency of the LEPS
           located at (55.1+-0.5) cm was carefully obtained using
           standard radioactive sources (133Ba, 152Eu, 241Am) and
           MCNP and GEANT4 simulations to be (2.3+-0.1)*10**-3 %.

            For N 7 - block made in B4C in front of the isomeric
           target, letting the neutron beam come inside the

MONITOR    ((MONIT)71-LU-175(N,G)71-LU-176-M,,SIG) Cross sections
           of the burn-up of 175-Lu was used to derive neutron
           flux at sample position using the initial Lu-175
           quantity, the neutron flux in the V4 port ILL
           high-flux reactor.
           In the ORPHEE G3.2 cold neutron flux, 175Lu(n,G)176Lum
           cross section was derived from c-s value at thermal
           point (16.7+-0.4) b using 1/v law to be (41.5+-1.0) b.

ANALYSIS   Integrated cross section has been calculated over
           a Maxwellian neutron energy distribution at T = 323 K
           and over the ORPHEE G3.2 neutron energy distribution,
           then described by the Breit-Wigner formula with one
           isolated resonance. Resonance energy, the radiative
           width, the neutron width, are adjusted on the
           Maxwellian averaged radiative capture cross section.
           This set of obtained parameters is not unique but it
           allows the relevance of the presence of a low energy
           resonance to be tested.
           Superelastic neutron width is fixed at 70% of the
           radiative width.
