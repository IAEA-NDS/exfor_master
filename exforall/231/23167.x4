FACILITY   (SYNCH,2ZZZCER)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation neutrons produced with a pulsed,
           6-ns wide, 20 GeV/c proton beam with up to 7.E+12
           protons per pulse in a 80x80x60 cm3 lead target are
           moderated by a 5.8-cm water slab surrounding the lead
           target. Two collimators, consisting of layers of iron
            (inner diameter 11 cm, outer diameter 50 cm, placed
           135 m from the lead target) and borated polyethylene
            (at a distance of 175 m, outer diameter 40 cm, inner
           diameter 1.8 cm). The spatial distribution has been
           accurately measured, confirming previous simulations
           by V.Vlachoudis(private communication),and modeled as
           a function of neutron energy - REL-REF of J.Pancin+.
           1.5-T sweeping magnet placed at 145m from the
           spallation target removed residual charged particles.
           3-m-thick iron shielding was placed just after the
           magnet to remove negative muons.
           Multifilter changer has been installed in the beam line
           upstream of the first collimator.
INC-SPECT  Nearly symmetrical Gaussian-shaped beam profile at the
           sample position of 185.2 m, with a standard deviation
           of about 0.77 cm at low neutron energies.
           In addition to Monte Carlo simulations, measurement
           of the flux performed with 235U-loaded parallel-plate
           fission ionization chamber from the Physikalisch-
           Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig.
           During the capture measurements the relative neutron
           flux was measured with an in-beam neutron monitor SiMon
           ,consisting of a 6Li deposit on a Mylar foil and four
           off-beam silicon detectors for the detection of the
           6Li(n,t)alpha reaction products. Up to 1 keV both
           methods are in good agreement.
           The neutron flux adopted for the capture yield is an
           analytical fit of the measured flux from the SiMon
           detectors up to 1 keV and pointwise data from the PTB
           measurement above this energy, suitably normalized in
           an overlapping energy region.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two in-house-developed deuterated benzene C6D6
           gamma-ray detectors contained in low-mass carbon fiber
           housing.
           For energy calibration of each C6D6 detector authors
           measured the response to radioactive sources of 137Cs
            (0.662 MeV), 60Co (1.173 and 1.332 MeV), and composite
           source of 238Pu with 13C (6.13-MeV gamma-ray through
           13C(a,n)16O* reaction).Energy deposition in the C6D6
           liquid scintillator volume for each of these sources
           was simulated by MCNP code.
           The data-acquisition system was based on Acqiris flash
           ADCs with 8-bit amplitude resolution and down to 1 ns
           sampling interval with 8 Mbytes of memory, recording
           for each detector its full output signal from the start
           time given by the incident protons.The digitizers were
           operated at 500 Msamples/s, allowing storage of the
           detector signal during a 16-ms-long time-of-flight
           interval, corresponding to a minimum neutron energy of
           0.7 eV.
SAMPLE      Two disk-shaped thorium samples of 99.5% purity with
           total mass of 2.8046 g and diameter of 15 mm were
           placed in the beam at a flight path of 185.2 m.
           Natural lead sample to estimate the scattered photon
           background and a gold sample to verify the analysis
           procedure.
           Thorium sample with a thickness of 4.1E-3 atoms/b.
           All samples were fixed on thin kapton foils and
           mounted on the sample changer. The distance of the
           detectors from the center of the beam was 2.9 cm and
           the detectors were shifted 9.2 cm upstream from the
           center of the sample in order to reduce the scattered
           photon background.
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path 182.5 m.
            Pulse-height weighted spectra used to derive the
           capture yield.
           Runs without beam served to determine the background
           due to the thorium activity.
           The flight time was calibrated for each pulse using the
           so-called gamma flash. The flight path length was
           calibrated using a measurement of the first resonance
           of gold. Measurement with gold was used to fit the
           flight path 185.2 m in combination with the resolution
           function, using energy of the first resonance 4.89 eV.
           Doppler broadening, resolution broadening, width of
           proton pulse, resonance spacing were considered as
           contributions in observed resonance widths.
ANALYSIS   Two saturated resonances at 21.8 and 23.5 eV were used
           to determine the normalization.
CORRECTION For the spatial distribution of gamma emission.
           For dead-time: correction factor up to 1.025 in the
           peak of resonances in the resolved resonance region
           and is practically 1.0 in the valleys between them;
           applied to weighted count rate spectrum.
           For radioactive background.
           For background from sample scattered neutrons.
           For beam profile dependence from energy - using
           analytical function.
STATUS     (COREL,22931001) Average c-s in URR.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,0.5) Uncertainty due to fit and subtraction of
           the background due to the radioactivity of the sample.
           (ERR-2) Total uncertainty due to the weighting function

           The uncertainties due to the mass determination of
           the sample, dead-time correction, the correction for
           neutron sensitivity, the correction for spatial
           distribution of gamma emission were neglected.

            Capture yield.
ANALYSIS   Experimental capture yields were compared with
           calculated ones by ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluation. Only the
           391 experimentally observed resonances from the 919
           resonances presently available in ENDF/B-VII.0 were
           used.The data set given in Table II of PR/C,85,064601
           reflects only the ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluated parameters
           without readjustment from resonances experimentally
           observed in the present measurement.
