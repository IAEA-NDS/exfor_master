INC-SOURCE (D-D) The quasimonoenergetic neutron beam was produced
            via the 2H(d,n)3He reaction by bombarding a deuterium
            gas target with a deuteron beam at currents aprx 1-2
            mu-A. Neutron flux varied between 3.E+05 and
            4.E+06 n/(cm2 s) in the four runs performed.
SAMPLE     (79-AU-197,ENR=0.9999) High-purity natural gold foils
            <99.99% 197Au> with a diameter of 14 mm and thickness
            of 0.5 mm were used. Two Al foils of the same
            diameter and thickness were placed immediately before
            and after the gold foil and were used to determine
            the neutron flux.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Four irradiations have been carried out.
            The SULSA unfolding code was used.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG,,,EVAL)
            The integrated neutron flux was determined by using
            the cross-section values for the 27Al(n,alpha)24Na
            reaction found in literature (see MONIT-REF) and by
            averaging over the deduced values in the front
            and back Al foils.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The induced activity on the samples was measured
            with a 56% relative efficiency high-purity germanium
            (HPGe) detector. The detector was calibrated with
            152Eu and 207Bi sources.
           (BF3) Beam fluctuations were monitored with a BF3
            counter placed at a distance of 3 m from the
            deuterium gas target.
ANALYSIS   .The STAPRE-F code was used for estimation
            energy-averaged cross sections for particle-induced
            reactions with several possible emitted particles.
            The neutron transmission coefficients were calculated
            using the ECIS03 code with the global optical model
            parameters by Koning and Delaroche.
            The energies, spins, parities, and branching ratios of
            the discrete levels for each nucleus involved were
            taken from Nuclear Data Sheets (see REL-REF), and the
            first 90 levels of 196Au were included (up to
           ~0.730 MeV). For the levels with unknown spin and
            parity, estimates from neighboring levels were made,
            while for levels with more than one spin assignment, a
            choice was made in order to include a variety of
            spin values.
REL-REF    (M,,J.Raynal,R,CEA-N-2772,1994) - ECIS03 code
           (M,,A.J.Koning+,J,NP/A,713,231,2003) - Global optical
                                               model  parameters
           (N,,H.Xiaolong,J,NDS,108,1093,2007) - The energies,
                spins, parities, and branching ratios were used.
ADD-RES    (THEO,COMP) Theoretical calculations of the above cross
             sections in the 8-25 MeV region were carried out
             with the use of the STAPRE-F, EMPIRE,and TALYS codes,
             which were also compared in their implementation of
             the generalized superfluid model.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainties are quadratic sum of:
           (EN-ERR,,1.)   Error of the neutron energy < 1%
           (ERR-1,4.,6.5) Error of the neutron flux 4 - 6.5%,
               including 2% uncertainty in the 27Al(n,alpha)24Na
               cross section
           (ERR-2) Error due to correction factors 2%
           (ERR-3,,0.5) Error due to time factors <0.5%
           (ERR-4) Error of the gamma-ray intensity per decay
                   1.1%/0.2%
           (ERR-5) Detector efficiency 5%,
                                including ERR-S given in Subents.
           (MONIT-ERR)  2% uncertainty in the 27Al(n,alpha)24Na
                        cross section
           .The value of the counting statistics uncertainty
            is 41.5% for the 9.5-MeV run, owing to the low beam
            current and shorter than desired irradiation, leading
            to a total cross-section uncertainty of 42.4%.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for:
             * contribution of background 'parasitic' neutrons;
             * self-absorption effects
             * target geometry
