FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) GELINA at IRMM .
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Electrons hits a mercury cooled uranium target
           and Bremsstrahlung is produced.
           (PHOTO) Consequently neutrons with energies of a few
           MeV are created by (gamma,xn)-reactions and
           photofission.
           Two beryllium containers,filled with water, mounted
           above and below the neutron production target, are used
           as moderator.
SAMPLE     Sol-gel technique was used for sample preparation.
           In approximately 3 g of Y2O3, which was used as the
           sol-gel matrix, approximately 320 mg of Am was infused.
           Much higher degree of homogeneity will be achieved with
           such a sample type.
METHOD     Background was estimated using the black resonance
           technique (Ag, Co and Na filters).
           (TOF) Flight path length was calibrated using the
           energy of the 6.674 eV resonance of U-238 resonance
           as given in ENDF/B-VII evaluated data file.
           Effective flight path length of (26.444+-0.006) m.
          1(TRN) Transmission measurement.
            - Flight path 2 of GELINA, moderator at an angle of
           9 degrees with its normal, flight path length 26.45m.
           Beam diameter approximately 2 cm, using combination of
           lithium-carbonate, copper and nickel collimators.
           Sample was positioned at a distance of approximately
           10 m from the neutron source.
           (COINC) To separate a valid neutron event from the
           photomultiplier noise, coincidence between the signals
           of both tubes was imposed.
           Time resolution of 0.5 ns.
           Measurements of the sample and open beam were cycled
           every 20 minutes.
          2      Capture measurement.
           -Flight path length of 10 m with the beam diameter at
           the sample station approximately 75 mm using lithium-
           carbonate plus resin, copper and lead collimators.
           Pulse height weighing technique was used to create
           detector response proportional to the energy of the
           registered gammas.
           Am sample was shielded from the detectors by cylinder
           of inner diameter approximately 13 cm, length 20 cm,
           thickness of approximately 1 cm, produced of antimony
           free lead.
DETECTOR   Neutron energy dependence of the resolution function
           was determined in a Monte Carlo simulation of the
           spectrometer setup.
           (BF3) Neutron flux is monitored by BF3 counters .
          1(GLASD) 1.27 cm thick lithium-glass scintillator with
           diameter of approximately 10 cm viewed by two
           photomultiplier tubes EMI9823QKB - for neutron
           detection.
          2(SCIN) Two cylindrical C6D6 detectors (NE230), mounted
           at an angle of 125degrees directly on quartz-windowed
           photomultipliers.
ANALYSIS   The software code AGS (Analysis of Geel Spectra,
           C. Bastian+. Physor-2006, ANS Topical Meeting on
           Reactor Physics, Vancouver, Canada,2006, paper C013,
           was used to derive the transmission and the capture
           yields from the registered data.
CORRECTION Dead-time correction, background subtraction and other
           by AGS code (see ANALYSIS).
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data.
