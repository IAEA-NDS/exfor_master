FACILITY   (VDGT,2GRCATH) The 5.5 MV Van de Graaff tandem
           accelerator of NCSR DEMOKRITOS.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)  D2 gas target, deuteron beams with currents
           about 1-2 microA.
INC-SPECT   The quasimonoenergetic neutron beams were produced
           with a neutron flux of about (2-4)x10**6 n/cm**2/sec.
           The average effective flux on each sample was obtained
           by taking the mean of the calculated flux values for
           the front and back Al foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The activation measurements involved continuous
           irradiation of the samples for about 48 h at each
           neutron beam energy.
           (STTA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two (80% and 85% relative efficiency) HPGe
           detectors.
           The absolute efficiency of the detectors was obtained
           using a calibrated 152Eu source placed at the same
           distance as the samples. Calibrated monoenergetic
           sources 54Mn, 60Co, 56Co, 137Cs, 22Na were used at
           distances of 28 and 7 cm from the detector front to
           correct the 152Eu efficiency for summing effects, which
           did not exceed 6%.
           The detectors were shielded with lead blocks covered
           by Cd.
           (BF3)  BF3-counter for neutron beam flux variation
           monitoring during irradiation, place at 3m from neutron
           source.

CORRECTION  For self-absorption and counting geometry of the
           emitted gamma rays in the activated sample using the
           code MCNP4C, were found to be 35% in the case of
           Egamma=123 keV and 5% for Egamma=343 keV.
            For coincidence summing effects.
            For the decay of the product nuclide during the
           irradiation and the counting collection time.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Data are compared  with EMPIRE-II and TALYS
                  calculations.
ERR-ANALYS Considered errors :
           - in the determination of the efficiency of the HPGe
           detector,
           - statistical errors of the photopeak areas,
           - errors in the emission probabilities and the
           determination of the target masses,
           - the errors in the reference reactions cross
           sections.
           -The error of the neutron-beam energy was determined by
           considering the kinematics of the d-d reaction, the
           actual size and material of the cell window, the
           pressure of the gas cell, the distance of the samples
           from the middle of the cell. It was found to be less
           than 0.1MeV.

           mixture of high  99.9% purity powder Hf-O(2) and C in
           concentrations 88% and 12%, respectively.
           Thin metallic targets of high-purity Hf with masses
           about 0.95 g of 1.3 cm diameter were also used for
           some of the measurements.
           Reference foils of high-purity Al, Nb, Au (of the same
           diameter as the Hf target) were placed in the front and
           the back of the target.
           Samples were stacked together in an aluminum  holder at
           0 deg with respect to the beam direction, at distances
           from 7 to 12 cm from the end of the deuterium gas cell.
           After the irradiation, the samples were placed 7cm from
           the window of two HPGe detectors.
