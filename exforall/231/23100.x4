FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) High flux reactor of Laue-Langevin
             Institute in Grenoble.
             MINI-INCA chamber.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) H9 irradiation channel allows for 4-PI
            irradiation geometry.
INC-SPECT   Highly thermalized neutron flux. Estimated epithermal
            to thermal ratio of 0.0021 in Westcott convention.
           Neutron density was quite constant in irradiation area.
           Deduced neutron flux (6.57+-0.15)*10**14 n/cm**2/s,
           main uncertainty is attributed to the uncertainty of
           initial quantity of Co-59 (=<2%).

SAMPLE     Np-237 sample was electrodeposited by molecular plating
           technique on 12 mm diameter Ni foil of 4 microm
           thickness in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Deposit
           area - circle of 6 mm diameter. Mounted on Ti holder
           together with 6 mm diameter Al foil containing 1% (in
           mass) of Co-59 for neutron flux measurement. Distance
           between Np-237 target and Co-59 monitor - 35 mm.
           backing, irradiated 2 hours in H9 channel.
           Isotopic composition of Np-237 sample:
           Np-237 - 99.7574 %, Pu-238 - 0.00135 %,
           Pu-239 - 0.1218 %, Pu-240 - 0.10635 %,
           Cm-243 - 0.0083 %, Cm-244 - 0.0048 %.
           Np-237 activity (370.3 +- 3.7) Bq was determined
           relative to Cm-244 calibration source from
           Radioactivity Standards Lab. of CERCA; the activity
           was certified to be known with one-sigma
           uncertainty of 0.7% for Cm-244 alpha-source.
           Using nuclear parameters the number of Np-237 atoms was
           deduced to be (3.612+-0.036)*10**6 corresponding
           to mass of (14.21+- 0.14) microg.
           Np-237 and Co-59 samples were irradiated for 2.733 h in
           so-called diaphragm position of Lohengrin spectrometer
           (H9 channel)

DETECTOR   (SPEC,HPGE,IMPSI) Lohengrin mass spectrometer,equipped
            with high purity germanium detector with intrinsic
            efficiency of 9.98 %, energy resolution of 1.7 keV at
            1173 keV; passive implanted planar silicon detector
            with energy resolution 17 keV for 5.5 MeV alpha-rays.
METHOD     (ASPEC) Composition of Np-237 sample and quantity of
           Np-237 atoms were determined by alpha-spectroscopy
           prior to irradiation by using Mini-INCA chamber.
           (GSPEC) Alpha- and gamma- spectroscopy to analyze
            samples after about half an hour after irradiation.
            Measurements were made 2-3 days after the end of
            irradiation.
ANALYSIS   The photopeak activities were determined from
           multi-peak chi-square minimization procedure, each
           peak being modeled by Gaussian function added to an
           exponential background. Final errors of gamma
           activities contained the errors of fit and errors on
           photopeak efficiency.

           Absolute gamma-ray emission probabilities from Np-238
           were determined in reference to the measured
           alpha-activities of Pu-238.
           Ratio of measured gamma-activities of Np-238 over the
           alpha-activity of Pu-238 was used to deduce gamma-ray
           intensities by fitting
