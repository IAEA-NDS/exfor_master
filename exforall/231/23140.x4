ANALYSIS   TOF spectrum owing to the Pd-105(n,gamma) reaction was
           carefully extracted by gating on 512-keV ground-state
           transition gamma-ray in the pulse-height spectrum of
           Pd-107.
CORRECTION For dead time - correction factor was obtained by using
           the random pulse generator.
           For self-shielding and multi-scattering effects by
           the Monte Carlo simulation code MCNP.

           Energy dependence of neutron flux at the irradiation
           position was measured with the 10B(n,a)7Li reaction.
           TOF spectrum related to the neutron flux was derived
           by gating on the 478-keV gamma-ray emitted through the
           10B(n,a)7Li reaction. Neutron flux was deduced from the
           gated TOF spectrum and the neuron-capture cross
           sections of B-10 in JENDL-3.

ANALYSIS   Relative neutron capture cross sections of Pd-105
           were derived from the neutron flux and the net TOF
           spectrum. Relative cross sections were normalized to
           the value of JENDL-3.3 at 1 eV.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data on Fig.8 of J,KPS,(1295),2011.
            Preliminary results - some contributions of
           impurities, Pd-108 and Pd-107, remain in the energy
           region of several eV, it is necessary to examine how to
           reject the contributions.

ANALYSIS    To derive the relative neutron-capture cross sections
           of Pd-107, net TOF component of Pd-107 was extracted
           simply by subtracting the TOF spectrum of Pd-105 from
           TOF spectrum obtained with the 107Pd sample.
           Then the relative cross sections were normalized at
           the third resonance peak with the value of JENDL-3.3.
REL-REF    (A,14133002,S.Nakamura+,J,NST,44,103,2007)
           These data agree with lower limit (9.16 +- 0.27 b) of
           the thermal-neutron capture cross section from
           J,NST,44,103,2007.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. C-S value of REL-REF is given in
           J,KPS,(1295),2011 as 9.6 b by misprint, correct value
           as given in REL-REF - 9.16 b.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data on Fig.9 of J,KPS,(1295),2011.
           Some contributions due to other Pd isotopes (e.g.108Pd)
           remain in the resonance region, because it was
           difficult to get rid of contributions due to the
           impurities by the simple subtraction done in the
           present study.
           There is a possibility that the thermal c-s would be
           about five times large compared with the evaluated one
           of JENDL-3.3 - 2.007 b.
