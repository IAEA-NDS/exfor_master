           Beam line No 4 - BL04.
           37.5 mm Pb filter was placed to suppress the gamma
           flash.
            Beam size was collimated to 3 mm diameter at the
           sample position with a rotary collimator.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)
DETECTOR   (D4PI,GE,BGO) 4Pi Ge spectrometer: two cluster-Ge
           detectors and BGO compton suppression detectors.
METHOD     (TOF) TOF spectra of Pd - 105, 106, 107, 108 were
           measured.

           consultancy Group (NRG), Netherlands; was reanalyzed in
           detail by a mass spectroscopy at the Kyoto University
           Research Reactor Institute.
           Pd-107 sample - pellet of 137.37 mg weight, 4.523 mm
           diameter, 0.917 mm thickness; was packed in an Al
           container of 229.76 mg weight, 9.077 mm diameter,
           1.86 mm thickness.
           Another Al container - for background.
           Pd samples were set at the position of 21.5m from the
           MLF neutron source with a 120-kW power (25 Hz).
PART-DET   (G) Gamma-rays from neutron capture.
CORRECTION For dead time - correction factor was obtained by using
           the random pulse generator.
           For self-shielding and multi-scattering effects by
           the Monte Carlo simulation code MCNP.
MONITOR   1(5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)
           The TOF spectrum corresponding to the flux of neutrons
           was derived by gating on the 478-keV gamma ray emitted
           through the 10B(n, a g)7Li reaction.
          2(5-B-10(N,G)5-B-11,,SIG)
           Neutron flux was deduced from the  gated TOF spectrum
           and the neuron-capture cross sections of B-10 in
           JENDL-3.3.

           of weights 52.7 mg and 34.7 mg, respectively.
ANALYSIS   TOF spectrum owing to the Pd-105(n,gamma) reaction was
           carefully extracted by gating on 512-keV ground-state
           transition gamma-ray in the pulse-height spectrum of
           Pd-107.
           Relative neutron capture cross sections of Pd-105
           were derived from the neutron flux and the net TOF
           spectrum. Relative cross sections were normalized to
           the value of JENDL-3.3 at 1 eV.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data on Fig.8 of J,KPS,(1295),2011.
            Preliminary results - some contributions of
           impurities, Pd-108 and Pd-107, remain in the energy
           region of several eV, it is necessary to examine how to
           reject the contributions.

ANALYSIS    To derive the relative neutron-capture cross sections
           of Pd-107, net TOF component of Pd-107 was extracted
           simply by subtracting the TOF spectrum of Pd-105 from
           TOF spectrum obtained with the 107Pd sample.
           Then the relative cross sections were normalized at
           the third resonance peak with the value of JENDL-3.3.
REL-REF    (A,14133002,S.Nakamura+,J,NST,44,103,2007)
           These data agree with lower limit (9.16 +- 0.27 b) of
           the thermal-neutron capture cross section from
           J,NST,44,103,2007.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. C-S value of REL-REF is given in
           J,KPS,(1295),2011 as 9.6 b by misprint, correct value
           as given in REL-REF - 9.16 b.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data on Fig.9 of J,KPS,(1295),2011.
           Some contributions due to other Pd isotopes (e.g.108Pd)
           remain in the resonance region, because it was
           difficult to get rid of contributions due to the
           impurities by the simple subtraction done in the
           present study.
           There is a possibility that the thermal c-s would be
           about five times large compared with the evaluated one
           of JENDL-3.3 - 2.007 b.

SAMPLE     Pd-107 sample isotope abundance (%):
           Pd-102 - 0.0, Pd-104 - 1.6+-0.4, Pd-105 - 48.8+-0.8,
           Pd-106 - 23.1+-0.3, Pd-107 - 15.3+-0.4,
           Pd-108 - 8.7+-0.3, Pd-109 - 2.6+-0.3.
ANALYSIS    The neutron capture cross sections involving the
           contributions of both 107Pd and other Pd isotopes were
           derived in the energy range from 0.01 eV to 300 eV from
           the obtained TOF spectra relative to the cross sections
           of 10B. The relative cross sections were normalized to
           the values calculated by the SAMMY code with JENDL-4.0
           at the three energy points: 6.8 eV of 107Pd, 11.8 eV of
           105Pd, and 33 eV of 108Pd.
           The cross sections of 107Pd in the low energy region
           were derived as follows:
           - the cross sections of Pd isotopes except for 107Pd
           were calculated with the resonance parameters in
           JENDL-4.0,
           - the cross-section components for those Pd isotopes
           were subtracted from the result for sample,
           - the remained components were divided by the abundance
           of 107Pd in the sample.
REL-REF    (A,14133002,S.Nakamura+,J,NST,44,103,2007)
           The obtained cross-section curve in the thermal energy
           region supports the previous result.
STATUS     (PRELM)
           On Fig.2 of S,JAEA-C-2012-001,159,2012 - capture c-s
           for sample, energy range from 1 to 100 eV.

            Request for the data was not send, because data of c-s
           are still preliminary, "in near future, final result

COMMENT    Of authors.
           The value in JENDL-4.0 is 0.01 meV, which is about five
           times larger than the present result.
           We found that both the 3.9-eV and 5.2-eV resonances do
           not belong to 107Pd.
