                Main reference.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2ZZZGEL) GELINA neutron facility of IRMM, Geel.
           Repetition frequency of the accelerator 800 Hz.
INC-SOURCE (BRST,PHOTO) Pulsed, compressed electron beam hits
           rotating U target, producing bremsstrahlung gamma rays,
           created neutrons via (gamma,n) and (gamma,f) reactions.
           Neutrons are then moderated in 4 cm thick water-filled
           beryllium containers.
           Cadmium filter is placed in front of the chamber to
           remove overlapping neutrons from previous bursts.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two surface barrier detectors to detect
           fission fragments from Cm and alphas from monitor.
METHOD     (TOF) Length of the flight path is 9.3 m.
           Incident neutron energy was determined by TOF.
            Two runs:
           -With highly enriched U-235 sample - to determine the
           detection geometry factors on both sides and to check
           if the U-235(n,f) cross section can be reproduced.
           Gave confidence in the good functioning of exp. setup.
           -With Cm sample at the same detection geometry.
           -To remove spontaneous fission contributions,
           additional run with the beam closed was performed using
           a pulse generator. Background measurement on the boron
           side was done with the black resonances filters of Rh,
           Au, Mn, W, Co.

           Request for the data was sent 10.11.2010 to O.Serot.

SAMPLE     Curium oxide sample of 50 microg/cm**2 thickness,active
           diameter 15 mm was mounted in the centre of a vacuum
           chamber, back-to-back with B-10 layer.
           Isotopic composition in March 2003 : Cm-245 - 98.48%,
           Cm-244 - 1.11%, Cm-246 - 0.405%, Cm-247 - 0.008%,
           Cm-248 - 0.002%.
REL-REF    (A,,J.C.Brown+,J,NSE,65,166,1978)
            The energy resolution was improve between 10 and 20 eV
            compared to Browne's measurement.
           (A,,M.S.Moore+,J,PR/C,3,1656,1971)
            Nice agreement with Moore's measurement.
ADD-RES     New set of resonance parameters will be determined in
           near future. Resolved resonance energy region (ends at
           100 eV in Maslov's evaluation (adopted by JEFF3.1,
           ENDF/B-VII.O, JENDL 3.3) can be probably extended.
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary result.
