FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) Z59 irradiation channel (B-side) of the
           BR1 reactor at SCK CEN - graphite-moderated air-cooled
           system, using natU as fuel. Power of 700 kW.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beam of diameter of 2 cm.
INC-SPECT  Measured thermal neutron flux at the 243Cm sample
           position was 6E+5 cm**-2/sec.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)
             For neutron flux monitoring.
PART-DET   (FF,A)
DETECTOR   (IMPSI) 50-mm-diam charged particle detector of
           passivated implanted planar silicon PIPS type,
           positioned in the beam at 8.3 cm from the 243Cm sample;
           for FF detection in solid angle of about 0.27 sr.
           Alpha particles emitted in the B-10(n,a) reactions were
           detected with a 12-mm diam. PIPS detector positioned
           outside the beam at 4.5 cm from the 10B sample.

SAMPLE     - 94.65% enriched 243Cm-oxide sample containing
           2.320 +- 0.025 microg of 243Cm.

            239Pu 7.89E+13 atoms .
           - U sample with a mass of 193.29+-1.33 microg, 99.94%
           enrichment in 235U.
           (92-U-233,ENR=0.00001) 4.99E+12 atoms

           (92-U-238,ENR=0.00013) 6.36E+13 atoms
             (number of atoms at time of measurement).
           Cm and U samples were produced by vacuum deposition of
           fissile material on identical aluminum backings of
           20-microm thickness and 70-mm diameter, fixed in
           identical aluminum frames and with a spot size of 15-mm
           diameter.
           - B-10 sample - to monitor neutron beam by (n,alpha) -
           46 +- 4 microg 10B/cm**2 .
ANALYSIS   For obtaining the cross section of the 243Cm(n,f)
           the relation was used:
           Y=e*F*SUM(Gi*Ni*SIGi), where
           Y - count rate,
           e - detection efficiency,
           F - neutron flux,
           Gi - Westcott g-factor,
           Ni - number of atoms,
           SIGi - fission c-s at 25.3 eV
              for i-th isotope considered, i from 1 to 7 for Cm.
           The fission count rate measured with the 235U sample
           can be expressed in similar way and the factor e*F can
           be determined.

CORRECTION Contributions from spontaneous fission are negligible,
           what was checked when the reactor was shut down.
           Contributions from the epithermal component of the beam
           were also estimated by filtering the beam with a
           1-mm-thick Cd foil, provided a cutoff energy of 0.55eV.
           The recorded fission spectrum amounts to 3.16% of the
           spectrum recorded without the cadmium filter.
