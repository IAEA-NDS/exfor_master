FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)  K-130 cyclotron at Department of
           Physics, Jyvaeskylae, Finland.
           Transport system was used to move the target from the
           irradiation to measurement position.
INC-SOURCE (D-C12) Neutrons produced via d+C-12 reaction.
            40 MeV deuterons.Carbon powder.
INC-SPECT   Broad neutron spectrum at 11 deg angle is presented
           on Fig.1 of J,NIM/A698,224,2013.
           The neutron conversion factor for the target in the
           geometry of the experiment was taken as
            (0.21+-0.003)*10**-2 neutron per deuteron (n/d).
            Thermal neutrons contribution measured by
           In-115(n,g)In-116 reaction was 1.6E-7 n/d (1.0*10**-7
           fraction of the fast neutron flux)- low enough
           with respect to the fast-neutron flux to state that
           fissions induced on 235U represented a negligible
           contribution to the total.
           Average energy of neutron spectrum 12.7 MeV.
SAMPLE     Uranium targets are metal disks of 12mm diameter, 0.5mm
           thick. Placed at 34 +-2 mm from entrance window of
           carbon target.
DETECTOR   (GE) Two Clover detectors complete with their
           Compton-suppression shields were placed at 12cm from
           the geometric center of the uranium target.
           The detectors have an average resolution (FWHM) at
           1.332MeV of 2.3-2.7 keV per detector crystal and the
           peak-to-total ratio after add-back is 43%.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (ACTIV) 1.3*10**4 cycles consisting of 5s irradiation,
           1.2s target transport, 25s counting and another
           transport.Six identical targets were placed on the
           transport chain .
           Neutron spectrum was measured by activation of
           Al,Ni,In,Bi foils.
CORRECTION For finite dimensions of U target.
           Due to U disk volume and self-absorption.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F)50-SN-132,,SIG,,SPA)
           Independent c-s for Sn-132 production.
REL-REF    (D,22723001,G.Lhersonneau+,J,EPJ/A,9,385,2000)
           Higher than calculated from experiment at IGISOL
           separator - 2.28 mb.
           (D,,T.R.England+,R,LA-UR-94-31006,1993)
           Somewhat lower than 5.34 mb .
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Includes the sole uncertainties due to input
           decay spectroscopy data and counting statistics.
           In addition,the measurement has :
           - hard-core error of 15% due to various scaling factors
           independent of the nucleus measured. The main
           contributions are :
           (ERR-1) - the neutron flux(14%),
           (ERR-2) - the Ge-efficiency(5%).
           (ERR-3,,2.)Calibration of the current integrator (<2%)
           does not play a part since the cross-section is
           directly calculated from the number of neutrons.
           (ERR-4,,0.1) Uncertainty of foil weight < 0.1%.
           (ERR-T) The final error 19%.
