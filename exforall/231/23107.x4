ANALYSIS          Comparing the peak areas of Ge-75 decay with
            reference gold peak , the c-s were obtained relative
            to Au c-s using exp. peak areas accounting for the
            emission probability, detector efficiency, neutron
            self-shielding, gamma-ray attenuation in target, decay
            during the waiting period. 1/v low for Au and Ge c-s
            was supposed.
CORRECTION For nuclei decayed during irradiation.

            target, 0.978 for gold foil.

           -Correcting for the feeding from isomeric state by IT
           direct c-s was derived. Correction includes the delay
           of the feeding (HL=47.7 s)  and nuclei in ground state
           decaying during activation. Correction was applied to
           the number of activated nuclei rather than to the
           resulting c-s.
            Peak area was corrected for contribution ( about 0.2%)
            from decay of Ge-77 for 264.6 keV gamma.

           Second sample of 435.7mg of GeO2 powder depleted in
           76Ge - to identify peaks resulting from neutron capture
           by 74Ge.
           Isotopic abundances of the samples in percent:
           Enriched: sum of 70Ge, 72Ge, 73Ge - 0.3, 74Ge - 12.7,

           An empty target consisting only of the FEP bag (70mg)
           was irradiated for background determination.
METHOD     (COINC) For the reconstruction of the level schemes,
           coincidence measurement was performed.
           An energy calibration, corrected for nonlinearity was
           achieved using the numerous background peaks of 19F in
           the spectrum of the empty target. The detection
           efficiency calibration was performed by utilizing the
           decay radiation of 60Co, 133Ba, 152Eu sources placed at
           the target position and prompt gamma rays produced by
           neutron irradiation of N, Cl and Cr.
ANALYSIS   Transitions in the germanium isotopes were identified
           by comparing the spectra of the enriched, the depleted
           and the empty targets taken in the singles mode.
           The relative intensities of the peaks were extracted
           from the singles spectra recorded.
           From the coincidence measurement two lines close to
           444 keV were identified.

COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           In Table A.2 of J,EPJ/A,48,20,2012 for Egamma=647.67keV
           coincident transitions is given as 25. keV - looks as
           misprint, there is no such transition 25 keV in Table.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
           Uncertainty of the measured gamma-ray energy contains a
           systematic contribution of 0.10 keV for the energy
           calibration added quadratically to the statistical one
           which came from the fit after background correction.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Decay scheme was reconstructed for 68 prompt
           transitions.
           Considering the recoil correction the neutron binding
           energy was determined to be (6505.84 +-0.05) keV.
