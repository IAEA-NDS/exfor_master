INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Cold neutron beam of mean energy 1.8 meV , flux
           2.9E+9 n/(cm**2*sec) .
SAMPLE     GeO2 powder as target material, isotopically depleted
           in Ge-76 (about 0.6% Ge-76, 38.3% Ge-74). Pressed into
           pill-shaped targets of 12 mm diameter.
           Gold foil of the same diameter to monitor neutron flux
           at target position. Irradiated together.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) From S.F.Mughabghab,

            Half-life error 0.00021 d, intensity error 0.0012.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Comparing the peak areas of Ge-75 decay with
            reference gold peak , the c-s were obtained relative
            to Au c-s using exp. peak areas accounting for the
            emission probability, detector efficiency, neutron
            self-shielding, gamma-ray attenuation in target, decay
            during the waiting period. 1/v low for Au and Ge c-s
            was supposed.
CORRECTION For nuclei decayed during irradiation.
           For self-absorption - correction factors 0.999 for Ge
            target, 0.978 for gold foil.
           Contribution from the target inhomogeneity was
           estimated from the mass inhomogeneity folded by
           the beam distribution.
