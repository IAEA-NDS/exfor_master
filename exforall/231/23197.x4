METHOD     (TOF) To separate prompt fission gamma rays from
           neutron induced gamma ray - TOF method was employed.
           Time resolution < 1.5 nsec.
           Intrinsic peak efficiency of detectors :
           both lanthanide-bromide detectors are about twice as
           good both lanthanide-bromide detectors are about twice
           as good as a 1.5 inch x 1.5 inch NaI detector but only
           around two thirds as good as a 1.5 inch x 1.5 inch BGO
           detector. For the exp. determination of the intrinsic
           peak efficiency also 241Am (Egamma 60 keV) and reaction
           241Am(a,n)9Be (Egamma 4.4 MeV) were used; also Monte
           Carlo simulations with the code PENELOPE was performed.
           Integral response functions were obtained by simulating
           the response of 220 different energies using the Monte
           Carlo code PENELOPE and folded with the experimentally
           found energy resolution.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Simplified ionization chamber loaded with 252Cf
           source as fission trigger.Operated with P10 gas(mixture
           of 90% Ar + 10% CH4, at p = 1.2 bars).

EXP-YEAR   (2012)
SAMPLE     Cf was deposited on a polished stainless steel disk
           with a 25-mm diameter. The source distributed on a
           10mm-diameter spot had activity of 8600+-100 fiss/s .
