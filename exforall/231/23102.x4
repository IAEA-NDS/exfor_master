FACILITY  1(CYCLO,2SWTPSI) PSI multi-user accelerator facility,
            590 MeV PSI ring cyclotron, power > 1.2MW.
          2(CHOPS,2FR ILL) Very slow neutrons from turbine at ILL
           pass through a chopper operating at duty cycle of 5.5%
           and frequency of 0.81 Hz.
           Experiment was designed and built at PSI.
           The data acquisition took place at ILL.
INC-SOURCE1(SPALL)Spallation target made of lead-filled Zircaloy
           tubes. Proton beam is pulsed with the duty cycle 1%,
           for 8 sec every 800 sec. Spallation neutron are
           thermalyzed in 3.5 m**3 heavy water (purity 99.75%).
           In the center of heavy water volume , the cold UCN
           converter at 5 K temperature is installed, consisted of
           a vessel filled with solid deuterium(purity 99.95%).
INC-SPECT 1 Thermalyzed spallation neutrons can be downscattered
           into ultracold and very cold neutron range
            (E-kin <500 neV) by phonon excitation. Neutrons leave
           the cold converter,pass through the thin material of
           the top lid, then slowed down by gravity from 5 - 9 m/s
           to 0 - 7 m/s, and become storable in the about 2 m**3
           UCN storage volume of 2.5 m high.
          2 Very slow neutrons of 3-20 m/sec.
METHOD    2(TRN,TOF) Transmission of very slow neutrons (3-20 m/s)
             was measured by time-of-flight method.
           Flight path 2.270 m. TOF spectra were measured with and
           without sample.TOF system was calibrated by recording
           TOF spectra of foil at two different flight paths.
SAMPLE     Samples of different material and thickness(0.01-1 mm).
           Sample holder at 2.220 m distance from the chopper.
           Surface roughness of the samples was not quantified.
DETECTOR    Neutron detector was installed closely behind sample,
            about 50 mm distance.
ANALYSIS    Experimental values for the total cross-sections were
           extracted from fits of transmission data with
           exponentials.
ADD-RES     Spherically shaped samples (Zircaloy and AlMg3) were
           used to investigate UCN transmission through the
           dome-like structure. Transmission probability decreases
           with increasing dome height.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty, including statistical
           uncertainty, uncertainty from calibration, uncertainty
           of flight path.
           Defined as 1.009*(statistical uncertainty).
