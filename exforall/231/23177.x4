INC-SPECT   The effective energy of incident neutron at each
           irradiation position has been previously determined by
           the ratio of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+,1982)
           and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway,1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis and
           Zieba, 1980) and are given in detail in Subasi+,1996.
           Effective average neutron flux at the sample position
           was determined by measuring the activity induced via
            27Al(n,a)24-Na monitor reaction.
           At the irradiation place (70 mm from neutron source)
           the neutron fluxes are ranged from 1E+7 to 6.E+7
           n/cm**2/s, depending on neutron target condition.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,,3,JENDL-4.0,,2010) Cross sections in the same
           neutron energies were obtained by polynomial fit to
           JENDL-4.0 data file.
DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,14.951HR,DG,1368.63,1.00)
SAMPLE      Thorium foils of 99.885% purity, 12.7 mm diameter,
           0.0508 mm thickness, about 0.085 g weight were placed
           on a thin aluminum frame fixed on the target holder
           inclined at the angle of 45deg.
           Thorium foil in each position was sandwiched between
           two Al monitor foils of 1 mm thickness.
            Isotopic abundances 100%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The angles of irradiation positions to the
           deuteron beam were 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 130 deg, which
           covered the neutron energies 14.83, 14.75, 14.52,
           14.15, 13.75, 13.57 MeV, respectively.
           Irradiation time 1 hr.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) During irradiation, the neutron flux was
           monitored with plastic scintillation detector NE102A,
           placed under the neutron-producing target.
           (HPGE) Gamma activities induced in the Al and Th foils
           were measured by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer
           with HpGe detector ORTEC GMX10180, 0.60 keV FWHM at
           5.9 keV, 1.80 keV FWHM at 1333 keV.
           Acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front of
           the detector to block the beta particles from samples.
CORRECTION Self-absorption of gamma ray in the foils, attenuation
           of the gamma rays in beta absorber, random coincidences
           of the gamma peaks, dead time, fluctuations of neutron
           flux during irradiation and contributions from low
           energy neutrons (about 17%).
           Measured activities are corrected for self absorption
           of gamma rays as 4%, 83% (757.2 cm**-11, linear
           attenuation coefficient of photon energy with 25.64 keV
           for Th foils) irradiated Al and Th foils respectively.
ANALYSIS          Full energy peak (FEP) areas were collected
           until a required uncertainty (1% to 2%) for the
           gamma-ray peaks of interest.
           The gamma peaks areas were evaluated by using the
           SAMPO90 program.
