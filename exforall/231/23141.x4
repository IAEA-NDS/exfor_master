FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNJAE) The neutron-nucleus reaction instrument
            (NNRI) at the J-PARC MLF Beam Line No. 4 (BL04).
            Accelerator was operated in double-bunch mode at a
           beam power of 120 kW and a repetition rate of 25 Hz.
           Disk chopper with a semicircular shape was used to
           prevent the intrusion of the low-energy tail of neutron
           pulse into the next pulse duration.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight length 21.5 m.
           Disk chopper with semicircular shape was installed at
           flight length of 14 m to exclude the effect from
           overlapping neutrons.
           Data were measured with event-by-event mode storing the
           information of gamma-ray pulse height (PHA), TOF and
           time-interval between coincidence signals.
            Time resolution of DAQ system is 10 ns.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed neutron beam was collimated to diameter
           of 7 mm at the sample position. Proton energy 3 GeV,
           average beam power 120 kW, repetition rate 25 Hz.
           Proton intensity of shots was stable within 1% in FWHM.
INC-SPECT   Background level of neutrons was negligible.
           The obtained neutron flux is shown in Fig.2 of
           J,NST,47,(12),1097,2010.
           Energy-integrated neutron intensities at sample
           position are 4.5E+6 n/s/cm**2 in neutron energy range
           1.5-25 meV, 6.6E+5 n/s/cm**2 in 0.9-1.1 keV.
           The incident neutron flux shape was measured with
           sintered natural boron sample (8.67 mg).
DETECTOR   (D4PI,GE,BGO) 4Pi Ge spectrometer: two cluster-Ge
           detectors and eight coaxial Ge detectors surrounded by
           BGO anti-Compton shields. Set at a position 21.5m from
           the neutron source. To detect the prompt gamma-rays.
           In the present measurement only two cluster Ge
           detectors were used.
           To suppress the gamma-flash effect to the detector,
           Pb filter of 37.5 mm thickness was inserted into the
           flight path.
           The sample was set in Al beam duct. To decrease
           background scattering from N-14 and O-16, the duct was
           filled with He gas. Lithium hydride powder in Al
           containers, sheets of boron and rubber mixture, lead
           plates of 3 mm thickness were set between the beam duct
           and the cluster Ge detectors to protect scattered
           neutrons and decay gamma-rays from the high-activity
           Cm-244 sample. The detectors were covered with
           radiation shield of lead, iron, and boron resin.
           Gamma-ray signals from the 14 Ge crystals in the
           cluster Ge detectors were acquired using an original
           data acquisition (DAQ) system based on a digital data
           processing technique.
           Random pulse generator (Berkeley Nucleonics, DB-2) was
           used to estimate the dead time of detectors.
           The total efficiency of the 4PI Ge spectrometer for the
           entire energy region was less than 12%, as calculated
           using standard gamma-ray sources (Cs-137, Co-60) and
           the EGS5 Monte Carlo simulation code.
           The peak efficiency of 4PI Ge spectrometer is
            3.64+-0.11 % for 1.33-MeV gamma- rays.
           Typical resolution is 9.8 keV (on beam) and 2.4 keV
            (off beam) in FWHM for 1.33-MeV gamma-rays.
PART-DET   (G) Prompt gamma-rays.
ANALYSIS   The neutron energy was calibrated by measuring a Au
           sample with well-known neutron resonances.
           Detection efficiency of capture gamma-rays for each
           resonance was assumed to be constant.
CORRECTION For dead time - correction factor was obtained by using
           the random pulse generator.
           For self-shielding and multi-scattering effects by
           the Monte Carlo simulation code MCNP, was found to be
           negligible.
           For background - measurement with dummy sample 17 hr,
           only with sample holder - 10 hr.
MONITOR   1(5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)
           Energy dependence of neutron flux was estimated from
           the TOF spectrum gated at the 478 keV gamma-ray peak
           emitted from the 10B(n,alpha gamma)7Li reaction.

           Neutron capture cross sections of the above reaction
           were taken from JENDL-3.3.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty due to the difference in the energy
           distribution of capture gamma-rays for each neutron
           resonance, which contributes to the detection
           efficiency.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty due to dead-time correction.
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty due to multiplicity for the capture
             gamma-rays.
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematical uncertainty.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Comparison with JENDL-3.3 data.
           Ratios for En 85.96 and 96.12 eV are different from the
           evaluated values. In the former case, two resonances of
           85.96 (Cm-244C; foreground) and 84.62 eV (Cm-246;
           background) overlap in the TOF spectrum; these two
           resonance peaks are difficult to separate.In the latter
           case, 98.85 eV (248Cm; background) overlaps with the
           foreground.
