FACILITY   (SPECM,2FR ILL) Lohengrin mass spectrometer of the
           Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL).
EXP-YEAR   (2010)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor core.
INC-SPECT    Thermal neutron flux reaching 5E+14 neutron/cm2/s.
METHOD     (OLMS) Separation of ions according to their A/q and
           E/q values (with A, q, E - the mass,ionic charge state,
           kinetic energy of the ions, respectively). Since
           several nuclei can have the same A/q and E/q ratios,
           an ionization chamber with two anodes is used to
           further distinguish them.
           (GSPEC) Isotopic fission yields were determined by
           gamma spectrometry. The beta-decay of the fission
           products occurs after their flight path in the
           spectrometer (about 1 micros). The fission products are
           then implanted in a movable tape, the position of which
           is fixed for each single gamma measurement (about 30
           min).Two HPGe clover detectors are placed on each side
           of the tape to measure the gamma-decay.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Ionization chamber measures the fragment energy
           loss dE, deposited in the first part of the chamber,
           as well as the total energy E deposited in the whole
           chamber. Ionization chamber alone is used for the mass
           yield measurement.
           (HPGE) Setup with two HPGe clovers -  for the isotopic
           yields determination.
SAMPLE     Two different U3O8 targets for the mass yield
           measurement : about one per week due to the target
           burnup.
           The first one was 68 microg/cm2 thick with an 233U
           enrichment of 99.44 %, the second one 103 microg/cm2
           thick with an 233U enrichment of 99.92 %.
ANALYSIS   Count rate of a mass was obtained independently from
           its energy or charge.
CORRECTION For burnup - the "burnup" monitoring of the 233U target
           was obtained by periodically measuring the kinetic
           energy distribution of a given mass (136) at a fixed
           ionic charge (21) and normalization to one at the
           beginning of each measurement.

REACTION   (92-U-233(N,F)MASS,CHN,FY)
ANALYSIS   In symmetrical region authors measured from masses 105
           to 113 in light peak, and from 120 to 127 in the heavy
           peak. The measurements in the light region are
           normalized on the heavy peak ones, and thus constitute
           independent measurements, among which the masses 112,
           113 and 114 never measured this way. The results for
           heavy symmetrical region are not shown in this paper
           though, since they still need to be thoroughly analyzed
STATUS     (PRELM) Preliminary data.

ANALYSIS   Only the productions of 52Te, 53I and 54Xe can be
           estimated with our method, due to the long half-life of
           55Cs - about 30 years. Since we could measure only part
           of all the isotopes produced in the fission process, we
           chose to normalize our results to the sum of the three
           measured isotopes.By doing the same normalization on
           the JEFF-3.1.1 library data, we can then get an
           independent comparison of the isotopic productions for
           these three isotopes.
