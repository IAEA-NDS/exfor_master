FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)  GELINA - Geel linear accelerator at
            EC-JRC-IRMM. Frequency 800 Hz.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Pulsed electron beam of 100 MeV on
           depleted U target. Pulse duration 1 ns. Gamma flash is
           generated via bremsstrahlung. Neutrons are produced
           mainly by following gamma,n reaction.
           Collimated to 6.1 cm diameter at sample position.
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux at sample position is of order
           500 n/cm**2/s .
SAMPLE     Natural sample of 1.32 g/cm**2 .
DETECTOR   (HPGE) GAINS detection system(Gamma Array for Inelastic
           Neutron Scattering) consists of eight HPGe detectors
            (100% relative efficiency), placed at 110 and 150 deg
           with respect to the neutron beam. Distance between the
           center of the sample and the front side of each
           detector is of the order of 15 cm. Read-out by four
           DC440 Acquiris digitizers. Typical energy resolution of
           the large HPGe detectors read-out by the digitized
           acquisition if of the order of 2.5 keV (FWHM) and the
           time resolution is of the order of 8 ns.
           Efficiency of the HPGe detectors is experimentally
           determined using a calibrated Eu-152 source.
           (FISCH) Neutron beam is monitored using a 235U fission
           chamber. Precise determination of the absolute
           efficiency of the fission chamber is described in
           REL-REF of A.Plompen+.

CORRECTION  For the determination of the HPGe detector efficiency
           for the extended source taking into account the
           autoabsorption of the gammas in the sample and the
           geometrical effect;
           for the multiple scattering - of the order 5% at high
           energies and almost negligible below 5 - 6 MeV.

            At energies above about 6.5 MeV our result is lower
           than the evaluation. This is understandable based on
           the contribution of high-energy gamma rays that were
           not detected in measurement.
ANALYSIS   For the energy range above 6276 keV the total inelastic
           cross section represents only a lower limit: it is
           possible that gamma rays with higher energies feeding
           directly the ground state exist but they were not
           detected by our setup.

ANALYSIS     Level production cross section is precise for
           neutron incident energies lower than 6276 keV and
           represents upper limits above this value.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Compared with JEFF 3.1 data.
            Overlap with the evaluated cross section is good at
           low neutron energies while our method cannot account
           for the contribution coming from high energy gamma
           rays and therefore above about 9 MeV our value
           overestimates the cross section.
