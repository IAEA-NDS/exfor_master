METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)   Frisch-gridded fission chamber .
           (SCIN) Three NE213 scintillation detectors employing
           the pulse-shape discrimination technique for efficient
           neutron/gamma-ray separation were placed at 0, 30, 60
           degrees relative to the deuteron beam axis and 4.598 m
           away from the neutron source and used to measure energy
           distributions from the neutron source at En = 16, 19,
           20,21 MeV. Neutron spectra at 0degree, corrected for
           pulse-height dependent efficiency, were used for the
           neutron background correction and are shown in Fig.3
           of J,ANE,43,26,2012.
           The efficiency calibration of the neutron detectors was
           performed with a 252Cf spontaneous fission source (see
           REL-REF of N.Kornilov+).
SAMPLE      Pa-231 sample was obtained by means of spray-painting.
            Original diameter 28 mm was reduced by collimator to
            6 mm, effective mass determined by alpha-spectrometry
            53.4+-1.3 microgram.
            Np-237 sample of 28 mm diameter, mass 182.2 microgram
           +- 1.7%, isotopic purity 99.9 %, with negligible
           fractions of 238U and 238Pu of less than 2E-7 and 4E-8,
           respectively.
           Protactinium sample was mounted on one side of the
           chamber together with a well-characterized 237Np sample
           in back-to-back geometry.
           The distance between sample and neutron source - 60 mm.

            Efficiency calibration details.
CORRECTION Fraction of fission fragments,which are absorbed in the
           sample due to neutron momentum transfer - estimated
           particle leakage amounts to (2.4 +-0.6)% at En = 21MeV.
           Without any significant error (smaller than 1.5%)
           authors assume that, due to considerable energy loss in
           the target at large emission angles, about half of the
           events escape detection.
           For alpha-particles pile-up.
           For dead time - < 4.%.

INC-SOURCE (P-T) For reliability check of the experimental set-up,
           author switched from a deuteron beam to protons in
           order to produce neutrons with energies En = 1.95 and
           2.95 MeV. Practically the same fission cross-sections
           were measured as published by S.Oberstedt+(2005),
           which gives evidence for the reproducibility of present
           results.
