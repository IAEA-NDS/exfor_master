FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) N0 beam line.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectra measured by TOF at 0 and 30 degrees
           respective to the proton beam are on Fig.2 of
           J,NSTP,1,89,2011.
           Quasi-monoenergetic neutron spectrum was obtained by
           subtracting the spectrum at 30 degrees from the
           spectrum at 0 degrees.
DETECTOR  1(SCIN) Intensity and energy spectrum of source neutrons
           produced from the 7Li(p,n) reaction were measured by an
           NE213 liquid scintillator placed at 17.10 or 16.13 m
           Li-target at 0 or 30 degrees, respectively.
          2(HPGE) HPGe detector for gamma rays measurement
PART-DET  1(N)
          2(G)
SAMPLE     Samples were placed at 8.05 or 7.05 m from the lithium
           target at 0 or 30 degrees, were irradiated 26 hr or
           18 hr, respectively.
METHOD    1(TOF) For neutron beam.
          2(GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectrometry of irradiated samples.
           (ACTIV) Activation.
ANALYSIS   Activation reaction rates R were estimated by the peak
           counts of gamma-ray spectra, the peak efficiency of
           HPGe detector (calculated by EGS4 code), the self-
           absorption of gamma-rays in samples, the beam current
           fluctuation during irradiation.
           Cross-sections were estimates as:
           SIG=(R(0deg)- f*R(30deg))/F, where
           f- is correction factor,
           F- neutron fluence rate per beam current.
CORRECTION For self-absorption in sample by EGS4 code.
           f - correction in subtraction of neutron spectrum due
           to variation of distances :
           - 17.10 to 16.13m between Li-target and NE213,
           - 8.05 to 7.05m between Li-target and samples.
STATUS       (COREL,     001) Data of proton-induced reaction
           cross sections at Ep=300 MeV.
