FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Proton beam of 137 MeV (maximum energy 400 MeV,
           Proton-beam current 700 nA) was transported to lithium
           target (1.0 cm thickness) placed in beam-swinger magnet
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux is on Fig.1 of J,NSTP,1,20,2011.
           Peak of quasi-monoenergetic neutrons was observed
           around 134 MeV with FWHM of the peak 3.0 MeV, and the
           intensity 1.05*10**10 neutrons/sr/microC.
           Set of collimators was used.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Intensity and energy spectrum of source neutrons
           produced from the 7Li(p,n) reaction were measured by an
           NE213 liquid organic scintillator located in the 0.deg.
           direction and 15 m downstream from the target, with the
           TOF method.
           NE213 liquid organic scintillators of 12.7 cm diameter
           and 12.7 cm thickness were employed to detect the
           scattering neutrons at three angles 6., 8., 15. degrees
           with 560-, 500-, and 400-cm flight-paths, respectively.
           Thin plastic scintillators were mounted in front of the
           NE213 scintillators as veto detectors to tag the
           charged particles from the sample.Iron shadow blocks of
           60 cm along the beam axis, 100 cm horizontally
           orthogonal to the beam axis, and 20 cm in height
           centered on the beam .
           Detection efficiencies were calculated with the
           SCINFULQMD code.
           Proton beam current measured by the Faraday cup.
SAMPLE     Sample was set 10 m downstream from the lithium target.
           Cylindrical samples of natural carbon (5 cm diameter x
            5 cm length) were used.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight -path 15 m.
            Background was measured without sample.
           (PSD) Data on the pulse height, pulse shape, and TOF
           (PHD) were acquired event by event.
           Gamma-ray events were segregated from the neutron
           events by PSD.
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) By subtracting the background spectrum and
           cutting off the low-TOF channels corresponding to the
           inelastic events, the elastic scattering neutrons were
           extracted.
CORRECTION The cross sections were corrected by 4.0%, 5.0% and 10%
            at 6., 8., and 15. degrees, respectively, for
           contribution of low-excitation states of sample nucleus
           ,e.g. 2+ state at 4.44 MeV and 3- state at 9.64 MeV for
           carbon. Correction factors for this contribution were
           estimated by a coupled-channels calculation.

           Agreement with the UC Davis data at 127.5 MeV.
            ENDF/B-VII.0 agrees well with the experimental data
           in the forward angular region below 10 degrees in CM
           system, while JENDL/HE-2007 gives about 30% lower
           values. At angles over 10 degrees, ENDF/B-VII.0
           underestimates the experimental data, and JENDL/HE-2007
           agrees well.
STATUS     (UNOBT) Data are on Fig.5 of J,NSTP,1,20,2011.
