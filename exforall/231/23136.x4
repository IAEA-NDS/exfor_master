SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched metallic tungsten disks were part
           of the inventory of the ORNL isotope program.
           For each isotope identical metallic disks were used and
           combined in the experiment to obtain different sample
           thickness.

METHOD     (TOF)  Different flight path lengths and repetition
           rates.
          1(TRN) Transmission measurement.
            -1ns pulse width with a repetition rate of 800Hz.
           Neutron beam was collimated to a 4.5cm diameter at
           the sample position. Background as a function of TOF
           can be derived by the 'black resonance' technique.
            - Shorter flight path of 25m with a 50Hz repetition
           rate - at low neutron energy part.
          2      Capture measurement.
           -30m (flight path 15) and 60m (flight path 14), GELINA
           operating at 800Hz.
           Additional runs using a sample holder, an aluminum
           canning dummy and Pb-208 sample in the beam in order to
           determine the background originating from the sample
           holder and the scattered neutrons.Black resonance
           filters were placed in the beam for supplementary
           background control and B10 slab served as frame overlap
           filter.
           -In a third set of experiments the samples were
           positioned at flight path 5, at a distance of 10m from
           the neutron production target. Repetition rate of 50Hz
           focusing on the thermal energy range of the neutron
           spectrum.
           -To normalize the capture yield the data obtained for
           flight paths 14 and 15, several runs having natural
           iron samples in the neutron beam were performed. The
           1.15keV resonance in Fe-56 was used for normalization.
           Additional runs with natural iron and tungsten disks
           were performed. Silver samples were used for the 50Hz
           runs at flight path 5 and the normalization factor was
           deduced after applying the saturated resonance
           technique.
DETECTOR  1(GLASD) At 50m measuring station,neutrons were detected
           by 0.635-cm-thick Li-6-loaded glass scintillator,viewed
           by one photomultiplier placed outside of the neutron
           beam, at a distance of 49.33m .
          2(SCIN) In the first case two C6D6 detectors,
           for the longer distance four C6D6 are used to detect
           the capture gamma rays.
           (IOCH) At 80cm prior the detectors' array a B-10 loaded
           ionization chamber served as a flux monitor.
ANALYSIS   The software code AGS (Analysis of Geel Spectra,
           C. Bastian et al.. AGS, Computer Code for Uncertainty
           Propagation in time of flight Cross Section Data,
           Physor 2006, Vancouver, Canada,2006) was used to reduce
           the data.
