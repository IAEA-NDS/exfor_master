FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) Reactor JRR-3

SAMPLE      (48-CD-112,ENR=0.9827)
            (48-CD-114,ENR=0.0052)
            Two sets of enriched (98.27%) 112Cd foils
             (163.97 and 160.88 mg, ~0.2 mm thick, 9 mm x 9 mm),
             one set is with Cd cover and the other without Cd
             cover.
            Al-Co wires (61.7 and 54.8 mg, 0.475% Co).
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 20% relative to 3'x3' NaI detector efficiency
            and resolution of about 2.1 keV at 1.3 MeV.
           Efficiency curve was calibrated with standard sources
            of 152Eu and 133Ba sources.
           Distance between samples and end cap of HPGe detector
            was about 2 cm.
METHOD     Cadmium-difference method.
           (ACTIV) Irradiated for 2 hours
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
CORRECTION Self-absorption correction factor for epithermal
            neutrons in the enriched 112Cd sample was taken to be
            0.49.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Overall uncertainties are 10%-20%, but 30% was
            chosen as the safety error because the uncertainty
            originated from the Cd-difference method is
            considered to be larger than the estimated overall
            uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) due to geometrical setup of target      (5%)
           (ERR-2) due to Cd absorber transmission factor (30%)

COMMENT    Takehito Hayakawa (2014-10-22):
            The uncertainty is printed as 0.3 mb instead of 0.4 mb
            in the abstract. Adopt 0.4 mb.
