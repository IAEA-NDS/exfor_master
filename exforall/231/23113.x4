FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE)  Reactor JRR-3
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons average flux 8.7E+13 1/cm**2/sec,
            evaluated by activated Al-Co wires.
SAMPLE      Two sets of Cd-112 foil enriched to 98.27%
            One set of samples was irradiated with cover of
            natural cadmium of 1 mm thickness, other - without Cd
            cover.
            Weights of Cd-112 foils were 163.97 mg and 160.88 mg
            with and without Cd cover, respectively.
            Thickness of Cd-112 foils was appropriately 0.2 mm,
            size about 9mm x 9 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation.
           (CADMB)  Cadmium difference method.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,NAICR) The gamma rays from activated samples were
            measured by a HPGe detector with low-background
            environment 8 and 14 months after irradiation.
            Efficiency of HPGe detector was about 20% relative to
            3 inch X 3 inch NaI detector.
            Energy resolution was approximately 2.1 keV for 1.3MeV
            gamma-ray.
            Efficiency curve was calibrated with standard sources
            of Eu-152 and Ba-133.
            Distance between samples and end cap of HPGe detector
            was about 2 cm.
