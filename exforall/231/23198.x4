FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  UCN facility PF2 of the ILL reactor.
           The apparatus consists of UCN spectrometer with valves
           for filling and emptying a neutron guide system, UCN
           detectors and a vacuum system.
           Spectrometer is a vertical cylinder with diameter 60cm,
           height 200 cm, made from copper with the inner surface
           coated by beryllium.
INC-SOURCE            The test beam of the UCN facility PF2.
INC-SPECT   Ultracold neutrons.
METHOD     Measuring UCN storage time at different gas pressure.
           Method was proposed in the articles:
