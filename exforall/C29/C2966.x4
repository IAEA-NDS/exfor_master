           Dame.
INC-SPECT  The proton laboratory energy range between Ep = 0.4
           and 1.4 MeV.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,BGO) The detector system consisted of a single,
           high efficiency (120% relative) , high purity,
           coaxial germanium detector(HPGe) surrounded by a
           bismuth germanate (BGO) shield for active Compton
           background suppression. The detectors were mounted on
           a rail system at an angle of 45 degree relative to
           the beam, which allowed the detector to be easily
           moved to different distances from the target in order
           to make summing correction measurements during the
           calibration as well as increase the efficiency
           throughout the resonance scans. In the following,
           "gclose geometry" and "gfar geometry" refer to the
           distances between target and end cap of the HPGe
           detector of 1 and 20 cm, respectively.
SAMPLE     For the present experiment, a new potassium target
           composition of K2WO4 was used with 99.5% purity and
           natural K abundance (93.258% 39K, 0.012% 40K, and
           6.730% 41K). The target material was evaporated onto
           tantalum backings of 0.3 mm thickness. Targets with
           two different thicknesses were used in the present
           experiment: (i) 100 microg/cm2 with an approximate
           energy loss of 25 keV at Ep = 600 keV to map out the
           resonances after they had been identified, either
           from previous direct measurements or from the present
           thick-target measurements, and (ii) 500 microg/cm2
           thick targets to investigate and explore resonances
           below Ep = 600 keV.
METHOD     The experiment was divided into three phases. First,
           the resonances above 600 keV were mapped out with a
           thin target. Second, long measurements on top of the
           respective thick target yield plateaus were performed
           in order to obtain precise measurements of the
           resonance strengths. Finally, thicker targets were
           used to search for new resonances in the region below
           600 keV using long irradiation times.
ANALYSIS   (SLA) The strengths of the observed resonances can be
           directly obtained from the on-resonance gamma-ray
           yield measured on top of the resonance yield curve
           Ymax. The resonance strength (omega gamma) results
           from the of the Breit-Wigner cross section over the
           target thickness or energy loss of the incident
           protons and is expressed by omega gamma=
            (2 Ymax e eff)/(lambdar**2 bgamma nu gamma) where
           where e eff is the stopping power of the protons in the
            target material, lambdar the de Broglie wavelength of
           the proton at the resonance energy, bgamma the
           branching ratio of the gamma-decay.
