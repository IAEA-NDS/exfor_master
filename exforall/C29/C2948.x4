FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) 10 MV TUNL FN tandem accelerator.
INC-SPECT  3He++ beam to an energy of 21 MeV with a mean
           intensity on target of 600 pnA.
DETECTOR   (SPEC,PROPC,SCIN) Reaction products entered the TUNL
           Enge split-pole magnetic spectrograph whose magnetic
           field was set at B = 0.81 T to focus reaction
           products into the detector's focal plane. The
           spectrograph was set at six different laboratory
           angles (thetalab = 9, 12, 20, 22, 25, and 27 degrees)
           and its entrance aperture subtended a solid angle
           with respect to the target of 1 msr for all angles. A
           position sensitive ionization chamber backed by a
           scintillator.
SAMPLE     The implanted 20Ne transmission targets used in the
           experiment were fabricated using an electron
           cyclotron resonance ion source to implant 20Ne at an
           energy of 25 keV directly into a 40+-4 microg/cm2
           thick carbon foil. The foil was mounted on a
           rectangular glass slide (3.7 cm x 2.5 cm) from which
           a total of four targets were obtained. Based on
           analysis using the software package SIMNRA, the
           targets were determined to consist of carbon, with a
           3.6+-0.4 microg/cm2 thick region of 20Ne, located
           close to the center, and a relatively thin 0.22+-0.02
           microg/cm2 thick 16O contamination layer located
           at the front.

REACTION   (10-NE-20(HE3,A)10-NE-19,PAR,DA)
METHOD     (EDE) The neutron pick-up reaction 20Ne(3He,4He)19Ne
           at a beam energy of 21 MeV was used to populate
           excited states in 19Ne. A position-sensitive focal
           plane detector was used to detect the outgoing
           reaction products that entered the spectrograph.
ANALYSIS   Alpha particles were selected by setting a software
           gate on the energy loss vs front position spectrum.
           Peak positions and intensities for the alpha-particle
           spectra at each angle were obtained by fitting
           Gaussian peaks with a linear function to describe the
           local background. The fitting was done using BayeSpec
           code. Given a fitting region, a model consisting of a
           linear background and a specified number of Gaussian
           peak shapes (all with common widths) is fit to the
           data. For all input parameters uninformative Gaussian
           priors are used with the starting values for
           positions and intensities obtained from the user
           input. This simultaneous fit to the data naturally
           accounts for any correlations between parameters, for
           example, background intensity and peak intensity. The
           result is a Gaussian fit to each of the peaks giving
           the mentioned parameters for every one of them. This
           is particularly useful to extract centroids and
           counts when two (or more) peaks are very close to
           each other, but within the resolution limit of the
           detector.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental uncertainties include the
           calibration uncertainty, energy loss uncertainty and
           statistical uncertainties from the peak fitting.

ANALYSIS   Angular distributions were used to extract the spin and
            parity of 19Ne excited states in the astrophysical
           energy range (6-7 MeV). R-matrix calculations were
           performed to investigate the impact of our
           spin-parity assignments on these effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties in the differential cross
           sections were obtained by error propagation, adding
           in quadrature the uncertainties in the counts
            (yields) and in the target thickness since they are
           mutually independent. The uncertainty in the Jacobian
           of the laboratory to center of mass conversion for
           the cross sections was not considered since its
           inclusion did not have a significant contribution to
           the uncertainties. The uncertainties in the
           laboratory yields come from the fits done using the
           BayeSpec code.
