INSTITUTE  (1USAMSU,3HUNDEB,1USAHPE,1USACMG,1USANOT)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAMSU) The National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University ReA
           reaccelerator facility.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,NAICR) The SuN detector is a 4pi calorimeter
           with the shape of a 16 in. x 16 in. barrel with a
           1.8-inch-diameter borehole along its axis. The barrel
           is segmented into eight optically isolated NaI(Tl)
           crystals, each connected to three photomultiplier
           tubes (PMTs).
SAMPLE     The hydrogen gas-cell target, located in the center
           of the SuN detector, was made of plastic with
           2-microm-thick molybdenum foils used as entrance and
           exit windows. The cell had a length of 4 cm and
           included a tantalum ring on the upstream side and
           tantalum foil lining the inner walls of the cell, to
           shield the plastic from the beam and reduce
           beam-induced background. The hydrogen gas inside the
           cell was kept at a pressure of ~600 Torr.
METHOD     A 82Kr beam was directed onto a hydrogen gas cell
           located at the center of the Summing NaI(Tl) (SuN)
           detector. The delivered beam impinged on a hydrogen
           gas-cell target and the gamma rays produced by the
           reaction were detected by the Summing NaI(Tl) (SuN)
           detector. The obtained spectra were analyzed using
           the gamma-summing technique and extracted cross
           section.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties in the presented cross
           section include
           (ERR-1) 5% for the beam-charge accumulation
           (ERR-2) 5% for the areal target density attributed to
           the measurement of the gas cell pressure,
           (ERR-S,1.,4.) statistical uncertainty varying between
           1% and 4%, with the latter value corresponding to the
           smaller energy.
CORRECTION Doppler-energy shift and the width fluctuation
           corrections.
