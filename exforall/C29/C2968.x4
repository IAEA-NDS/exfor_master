           3MEXINI,2ITYCAT,1USATAM)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) UND FN tandem, the radioactive beam
           facility of the University of Notre Dame.
INC-SPECT  Primary beams of 6Li(3+) at 23.8, 24.8, 26.1, 29, and
           30 MeV were produced by the Notre Dame FN tandem
           accelerator and impinged on a primary 2.5-cm-long
           gaseous primary target containing 850 Torr of 2H. The
           intensity of the primary beams was 300 to 500 enA,
           producing secondary 7Be beams via the direct reaction
           6Li(2H,n)7Be at intensities ~5*10**5 pps. The
           produced secondary beams were collected and
           transported via the TriSol solenoid system to a
           1.95-mg/cm2-thick natZr secondary target with
           energies of 20.6, 22.1, 23.7, 27.3, and 28.2 MeV.
           Another possible explanation for the discrepancy
           could be the uncertainty in the beam energy, which
           was estimated to be of the order of +-0.5 MeV.
DETECTOR   (SISD,TELES) The quasielastic scattered nuclei,
           including the excitation to the first excited state
           of 7Be, together with other reaction products were
           detected by four silicon telescopes. The DSSSD
           detectors with dimensions of 5.4x5.4cm provide 16
           strips distributed horizontally and 16 strips
           vertically, allowing a pixel by pixel analysis and an
           interstrip rejection.
SAMPLE     A natZr target of 1.95 mg/cm2 thickness.
METHOD     (EDE) The telescopes produced an excellent
           discrimination between the 7Be recoils and the
           various reaction products by energy via the dE-E
           technique. With appropriate gates on such spectra and
           after interstrip rejection, yields of the elastic
           scattered 7Be nuclei at various angles corresponding
           to the 16 vertical strips of each telescope were
           integrated and normalized to the target scattering
           centers, to the geometrical solid angle, and to the
           flux. The flux was adjusted at the most forward
           angles, such as the elastic scattering versus
           Rutherford, to be unity and differential cross
           sections were obtained.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The assigned errors to the total reaction
           cross sections correspond to angular distributions.
