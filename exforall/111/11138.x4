INC-SOURCE (D-LI) Li-7(d,n) source
INC-SPECT  Maximum energy 25.4 MeV. Effective energy 24-25 MeV.
DETECTOR   (THRES,GEMUC) C12(n,2n) Threshold detector with 20.4
           MeV.
METHOD     (TRN,ACTIV) Carbon was used as an energy-sensitive
           neutron detector. The deuteron beam was monitored by
           a graphite disk placed 1 inch in front of the target.
           Both monitor and detector were irradiated
           simultaneously to avoid corrections for bombardment
           time and fluctuations in the beam intensity. The
           detector was made by quartering a hollow graphite
           cylinder (4.5 cm long) parallel to its axis. During
           irradiation the four pieces were stacked together and
           placed longitudinally with respect to the neutron
           beam. The cross section of the detector was 1.9x1.6
           cm2 and its center was 22.4 cm from the target. The
           scatterers had a cross section of 1 sq. inch and were
           placed midway between the target and detector. After
           irradiation for 40 minutes with deuteron currents of
           50-60 microA, the monitor and detector were removed.
           The radioactivity induced in the monitor was observed
           with a Lauritsen electroscope, while the detector
           was wrapped about a thin-walled Geiger counter which
           fed into a "scale of 32" recording unit.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors of the measured cross sections
           are estimated from the consistency of the data to be
           less than 8 percent for hydrogen, 5 percent for
           carbon, and 10 percent for the other elements.
