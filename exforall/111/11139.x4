TITLE      The Slow Neutron Cross Sections of Indium, Gold,
           Silver, Antimony, Lithium, and Mercury as Measured
           with a Neutron Beam Spectrometer

METHOD     (TRN,TOF) The variations of the slow neutron
           transmissions of In, Au, Ag, Sb, Li, and Hg have been
           investigated as a function of the time-of-flight of
           the incident neutrons for a 5.4-meter path by use of
           a neutron beam spectrometer.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Plots were digitized vs. neutron
           time of flight in  microsec/meter and converted to
           energy by compiler using the relation
           E = (72.3/t)**2 eV which gives the neutron
           energy for a timing t, microsec/meter from. Formula
           was taken from Phys. Rev. 71, 165 (1947) and verified
           using the method of visual inspection. Transmission
           data are more reliable, while cross section scale is
           less obvious.

SAMPLE     This salt was tightly packed in an aluminum container
           such that there were 4.85 g/cm2 of LiF and 0.418
           g/cm2 of aluminum in the beam for the thicker sample
           and 0.862 g/cm2 of LiF and 0.418 g/cm2 of aluminum in
           the beam for the thinner sample. The lithium fluoride
           was obtained from the City Chemical Corporation and
           was of analytical reagent grade. The salt was dried
           at 120 degrees C for 48 hours before being packed in
           the container.
ANALYSIS   If the cross section of aluminum is assumed to be
           1.5x10**(-24) cm2/atom, and that of fluorine
           2.5x10**(-24) cm2/atom and these cross sections are
           assumed constant over the energy interval studied,
           then the absorption due to the aluminum and the
           fluorine will be equivalent to a reduction in the
           transmission to T=0.938 for the 0.862 g/cm2 sample
           and to T=0.826 for the 4.85 g/cm2 sample. The
           experimental results then indicate that the slow
           neutron cross section of lithium follows a 1/v law
           and may be expressed as the sum of a constant term
           and a 1/v term: sigma = [(11.5+- 0.2) *E**-1/2 +
            (1.7+- 0.2) ]*10**-24 cm2/atom if the cross section
           of fluorine is assumed to be constant at 2.5x10**24
           cm2/atom. E is the neutron energy in eV.

SAMPLE     A 19.8 g/cm2 disk of metallic silver was used. A
           preliminary run on the thin sample in the thermal
           region gave sufficient data to indicate the thickness
           of the sample which would give best results in this
           region. Therefore, the thick sample was cut
           approximately in half and a sample containing 7.84
           g/cm2 was used for the rest of the measurements an
           silver.
METHOD     Resolution width was approximately 50 microsec/meter.
ANALYSIS   Outside resonances, the cross section from the
           experimental transmission T by using the formula
           T=exp(-n sigma), where n is the number of atoms per
           cm2 in the sample.  Silver cross sections can be
           expressed as sigma = [(4.2+-0.3) + (0.64+-0.02)*E**(-1/
           2)]x10**(-24) cm2/atom. E is the neutron energy in eV.

SAMPLE     A 19.8 g/cm2 disk of metallic silver was used.
           Transmission measurements were made using a thin
           sample containing 1.043 g/cm2, in the vicinity of 32
           microseconds/meter.
ANALYSIS   In the thermal region, the Ag
           cross-section curves can be resolved into the sum of
           a constant term and a 1/v term: sigma = [(9.05+-
           0.10)*E**-1/2 + (6.6+-0.5)]*10**-24 cm2/atom.
           E is the neutron energy in eV.

SAMPLE     The mercury was U.S.P. XII redistilled - purchased
           from the Mallinkrodt Chemical Works. For the
           preliminary investigation of the entire transmission
           curve of mercury, a sample containing 3.25 g/cm2 of
           the liquid was used.
METHOD     Resolution width was approximately 100 microsec/meter.

           from the Mallinkrodt Chemical Works. A sample
           containing 12.9 g/cm2 of the liquid was used.
METHOD     Resolution width was approximately 10 microsec/meter.
ANALYSIS   Outside resonances, the cross section from the

           T=exp(-n sigma), where n is the number of atoms per
           cm2 in the sample. Silver cross section can be
           expressed as sigma = [15 + 64*E**(-1/2)]x10**(-24)
           cm2/atom. E is the neutron energy in eV.

SAMPLE     The thick sample contained 5.02 g/cm2 of the metal.
           These samples were obtained from the Indium Company
           of America and were the purest indium that could be
           furnished by this company.
METHOD     Resolution width was less than 50 microsec/meter.
ANALYSIS   Outside resonances, the cross section from the
           experimental transmission T by using the formula
           T=exp(-n sigma), where n is the number of atoms per
           cm2 in the sample.
