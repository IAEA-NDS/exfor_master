FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACOL) The Columbia Neutron Velocity
           Spectrometer.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 proportional counter detectors.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons slowed down in paragon are detected by
           BF3 proportional counters. Excellent collimation is
           obtained by using an extensive B4C and Cd collimating
           system. Experiments were conducted principally at a
           5.4-meter source detector distance. A special
           selector system counts all the neutrons detected and
           also selectively counts those detected in an
           adjustable timed interval after the cyclotron burst.
           The slow neutron energy distributions from paraffin
           "source" slabs were shown to be of a modified
           Maxwellian form with an asymmetrical high energy tail.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Plots were digitized vs. neutron
           time of flight in  microsec/meter and converted to
           energy by compiler using the relation
           E = (72.3/t)**2 eV which gives the neutron
           energy for a timing t, microsec/meter from. Formula
           was taken from Phys. Rev. 71, 165 (1947) and verified
           using the method of visual inspection. Transmission
           data are more reliable, while cross section scale is
           less obvious.

REACTION   (5-B-0(N,TOT),,SIG)
SAMPLE     A 2.464 g/cm2 sample of B203 was used.
METHOD     For the highest energy measurements the cyclotron and
           detection on time intervals were reduced to about 15
           microseconds each to give a total resolution width of
           about 6 microseconds/meter.

HISTORY    (20210317A) BP: Added sample, resolution. Changed old
                       BNL-325 curve with digitization.

REACTION   (5-B-0(N,TOT),,SIG)
SAMPLE     A 2.464 g/cm2 sample of B203 was used.
METHOD     For the measurements below 100 microseconds/meter the
           total resolution width was 20 microseconds/meter plus
           3.7 percent of the time-of-flight due to the counter
           length. For the remainder of the measurements a 5000-
           microsecond cycle was used with cyclotron and
           detection, on-time widths of 100 microseconds each
           below 500 microseconds/meter and 150 microseconds
           each above 500 microseconds/meter. In calculating the
           total resolution width above 200 microseconds/meter
           the delayed thermal emission width of 45 microseconds
           and the 3.7 percent effect due to the counter length
           must be added to the sum of the cyclotron and
           detection on-time intervals.
ANALYSIS   The results of these measurements together with an
           estimate of the overall uncertainty present may be
           given as: sigma = [(118+-4)*E**(-1/2)]*10**(-24)
           cm2/atom, where E is the neutron energy in electron
           volts.
