SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.9442) The Li6 was 94.42% Li6 by
           weight.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The quoted errors at 8 and 11 MeV in Table
           I represent an educated guess as to probable error
           limits.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied to the data for elastic
           energy loss, multiple scattering, finite detector
           size, variation of the beam energy and intensity with
           angle, finite source-detector spacing, and the effect
           of the 15-mil Armco iron container. At 14 MeV,
           information on the lithium angular distribution is
           available. At 8 MeV, the angular distribution was
           estimated from other light-element angular
           distributions. The 11 -MeV correction factors were
           obtained by interpolation. Due to the lack of
           knowledge about the angular distribution, the Anal
           cross sections at 8 and 11 MeV are not very accurate.

COMMENT    Data corrected in priv.comm.,1964.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied to the data for elastic
           energy loss, multiple scattering, finite detector
           size, variation of the beam energy and intensity with
           angle, finite source-detector spacing, and the effect
           of the 15-mil Armco iron container. At 14 MeV,
           information on the lithium angular distribution is
           available. At 8 MeV, the angular distribution was
           estimated from other light-element angular
           distributions. The 11 -MeV correction factors were
           obtained by interpolation. Due to the lack of
           knowledge about the angular distribution, the Anal
           cross sections at 8 and 11 MeV are not very accurate.
           The Li7 cross section reported here is lower than
           that of Li6 because inelastic scattering to the
           0.477-MeV level in the case of Li7 could not be
           separated from elastic scattering collisions.

CORRECTION Corrections were applied to the data for elastic
           energy loss, multiple scattering, finite detector
           size, variation of the beam energy and intensity with
           angle, finite-source detector spacing, and fission
           effects. The fission correction was determined by
           first calibrating the detection efficiency for
           fission neutrons at each detector bias by using the
           spontaneous fissions from Pu240, and then measuring the
            induced fission rate by means of a detector bias set
           above the initial neutron energy but below the upper
           energy limit of the fission spectrum.
