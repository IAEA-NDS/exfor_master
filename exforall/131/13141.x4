TITLE      A new technique for enhancing helium production in
            ferritic materials
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Peripheral Target Position of HFIR.
SAMPLE     55Fe produced through neutron capture on high purity
            natural iron samples
METHOD     (ASEP) Isotopic-dilution gas mass spectrometry
DETECTOR   Thermal ionization mass spectrometry was
           performed on three samples to measure the ratios of
           all iron isotopes
           (SCIN) 55Fe was also measured by liquid scintillation
           spectrometry
MONITOR    Fe, Co, Ti, Ni dosimeters.
CORRECTION Corrected for reactor power history and 55Fe decay.
