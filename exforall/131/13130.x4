TITLE      THERMAL-NEUTRON FISSION CROSS SECTION OF 26.1-MIN
           U-235M
FACILITY   (REAC) LOS ALAMOS OMEGA WEST REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)
INC-SPECT  PEAK ENERGY OF MAXWELLIAN NORMAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
            IS 26 MILLI-EV, THE ENERGY OF THE MOST PROBABLE FLUX
            IN THE WAVELENGTH REPRESENTATION OF THE MAXWELLIAN
            FLUX IS 75.5 MILLI-EV.
           THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM IS APPROXIMATED BY A MAXWELLIAN
            DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE 350 DEG-K.
SAMPLE     6.E+10 TO 3.E+11 ATOMS DEPOSITED ON 9.5-MM DIAMETER
            PLATINUM DISK. SAMPLES OBTAINED BY CHEMICAL SEPARATION
            OF URANIUM GROWN IN A 15-MIN PERIOD BY ALPHA DECAY
            OF PLUTONIUM SOLUTION (200-400 MG PU).

ANALYSIS   MULTISCALE SPECTRUM FITTED TO A + B X EXP(-LAMBDA T)
           WHERE A IS NORMALIZED FISSION RATE FOR 235-U-G IN THE
                   DEPOSIT AT LONG TIMES AFTER SEPARATION,
                   INCLUDING BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE FISSIONS
                   FROM PLUTONIUM
                 B IS RELATED TO RATIO OF THE ISOMERIC TO THE
                   GROUND STATE CROSS SECTIONS
                 T IS THE TIME ELAPSED SINCE THE END OF THE
                   GROW-IN PERIOD DURING CHEMICAL SEPARATION
            LAMBDA IS THE ISOMERIC STATE DECAY CONSTANT, 0.02656
                   MINUTES(-1).
CORRECTION CORRECTION MADE FOR FISSIONS DUE TO ANY PLUTONIUM
            FOUND IN THE DEPOSIT BY LATER ALPHA COUNTING THE DISK.
