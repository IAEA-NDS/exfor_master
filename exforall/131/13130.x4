TITLE      Thermal-neutron fission cross section of 26.1-min
           U-235M
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Los Alamos Omega West Reactor
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)
INC-SPECT  Peak energy of Maxwellian normal energy distribution
            is 26 milli-eV, the energy of the most probable flux
            in the wavelength representation of the Maxwellian
            flux is 75.5 milli-eV.
           The neutron spectrum is approximated by a Maxwellian
            distribution of temperature 350 deg-K.
SAMPLE     6.E+10 to 3.E+11 atoms deposited on 9.5-mm diameter
            platinum disk. Samples obtained by chemical separation
            of uranium grown in a 15-min period by alpha decay
            of plutonium solution (200-400 mg Pu).
DETECTOR   (FISCH)
DECAY-DATA (92-U-235-M,26.1MIN)
ANALYSIS   Multiscale spectrum fitted to a + b x exp(-lambda T)
           where a is normalized fission rate for 235-U-g in the
                   deposit at long times after separation,
                   including background and possible fissions
                   from plutonium
                 B is related to ratio of the isomeric to the
                   ground state cross sections
                 T is the time elapsed since the end of the
                   grow-in period during chemical separation
            lambda is the isomeric state decay constant, 0.02656
                   minutes(-1).
CORRECTION Correction made for fissions due to any plutonium
            found in the deposit by later alpha counting the disk.
ERR-ANALYS Uncertainty is one standard deviation of the eight
            individual samples results
