TITLE      Reaction 6Li(n,p)6He at 118 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
SAMPLE     The thickness of 6Li was 462 mg/cm2; 7Li - 290 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,HPGE) Three telescopes each composed typically
           of three hyperpure Ge detectors mounted inside a common
           cryostat. Protons emitted at three angles are detected
           simultaneously by three telescopes.
           With one additional run with deflecting magnetic field
           is turned on, a complete six point angular distribution
           out to 20. degr. can be obtained.
           (SCIN) In front of each Ge telescope a thin dE plastic
           scintillator is placed to provide a fast trigger in
           coincidence with signals in the first detector of the
           corresponding telescope.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC)
           Background was measured with the target removed.
           Thus, a measurement at a given field setting was
           accomplished by cycling back and forth through the
           target sequence: 6Li, CH2, blank.
