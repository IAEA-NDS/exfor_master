TITLE      -THE THERMAL NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS OF 92-U-234
            AND -U-236.-
FACILITY    DIDO REACTOR
           (SPECM)    AEI TYPE MS5 MASS SPECTROMETER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    REACTOR, SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED WITH COBALT
            MONITOR IN THE REACTOR FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS.
INC-SPECT   THE IRRADIATION POSITIONS PROVIDED THERMAL NEUTRONS
            WESTCOTT EPITHERMAL INDEX PARAMETER
            (R =(7.5 +- 1.0)E-4) WITH A TEMP. OF 116 +- 9 DEG-C.
METHOD      EXAMINATION BY THE MASS SPECTROMETER.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)

            WILKINS, TO BE PUBLISHED IN J.BRIT.NUCL.ENERGY SOC.
COMMENT     THE REASONS OF NEW MEASUREMENT ARE BASED ON THE RECENT
            AVAILABILITY OF (A) IRRADIATION POSITIONS WHICH
            PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THERMAL NEUTRONS OF ADEQUATE
            INTENSITY COMBINED WITH, (B) SAMPLES OF U-ISOTOPES
            ALMOST ISOTOPICALLY PURE
HISTORY    (710519C)
           (760112E)
ERR-ANALYS  SYSTEMATIC ERROR ALSO CONSIDERED.
