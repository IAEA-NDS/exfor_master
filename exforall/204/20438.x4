TITLE      -THE THERMAL-NEUTRON FISSION CROSS-SECTION OF TH-227.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )      E.I.R. SWIMMING-POOL REACTOR SAPHIR.
INC-SPECT   METH.1 - THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX = 5.0E+8/CM**2/SEC
                     (FAST COMPONENT ABOUT 1/10 OF THIS VALUE)
            METH.2 - 3-DAYS IRRADIATION IN THERMAL NEUTRON
                     FLUX = 2.0E+13/CM**2/SEC.
SAMPLE      METH.1 - TH-227 WAS MOUNTED IN THE FISSION COUNTER
                     WITH SCOTCH PLATE.
            METH.2 - AN ELECTROPLATED SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED.
           .SEE TEXT FOR DETAIAL OF SAMPLE PREPARATION AND MASS
            DETERMINATION OF TH-227.
METHOD      - BACK TO BACK FISSION COUNTER METHOD (METH. 1)
            - RADIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES (METH. 2)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    PARALLEL PLATE-TYPE FISSION COUNTER OPERATED
            AS A GAS FLOW CHAMBER WITH AN ARGON(90 PERC.)-METHANE
            MIXTURE. THIS COUNTER WAS FASTENED BACK TO BACK TO
            A SIMILAR COUNTER CONTAINING A VERY THIN DEPOSIT OF
            U-235 SERVING AS A MONITOR. (METH. 1)

ERR-ANALYS  METH.1 - ERRORS DUE TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE N.OF
                     ATOMS OF TH-227,THE BACKGROUND, THE U-235
                     FISSION CROSS-SECT. AND COUNT RATE,
                     AND STATISTICAL ERRORS WERE INCLUDED
            METH.2 - NO ERROR GIVEN,BUT ESTIMATED TO 25-30 PERC.
                     FOR VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS. A STANDARD
                     DEVIATION OF 25 PERCENT HAS RESULTED  FOR
                     THE ARITHMETIC MEAN.
            THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE WEIGHTED MEAN INCLUDING
            BOTH METHODS WAS ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT.
