TITLE       Measurements of thermal neutron cross-sections for
            helium production in Ni-59 and Ni-60
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDCTH)
INC-SOURCE .Double crystal monochromator
           At 50 MW reactor power about 105 n/s passed through the
           target position.
SAMPLE     .0.85+-0.01 atomic % Ni-59 material obtained by
            irradiating nickel powder enriched to 99.9%
            in Ni-58 with thermal neutrons from the reactor R2.
           .Target enriched to 93% in Ni-61 also prepared.
           .Thickness 1.65+-0.05 microg/millim**2 for Ni-58,59
            and 0.82+-0.03 microg/millim**2 for Ni-61.
           The targets of LiF were vacuum deposited onto 12 mm
           thick Al taken from the same sheet as was used for the
           backing for the Ni targets. The LiF targets were 14 mm
           in diam. and their thicknesses were determined by
           micro-weighting to be 1.60, 2.10 and 3.37 mu-g/mm2
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)    Silicon surface barrier detector with an
           active area of 114 mm2 was used for detecting alphas,
            tritons and protons.
