TITLE       Elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons in the
            energy range 1.0 to 5.0 MeV by natural molybdenum
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK ALD)    AWRE 6 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)    T(p,n)He-3 reaction, tritium gas target with
            a 0.0003 cm thick Mo entrance foil and 760 torr gas
            pressure.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-FW) The incident neutron  energies varied from
            1 to 5 MeV energy spreads on source neutron energies
            varied from 50 keV at 1.0 MeV neutron energy, to
            30 keV at 3.0 MeV, to 20 keV at 5.0 MeV. These energy
            spreads are almost entirely due to incident proton
            energy loss in the gas cell.
SAMPLE      Right cylinder of natural Mo, 2.0 cm. outer diam.,
            1.20 cm inner diam. and 4.99 cm long. Purity better
            than 99%
METHOD     (TOF)    Time of flight, flight path = 1.747 m,
            a second time of flight spectrometer, viewing the gas
            target at a fixed angle, was used as a monitor to
            compare neutron yields at different angles.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  Liquid scintillator (NE213) and measurement of
            detector efficiency with n-energy. The extrapolation
            of the counter efficiency curve from 4.2 to 5.0 MeV
            was guided by past experience runs using d-d n-source.
           (LONGC) Two long counters, at 0. and 90. degr., were
            used as relative neutron flux monitors for the
            excitation function measurements.
            In case of angular distributions two long counters
            were used to intercompare runs at different incident
            energies and so put this data on the same relative
            scale for all incident neutron energies.
REL-REF    (M,,J.H.Towle+,J,NP/A,118,500,1968) - The neutron
            detection system and experimental procedures described
ANALYSIS    Most of the data analysis, including peak areas,
            inelastic continuum analysis and repetitive
            calculations were done on a PDP-7 computer.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)  The scattering at 45 deg from
            the polythene sample was measured.
           (26-FE-0(N,INL)26-FE-0,,DE)
               The well-known scattered n-group
            energies from iron were used for the time calibration
MONIT-REF  (,A.Horsley,J,ND/A,2,243,1966)
COMMENT     The intension of this work is to provide detailed
            experimental data in the range 1.0 to 5.0 MeV prior to
            an evaluation of scattering cross section for natural
            Mo, no attempt has been made to compare the data with
            theoretical predictions.

COMMENT    From the text of the article: It should be noted that
           included in the data in table 1 are contributions to
           the cross section from the 204 keV inelastic level,
           which could not be resolved from the elastic peak.
           According to the excitation function data for the
           204 keV level, this will increase the elastic cross
           section by at most 80 mb at 1.5 MeV, falling to
           essentially zero contribution above 3.5 keV. This is
           due to a single level in Mo-95 and was only separable
           from the elastic peak in the excitation function
           runs at 125.degr.

           sections on an absolute scale, the elastic peak areas
           were used. Two directly comparable sets were available,

           function data) differential cross sections at 125.degr.

COMMENT     In obtaining the total cross section, values of the
            (n,gamma) and (n,p) cross sections by J.Schmidt were
            used (see REL-REF), although these are too small to
            have any appreciable effect on the final value.
