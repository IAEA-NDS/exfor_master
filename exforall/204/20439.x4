TITLE      -REACTION CROSS-SECTION AND RESONANCE INTEGRAL FOR
            O18(N,G)O19.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    E.I.R. SWIMMING-POOL REACTOR SAPHIR.
INC-SPECT   THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX = 9.0E+12 N/CM**2/SEC.
SAMPLE      TWO BATCHES OF NA(2)-CO(3), WITH 43.5 PERCENT
            AND 84.6 PERCENT O-18 RESPECTIVELY.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION, THE IRRADIATION TIME WAS 30 SEC.
DETECTOR   (GELI )    40 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR COUPLED TO
            A INTERTECHNIQUE 4000 CHANNEL ANALYZER.
MONITOR    (11-NA-23(N,G)11-NA-24,,SIG)

ERR-ANALYS  THE POSSIBLE SOURCES OF ERRORS ARE DISCUSSED,
            QUADRATIC COMBINATION OF ALL ERRORS GIVES THE OVERALL
            ERROR OF +- 5 PER CENT IN THE CROSS SECTION.

COMMENT     THERMAL CROSS-SECTION WAS DERIVED FROM THE EFFECTIVE
            CROSS-SECTION ( = (1.7 +- 0.1) * E-4 BARN), USING THE
            FOLLOWING PARAMETERS WHICH WERE EXPERIMENTALLY
            DETERMINED,
            THE SPECTRAL INDEX R = (1.51 +- 0.08) * E-2,
            THE WESTCOTT VALUE S = 5.31,
            AND THE CORRECTION FACTOR FOR DEVIATION FROM THE 1/V
            LAW WAS SET EQUAL TO 1.
