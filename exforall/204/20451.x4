FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK HAR) Harwell 45 MeV Electron Linear
                           Accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO)    Photo-Neutron with Booster.
METHOD     (TOF)    Time of Flight.
DETECTOR   (GELI)    4 and 20 cm3 Ge(LI) detectors.
ANALYSIS   .Assignment of resonance spins using the intensity
            ratios of low energy neutron capture gamma-rays.
