TITLE      -Backward scattering of 14.1 MeV neutrons from C-12.-
FACILITY   (CCW,2ITYTUR)  Turin Univ. Electro-static generator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    Deuteron-tritium
INC-SPECT  Neutron flux 1.x 10.**7 n/sec in the whole solid angles
SAMPLE      Graphite slide, 70*70 cm, 0.9 cm thick.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) Time of flight, flight path = 218 cm.
                       Associated-particle method.
DETECTOR   (SCIN )  NE213 liquid scintillator.
            The experimental technique allows measuring
            angular distributions at backward angles (178 deg.).
            Angular resolution is better than 2 deg FWHM.
ANALYSIS    The whole angular distribution was analysed by an
            optical potential.
MONITOR     Absolute measurement.
PART-DET   (N    )  neutrons.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data from NCL,3,99.
CORRECTION  Corrected for double-scattering and evaluated of the
            order of 11% (with an error of 20%).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The quoted errors are the statistical ones.
