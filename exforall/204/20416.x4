INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuteron-deuterium reaction in a 10 cm long

DETECTOR   (STANK) Large Gd-loaded liquid scintillator.
            76cm diameter. Equipped by 12 photomultipliers.
            Detector efficiency was calibrated using a 252-Cf
            source assuming a value of NU=3.732 and Maxwellian
            spectrum temperature 1.43 MeV.
             Neutron detection efficiency as function of energy
            was estimated by Monte Carlo calculations .
            The efficiency energy dependence was smoothed as

            distribution for the detected events.
CORRECTION  Background correction.
            For dead time losses.
            Efficiency correction for difference of Cf252 fission
            neutron and (n,2n) neutron spectra.
            Multiple event correction.
            For events not induced in sample.
            For (n,2n) reactions induced by non-monoenergetic
            neutrons.
            Correction in the flux measurement.
            For the effect of (n,2n) reaction in the axial tube
            of scintillator tank - estimated to be negligible.
            For reactions induced by degraded neutrons ( -3%)
            and loss of secondary neutrons in sample ( +0.5%) .
COMMENT     The direct detection technique of emitted neutrons
            used in this experiment is not limited to nuclei
            with suitable activity characteristics of
            residual isotopes as it is the case for activation
            measurements.
CRITIQUE   H.Vonach et al., Nucl.Sci.Eng. 106(1990)409 corrected

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors given are standard errors derived by
            quadratic addition of the statistical errors of the
            experimental data and the errors of the correction.
           .Uncertainties of Cf-252(NU-BAR) and U-238-fission
            cross-sections are not included.
