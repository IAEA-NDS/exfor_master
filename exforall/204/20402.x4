TITLE      -ELASTIC AND INELASTIC SCATTERING OF 5.0 MEV NEUTRONS
            BY SODIUM.-
FACILITY   (VDG  )    AWRE 6 MV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  )    T(P,N)HE-3 REACTION, TRITIUM GAS TARGET.
INC-SPECT   THE INCIDENT ENERGY 5.0 MEV,
            THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPREAD WAS 25 KEV, MAINLY DUE TO
            THE PROTON ENERGY LOSS IN THE GAS CELL AND THE FINITE
            ANGLE SUBTENDED AT THE TARGET BY THE SCATTERING SAMPLE
SAMPLE     .PRODUCED BY POURING MOLTEN PURE NA METAL, IN
            AN ARGON ATMOSPHERE, INTO A LIGHT CYLINDRICAL AL CAN
            OF WALL THICKNESS 0.04 CM,
           .THE ENCLOSED NA SAMPLE WAS 4.5 CM DIAMETER,
            4.6 CM LONG AND WEIGHED 71.093 G AND WAS X-RAYED TO
            CONFIRM THE ABSENCE OF VOIDS.
           .PURITY OF NA BETTER THAN 99.5 PER CENT,
            REMAINDER MOSTLY O(2).
METHOD     (TOF  )    TIME OF FLIGHT,  FLIGHT PATH = 1.75 M,  THE
            SPECTRA WERE OBTAINED AT TEN ANGLES BETWEEN 30 AND 135
            DEGREES.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     LIQUID SCINTILLATOR (NE213) AND MEASUREMENT

            SCATTERER TO OBTAIN AN ABSOLUTE CROSS SECTION SCALE,
           (26-FE-0(N,INL),,DE)
               THE WELL KNOWN NEUTRON GROUP
            ENERGIES FROM N-SCATTERING OF IRON WERE USED AS TIME
            CALIBRATION AND A CHECK ON INCIDENT NEUTRON ENERGY.
