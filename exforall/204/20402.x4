TITLE       Elastic and inelastic scattering of 5.0 MeV neutrons
            by sodium
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK ALD)    AWRE 6 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)    T(p,n)He-3 reaction, tritium gas target.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-FW) The incident energy 5.0 MeV, the neutron
            energy spread was 25 keV, mainly due to the proton
            energy loss in the gas cell and the finite angle
            subtended at the target by the scattering sample
SAMPLE     .Produced by pouring molten pure Na metal (> 99.5% Na,
            remainder mostly O2), in an argon atmosphere, into
            a light cylindrical Al can of wall thickness 0.04 cm.
           .The enclosed Na sample was 4.5 cm diam., 4.6 cm long
            and weighed 71.093 g and was X-rayed to confirm the
            absence of voids.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)  The scattering at 45 deg from
            the polythene sample was measured.
MONIT-REF  (,A.Horsley,J,ND/A,2,243,1966)
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight, flight path = 1.75 m, the spectra
            were obtained at ten angles between 30 and 135. degr.
             * The well known neutron group energies from
            n-scattering of iron were used as time calibration
            and a check on incident neutron energy.

ANALYSIS   (4PI1A)
            The 439 keV level is considerably interfered
            with by the elastic peak. But a shape for elastic peak
            can be subtracted from the full spectrum to leave the
            inelastic spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error in extracting individual inelastic
            peak areas, was estimated to be 5 or 7% in the peak
            area.
           .Since inelastic angular distributions were isotropic,
            the integrated cross sections were taken as 4pi times
            the means of the measured differential cross sections,
            each weighted according to its error, and errors
            quoted on inelastic integrated cross sections are the
            standard deviation of these means.
