INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
REFERENCE  ((R,AERE-R-6074,6906)=(P,EANDC(UK)-113,6906)) DESCRIBES
            A NEW EXPERIMENT, THE ONE WHICH IS HERE COMPILED.
            THE DATA PUBLISHED IN THIS REFERENCE IN TABLE 8,
            PAG.14 HAVE BEEN HOWEVER SUPERSEDED BY THOSE LISTED
            BELOW WHICH REFER TO THE SAME EXPERIMENT BUT WERE
            NORMALIZED TO NEW B-10(N,ALPHA) DATA.
           (W,MOXON,7112) REVISION OF THE DATA PUBLISHED IN THE
            HARWELL REPORT MENTIONED BELOW,ATTACHED TO A SOWERBY
            LETTER TO CCDN DATED 7/12/1971.

            DESCRIPTION OF THE HARWELL FACILITIES. THE MEASUREMENT
            WAS PERFORMED ON NATURAL U SAMPLE AND U-235 EFFECTS
            WERE DETERMINED IN A SUBSIDIARY EXPERIMENT.
            DATA PLOT GIVEN.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,G)92-U-239,,SIG,,AV)
PART-DET   (G    )    GAMMAS.
COMMENT     THE NEW VALUES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FOR (1) IMPROVED
            SELF SCREENING AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING CORRECTIONS
            AND (2) THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF B-10(N,A GAMMA)
            CROSS-SECTION HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO THAT RECOMMENDED
            BY SOWERBY ET AL.,J.NUCL.ENERGY,24(1970)323.
            MOST OF THE ERRORS ARE PREDOMINATELY SYSTEMATIC IN
            ORIGIN AS DISCUSSED IN AERE-R 6074. THE PERC. ERRORS
            QUOTED HAVE BEEN INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THOSE GIVEN
            IN AERE-R 6074 TO ALLOW FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN THE
            SELF SCREENING AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING CORRECTIONS.
