TITLE      -ACTIVATION MEASUREMENTS OF THE CROSS SECTION OF THE
            REACTION PM147(N,G)PM148G FOR REACTOR NEUTRONS.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    DIDO REACTOR, ABOUT 10 HR IRRADIATION AT A
            PNEUMATIC CARRIER POSITION OF 12HGR2 HOLE WHICH RUNS
            THROUGH THE GRAPHITE REFLECTOR UNDER THE HEAVY WATER
            TANK.
SAMPLE     .SMALL SEALED SILICA AMPOULES CONTAINING
            BETWEEN 1.5 AND 3 MICR-G PM-147 DISSOLVED IN ABOUT
            100 MICRO-L M HCL.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION ANALYSIS.
DETECTOR    4*PI*BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE COUNTER.
ANALYSIS    SEPARATION OF EXPONENTS. THE FOLLOWING HALF-LIFE
            VALUES WERE USED
            PM-147 2.623 +- 0.001 YR, PM-148G 5.370 +- 0.009 D,
            AU-198 2.4946 +- 0.001 D, CO-60 5.260 +- 0.003 Y.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
            = 37.37 +- 0.11 B, BY SILK ET AL.,
            AERE-R 6059(1969),
           (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)

COMMENT     ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING THE IRRADIATION OF
            GOLD-ALUMINIUM ALLOYS, BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT CADMIUM
            BOXES, SHOWED THAT EPITHERMAL INDEX
            R * SQUARE ROOT(T/T0) WAS ALWAYS WITHIN THE RANGE
            0.0012+-0.0001. MAXWELLIAN TEMPERATURE WAS 60 DEG-C.

CORRECTION  CORRECTION FOR THE FLUX VARIATION AT THE POSITION OF
            IRRADIATION AND THE CORRECTION FOR PHOTO-PEAK AREA
            WERE CONSIDERED.
