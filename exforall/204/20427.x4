TITLE      -The average number of prompt neutrons from neutron
            induced fission of U-235 between 0.2 and 1.4 MeV.-
FACILITY   (VDG)      3 MV pulsed Van-de-Graaff accelerator.
            Pulse width 1 nsec, average beam current 20 microA at
            repetition rate 5 MHz.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    Li-7(N,P). Collimated neutron beam.
INC-SPECT   The metallic Li-targets thickness was such, that
            neutron energy spread deltaEn was less 4%.
SAMPLE      Two uranium acetate layers less than 0.5 millig/cm**2
            in fission chamber at 56 and 63 cm flight path
            and U-235 metal disk of 0.15 millimeter thick,
            70 millimeter diameter at 74 cm flight path.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) -Gas scintillation fission counter, containing
            two thin samples of U-235, divided by samples into
            optically decoupled thirds each inspected by 56 DUVP
            photomultipliers.
             -Fission neutron detector PM XP 1040, placed at
             12.5 cm distance from sample.
            Both detectors and the samples were shielded against
            slow, roomscattered neutrons by Cd-sheets to reduce
            the time-independent background.
           (GLASD) Li-6-glass detector at 130 cm from target for
           neutron spectrum determination and as monitor for
           neutron yield.
           Calibration procedure was done by strong Am-Be neutron
           source located at 3m distance to measure efficiency.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight. Overall time resolution 2.5 nsec.
           (COINC) Coincidence between two thirds to register
            a fission event.
           (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination against gamma
            radiation.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),PR,NU,,AV)  Integral from 225 to 1363keV
            of NUp values recommended by F.Manero
            and V.A.Konshin, Atomic Energy Review 10, IAEA,
            Vienna(1972),P.637, was used for normalization.

            Detailed description of detection given in reference.
ANALYSIS    TOF spectra of three samples and the pulse height
            distribution of the fission neutron detector for max.
            energy run at 1363+-35 keV were used.
            Prompt neutron yield was derived from integrated peaks
            in TOF spectra.
CORRECTION  Carefully considered,see Table 1 of reference.
            Correction for:
           -Fission neutron detector efficiency and increase of
            fragment temperature - 5% (max.),
           -Isotopic composition - 1.5% (max.),
           -Multiple scattering - 1.5% (max.),
           -Self shielding and fission neutron angular
            distribution - 0.8% (max.).
            Background considerations concerning the fission
            neutron detector were made.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty due to background and
                     corrections was 0.6 %.
           (ERR-S)   Max error of counting statistics 1.1% .
                     Min error of counting statistics is 0.6%
           ERR-SYS and ERR-S correspond to one standard deviation.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of correction for fission neutron
                   detector efficiency and increase of fragment
                   temperature.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of correction for isotopic
                   composition. Maximal.
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty of correction for multiple
                   scattering . Maximal.
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty of correction for self shielding
                   and fission neutron angular distribution. Max.
