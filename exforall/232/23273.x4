SAMPLE      He-8 was produced through fragmentation reactions
           induced by either 600 MeV proton or 910 MeV He-3 beans.
           The production target consisted of 47.0 g/cm2 uranium
           carbide matrix.
METHOD     (COINC) Beta-gamma and beta-neutron coincidence.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 24x16 mm plastic scintillator NE102.
           Beta-detection efficiency was determined on-line to be
            40+-3 % in beta-gamma coincidence measurement on
           nuclide Ne-23 ( HL=38 s) .
           (GELI) Coaxial Ge(Li) crystal with 17% standard
           efficiency was used as gamma detector. The shape of the
           efficiency curve was determined to ~5% accuracy by
           calibrated sources and Ne-23 measurement.
           (D4PI) 4PI neutron counter consisting of 12 He-3
           proportional counters imbedded in paraffin wax, was
           slid over beta-detector. Neutron detection efficiency
           was determined to be 20+-1 % with a 48 g U sample.
           (HE3SP) Neutron energy spectrum was measured with He-3
           filled high-resolution spectrometer.
           (SIBAR) For CP measurement the He-8 ions were collected
           on a thin Ni foil in front of 100-microm-thick surface-
           barrier Si detector.

            Relative beta-delayed neutrons spectrum in arb.units.
DECAY-DATA (2-HE-8,117.5MSEC) 117.5+-1.5 ms was measured.
            119+-1 ms is recommended as combining with one
           published earlier.
EN-SEC     (E,N) Energy of delayed neutrons.
ANALYSIS   Normalization energies 0.79507 MeV and 2.4947 MeV
             (values were digitized from Fig.4).
CORRECTION For detection efficiency. Thermal peak was subtracted.
COMMENT    Of authors. The measured energy spectrum of delayed
           neutrons can be interpreted as mainly arising from
           the 3.21 MeV and 5.4 MeV states in Li-8.

           (ERR-DIG) Digitizing error of scale Y ( data);
