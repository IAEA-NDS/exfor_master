            CS for Li-7(p,n) at 13 and 18 keV -
            (5.2+-0.6)*10-2 b and (4.8+-0.5)*10-2 b.
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) Harwell pile B.E.P.O.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Collimated beam of thermal neutrons.
SAMPLE      Be-7 was prepared by bombardment of a block of pile
           graphite with the 175 MeV internal proton beam of the
           Harwell cyclotron.After chemical separation the Be-7
           was deposited on Pt sheet as a "weightless" source.
           The mass of Be-7 was determined from the counting rate
           due to 478 keV gamma-rays detected in an organic
           scintillation crystal relative to the rate due to
           411 keV gamma-rays from Au-198 source.
           Be-7 absolute activity (5.4+-0.1)*10**6 gammas/sec,
           corresponding mass (3.76+-0.40)*10**-9 g of Be-7.
           Sample was mounted on the source electrode of IOCH .
           PHDs were measured at different filling gas pressure.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Parallel plate gridded ionization chamber .
METHOD     (PHD) Pulse-height spectra measured.
           Cd difference curves .
           Intensity of proton group was measured to be of the
           expected 53d half-life.
DECAY-DATA (4-BE-7,53.D)
ADD-RES    The cross section for all processes leading to the
           destruction of Be-7 was measured to be
           SIG=(4.8+-0.9)*10**b by using the ratio of activities
           of two Be-7 samples, one of which was irradiated for
           28 days ( integrated flux F=(1.36+-0.10)*10**18).
           Spectra were studded by NaI scintillator and organic
           crystal detector.
           Ratio of activities of two samples:
           before irradiation Y=1.112+-0.009 ;
           after irradiation of stronger sample - Y1=1.043+-0.005.
           Used formula: Y1=Y*exp(-SIG*F) .
