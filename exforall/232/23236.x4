TITLE      Determination of Q0 and k0 factors for 75Se.
INSTITUTE  (2BLGMOL) L.Sneyers,P.Vermaercke.
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) Irradiation channels S84, Y4 and X26 of
           the BR1 reactor at SCK*CEN, Belgium, were used .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT     Parameters of the neutron spectra:
            Channel   f          a
           S84        17.0       -0.003

           X26        95.0       0.11
           f - ratio of the thermal neutron flux to epithermal
               flux,
           a - slope parameter of the epithermal spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Each of the materials were irradiated in
           three different channels of the BR1 reactor, both under
           a 1 mm thick Cd cover and bare, always accompanied by a
           IRMM-530 flux monitor.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After irradiation and appropriate cooling time,
           samples were measured on five HPGe detectors Obelix,
           Panoramix,Calvin, Asterix or Hobbes (efficiency ranging
           between 40 and 55 %).
ANALYSIS   The Hyperlab program was used for net peak area
           evaluation.
           The value f (thermal-epithermal flux ratio) was
           determined for each channel using the Cd ratio method,
           measuring the Au-monitor, bare and Cd-covered, at the
           same position on the same detectors as the Se-samples.
CORRECTION - Coincidence correction.
            Coincidence correction factors for a Se-shot measured
           at 25 cm detector distance:
           E-gamma (keV)         COI factor

           400.7                 1.011
           - Epithermal and thermal self-shielding corrections
           were calculated using the MATSFF program.

SAMPLE     Three different materials:
           - a pure Se shots standard, Manufacturer Alfa Aesar,
           Puratronic, typical weight Se 5 mg, concentration
           99.999% pure;
           - pure Se powder, Manufacturer Alfa Aesar, typical
           weight Se 5 mg, concentration 99.999% pure;
           -an ICP standard solution , Manufacturer NIST 3149a,
           typical weight Se 0.1 mg, concentration 1,000 ppm .
           Samples were packed in plastic bags and spacers were
           used to create a minimum 2 cm distance between the
           different samples during irradiations.
DECAY-DATA (34-SE-75,119.8D)
METHOD     - k0 and Q0 values were determined by bare monitor
           method.
           - k0, Q0 and FCd were determined by Cd-covered methods.
ANALYSIS   The effective mean resonance energy Er needed to
           convert the measured Q0(a) to Q0 was 29.05 eV as
           calculated A.Trkov (2013, private communication).
           In our calculations the impact of taking Er equal to
           29.4 eV (from REL-REF of F.De Corte+) was < 0.1 %.

           The value for FCd which gave the best matching results
           for k0 was 0.89 +-0.03 (the given uncertainty is the
           expanded uncertainty expressed at a 95 % confidence
           interval with k = 2). The assumption that FCd was equal
           to unity would have led to k0-factors about 3 % higher
           in calculations.

           The uncertainty given is a propagated uncertainty
           which is mainly based upon the uncertainty of the
           reference value, counting statistics, reference
           efficiency and uncertainties on Q0 and FCd.
