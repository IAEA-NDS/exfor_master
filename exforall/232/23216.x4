INC-SOURCE (D-T) Tritiated titanium (Ti-T) target was bombarded
           with a 350 keV d+ beam at the 0 degree beam line of
           the Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) at the JAEA.
           To reduce the background at the measuring position,
           the neutron collimator (2 cm diameter) at the 0 degree
           beam line was used. The angle between the d+ beam and
           the axis of the collimated neutron beam was 80 degree,
           which resulted in a 14.2 MeV neutron energy.
           The distance between an exit of the collimator and the
           sample was 15 cm.
INC-SPECT  The typical value of neutron fluence at the sample
           position was 6.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 36% HPGe detector - to measure induced activity.
           The distance between the sample and the HPGe detector
           surface was 5 cm.
SAMPLE     Samples were 1 mm thick rectangular (10 mm x 20 mm) or
           disk-shape (15 mm diameter).

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           The typical neutron fluence rates at the irradiation
           positions were measured by Al27(n,a)Na24 reaction.

METHOD     (GSPEC)
CORRECTION The effect of the scattered neutron from the sample,
           the sample folder and the atmosphere was taken into
           account - calculated by the MCNP-4C:
           the neutron fluence rate at the HPGe detector surface
           was 4.0E-4 times against the sample position.

COMMENT    Of author M.Shibata 2014-03-19 :
           The Sm-143m2 production cross section is withdrawn and
           not released because its uncertainty is too large.
