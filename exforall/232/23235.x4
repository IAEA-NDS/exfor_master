TITLE      Measurement of k0 and Q0 values for iridium isotopes.
INSTITUTE  (2BLGMOL) L.Sneyers,P.Vermaercke.
           (1CANMPT) C.Chilian,G.Kennedy.
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) Irradiation channels S84, Y4 and X26 of
           the BR1 reactor at SCK*CEN, Belgium, were used .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT     Parameters of the neutron spectra:
            Channel   f          a
           S84        17.0       -0.003
           Y4         38.7       0.066
           X26        95.0       0.11
           f - ratio of the thermal neutron flux to epithermal
               flux,
           a - slope parameter of the epithermal spectrum.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Ir standards were irradiated under Cd cover and
           the Cd ratios were subsequently used, along with the
           known Q0-values, to determine FCd - resonance neutron
           cadmium transmission factor.
           The two-channel method was used to determine Q0-values:
           irradiating a standard of the element, along with Au
           monitor, in two reactor irradiation channels with very
           different f, to determine the k0-value of one of the
           gamma-rays emitted by the nuclide produced.
           The Ir foil standards were irradiated in channels S84
           and X26.
           The specific activities of 192Ir, 194Ir and 198Au were
           measured by counting the samples at a distance of 25cm
           from the HPGe detector.
           The Q0 values obtained were verified using a similar
           irradiation in channel Y4.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-rays were detected with three HPGe
           detectors with relative efficiency of about 40 % .
SAMPLE     Al-Ir foils were prepared by Central Bureau for Nuclear
           Measurements (CBNM) by gravimetrically mixing the
           components of the alloy; were certified by CBNM to
           contain 1.00 +- 0.01 wt% Ir. Discs with 4 mm diameter,
           0.1 mm thickness were punched from these foils and
           accurately weighed. Each disc contained approximately
           33 microg Ir.
           The co-irradiated reference standard IRMM 530R Al-Au
           foil, containing 0.1003 +- 0.0012 % Au, was punched
           similarly. The Au monitors were used to redetermine f
           for this work using Cd-ratio measurements.
CORRECTION  For coincidence summing < 0.8 %.
            For neutron self-shielding using correction factors
           calculated by MATSSF and Sigmoid - <0.1%.
