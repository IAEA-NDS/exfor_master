            Incident spectrum.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERKFK) 3.7 MV Van Der Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Protons of energy 1912 keV.
           LiF target on water-cooled Cu backing.
           Neutrons are emitted into a forward cone of 120. degr.
           angle, max.neutron energy 106 keV.
            Exp. spectrum is presented on Fig.1 of PR/C,90,065801.
INC-SPECT   Exp. spectrum is presented on Fig.1 of PR/C,90,065801
           - quasi-Maxwellian spectrum corresponding to a thermal
           energy kT=25.+-0.5 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Several activations were performed with
           different exp. parameters - diameter, thickness, mass
           of samples, activation time and neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Li-6 glass detector at ~90cm distance from the
           LiF target was served as neutron monitor and was used
           to record the time-dependence of neutron flux.
           (HPGE) Well-shielded HPGe detectors were used to
           measure the induced activity:
           - two single HPGe detectors of 30% and 100% relative
           efficiency in far geometry with distance
           sample-detectors 76 mm ,
           - system of two HPGe Clover detectors with relative
           efficiency 130% each in very close geometry.
           Calibrations with set of standard sources.
           Efficiencies were determined with uncertainty 2% in
           gamma energy range 120 -1470 keV.
           The efficiency of HPGe Clover system was simulated by
           GEANT4, and presented on Fig.3 of PR/C,90,065801,2014.
           Smaller HPGe detector was used for higher activities -
           Au, Yb-175(two samples),-177, Os-191,-193, Hg-203.
           Intermediate activities ( four Yb-175, Hg-205) were
           counted with larger HPGe detector.
           HPGe Clover system was used for weak activities of
           Pt-197,-197m,-199.
SAMPLE     Pressed from oxides or chlorides of natural
           composition, except Pt ( cut from a metal foil).
           The samples were sandwiched between two Au foils of the
           same diameter for normalization to the well-known
             (n,gamma) cross section of 197Au.

ANALYSIS    The measured spectrum averaged cross section was
           defined relative to Au197 capture cross section at
           quasi stellar spectrum at kT=25 keV 586+-8 mb.
CORRECTION For self-absorption; coefficients were take from NIST
           technical report at
           http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/xraycoef/index.cfm.
           For the fraction of activated nuclei that decayed
           during irradiation.
           Correction for coincidence-summing and sample
           correspondence to extended sources was found to be
           negligible at far geometry ; but for Pt isotopes
            (measured by Clover detector) these effects were
           investigated by GEANT4 simulations, assuming a
           conservative 20% uncertainty for the resulting
           corrections.

CRITIQUE   By Naohiko Otsuka (2020-12-13):
           The decay data table of the article shows that 11.1% is
           assumed for the 346.5 keV gamma line emitted due to the
           isomeric transition of the 197Pt metastable
           state (95.41 min). This is related with the isomeric
           transition probability (96.7%) by 11.1%=96.7%/(1+7.71),
           where 7.71 is the internal conversion coefficient.
           Hence the number of the 346.5 keV gamma corrected by
           11.1% corresponds to the metastable production
           including its beta decay fraction, and it is not clear
           why the authors had to add the beta decay
           fraction (0.38 mb) separately to obtain the cross
           section for metastable production.
           This question was forwarded to Justyna Marganiec via
           Iris Dillmann (26 August 2020) but without any reply.
