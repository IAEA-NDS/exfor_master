INC-SOURCE (D-D)  Thin deuterated target composed of a Ti layer
           saturated by deuterium 825microg/cm2 thick attached to
           a 0.5mm thick silver backing.

INC-SPECT   Mono-energetic neutrons.
           PLC measurements were performed at 5 m and 0deg from
           the target both with and without a shadow cone to
           measure the fluence of the direct neutrons. The neutron
           fluence was monitored both by integrating the deuteron
           charge deposited on the target and by means of two De
           Pangher long counters placed at a distance of 6 m from
           the target.
           The fluence at the calibration position was determined
           with an uncertainty of 2% to 3%.
SAMPLE     Metal of natural composition.
           Two terbium samples :
            - 30mm diameter disk, 5mm of thickness, total mass
           28.9g;
           - parallelepiped shape, 5x8x10 mm,total mass of 3.3g
METHOD     (ACTIV) Terbium samples were irradiated under 0deg
           angle with respect to the incoming deuteron beam.
           The sample-to-target distance was varied from 3.3cm to
           20.3cm leading to neutron fluence rates between
           6.E+4 and 3.E+6 /cm2/s .
           Volumetric inhomogeneity (i.e. the maximum variation)
           in the terbium disk sample was of 39%, 44% and 53% in
           fluence and of 54keV, 86keV and 133keV in energy,
           respectively at 3.7MeV, 4.3MeV, and 5.4MeV.
           The irradiations in the 7MeV neutron field were
           performed at three distances:

           The extra-range germanium detector GX4019, CANBERRA at
           KINR ( Ukraine) after 5 days .
           The energy resolution was found to be 1.9keV for 1332
           keV gamma-rays from 60Co ; 0.8keV for 122keV from 57Co.
           The efficiency calibration of the detector was
           performed by 60Co, 137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am sources.
CORRECTION  For self-shielding; self-shielding factor 1.02-1.05.

ANALYSIS   The cross sections were calculated by the isotopic
           abundance, the number of nuclei in sample, the decay
           constant, the detector efficiency, the gamma yield,
           the neutron flux, the times of irradiation, cooling,
           measurement, the peak area, the self-shielding factor,
           the fractional contribution of the low-energy scattered
           neutrons - see Eq.(2) of J,NP/A,936,6,2015.

           uncertainties in quadrature - 7.1 - 38 % .
