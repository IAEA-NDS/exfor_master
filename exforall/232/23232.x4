            Exp.procedure.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) 3 MV Pelletron accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Metallic Li target. 1.5-ns bunched proton beam
           of about 2.3 MeV energy. The pulse repetition rate
           4 MHz, average current of the proton beam 6 microA.
INC-SPECT  Normalized incident neutron energy spectra is presented
           on Fig.2 of J,JRN,200,235,2014.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Large anti-Compton NaI(Tl) spectrometer of
           15.2 cm diameter, 30.5 cm length, located 78.5 cm from
           the sample at an angle of 125deg with respect to the
           proton beam - to detect prompt gamma-rays emitted from
           the sample. The long NaI(Tl) scintillator was centered
           in hollow Compton-suppression NaI(Tl) detector of
           33.0 cm outer diameter, 35.6 cm length.
           Spectrometer was set in heavy shield: borated paraffin,
           borated polyethylene, cadmium, 6LiH and potassium-free
           lead.
           (GLASD) The incident neutron energy spectra were
           measured by a time-of-flight method with a 6Li-glass
           scintillation detector of 102 mm diameter, 6.4 mm
           thickness.
           Small 6Li-glass scintillation detector (diameter 5.0mm,
           thickness of 5.0 mm) located 30 cm from the 7Li
           neutron-generation target served as a monitor of the
           neutron generation.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight (TOF) to measure incident neutron
           spectrum on capture sample.
           Runs with and without the 105Pd sample (sample run and
           blank run) and a run with a standard gold sample (gold
           run) were made cyclically in each measurement.
           (PHD) PH spectra were measured for Pd-105 and Au.
           The total measuring times for 105Pd was about 40 h;
           for the gold - 9 h, the blank runs - 31 h.
ANALYSIS   The energy calibrations of PH spectra were performed
           with standard gamma-ray sources (137Cs, 22Na, 60Co) and
           the background gamma-rays observed in the measurement
            [40K: 1.461 MeV, 56Fe(nthermal,gamma)57Fe:7.638 MeV
            (weighted average of 7.631 and 7.646 MeV gamma-rays)].
           The capture yields were obtained by using a
           pulse-height weighting technique with the weighting
           function of the gamma-ray spectrometer and each of the
           net capture gamma-ray pulse-height spectra.
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 105Pd metal disk of 15mm diameter
           , about 0.68 mm thickness.
           Gold disk of 15mm diameter, 1.0mm thickness was used as
           a standard sample.

           The distance between the 7Li target and the sample was
           12 cm.
CORRECTION For backgrounds: natural BG, the time-independent BG
           due to neutrons, the time-dependent BG due to neutrons,
           the tail of (p,gamma) peak.
           Correction factors were evaluated considering
           different effects coming from neutron self-shielding,
           neutron multiple-scattering, gamma-ray scattering, and
           gamma-ray absorption in the sample, from the dependence
           of the gamma-ray detection efficiency on the gamma-ray
           source position, from the impurities in the sample, and
           from the dead time.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The neutron-capture cross sections based on the
           Hauser-Feshbach statistical model with the dominant
           ingredients of level densities described by the
           Gilbert-Cameron approach and the gamma-ray transmission
           coefficients described by gamma-ray strength functions
           were calculated.
