FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNKTO) Kyoto University lead slowing-down
           spectrometer driven by an electron linac (KULS) at
           KURRI. KULS is a cube of 1.5x1.5x1.5 m3, composed of
           lead blocks (10x10x20 cm3, purity 99.9%), set on a
           steel platform cart in the linac target room. All
           surfaces of KULS are covered with Cd sheets of 0.5 mm
           thick to shield from low energy neutrons.
           The energy calibration of KULS was done by :
           - BF3 counter for the neutron transmission measurement
           through a resonance filters indium or cobalt,
           - Ar gas counter for the capture gamma-ray measurement
           with a resonance filter of Au, Cu or Al.
           Pulse width of electron beam was generally 33 ns (FWHM)
           and the frequency was 100 Hz as the optimum value.
           The beam current on the target was around 10.5 to 12.4
           microA.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Pulsed fast neutrons are produced by a
           photoneutron target of tantalum (8 cm diameter,6 cm
           effective thickness) in cylindrical Ti case, which is
           air-cooled with compressed air.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Back-to-back (BTB, backsides of MA and 235U
           deposits face each other) type double fission
           ionization chamber with two parallel plate electrodes
           was employed for the detection of fission events; made
           of Al, 2 mm thick, 40 mm diameter, 43 mm length.
           Distance between the electrode and the deposit is 8 mm.
           Ar + CO(2) gas is flowed through the BTB chamber.
SAMPLE     Number of atoms for sample deposits was determined
           through low-geometry alpha-counting:
           U-235  - 10 microg, (2.80+-0.10)E+16
           Np-237 -            (1.99+-0.02)E+17
           U-235  - 5 microg,  (1.51+-0.03)E+16
           Am-241 -            (1.73+-0.02)E+16
METHOD     (SLODT,PHD) The pulse height data and the slowing-down
           time data were acquired by processing the waveform
           data. The fission fragment pulses were discriminated
           from the alpha-particles pulses by the pulse height.

            Request for the data was sent 07.02.2014 to author
            W.Takahashi.
