INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Fission-like neutron spectrum in the central cavity.
           The integrated flux in one 'shot' is typically
           3.E+14 n/cm2 .
           Cavity spectrum average energy 1.44 MeV.
           Moderated spectrum average energy 0.29 MeV - for
           additional testing measurement.
           Spectra calculated by TRIPOLI 4.4 code are on Fig.6.
SAMPLE     Uranium samples of isotope-enriched 235U, 236U, 238U
           and various blank samples.
           The isotopic content determined by mass spectroscopy:
           U-235 sample: U-233 - 0.0001%, U-234 - 0.0342%,
           U-235 - 99.84%, U-236 - 0.0249%, U-238 - 0.1052%.
            Samples for additional testing measurement:
           U-236 sample: U-233 - 0.082%, U-235 - 0.205%,
           U-236 - 99.68%.
           U-238 sample: U-234 - 0.0054%, U-235 - 0.7204%,
           U-238 - 99.2742%.
           The U samples ( 19mm diameter, masses 7 to 20 microg)
           were prepared from solutions that were dried dropwise
             (stippled) onto Ti backing foils.
           The U mass of each sample was determined by alpha
           counting using an alpha spectrometer (Eurisys Mesures-
           EM 7184). It's detection efficiency was determined by
           a calibrated alpha source (containing 239Pu, 241Am,
           244Cm, diameter 15mm, total activity 459 alpha/s) with
           uncertainty of 3% at the 2sigma confidence level.
           Indium foils were co-irradiated with the U or blank
           samples for flux monitoring.
DETECTOR              Dedicated electron detector based on an
           electrostatic deflecting system and a channeltron
           electron multiplier (Photonics X9551BL).
           (HPGE) Irradiated samples were gamma-counted using
           three separate HPGe detectors which were energy and
           efficiency calibrated using sources of 152Eu and 133Ba
           whose activity were known to a precision of 2% at the
           1sigma confidence level.
             To characterize the 235mU detection efficiency,
           samples of different masses were prepared and traced
           with a known amount of isomer obtained by alpha-recoil
           collection from an electrodeposited 239Pu mother
           source. An alpha-recoil collection efficiency of
           0.31 +- 0.03 was determined,which agrees with
           calculated value 0.31 .
           For the calibration of the U-235m conversion electron
           detection efficiency, several samples were made by
           collecting a known amount of U-235m recoils from the
           239Pu-241Pu mother source, adding varying amounts of
           235U. The 235mU isomer detection efficiency EPS against
           the 235U mass for each sample was fitted as:
            EPS=eps1+eps2*m, where
           eps1=4.14+-0.35, eps2=-0.125+-0.03%/microg, m - mass of
           U-235 sample in microg.
PART-DET   (E) Low-energy conversion electrons .
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) After irradiation, the U was dissolved
           off of the backing foil and radiochemically processed
           to remove fission products. The samples were then
           electroplated onto a stainless steel disk or a fresh Ti
           backing foil and then counted. Cooling time was
           typically 90min.
ANALYSIS   Fit of the time spectrum showing U-235m isomer decay
           was performed by exponential decay plus a constant
           background, and the HL of 25.33min was obtained.
