FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) BR-1 reactor
INC-SPECT  Reactor fast flux
SAMPLE     3 g suprapur KI (reaction sample) and 100 mg (NH4)SO4
            (monitor sample).
           Sealed in separate silica tubes and packed in a
            standard Al container.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Separation of Te and I from irradiated sample.
           Tracer experiment confirmed that the chemical yield
            was 95% to 100% for I and more than 97% for Te.

           This article concludes that the fast neutron flux at
            the irradiation position is practically unperturbed.
MONITOR    (16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG,,FIS)
DECAY-MON  (15-P-32,,B-)
           Beta activities of 32P and 35S (from 34S(n,g)35S) were
            accurately discriminated.
COMMENT    By authors:
            The 159 keV gamma line from 123mTe (104 d) was not
            detected. This shows the Te content of the KI sample
            was below the detection limit, and consequently
            no correction is required to 127I(n,p)127Te data due
            to 126Te(n,g)127Te contribution.

METHOD     (BSPEC) The measurement of the disintegration rate of
            127mTe was performed at least 5 days after the end of
            the irradiation to allow for the complete decay of
            127gTe.
