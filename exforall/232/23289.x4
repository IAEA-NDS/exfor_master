FACILITY   (VDGT,2GRCATH) The 5.5 MV tandem T11/25 accelerator of
            NCSR DEMOKRITOS.
SAMPLE      AmO(2) pressed into pellets with Al(2)O(3) and
           encapsulated into Al containers were provided by
           JRC-IRMM, Geel, Belgium.
           IRMM2 target (42 mg Am ) was irradiated with 10.8 MeV
           neutrons; IRMM3 target (40 mg Am) was irradiated with
           the neutron beam energies 10.0, 10.4, 17.1 MeV.
           High-purity Al foils were placed at the front and back
           of the Am target, along with Au and Nb foils at the
           back, to monitor the neutron flux and to account for
           its variation with distance.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
             Measurement relative to 27Al(n,a)24Na cross section,
           while results were cross-checked using 197Au(n,2n)196Au
           and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reference reactions.

INC-SOURCE (D-D) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energy 10.0,10.4,
           10.8 MeV were produced via the 2H(d,n)3He reaction
            (Q=3.269 MeV) at Ed = 7.2, 7.6, 8.0 MeV, respectively,
           using deuterium gas (pressure 130 kPa) target.
            The samples were placed ~7 cm from the gas target,

           foils +-5 deg.
           (D-T) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energy 17.1 MeV
           were produced via 3H(d,n)4He reaction (Q=17.59 MeV).
           Deuterons energy 2.5 MeV. Solid Ti-tritiated target,
           consisting of 2.1 mg/cm2 Ti-tritiated layer on 1 mm

ANALYSIS    Cross section was defined :
            SIG=(Np/Nt)/F, where
           Np - number of the nuclei produced during irradiation,
           Nt - number of target nuclei,
           F - time-integrated neutron flux.
           The ratio R=Np/Nt was evaluated experimentally by
           measuring several gamma-ray lines emitted above 400 keV
           from the 241Am of the sample, and the 987.8 keV
           gamma-ray from the deexcitation of 240Am.
           Correction factors and detection efficiencies were
           supposed to be identical.
           Gamma intensities were used from REL-REF of R.Firestone

ANALYSIS    Cross section was defined :
            SIG=Ngamma/(Nt*F*EPS*Fs*Igamma*D*fc), where
           Ngamma - the number of gamma-ray events,
           Igamma - gamma-ray intensity,
           Nt - number of target nuclei,
           F - time-integrated neutron flux,
           EPS - Ge detector efficiency,
           Fs - self-absorption correction factor,
           fc - correction factor for decay during radiation,
           D - correction factor fro decay after irradiation
            (during cooling and gamma-ray measurement).
           The efficiency of the Ge detector (EPS) along with
           the self-absorption correction factor (Fs) were deduced
           via a series of MCNP5 calculations.Experimental spectra
           were reproduced fairly well by the MCNP5 simulations;
           the deduced parameters of the detection setup were then
           used to simulate the EPS and Fs values for the 987.8keV
           gamma-ray transition.
