FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)  Kyoto University reactor (KUR)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)  B4 supermirror neutron guide tube at the Kyoto
                   University reactor
INC-SPECT   The thermal neutron fluence rates up stream and down
           stream under the 5MW condition were 2.4E+7 n/cm**2/s
           and 2.0E+7 n/cm**2/s, respectively. The dimensions of
           the neutron beam were 14x61 mm**2.
           The neutron fluence rate during the experiments was
           monitored by measuring the counting rate of some
           gamma-rays from the 35Cl(n,g)36Cl reaction.
           Also the neutron fluence rate was checked with the
           induced activity of a 197Au(n,g)198Au reaction by
           inserting the 197Au sample every 6 hours.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Three 22%,60%,90% HPGe detectors were used to
           measure prompt gamma-rays.
           The relative detection efficiency at a
           sample-to-detector-distance of 20cm for every detector
           was predetermined using the radioactive sources 56Co
           and 152Eu and prompt gamma-rays from the 14N(n,g)15N
           with the Monte Carlo simulation code GEANT4.
           The total efficiencies,which were used to correct the
           coincidence summing effects,were experimentally
           determined by the mono-energetic gamma-sources 54Mn,
           57Co, 137Cs, 203Hg, 60Co, 88Y.
           The uncertainties of the efficiencies for the detectors
           were found to be 0.5% between 244 keV and 5MeV and
           0.7% above 5MeV.
           The counting rates were between 18 and 29 kcps, and the
           measuring times were from 6-30 h.
           The energy resolution at 1332keV was maintained at
           2.0keV for the 22% and 60% detectors and at 2.6 keV for
           the 90% detector by using high rate or ultra-high rate
           amplifiers (ORTEC937 or 937U). Five measurements were
           performed.
           An additional 38% HPGe detector was used to monitor the
           neutron fluence rate during the experiments by
           measuring the counting rate of some gamma-rays from the
           35Cl(n,g)36Cl reaction.
SAMPLE     The polyvinylidene chlorides CH(2)-CCl(2) of 42-167 mg.
           The target box and the beam shutter were made of 10-mm
           thick polytetrafluoroethylene plates that included 30%
           by weight enriched lithium fluoride 6LiF. The samples
           were glued on a thin carbon sheet and were set at 30deg
           angle against each detector in the target box.
ANALYSIS   The peak areas of gamma-rays were evaluated by the
           summation of counts in the channel interval
           Cch-3*FWHM, Cch+33*FWHM, where Cch - the peak center,
           FWHM - the full width at the half maximum of the
           gamma-ray peak.
CORRECTION For coincidence summing effects - For the 22%, 60% and
           90% HPGe detectors,the typical summing effects for the
           8578.6keV gamma-ray were found to be approximately
           0.5%,1.5% and 3.0%,respectively.
