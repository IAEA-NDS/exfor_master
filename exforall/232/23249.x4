           The nominal voltage 1.789 MV, equivalent to a proton
           energy of 3.665 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction.
            A thin Al foil serves as the energy degrader to
            generate MBNS at kT = 30 keV.
INC-SPECT   Simulation system was checked by data of neutron
           spectra produced by
           - monoenergetic proton beams as measured by Ratynski+
           and Lederer+ ;
           -broadened beam proton as measured by Feinberg+
            (see REL-REFs).
            The simulated neutron spectra compared to the MBNS at
            kT = 30 keV are on Fig.2 of J,NDS,120,205,2014.
            96% of the neutrons passed through the Au frontal
            surface; 95% through the Tb frontal surface,
            93% through the Tb back surface. Fluence ratio Au/Tb
            was estimated to be equal to 1.02.
SAMPLE     Au and Tb samples of diameter 2.4 cm, masses of
           862+-1 mg and 2178+-1 mg, respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time was about 2 h with a
           proton current of around 3 microA on target.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe from ORTEC (GMX Serie).
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG,,MXW)
           MACS for Au was used as reference.

CORRECTION  Corrections          Value+-Uncertainty(%)
           Au self-absorption -  0.988 +- 0.2
           Tb self-absorption -  0.956 +- 0.4
           Fluence ratio -       1.02 +- 0.2 .
           The neutron backscattering from air was considered
           negligible.
           298.6 kev and 297.3 keV lines were not distinguished -
           contribution of 297.3 keV line was considered as
           negligible due to low intensity (0.009).
