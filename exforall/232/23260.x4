SAMPLE     The liquid standards were spiked on cylindrical
           cellulose filters of 1.25 mm thickness and 7 mm  diam.,
           with typically 100 microliter of solution content.
           The foils were cut in disks of 8mm diameter (average).
           Packed inside plastic bags of 0.1 mm thick.
           Four samples of each material were prepared and
           irradiated per channel per irradiation exercise.
           Half of these samples were placed along the axis of a
           cylindrical polyethylene irradiation container or
           'rabbit', while the other samples were covered in
           hollow Cd cylinders of 1 mm wall thickness. Inside the
           rabbit, each sample was sandwiched between at least 2
           comparators with a 2 cm separation to each one. The
           comparator consisted in 0.1 % Au Al-alloy foils of
           0.1 mm thickness and 7 mm diameter (IRMM 530R).
           For irradiations in the thermal Cavity, the comparator
           consisted in a high-purity Au wire(Goodfellow 5150/43).

METHOD      Measurements at channel:
            S84 via Ru-105
            Y4 via Ru-105
            S84 via Rh-105-m

            S84 via Rh-105-g
            Y4 via Rh-105-g
ANALYSIS   The Q0(or s0) factors were determined by 2 different
           approaches:
          1- the classical method: from the mean (AVG) and
           observed SD of the results from all channels employed,
           when inputting the recommended Er value from
           references - 495. eV (+-10%).
          2- the a-vector method applied on up to 3 irradiation
           channels: leading to simultaneous Q0 (or s0) and Er
           determination.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Effective resonance energy defined by a-vector
           method.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) One sigma uncertainty.
           Uncertainty in the Q0 determination for for the simple
           case of one determination in one irradiation channel

           contributions from the FCd = 1 and neutron
           self-shielding effects is on average
            2.5 % for foils, 2.6 % for compounds;
           include contributions from :
           - The combined uncertainty of 1.1 % for foils and 1.2 %
           for liquids/compounds in the parameter OMEGACd .
           - A combined type-B uncertainty from the comparator Qa
           factor for channels Y4 - 1.9 % , S84 - 1.8 % .
           - A combined type-B uncertainty of 1.2 % during
           Qa -> Q0 conversion, due to the uncertainty on a and

           references - 107. eV (+-3%).
          2- the a-vector method applied on up to 3 irradiation
           channels: leading to simultaneous Q0 (or s0) and Er
           determination.

METHOD      Measurement at channels:
            Y4  - 2 samples x 3 irradiations,
            S84 - 2 samples x 3 irradiations,
            X26 - 2 sample x 2 irradiations.
ANALYSIS    An effective thermal neutron cross-section SIG was
           extrapolated with aid of the k0-definition, atomic
           weight, isotopic composition, the gamma intensities
           values.
           Defined according to their ADS(activation decay scheme,
           including decay branching factors).
COMMENT    Negligible contribution from 152m2Eu (96 min, IT 100%)
           to 152gEu was considered by authors :
            its cross-section contribution is just 4 b (0.07% of
            the ground state value). It was not subtracted.
ERR-ANALYS  Not given.
           Uncertainty on exp. SIG value comes from to the obs. SD
           between all available gamma-lines.
ADD-RES     Measured k0-values with one-sigma uncertainty:
           E-gamma,keV           k0, no-dim.

           1408.0                9.13E+0 (+-5.0%)
           The s0 factors were determined by approaches:
           1- the classical method: from the mean (AVG) and
           observed SD of the results from all channels employed,
           when inputting the recommended Er value from
           references - 5.80 eV (+-4.%).
           2- the a-vector method applied on up to 3 irradiation
           channels: leading to simultaneous s0 and Er
           determination.
            s0 factors  :
           1- channel S84 - 0.05 (+-5%), channel Y4 - 0.04(+-3.%),
            channel X26 - 0.06 (+-4%); average - 0.05 (+-18%) ;
           2-  0.05 (+-5.%).
                  Effective resonance energy Er defined by
           a-vector method - 0.17 (+-20.%).

           references - 0.61 eV .

           channels: leading to simultaneous Q0 (or s0) and Er
           determination.

           Uncertainty on exp. SIG value comes from to the obs. SD
