INC-SOURCE (AM-BE)  Three Am241-Be sources immersed in paraffin
           moderator shielded with lead bricks.
INC-SPECT  At the sample irradiation position, thermal and
           epithermal neutron fluxes were measured to be
           (1.5 +- 0.2)*10**4 and (1.4 +- 0.1)*10**3 n/cm**2/s
           respectively. The epithermal neutron spectrum shape
           factor was experimentally determined as 0.083 +- 0.016
           at the sample irradiation position.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation.
           -Irradiation times about 55-90 h for 158Gd, about 7-13h
           for 55Mn, after the irradiations the suitable waiting
           times varying up to 20 min, counting periods between 2
           and 24 hr.
           - The irradiation times for the 55Mn and 148Nd were
           chosen for a period of three to five half lives;
           the counting times varied between 2 and 7 h for 149Nd
           and between 2.5 and 10 h for 56Mn.
           - the irradiation times for Cs and Mn were chosen for
           a period of four to five half-lives.
           (CADMB)  Cadmium ratio method
CORRECTION Dead times were typically less than about 0.1%.
           Background measurements were subtracted from the sample
           spectra.
           Correction factors for gamma ray attenuation and for
           true coincidence summing were used.

SAMPLE      Gd(2)O(3) powder, purity > 99.99%, from Aldrich corp.
           Mixed with Al(2)O(3) powder to minimize errors due to
           self-shielding effect. Diluted sample (3.2% Gd(2)O(3)+
           96.8% Al(2)O(3)) and (3.4% MnO(2) + 96.6% Al(2)O(3))
           were filled in small polystyrene tubes with
           height/diameter about 2 and wall thickness of 1 mm.
           Ten diluted Gd samples (each mass of about 0.8 g) were
           individually prepared. Five were used for Cd-covered
           irradiation and the other were used for obtaining bare
           irradiation data. The same preparation - for ten Mn
           samples.

REACTION   (55-CS-133(N,G)55-CS-134-M,,RI)
SAMPLE      Cs(2)CO(3) powder, purity > 99.99%, from Aldrich corp.
           Mixed with Al(2)O(3) powder as (96.3% Al(2)O(3) +
           3.7% Cs(2)CO(3)) and (96.6% Al(2)O(3) + 3.4% MnO(2)) to
           minimize errors due to self-shielding effect.
           The diluted samples were filled in small polystyrene
           tubes with the 6.5 mm diameter, 13.1 mm height, 1 mm
           wall thickness. Ten diluted Cs-samples having each mass
           of about 0.8 g were individually prepared. Five them
           were used for Cd-covered irradiation and the other five
           samples were used for obtaining bare irradiation data.
           The same sample preparation produces were employed for
           ten Mn samples.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial n-type HPGe detector (Canberra GR2020)
           to measure induced activity. Active volume about
           100 cm**3. Measured relative efficiency of 22.6% at
           1332.5 keV of 60Co, energy resolution 1.80 keV,
           peak-to-Compton ratio of 53.5:1 at 1332.5 keV of 60Co.
           Shielded by a 10 cm thick lead lined with 1 mm copper
           sheets on all sides.
           The gamma detection efficiency as a function of energy
           was determined using the multi-nuclide standard source
           EG-ML S/N:1160-39-3 in sand matrix (SiO2: 1.7 +- 0.1
           g/cm**33) spiked with 241Am, 109Cd, 57Co, 123mTe, 51Cr,
           113Sn, 85Sr, 137Cs, 60Co, 88Y radionuclides.
           The samples were counted on the end-cap of detector.
           The counting times varied between 2 and 8 h, depending
           mainly on the activity level of 134mCs or 56Mn products
           in the samples.
ANALYSIS   Westcott correction factors g(20 degC) 1.0030 for 133Cs
           and 1.0003 for 55Mn isotopes were used in analysis.
           Calculated neutron self-shielding factors for diluted
           MnO(2)and Cs(2)CO(3) samples:
           Mn - 0.997 for thermal neutrons, 0.903 for epithermal,
           Cs - 0.998 for thermal neutrons, 0.901 for epithermal.
           Correction factor for gamma ray attenuation
                      for Mn - 1.010, for Cs - 1.046.
           True coincidence summing factor
                      for Mn - 0.963, for Cs - 0.999 .
           Effective resonance energy for Mn - 468+-51 eV,
                                      for Cs - 9.27+-1.02 eV .
