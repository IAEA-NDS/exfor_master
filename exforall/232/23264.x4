INC-SOURCE (REAC) Cold neutron beam
INC-SPECT   The energy distribution of the cold neutron beam  is
           presented on Fig.2 of J,NDS,119,69,2014.
           The neutron flux was determined using the count rate
           of the 412 keV peak and the counting efficiency of the
           detector.
           Thermal equivalent flux of 2.5*10**10 1/cm2/s .
METHOD     (ACTIV) Samples were irradiated for 5 to 12 h at a
           thermal equivalent flux of 2.5*10**10 1/cm2/s .
           The decay radiation was counted for 1 hr.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectra were measured using a
           DSPEC 50 MCA and a 60-% n-type Poptop HPGe detector.
           152Eu and 133Ba calibration sources with a given
           uncertainty of 1.5% were measured in order to calculate
           the detector efficiency.
COMMENT    This work was done with financial support by the
           Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)
           under grant 02S9052A.

           The activity of the 241Am was determined with an
           uncertainty of 0.75 %.

           The Kalpha x-rays of 242Pu following the electron
           capture decay of the 242gAm(16.02(2) h) are used for
           the capture cross section determination.
           The emission probability from the 242Pu x-rays were
           taken from : M.B+, Table of Radionuclides Vol. V.:
           Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (2010).
MONITOR    (79-AU-198(N,G)79-AU-199,PAR,SIG)
            For neutron flux.
CORRECTION  Corrections for photon absorption in the quartz glass,
           for the neutron absorption in the gold foil (0.3 %) and
           the decay corrections were applied to obtain the
           saturation activity.
           The contribution of influence of the 241Am gamma-rays
            (98.97 keV, 102.98 keV) in the order of 5-10% was also
           subtracted.
ANALYSIS   The region of peaks was integrated channel by channel a
           the baseline subtracted. After corrections the
           Am-242(n,Gamma)Am-242g cross-section was determined fro
           the amount of Am-242, the saturation activity and the
           measured neutron flux.
