FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) PF1B neutron beam line
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Moderated to the thermal neutrons.
SAMPLE     No information
METHOD     (TOF) For fission fragments velocity and.
           (PHD) For kinetic energy of fragments measurement in
           ionization chambers.
           Mass resolution ~4 m.u., energy resolution ~1 MeV.
PART-DET   (G,FF,N) Fission fragments, gammas, neutrons
DETECTOR   (SPEC,IOCH,NAICR) SpecTrometer for Exotic Fission
           Fragments(STEFF) is 2-velocity, 2-Energy spectrometer
           to measure independently both the mass and kinetic
           energy of both fission fragments.
           Neutrons were measured by NaI(Tl) detectors.
           The response function matrix was produced by performing
           a large series of Geant4 simulations of monochromatic
           sources which were compared with measured (with STEFF)
           lines from 60Co and 137Cs.
COMMENT    This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical
           Sciences Research Council in the UK.

ANALYSIS   Measured fold distribution was fitted by Monte Carlo
           simulation using a skewed Gaussian distribution based
           upon the Huizenga and Vandenbosch statistical model of
           gamma-ray de-excitation from a fission fragment.
