           Scientific Workshop on Nuclear Fission Dynamics and the
           Emission of Prompt Neutrons and Gamma Rays, Biarritz,
           France, 28-30 November 2012.
INSTITUTE  (2FR BRC)
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR BRC)
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
INC-SPECT  Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons.
DETECTOR  A(FISCH) Ionization chambers filled with P10 gas (10%
           methane, 90% argon) and containing several tens of
           parallel plate electrodes on which the actinides sample
           was deposited. For fission fragments detection.
          B(SCIN) The neutron detector was manufactured by
           Cryos-Beta and consists of an organic crystal of doped
           p-terphenyl C(18)H(14) coupled to a photomultiplier
           Photonis XP53X2). The crystal is a cylinder of 75 mm
           diameter, 500 mm length,  density of 1.23 g/cm3.
           The energy resolution of the detector was determined
           using gamma-sources in an energy range from 59.5 to
           1836 keV. For 137Cs (662 keV) about 10% (FWHM) was
           obtained. The energy calibration for gamma-rays was
           carried out by using the gamma-sources mentioned.
           Energy calibration for neutrons the detector was
           irradiated with spontaneous fission neutrons from
           a 252Cf source. A TOF spectrum was recorded and
           converted into energy.
           The total neutron efficiency consists of two
           components:
            a) the geometric acceptance corresponding to the solid
           angle - (2.73+-0.29)*10**-4,
            b) an intrinsic component, which is a function of the
           detected neutron energy, was determined by a PFNS
           measurement by using a point-like 252Cf(SF) source.
           The para-terphenyl detector (sensitive to neutrons and
           gamma-rays) was placed at a distance of about 1 m from
           the fission chamber perpendicular to the ion beam axis.
