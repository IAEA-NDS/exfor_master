TITLE      Spectrum-integrated helium generation cross sections
            for 6Li and 10B in the Sigma-Sigma and fission cavity
            standard neutron fields
AUTHOR     (B.M.Oliver, H.Farrar IV, E.P.Lippincott, A.Fabry)
INSTITUTE  (1USAAI,1USAHED,2BLGMOL)
REFERENCE  (C,82GAITHERS,2,889,1982)
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) BR1 reactor
METHOD     (HE-AC)
CORRECTION - Neutron perturbations due to neutron self-shielding
              and flux depression, neutron flux gradients over
              the irradiation assemblies, and assembly scattering
           - Subtraction of the small epithermal helium;
              contribution by placement of samples 30 cm above
              and below the central region of Cd tube not wrapped
              by U235 (for fission cavity measurements);
           - Subtraction of 19F helium production for 6LiF sample
             (23 mb for fission cavity, 5 mb for Sigma-Sigma).

INC-SPECT  235U fission spectrum
SAMPLE     The following samples were in an Al cylindrical box
            (8 mm OD, 46 mm long):
            - Encapsulated enriched (93.0%) boron-10
            - Bare natural (19.8%) boron crystal
            - Encapsulated enriched (99.1%) 6LiF
            - Bare enriched (99.1%) 6LiF crystals
           Three such Al boxes were at three locations (+30 cm,
            0 cm, -30 cm) of 1 m Cd tube (10 mm OD, 8 mm ID).
           The central 6.8-cm section of the Cd tube was wrapped
            by 0.1-mm-thick enriched (93%) 235U foil.
