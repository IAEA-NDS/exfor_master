FACILITY   (LINAC,2TUKCNA) SAMES T-400 Neutron Generator in
           combination with a Fast Sample Transfer System (FSTS),
           which can deliver the sample from the irradiation
           position to HpGe detector or vice versa within 0.5 s.
SAMPLE     Sample pellets of 13 mm diameter, 8.5 mm thickness,
           about 2 g weight were pressed from the natural,
           high-purity (99.9%) Sm(2)O(3), and Al2O3 powders.
           Water contents in the samples were removed by heating
           the oxide materials up to 105 deg C, then they were
           kept in a desiccator for 0.5 h to cool down to the room
           temperature; next they were filled into dry stainless
           steel capsules and pressed to form a dense pellet; the
           pellets were tightly packed into thin polyethylene
           boxes and sealed-off.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)   H-3(D,N)He-4 reaction . deuteron beam current
           300 microA, accelerating voltage 250 kV.
INC-SPECT  At the irradiation place (70 mm from neutron source),
           neutron fluxes are measured to be from 0.9E+7 to 1.6E+7
           n/cm2/s, depending on the neutron target condition.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Six different positions around the target
           holder inclined at 45 deg were used. The angles of
           the irradiation positions along the deuteron beam were
           0, 30, 60, 120, 130 deg,which correspond to the neutron
           energies 14.83, 14.75, 14.52, 14.15, 13.75, 13.57 MeV,
           respectively. The effective energies of the incident
           neutrons at each sample position were determined by the
           ratios of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+, 1982) and
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway, 1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis+, 1980)
           and procedure of the energy measurement is given in
           detail in Subasi+(1996).
           Acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front of
           the detector to protect samples from beta particles.
           and to minimize the photon absorption and production
           bremsstrahlung.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error 21.5-47.2%) includes errors due to:
           (ERR-1) Sample weight,
           (ERR-2) Concentration of the element,
           (ERR-3) Isotopic abundance,
           (ERR-4) Counting solid angle and intrinsic efficiency
           of the gamma detector,
           (ERR-S,21.,47.) Statistical uncertainty (full energy
            photo-peak area),
           (ERR-5) Neutron flux fluctuation,
           (ERR-6) Effective neutron flux ( including reference
             cross section),
           (ERR-7) Irradiation, cooling and measuring times.
            The uncertainties were assumed to be uncorrelated,
           the total uncertainties in the cross section values
           could be determined by adding the experimental errors
           and the uncertainties of nuclear data into the
           quadratic function.
