           Accurate Neutron-Nucleus Reaction measurement
           Instrument (ANNRI) at Japan Proton Accelerator
           Research Complex (J-PARC). J-PARC was operated at a
           beam power of 280 kW, a pulse width of 100 ns in the
           'double-bunch mode' and a repetition rate of 25 Hz.
           The interval between double-bunched pulses was 600 ns.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutron beam line No.4(BL04) of the Materials
           and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF) in the
           Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) .
           The neutron beam was collimated to a diameter of 7mm at
           the sample position.
SAMPLE      Metal sintered disks of 5 mm diameter.
           Each sample was sealed in a bag of fluorinated ethylene
           propylene (FEP) films and fixed to a sample folder.
           A NaCl sample of 5mm diameter, 500mg weight was used to
           define the full-energy-peak efficiency via the relative
           intensities of prompt gamma rays from the 35Cl(n,gamma)
           reaction at thermal neutron energy.
           The total measuring time for thin and thick 74Se
           samples, 77Se sample, NaCl sample were 32.0, 17.2,
           35.7, 2.6 hours, respectively.
METHOD     (TOF,PHD) TOF and PH spectra were measured.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) 4PI Ge spectrometer:
            two cluster-Ge detectors, eight coaxial-Ge detectors,
            surrounded by BGO compton-suppression detectors.
           Located at 21.5m from the center of a moderator at
           Japan Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS).
ANALYSIS   The relative intensity of each primary transition was
           obtained by dividing the net peak counts by the
           full energy-peak efficiency. The relative intensity was
           normalized so that the sum of them was 100 %.
ERR-ANALYS         Uncertainty in the correction factors of the
           self-shielding - 5%.
CORRECTION  For dead-time.
            For backgrounds.

           Observed primary gamma-rays from the 27-eV resonance.
           The relative intensity was normalized so that the sum
           of them was 100 %.
REL-REF    (D,12728012,G.Engler+,J,NP/A,372,125,1981)
            Re-normalized for comparison.
           The previous relative intensities of Engler+ are
           consistent with the present data above 6 MeV, but for
           lower energies they are larger than the present ones by
           a factor of two, or were not observed.
SAMPLE      Isotopic enriched samples of 74Se(99.96%).
           74Se samples weights of 0.25 mg and 89.0 mg.
           In the thin sample, carbon powder with a weight of 10mg
           was mixed as a dilution material.
ANALYSIS   The relative intensity of each primary transition was
           obtained by dividing the net peak counts by the
           full energy-peak efficiency. The relative intensity was
           normalized so that the sum of them was 100 %.
