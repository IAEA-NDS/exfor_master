SAMPLE     - Dried powder samples of high purity of the natural
           Nd2)O(3) (99.99%) were pressed to make four pellets of
           13mm diameter, 8.5 mm thickness, about 2 g weight.
           The pellets were tightly packed in to thin polyethylene
           boxes.
           - The sample preparation procedure was also applied for
           the Al(2)O(3 )(99.99%) powders.
            All neodymium samples were irradiated and counted for
           10 cycles.

           300 microA average atomic deuteron beam,
           accelerating voltage 250 kV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  The angles of the irradiation positions to the
           deuteron beam were 0, 30, 90, 130 deg, which correspond
           to the neutron energies 14.83,14.75,14.15,13.57 MeV,
           respectively. The effective energies of the incident
           neutrons at each sample position were determined by the
           ratios of 90Zr(n,2n)89Zr (3.27 d) (Pavlik+, 1982) and
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb (10.15 d) (Nethaway, 1978) reaction
           cross sections (the Zr/Nb ratio method) (Lewis+, 1980)
           and procedure of the energy measurement is given in
           detail in Subasi+(1996).
           Acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front of
           the detector to protect samples from beta particles
           and to minimize the photon absorption and production
           bremsstrahlung.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma counting system with a HpGe detector.
           Acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness was placed in front of
           the detector to protect samples from beta particles
           and to minimize the photon absorption and production
           bremsstrahlung.
           (SCIN) During irradiation, the neutron flux was
           monitored by the plastic scintillation detector(NE102A)
           placed under the target, on which the fast neutrons are
           produced.

ANALYSIS   139mCe (via 142Nd(n,a) ) and 141mNd (via 142Nd(n,2n) )
           radionuclides in the gamma ray spectrum had
           754.24+-0.08 keV and 756.51+-0.05 keV gamma lines,
           respectively. The search and determination of the photo
           peaks were performed using the SAMPO90 program.
           The calibration spectrum obtained by the standard
           sources (60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, 241Am) was processed to
           obtain the proper energy and peak shape calibrations.
           The goodness(KHI2) and variance of the fitting
           performed for the multiple photo-peaks were 1.0 and
           0.3, respectively.
           The cross sections were calculated from the cyclic
           activation formula.
CORRECTION Dead time and self-absorption corrections  - 4%.
           The low energy neutron contribution due to scattering
           in the target materials reached rates up to 10%. The
           effect of low energy neutrons in the sample pellets
           packed in thin (1mm thickness) polyethylene boxes was
           determined by the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code; rate of less
           than 1% was found, which can be neglected.
           The attenuation of the gamma rays in the acrylic beta
           absorber.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty (37.5-38.6 %) includes :
           (ERR-1) Sample weight,
           (ERR-2) Concentration of the element,
           (ERR-3) Isotopic abundance,
           (ERR-4) Relative gamma-ray intensity,
           (ERR-5) Counting solid angle and intrinsic efficiency
           of the gamma detector,
           (ERR-S,37.2,38.3) Statistical uncertainty (full energy
            photo-peak area),
           (ERR-6) Neutron flux fluctuation,
           (ERR-7) Effective neutron flux ( including reference
             cross section),
           (ERR-8) Irradiation, cooling and measuring times.
            The uncertainties were assumed to be uncorrelated,
           the total uncertainties in the cross section values
           could be determined by adding the experimental errors
           and the uncertainties of nuclear data into the
           quadratic function.
