FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE)
           Accurate Neutron-Nucleus Reaction measurement
           Instrument (ANNRI) of Materials and Life science
           experimental Facility (MLF) in Japan Proton Accelerator
           Research Complex (J-PARC).
           J-PARC was operated at a repetition rate 25 Hz, a power
           210 kW, in the 'double-bunch mode' - each proton pulse
           consists of two bunches of 100ns width each at interval
           of 600 ns.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)
INC-SPECT   The energy-integrated neutron intensities were
           9.1E+10 n/s/m2 in the neutron energy range 1.5 -25 meV
           and 1.2E+10 n/s/m2 at 0.9 - 1.1 keV under a proton
           beam power of 210 kW .
           The neutron spectrum was measured by detecting the
           478keV gamma rays from B-10(n,alpha+gamma)7Li reaction.
SAMPLE      Metallic tin samples of 5mm diameter .
           Background was measured without sample and with Pb-208
           sample of 5 mm diameter, 159.7 mg weight, isotopic
           enrichment 99.60 mole%.
METHOD     (TOF) The total measuring time was about 38 hr for the
           Sn-112 and Sn-118 samples, about 23 hr for the empty
           sample and 17 hr for the Pb-208 sample.
PART-DET   (G) Energies of observed gamma-rays are in Table I
           of J,NDS,119,150,2014 .
DETECTOR   (GE) The array of Ge detectors is composed of 22 Ge
           crystals and located on the flight length of 21.5 m
ERR-ANALYS         Uncertainty in the correction factors of the
           self-shielding - 5%.
CORRECTION  For dead-time.
            For backgrounds - frame-overlap; due to scattered
           neutrons. The backgrounds were normalized with the
           areas of the 7724-keV gamma peaks from 27Al(n,gamma)
           reaction.
            For self-shielding of the samples.
            For contributions of impurities.

SAMPLE     Sn-112 : 97.3mg, isotopic enrichment 99.65 mole% with
           0.3 mole% and 0.05 mole% isotopic contaminations of
           Sn-114 and Sn-115,respectively.
ANALYSIS   Resonance energies were defined by measured point-wise
           neutron-capture cross-section normalized by the thermal
           cross-section measured by K.S.Krane+.
           Resonances 21.02, 40.38, 166. keV were not observed.

FLAG       (1.) The gamma rays were not observed clearly, because
           the number of the events was not enough.
           (2.) The gamma rays were observed clearly, but the
           resonances were overlapped each other.
