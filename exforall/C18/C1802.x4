FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 565 mg/cm2 and 376 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN)30Ne fragments were identified by
           momentum and energy loss measurements at the S800
           focal plane, and by time of flight between the A1900
           and S800 focal plane scintillators.
           (HPGE)Gamma rays from reactions on the secondary
           target were detected using SeGA (Segmented Germanium
           Array), consisting of seventeen 32-fold segmented
           germanium detectors situated 20 cm from the target
           in two rings at 90deg and 37deg relative to the beam
           axis.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF,COINC)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT)32Mg ions were produced by fragmenting a 140
           MeV/nucleon 48Ca beam on a 850 mg/cm2 9Be production
           target.The A1900 fragment separator, operated with a
           2% momentum acceptance, was used to select and
           transport the 32Mg beam.
CORRECTION Corrections for the data acquisition dead time, the
           S800 focal plane acceptance for 30Ne residues, and
           detector efficiencies were applied.
