FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment performed at the Holifield
           Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at ORNL
SAMPLE     Hydrogen gas in the scattering chamber at pressures
           up to 3 torr
DETECTOR   (SISD) The alpha particles and heavy recoils were
           detected in coincidence within the gas-filled chamber
           by the SIDAR silicon detector array and a Micron Type
           S1 detector, respectively. Eight SIDAR detectors were
           arranged in a flat annular array with sixteen 0.5-cm
           strips covering radii from 5 to 13 cm.S1-style 300
           micron thick detectors has four quadrants of 16 rings
           subtending radii from 2.4 to 4.8 cm in 1.5 mm strips.
           The SIDAR array was located 115mm from the entrance
           of the chamber, while the S1 detector was positioned
           220 mm downstream of SIDAR.
METHOD     New method developed for resonant (p,a) studies was
           used. In this method, the reaction vertex can be
           determined from the energy of  alpha particles
           detected in SIDAR array. Inverse kinematics was used,
           all heavy recoils were detected in S1 detector.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in measured stopping
                   power of 31P ions in hydrogen gas
           (ERR-2) Systematic uncertainty in the strength of
                   the 244Cm alpha source used for determining
                   the solid angle of the monitor detectors
           (ERR-3) Systematic uncertainty in the effective solid
                   angle coverage from uncertainties in the
                   angular distribution
           (ERR-4) Systematic uncertainty in the carbon foil
                   thickness due to uncertainties in the stopping
                   power of alpha particles in carbon.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
