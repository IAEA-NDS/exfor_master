REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,81,055804,2010)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the 1-MV Van de
           Graaff accelerator at the Triangle Universities
           Nuclear Laboratory
SAMPLE     Sample was a 1mm thick aluminum sheet (99% purity)
           with implanted  layer of 22Ne. The ion implanter
           accelerated  neon ions from a pressurized natural
           neon (9.25% +- 0.03%  molar fraction of 22Ne) gas
           bottle to an energy of 100 keV. A 90 deg analyzing
           magnet (with a quoted selectivity of 1/100) was  used
           to mass separate the 22Ne ions. The incident dose of
           22Ne was estimated by integrating the beam current
           on the backing, assuming singly charged incident
           22Ne ions. The beam current on the backing amounted
           to about 20 mu-A on average. The total accumulated
           charge was 0.26 C (corresponding to 1.6E+18  incident
           22Ne ions) over a circular implantation region of
           2.5 cm in diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Capture gamma rays from the excited compound
           nuclei (28Si and 23Na) were detected using a 135%
           relative efficiency HPGe detector. The detector was
           located at 55 deg with respect to the  beam direction
           at a distance of 3.0 cm from the center of the target.
METHOD     Depth profiling technique was used to determine depth
           profile of 22Na ions implanted in surface layer of
           27Al. Analysing the resonance gamma ray yield of
           22Na(p,g) resonance at 479 keV and 27Al(p,g) resonance
           at 406 keV, the strength of 22Na(p,g) resonance was
           determined relatively to the strength of 27Al(p,g)
           resonance.
CORRECTION Corrected for contributions from 27Al(p,gamma)
           resonances at 326 keV and 447 keV.
