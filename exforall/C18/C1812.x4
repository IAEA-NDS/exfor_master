TITLE      Tritium and Neutron Production by 2.2-Bev Protons on
           Nitrogen and Oxygen

REFERENCE  (J,PR,97,780,1955)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Experiment performed at the
           Brookhaven Cosmotron
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,,SIG) All cross sections
           calculated assuming that cross section of monitor
           reaction is 9.0 mb at 2.2 GeV proton energy
INC-SOURCE Activation method was used for incident
           proton flux and neutron yield  determination.
HISTORY    (20100923C) Compiled by S.H.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Probably only statistical uncertainty
           included. Systematic uncertainty connected with
           monitor reaction cross section is NOT included

SAMPLE     0.1N HNO3 water sample in AL cylinder with diameter of
           4.4cm and length of 6.3cm and 10.1 cm with wall
           thickness of 0.12cm. Three cylinders with total length
           of 22.7 cm were used. Sample weight was 250g.
DETECTOR   Neutrons were determined and measured by activation
           of series of In foils embedded in a cadmium covered
           paraffin block.
