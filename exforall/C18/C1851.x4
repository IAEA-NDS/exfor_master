INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USALAS) 2.5 MeV Los Alamos electrostatic
           generators.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) The horizontal bars on the
           figures are not errors but indicate the energy spread
           due to target thickness.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4pi scintillation counter.
SAMPLE     The 016 targets used for the different runs were cut
           out of a single sheet of 0.70 mg/cm2 muscovite mica.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Thin mica targets were irradiated by various
           energy triton beams. The decay was followed in each
           case for at least eight half-lives and usually more.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The values of the absolute cross section
           are only good to about 20 percent due to the
           difficulty of obtaining a reliable absolute
           measurement. Because of this difficulty the vertical
           scale should be considered only as a rough indication
           of the absolute value.
           (DATA-ERR) Pointwise error bars from the figure.
