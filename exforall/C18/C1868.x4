FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANMNA) Experiment performed at the
           University of Manitoba sector- focussed cyclotron
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CSICR) Series of 4 plastic scintillation (two
           button + two annular) detectors defined the incident
           proton beam. Additional thin plastic scintillator
           placed behind the target detected 98% of beam
           protons. CsI scintillation detector subtended angle
           of 45.5 deg detected elastically scattered protons at
           angles less than 45.5 deg.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission method was used, elastically
           scattered protons were not included in total cross
           section.
CORRECTION  To obtain total reaction cross section, to raw cross
           section were applied corrections for
            - elastic scattering
            - inelastic scattering
            - for protons which underwent nuclear reaction in
              detector and did not deposited enough energy

SAMPLE     (12-MG-24,ENR=0.99) Thickness of the target was 39.3+-
           0.2 mg/cm2. The 24Mg target was transferred to the
           apparatus in an argon atmosphere and surface
           contamination with oxygen or nitrogen was estimated
           to be less than 1% by weight
