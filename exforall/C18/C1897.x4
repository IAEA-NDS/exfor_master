TITLE      Inclusive measurement of (p,pi-xn) double charge
           exchange reactions on bismuth from threshold to 800 MeV

INC-SOURCE Proton beams from 120 to 214 MeV at IUCF, from 188 to
           481 MeV at TRIUMF and 800 MeV at LAMPF.
SAMPLE     For the TRIUMF and LAMPF measurements the target was
           made of a thin bismuth layer (0.8-2 mg/cm )
           evaporated onto thin aluminum backing. Due to the
           lower currents at IUCF, thick targets (10-45 mg/cm )
           had to be used.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR,GELI)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,RCHEM,ASPEC,GSPEC) Two identical targets
           were irradiated at each proton energy. The first
           target was put aside for several hours to allow for
           the short-lived activities to decay. The radioisotope
           211At is in secular equilibrium with its decay
           product 211Po which emits a distinct high energy
           alpha (7.45 MeV). The yield of these alphas is
           directly related  to the production rate of
           211At. The second target underwent chemical
           separation for astatine immediately after the
           irradiation. The chemically separated astatine
           activities were determined by simultaneous alpha and
           gamma counting. Whenever possible, measurements were
           carried out by both systems and the degree of
           agreement was used to determined the reliability of
           the two systems.
ANALYSIS   (PGS,INTED) All gamma spectra were analyzed with
           GAMANAL program, and alpha spectra were integrated by
           hand. To determine cross sections, authors first
           calculated the effective cross section sigma(211At)
           for the production of 211At from the yield in the
           direct target; then multiplied this effective cross
           section by the ratio of yields 210-xAt/211At in the
           chemically separated target of the same thickness.

COMMENT    Beam integration at IUCF was measured with a Faraday
           cup, while at TRIUMF and LAMPF it was deduced from
           the 24Na activity produced in thin aluminum foils
            (1.85 mg/cm2) of the same area as the target.

           The measured cross sections were summed up for each
           bombarding energy to yield the observed cross
           section. This cross section is not total, since
           products lighter than 203At were not included due to
           their short half-lives.
