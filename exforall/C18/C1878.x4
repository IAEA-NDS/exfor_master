FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the coupled
           cyclotron facility of the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory, East Lansing
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target placed 65 cm upstream of the
           pivot point of the S800 spectrograph. The target had
           an average thickness of 60 mg/cm2 and was contained
           by 125 mu-m thick Kapton foils.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons from the (p,n) reaction were detected
           in Low-Energy Neutron Detector Array (LENDA),
           consisting of 24 plastic scintillators bars placed at
           beam height and at 1 m from the target. Each bar had
           a vertical height of 300 mm, a depth along the axis
           through the target of 25 mm, and a width of 45 mm.
           Laboratory angles between 20deg and 70deg were
           covered, with gaps of 1.7deg between bars.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy was determined using time of
                 flight
           Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE A 20-pnA, 160 MeV/A beam of 58Ni from the NSCL
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility struck a 410 mg/cm2 thick
           Be production target at the entrance of the A1900
           fragment separator. The secondary beam was
           purified by placing a 237 mg/cm2 thick aluminum wedge
           at the intermediate image and a momentum-defining
           slit at the A1900 focal plane. The resulting cocktail
           beam of N = 28 isotones, with a momentum spread of
           0.25%, had an intensity of 8E+5 pps and contained
           56Ni at 110 MeV/A(66%), 55Co at 106 MeV/A (32%), and
           54Fe(2%) at 102 MeV/A. The beam energies were obtained
           by injecting the beams into the spectrograph and
           measuring their momenta. The time of flight (TOF)
           between an in-beam diamond detector placed upstream
           of the target and a plastic scintillator placed in
           the focal plane of the spectrograph uniquely labeled
           the isotopes in the cocktail beam.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty taking into account the
           efficiencies of the detectors and particle
           identification gates,transmission of the beam
           from the diamond detector to the target, and the
           dead time of the data acquisition system
