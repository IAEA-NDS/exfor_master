SAMPLE     Liquid helium target with length of 15 cm
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Protons were detected with three plastic
           scintillation counters. Two plastic scintillation
           detectors with diameter of 0.7cm defined the incident
           proton beam. Third plastic counter with diameter of
           15 cm, located 73 cm behind the target was used to
           detect scattered protons.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission method was used
CORRECTION Following correction were made
             - for multiple scattering
             - for undetected (p,n) channel
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given

REACTION   (2-HE-4(P,TOT),,SIG,,AV/MSC) Total p+He cross section
             defined as the cross section for an incident proton
             not to leave helium target in forward direction in a
             cone with half-angle of 5.95 deg
