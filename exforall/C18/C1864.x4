TITLE      An associated particle method for measuring total
           proton reaction cross sections at 15.8 MeV

DETECTOR   (CSICR) CsI(Tl) scintillator was chosen as the proton
           detector.
           (SI) Silicon detector was used as associated particle
           counter
INC-SOURCE  D(3He,p)4He reaction was used to produce 15.8 MeV
            protons.  Associated particle (4He) method was used to
            tag 15.8 MeV protons. The deuterium source target
            was a heavy water ice deposited on a thin cooper foil
            held at liquid nitrogen temperature. Thickness of the
            source target was 100 keV for 3He energy of 690 keV
