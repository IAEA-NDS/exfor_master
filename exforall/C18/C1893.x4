FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State
           University.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analyzed with
           S800 spectrograph and identified using set of
           detectors in focal plane
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber was used to measure energy
           loss of reaction products
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillation detectors were used to
           measure time of flight of projectile ions and reaction
           products. Two scintilation detectors were placed
           before the reaction target for incident particle
           identification
           (HPGE) The SeGA array of 32-fold segmented high-
           purity germanium detectors, was used to detect the
           de-excitation gamma rays emitted by the reaction
           residues. Sixteen of the SeGA detectors were arranged
           in two rings with relative angles of 90 deg (9
           detectors) and 37 deg (7 detectors) with respect to
           the beam axis. The high degree of segmentation allows
           for event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the
           gamma rays emitted by the projectile-like reaction
           residues in flight.
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Projectile beam containing 48Cr and 50Fe was
           produced by fragmentation of a 160-MeV/nucleon 58Ni
           primary beam. The 893 mg/cm2 thick 9Be production
           target was located at the mid-acceptance target
           position of NSCL's A1900 fragment separator. An
           achromatic Al wedge of 300 mg/cm2 thickness together
           with slit systems were used to optimize the beam
           purity on 50Fe. The resulting cocktail beam of N = 24
           isotones was transmitted to the reaction target
           position of the S800 spectrograph at typical rates of
           2500, 2000, and 500 particles/s and purities of 39%,
           40%, and 11%, respectively, for 48Cr, 49Mn, and 50Fe
           at dp/p = 1% total A1900 momentum acceptance.
ANALYSIS   Reaction products were identified by energy loss and
           time of flight. Primary particles were identified by
                               their time of flight.
