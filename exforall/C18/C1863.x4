FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the external
           proton beam from the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility
METHOD     (TRN)
INC-SOURCE Incident protons with energy of 800 MeV elastically
           scattered on hydrogen at an angle of 17.5deg
           resulted in secondary proton beam with energy of 700
           MeV. Liquid hydrogen 2cm target cell was enclosed in
           a scattering chamber with 0.051 mm Mylar windows.
           Scattered protons were collimated by 40 cm long lead
           collimator with aperture of 5cm x 5cm.
           The incident beam of protons elastically scattered
           on hydrogen was counted by a pair of multiwire
           proportional chambers 16cm x 16cm immediately in
           front of the calcium target.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Charged particles produced in interaction with
           Ca target were detected by a pair of multiwire
           chambers 32cm x 32cm located about 12 cm behind the
           target. Proton interactions in the calcium target
           which produced only a neutral particle could not be
           detected. Largest detected scattering angle was 62deg.
ANALYSIS   The total reaction cross sections were obtained
           by integration over all angles of the inelastic
           differential cross section and by extrapolation of
           those cross sections to zero degrees.
           The single reaction channel which produces only a
           neutral particle in the final state is the (p,n)
           reaction and has been estimated to be about 2% of
           the total reaction cross section for
           660 MeV protons on medium-weight nuclei.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Syst. uncertainty in incident number of protons
           (ERR-2) Syst. uncertainty in target thickness
           (ERR-3) Syst. uncertainty in delta ray subtraction
           (ERR-4) Syst. uncertainty in extrapolation to zero deg.
           (ERR-5) Rel. uncertainty in extrapolation to zero deg.
           (ERR-6) Rel. uncertainty in delta ray subtraction
           (ERR-7) Rel. uncertainty in dead time losses
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           The inability to detect (p,n)channel introduce a
           small error in the absolute values for the total
           reaction cross sections.
