FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Measurement was performed at the
           Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) radioactive
           beam facility, TRIUMF.
SAMPLE     Two (CH2)n targets were used during the experiment with
           thicknesses of 32+-2 and 34+-2 mu-g/cm2, respectively.
           The hydrogen content of the target was monitored by
           measuring the ratio of hydrogen to carbon recoils
           scattered, at a given angle, by the beam. When the
           ratio dropped significantly, the target was replaced.
INC-SOURCE High-intensity 18F4+ beam with average 5 x 10E+6 pps
           from ISAC was used.The 18-O contamination in the beam
           was monitored throughout the experiment and dropped
           from an initial 70% (during 673 keV runs) to less
           than 5% during the 250 keV data runs.
DETECTOR   (SISD) Coincident alpha-particle and heavy-ion
           products were detected by highly segmented silicon
           strip detector arrays, providing particle energy,
           time-of-flight, and scattering angle information. One
           silicon strip detector array (LEDA-2) was positioned
           upstream covering laboratory angles from 120 to 146
           deg. Three further silicon strip detector arrays
            (LEDA-1,S2-1,S2-2) covered downstream laboratory
           angles from 4 to 69deg.
METHOD     (EDE)
MONITOR    (8-O-18(P,A)7-N-15,,SIG) Monitor reaction was used
           only at 673.0 and 453.0 keV incident energy
