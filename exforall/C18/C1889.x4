FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANTMF)Experiment performed at the TRIUMF
           facility in Vancouver using DRAGON recoil separator
SAMPLE     High purity (99.9%) target with thickness of
           50 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The DRAGON recoil separator was used at 0deg
           to select the 28Si recoils
           (BGO) BGO array was used to record the gamma rays in
           coincidence with heavy recoils identified by a
           detector place at the DRAGON focal plane
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between heavy recoils in focal
           plane detector and gamma rays in BGO array was required
           (EDE) Energy loss method was used to identify charge
           and of the recoils.
