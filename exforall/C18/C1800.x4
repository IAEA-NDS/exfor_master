FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment performed at the HRIBF
           facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using
           primary cyclotron ORIC, 25-MV tandem Van de Graaff
           and the Daresbury Recoil Separator.
SAMPLE     Windowless hydrogen gas target. Target areal density
           was (6.9 +- 0.2)E+18 atoms/cm2 at 5.5 torr of H2
DETECTOR   (SPEC)The Daresbury Recoil Separator (DRS) has been
           used to separate the  recoils of interest from the
           unreacted primary beam. The main elements are  two
           Wien velocity filters. The system is appended with a
           magnetic dipole and  three quadrupole triplets to
           focus selected reaction product onto focal  plane.
           (IOCH)Selected ions were identified in focal plane
           with a segmented,  isobutane filled gas ionization
           counter
METHOD     (OLMS) Mass separation of reaction products by two
           Wien filters was used.

INC-SOURCE A mixed 17F/17O beam (17F was typically 35% of
           the total beam) was used to bombard the windowless
           hydrogen  gas target. Beam currents as high as 2E+7
           17F ions/s  were obtained.

INC-SOURCE A mixed 7BeO/7LiO beam was injected into the Tandem
           Van de Graaff  accelerator where the molecules were
           broken up during stripping at the  terminal. Positive
           7Be/7Li ions were then further accelerated  before
           delivery to the DRS. Beam currents peaked  at about
           2E+7 7Be/s with typical beam compositions of  7Li/7Be
           = 7/1.
