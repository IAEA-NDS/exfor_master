           (J,JP/CS,322,012007,2011)  Preliminary data
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed at the TwinSol
           facility at the University of Notre Dame.
SAMPLE     Several samples of natural Ni or enriched 58Ni were
           used during experiment. The thickness of natural
           samples varied between 1.36 and 5.60 mg/cm2.
           Thickness of enriched 58Ni samples varied between
           0.725 and 0.924 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Several dE-E silicon surface-
           barrier telescopes were used at backward angles to
           detect protons evaporated from the fused system.
           Either three telescopes at 120,135 and 150 deg or
           four telescopes at 112.5, 127.5,142.5 and 157.5 deg
           were used in various experimental runs.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
INC-SOURCE The 8B beams were generated using the 3He(6Li,8B)
           reaction at the TwinSol facility at the University of
           Notre Dame. Primary 6Li3+ beams with energies between
           31 and 38 MeV produced the 8B beams with energies
           between 22.4 and 30.0 MeV. Primary beam currents for
           the different stages varied from 50 to 220 particle-
           nanoamperes (pnA), yielding secondary beam rates of
            (0.5-2.7)E+4 ions/s. The most relevant contaminants
           and typical yields (relative to 8B) were 3He2+ (45%)
           and 7Li3(45%).
ANALYSIS   Cross section are based on measurement of protons
           evaporated from fused system in backward direction.
           Fusion cross sections values are based on the
           assumption that complete fusion (CF) is the only
           mechanism responsible for the observed proton
           yields

MISC-COL   (MISC)  Effective fusion energies were determined
                   iteratively and include a correction for mean
                   energy loss in the target obtained by using
                   successive Wong-model fits to the data as
                   weighting functions. Cross sections data as
                   sent by author depend on fusion energy.
