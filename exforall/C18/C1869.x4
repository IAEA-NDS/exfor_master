REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,84,045802,2011)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment performed at the ATLAS
           facility at Argonne National Laboratory
SAMPLE     CH2 target with thickness of a 650 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SISD)The alpha particles were detected
           in a 1000 mu-m thick annular double-sided Si detector
            (DSSD) with a back plane segmented into 16 wedges and
           a front  plane divided into 16 rings segmented in
           theta(lab). The detector was placed such that the 16
           rings covered an angular range of theta(lab) between
           8deg and 25deg with respect to the target.
           (MAGSP,PGAC,IOCH) The 30S reaction products were
           separated from the main beam (33Cl and 32S), and
           other reaction products by an Enge split-pole magnetic
           spectrograph. The particles were detected by an xy
           position-sensitive parallel grid avalanche counter
           and ionization chamber located at the focal plane of
           the spectrograph and filled with 5 Torr of isobutane
           and 15 Torr of CF4 gas, respectively. The PGAC
           measured the time of flight and the focal-plane
           position (or magnetic rigidity) of the particles, and
           the IC gave the energy loss in the gas, allowing
           rudimentary particle identification.
METHOD     (COINC) Alpha particles and 30S reaction products
           were detected in coincidence to avoid detection of
           scattered beam.  Inverse kinematics was used with
           radioactive 33Cl beam
INC-SOURCE 33Cl beam was produced using the in-flight method. A
           320-MeV primary beam of stable 32S13+ was incident on
           a gas cell, which was cryogenically cooled to -184
           deg C and filled with 1.4 atm of D2 gas. The
           d(32S,33Cl)n reaction produced the desired
           radioactive 33Cl ions, which were emitted in a cone
           of 2.5deg. A 20 mu-g/cm2 carbon stripping foil was
           located immediately following the gas cell to
           increase the charge state fraction of fully stripped
           33Cl17+. The ions were then focused with a
           superconducting solenoid and rebunched with a
           superconducting resonator. After a 22 deg bending
           magnet was used, a cocktail beam remained, which
           consisted mostly of the different charge states of
           the primary 32S beam and the secondary 33Cl17+ beam.
           After a radio-frequency (RF) sweeper was used, the
           32S to 33Cl ratio of approximately 1.4:1. The final
           beam consisted of the secondary 33Cl17+ ions at 250
           MeV and the low-energy tails of the primary beam with
           different charge states
