REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,83,014606,2011)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Measurements were performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University using Coupled-Cyclotron
           Facility.
SAMPLE     CH2 target placed in the S800 chamber. Targets with
           thicknesses of 7.10 mg/cm2 for the p(34,36Ar,d)
           33,35Ar reactions and 2.29 mg/cm2 for the p(46Ar,d)45Ar
           were used
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD,CSICR) Energy and angle of emitted
           deuterons were measured using array of 16 HiRA
           telescopes. Each telescope consists of Si strip dE
           detector with thickness of 65 mu-m, Si strip E
           detector with thickness of 1500 mu-m, backed by CsI(Tl)
           crystals for full energy measurements. The telescopes
           subtended polar angles of 4 deg to 45 deg in laboratory
           system.
           (MAGSP,IOCH,SCIN) Heavy reaction fragments emitted
           at angles less than 4deg reached the S800 spectrometer.
           They were identified in the focal plane detector
           consisting of ionization chamber for dE  measurement
           and time-of- flight detector.
