REFERENCE  (J,MED,8,396,1981)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USADAV)The experiment was performed at the
           Crocker Nuclear Laboratory 76 in. isochronous
           cyclotron of the University of California at Davis.
SAMPLE     1.16 cm thick Be target
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,NAICR) Protons recoiling from the CH2 were
           detected at 15deg from the beam by an E-dE telescope
           consisting of a 320 micron silicon DE detector and a
           1.6 cm thick Nal scintillator.
METHOD     Neutron spectrum was measured by proton recoil
           method. Neutrons at 0 deg interacted in CH2 target
           wuth thickness of 57.9 mg/cm2 C H 2and recoil protons
           were detected at 15 deg by a E-dE telescope.
CORRECTION The detected proton energy spectrum was corrected for
           carbon contribution, energy loss in the target and dE
           detector and kinematic shift

ANALYSIS   Corrected proton spectrum was divided by the n+p
           differential cross section at each energy to obtain
           the beam neutron spectrum. n+p cross sections were
           obtained from the parameterization of Hopkins and
           Breit for the energy range 0-25 MeV, and from
           Binstock for energies above 25 MeV.
