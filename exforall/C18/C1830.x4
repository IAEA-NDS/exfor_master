FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the National
           Superconducting Laboratory's Coupled Cyclotron Facility
           (PRJFS) A1900 fragment separator was used to separate
                   10B ions from other fragments
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Sample was positioned at the pivot point of
           the S800 spectrograph. The S800 selected the
           secondary reaction residue of interest based on
           magnetic rigidity and identified on event-by-event
           basis in focal plane detector
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) The focal-plane detection system
           consisted of two x-y position-sensitive detectors and t
           plastic scintillators (5 and 10 cm thickness). The
           scintillators provided both an energy loss dE and total
           residue energy E measurement and in addition a start
           signal for the time-of-flight measurement.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty of 5% was dominated by
           systematic losses due to finite acceptance of S800
           spectrometer, that ere limited to to +-2.5% in
           momentum, and 3.5 deg and 5.0 deg in the dispersive and
           nondispersive directions, respectively.
