FACILITY   (VDG,1CANTMF) Data measured at the DRAGON recoil
           separator, located at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target was filled with 4He maintained
           at a pressure within 3% of 8 Torr.
DETECTOR   (BGO) The DRAGON target was surrounded by an array of
           30 BGO gamma detectors in a tight geometry. 20Ne ions
           produced in the reaction were detected in coincidence
           with gamma events in the BGO array, after separation
           from the beam using a two-stage electromagnetic
           separator
           (IOCH)20Ne ions produced in the reaction were
           detected in ionization chamber after separation from
           the beam using a two-stage electromagnetic separator
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays detected in BGO
           array and separated 20Ne reaction products detected in
           ionization chamber. Experiment performed in inverse
           kinematics using 16-O beam
