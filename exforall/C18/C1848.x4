FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University using the Coupled Cyclotron
           Facility (CCF)
SAMPLE     Secondary beryllium target with thickness of 188 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Residual projectile-like nuclei were detected
           in the S800 spectrograph
           (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted at the secondary target
           location were detected using the SeGA array of 17
           segmented germanium detectors in coincidence with the
           residues in the S800 spectrograph.
METHOD     (COINC) coincidence between gamma rays in SeGA array
           and residual projectile-like nuclei identified in S800
           spectrograph was required
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Radioactive isotope beam of 46Ar was produced
           via fragmentation of a primary beam of 140
           MeV/nucleon 48Ca provided by the CCF. The primary
           beam was fragmented on a 705 mg/cm2 thick beryllium
           target, and the fragmentation products were separated
           in the A1900 fragment separator [18]. The separator
           selected a secondary beam of 99.9MeV/nucleon 46Ar
           which had a momentum spread of +-1.3% and a purity
           exceeding 90%. The rate of 46Ar particles impinging
           on the secondary target averaged 7E+5 particles/s.
