FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed using radioactive
           beams produced by the TwinSol system installed at
           University of Notre Dame
SAMPLE     The carbon target (99.8% 12C) used in the
           measurements was a natural foil 1.1 mg/cm2 in
           thickness mounted in a target holder.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) The scattered particles were detected
           by one dE-E Si telescope consisted of a 20 mu-m Si dE
           detector with an area of 300 mm2 backed by a 1000
           mu-m thick Si E detector with circular aperture that
           subtended a solid angle of 13 msr.
           (SI) Two silicon planar E detectors which covered
           solid angle of 8 msr were used in addition. Telescope
           and planar detectors were positioned at angles 15, 20,
            25, 30, and 35deg in the laboratory system
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) The different scattering particles were
           identified using the combination of dE and Etotal
           information for the data taken with the telescope,
           and time-of-flight (TOF) and Etotal for the data
           taken only with the E-silicon detectors.
INC-SOURCE (KINDT)The in-flight beams were produced by impinging
           a 35-MeV primary 6Li3+ beam on a 3He gas-cell
           production target via one- or two-nucleon transfer
           reaction with a large, forward-peaked cross-section.
           The secondary beams produced in the forward direction
           are collected within an angular range of 2.7deg <
           theta < 6deg by the two superconducting solenoids and
           focused at a secondary scattering chamber. A system
           of blocks and collimators, located along the solenoid
           axes, is used to clean up the beam of interest.
