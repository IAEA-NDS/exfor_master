FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) Experiment performed at the Chicago
           170-inch synchrocyclotron.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm scintillators with
           thickness of 0.635cm were used to define beam. A
           91/2-inch diameter liquid scintillator counter was
           placed coaxial with the beam defined by the first two
           counters and at variable distance. It was connected
           in anticoincidence with the coincidence output of the
           first two counters so as to count directly the number
           of particles removed from the beam. Thin scatterers
            (sample of 90-95 percent beam transmission) were
           placed directly after the second crystal counter.
METHOD     (TRN) Measured using transmission method.
ANALYSIS   Correction for Coulomb scattering was made from
           measured data at several small angles larger than
           zero.Total cross section was obtained by extrapolation
           of measured data to zero angle.
CORRECTION Corrected for Coulomb scattering
