FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at the
           Michigan State University using the large-acceptance
           A1900 fragment separator and the high- resolution
           S800 spectrograph
SAMPLE     The secondary beam bombarded the liquid hydrogen
           target of thickness 210 mg/cm2 to induce proton
           inelastic scattering. The liquid hydrogen was
           contained in a cylindrical cell. The target cell had
           aluminum entrance and exit windows with thicknesses
           of 0.22 mm and diameters of 30 mm.The average
           mid-target energy of 74Ni was 81 MeV/nucleon.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction residues were analyzed with the
           S800 spectrograph, whose magnetic field was set to
           transmit the scattered 74Ni ions.The particle
           identification was performed by combining B-rho, E-dE,
           and TOF measured by focal-plane detectors of the S800.
           (MWDC) Ion momentum was determined by two position
           sensitive cathode readout drift chambers.
           (TELES,IOCH,SCIN) An ionization chamber located
           downstream of the drift chambers provided the dE
           information. For the TOF, the flight time differences
           between the target position and the final focal plane
           were used, the former being extracted from the time
           measured by the plastic scintillator at the exit of the
           A1900 and B*rho of the incident beam.
           (NAICR) The gamma rays emitted from the excited
           nuclei were detected by a barrel array of NaI(Tl)
           scintillators with an inner diameter of 43 cm
           surrounding the liquid hydrogen target. The array
           consisted of 21 NaI(Tl) scintillator bars, each of
           which was 55.0 cm long and had a trapezoidal cross
           section with a height of 6.0 cm and upper and lower
           bases of 5.5 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. The barrel
           covered a polar-angle range from 38 to 122 deg with
           respect to the beam axis.
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification
           (COINC) Coincidence was required between 74Ni ions
           detected by detectors in S800 focal plane and
           NaI(Tl) gamma ray detectors
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) A 86Kr primary beam accelerated to 140
           MeV/nucleon by the Coupled Cyclotron Facility was
           directed onto a 399-mg/cm2-thick 9Be fragmentation
           target at a typical intensity of 20 particle nA. The
           produced fragments were selected and separated by the
           A1900 fragment separator.
