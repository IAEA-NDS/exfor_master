FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the the
           88inch cyclotron located at Lawrence Berkeley
           National Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)The detector had a relative efficiency of 62% at
           1.33 MeV as compared with a standard NaI crystal.The
           full width at half maximum resolution of the detector
           was 1.3keV at 181 keV,2.0keV at 739keV,
           and 2.9keV at 1368keV. The activity of each
           foil was measured at a distance of 10cm from the front
           face of the detector.

SAMPLE     Stack of alternating layers of molybdenum and aluminum
           foils. The molybdenum foils were 99.95% pure,of
           natural isotopic composition, and were either 25 or
           102 mu-m thick. The aluminum foils were used as energy
           degraders and beam monitors. The thickness of the
           aluminum foils were 127,229 or 305 mu-m. Several Mo-Al
           stacks were used to cover the whole energy range
