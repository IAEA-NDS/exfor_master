FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU)Experiment performed using
           the coupled K500 and K1200 cyclotrons,A1900
           fragment separator and the spectrometer
           S800 at the  National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Magnetic spectrometer S800 with focal plane
           detectors
           (SCIN) Two plastic scintillators and were used to
           measure dE - E signals and the time difference
           between the cyclotron RF signal and the event trigger
           (MWDC)Two cathode readout drift detectors in the
           focal plane were used to determine positions and
           angles of 3He particles
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
INC-SOURCE Primary beam of 16-O with energy of 150 MeV/nucleon
           impinged upon a 3526 mg/cm2 Be production target and
           produced a 115A MeV secondary triton beam, which was
           separated from other reaction products in the A1900
           fragment separator
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty in beam intensity
HISTORY    (20110615C) Compiled by S.H.
COMMENT    Only part of the data, measured at MSU, compiled.
           Data measured in Tokai are under compilation in a
           separate entry.

           C and 13CH2 target isotopically enriched to 99.3% in
           13C with thickness of 18 mg/cm2 were used. Cross
