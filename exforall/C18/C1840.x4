FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan
SAMPLE     (6-C-12,ENR=0.989) Vitreous carbon with a density of
           1.54 g/cm3 and thickness of 149.4 mg/cm2 located at
           the midacceptance target position of the A1900
           fragment separator
           Be target with thickness of 188 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Target position was surrounded by the high-
           resolution gamma-ray detection system SeGA, an array
           of 32-fold segmented high-purity germanium detectors
           with high degree of segmentation which allowed for
           event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the gamma rays
           emitted by the projectile-like reaction residues
           in flight.
           (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analyzed by
           magnetic spectrograph S800.
           (IOCH,SCIN) Event-by-event particle identification
           was performed with the focal-plane detection system
           formed by ionization chamber, which measured energy
           loss and plastic scintillation detector for
           time-of-flight measurement.
METHOD     (GSPEC,COINC,EDE) Coincidence of the reaction product
                            and discrete gamma ray was required
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The projectile beam of 22Mg was obtained by
           projectile fragmentation of a 170-MeV per nucleon
           24Mg primary beam. The 9Be fragmentation target of
           1904 mg/cm2 thickness was located at the midacceptance
           target position of the A1900 fragment separator. The
           momentum acceptance of the separator was restricted
           to dp/p = 0.0014. The resulting cocktail beam of N=10
           isotones contained 22Mg (74%), 21Na (24.5%), and
           20Ne (1.5%).
