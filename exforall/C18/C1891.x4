FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Irradiations were performed at a D6
           beam line of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron
           at Brookhaven National Laboratory
DETECTOR   (TRD) Target-detector stacks were prepared by
           arranging CR-39 nuclear track detector sheets with
           target layers sandwiched between them.
METHOD     (STTA)
INC-SOURCE Negative pions were produced from proton irradiation
           in D6 beam line
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
