FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment performed at ATLAS
           facility at Argonne National  Laboratory
SAMPLE     232Th sample with thickness of 640 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Four 5 x 5 cm2 Si surface barrier detectors
           subdivided into four quadrants surrounded the 232Th
           target with two pairs opposite to each other,
           covering the angular range between 25deg and 70deg
           and between 115deg and 160deg.
INC-SOURCE The 15C beam was produced via the in-flight technique
           by bombarding a cryogenically cooled gas cell filled
           with deuterium at 1.4 atm with an intense (100 pnA)
           14C beam delivered by the ATLAS accelerator. The 15C
           ions produced via the d(14C,15C)p reaction were
           focused with a superconducting solenoid located
           behind the gas cell and rebunched with a
           superconducting resonator.Energy changes for
           excitation function measurement were achieved by Au
           energy degrading foils.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No infromation given
ANALYSIS   Realtive normalization of 13,14,15C measurements
           was achieved by using elastically scattered particles
           detected by Si detectors at forward angles of 35 deg.
