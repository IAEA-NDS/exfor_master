FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment performed at the FN Tandem
           Accelerator at Notre Dame
SAMPLE     (52-TE-120,ENR=0.994) 120Te oxide target
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The counting system consisted of two HPGe
           clover detectors placed face-to-face in close
           geometry with a gap of 4.9 mm. The detector setup was
           shielded inside a Pb castle with 10-cm-thick walls and
           a 3-mm Cu inner lining. A 0.59-mm-thick Cu plate was
           placed in front of each clover to reduce the count
           rate from x rays.
           (SI) Silicon detector was positioned at 135deg in the
           target chamber to monitor the stability
           of the beam and target.
