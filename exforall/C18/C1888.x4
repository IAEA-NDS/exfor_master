SAMPLE     (52-TE-120,ENR=0.994) 120Te oxide target
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The counting system consisted of two HPGe
            clover detectors placed face-to-face in close
            geometry with a gap of 4.9 mm.
           The detector setup was shielded inside a Pb castle
            with 10-cm-thick walls and a 3-mm Cu inner lining.
           A 0.59-mm-thick Cu plate was placed in front of each
            clover to reduce the count rate from X rays.
           (SI) Silicon detector was positioned at 135deg in the
            target chamber to monitor the stability of the beam
            and target.
