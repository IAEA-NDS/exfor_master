FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMRY) Experiment performed at the
           University of Maryland Cyclotron Laboratory
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutron spectra were measured using neutron
           spectrometer consisting of two scintillation
           counters. First counter with scintillators NE102 and
           partially NE228 served as proton recoil detector and
           time of flight start counter. The second detector
           with thick NE102 plastic scintillator served as time
           of flight stop detector. Sum of recoiled proton energy
           and energy of scattered neutron measured by time of
           flight determine the energy of primary neutron. Two
           additional scintillation detectors were used as charged
           particle veto detectors for background reduction.
