FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the 88-Inch
           Cyclotron and LBNL Advanced Electron Cyclotron
           Resonance ion source
SAMPLE     (94-PU-242,ENR=0.99)
           PuO2 oxyd deposited on titanium target backing foil
           mounted on rotating wheel (12Hz).
           Thickness of four target segments was 440,340,320 and
           270 mu-g/cm2. Backing foil thickness was 2.4 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Evaporation residues were separated in gas
           filled separator BGS and implanted in focal plane
           detector.
           (MWPC) A multiwire proportional counter (MWPC)
           filled with 370-Pa isobutane was placed before the
           focal plane detector (FPD) to distinguish
           implantation events from radioactive decay events in
           FPD.
           (SISD) Focal plane detector consisted of Si detectors
           with 48 vertical strips to measure positional
           information of implantation and decay events.
ANALYSIS   Transmission efficiency of BGS was determined using a
           Monte Carlo simulation of trajectories in BGS. The
           calculated efficiency for 114-XX-285 evaporation
           residues was 69%.
INC-SOURCE Advanced Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source was
           used to produce beams of 10-11 times ionized 48Ca,
           which were accelerated in 88-Inch cyclotron
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty calculated at 68% confidence
