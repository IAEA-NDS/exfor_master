             Experimental setup described
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment was performed at ATLAS
           accelerator using the Fragment Mass Analyzer at
           the Argonne National Laboratory
SAMPLE     (42-MO-100,ENR=0.974) two targets with thickness of
           34 and 39 mu-g/cm2 on 40 mu-g/cm2 thick carbon backing
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Recoil mass separator with triple-focusing
           design separates nuclear reaction recoils from the
           primary heavy-ion beam and other sources of
           background, and disperses them at the focal-plane
           according to their mass-to-charge ratio
           (TELES,PGAC,IOCH,SI) Focal plane detector in
           configuration position-sensitive parallel grid
           avalanche counters, ionization chambers and
           large-area Si surface-barrier detectors
METHOD     (EDE,COINC,TOF)
ANALYSIS   Mass and charge state integrated evaporation
           residues (ER). In most cases four charge states were
           measured, sometimes two and only at a few low
           energies a single state was measured
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in transmission
                   efficiency
           (DATA-ERR) No information given, most probably
           statistical uncertainty (compiler comment)

           waiting for data from author
CORRECTION Corrected for detection efficiency and beam
           transmission efficiency. At higher energies evaporation
           residues cross section corrected for fission.
