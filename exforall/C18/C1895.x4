REL-REF    (O,C1150001,H.Scheit+,J,PR/C,63,014604,2001) Proton
           scattering of  36,42,44Ar data were published in
           Phys.Rev. and previously compiled in EXFOR (C1150001).
           Thesis data for protons are preliminary in nature
           and were not finalized until 2001.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)
           (FRS) The experiment was performed using the
           A1200 Fragment Separator(FRS).
SAMPLE     0.0935 and 0.1841 g/cm2 gold foils.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The time of flight (TOF) between a
           thin plastic scintillator located after the A1200
           focal plane and a parallel plate avalanche counter
           (PPAC) located in front of the secondary target
           provided identification of the fragment before
           interacting in the secondary target. A fast-slow
           phoswich detector was located at zero degrees with
           respect to the beam axis and allowed the
           identification of the beam particle after interacting
           in the target. Photons were detected in coincidence
           with beam particles by the NSCL NaI(Tl) array. Each
           NaI(Tl) crystal is cylindrical, 17.1 cm long and 5.0
           cm in diameter and encapsulated in a 2 mm thick
           aluminum shield. Quartz windows, 0.5 cm thick, are
           attached at both ends. A 5 cm diameter
           photomultiplier tube (PMT) is optically coupled to
           each window. A total of 38 detectors are arranged in
           an aluminum frame in 3 concentric rings, of 11
            (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer) detectors,
           oriented co-axially to the particle beam axis around
           a 150 mm diameter beam pipe. The radii of the three
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm. As
           assembled the full array is 60 cm long, 51 cm wide
           and 55 cm high.
METHOD     (EDE,GSPEC,TOF,COINC,EXTB)
           Coulomb excitation, inelastic scattering.
INC-SOURCE 48Ca,40Ar primary beams were fragmented on 9Be primary
           target. Radioactive ion beams were selected by A1200
           fragment separator and delivered on 197Au secondary
           target.
ANALYSIS   (PGS,INTAD)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty includes root mean square from
           efficiency, statistical and geometrical uncertainties.
