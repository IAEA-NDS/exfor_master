TITLE       (p,pxn) and (p,xn) reactions and mechanisms on
           133Cs at 550 MeV

INC-SOURCE 550 MeV proton beam of the Space Radiation Effects
           laboratory synchrocyclotron.
SAMPLE     Targets consisted of a mixture of CsBr (optical grade
           - 99.9%) and 99.99% pure fine aluminum powder,
           homogeneously mixed and pressed into pellets. The
           resulting targets contained 38 to 47%
           monoisotopically pure 133Cs and had a surface density
           of 59-131 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (GELI) High resolution nuclear diodes Ge(Li) detector.
PART-DET   (DG)
METHOD     (RCHEM,GSPEC,STTA,ACTIV) After irradiation the CsBr
           pellets and adjacent guard foils were dissolved and
           cesium and barium fractions were chemically separated
           and purified by standard radiochemical procedures.
           All samples prepared in this fashion were assayed by
           gamma detection using a high resolution Nuclear Diodes
           Ge(Li) detector.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) Activity measurements were analyzed using the
           Brookhaven decay curve analysis program CLSQ.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG) The 24Na, from the
           monitor reaction, was beta counted with an end-window
           gas flow proportional counter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties indicated in Table II are
           root mean square deviations from the average for
           replicate determinations.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties
           are also listed in the table,  they include:
           (ERR-1) 5% for the monitor reaction beta counting
           efficiency.
           (ERR-2) 6% for 24Na cross section.
           (ERR-3,2.,8.) 2-8% in value of the 24Na disintegration
           rate.
           (ERR-4,2.,8.) 2-5% for chemical yield determination.
           (ERR-5) 6% for Ge(Li) detector efficiency.
           (ERR-6,1.,10.) 1-10% branching ratio, reliability of th
           decay scheme data.
