MONITOR    (79-AU-197(4-BE-7,EL)79-AU-197,,DA)
DETECTOR   (SI) Scattered protons were detected in the large-area
            segmented silicon detector array (SIDAR).SIDAR is
            comprised of 128 segments with 16 radial (from 5 to
            13 cm) and 8 azimuthal divisions. The array covered
            laboratory angles 25deg -  51deg  allowing detection
            of the forward focused scattered protons while passing
            the 17F beam out of the target chamber.
           (IOCH) The beamlike recoils from the scattering
           reactions were detected and identified in a gas-filled
           ionization counter in coincidence with the protons
           detected by the SIDAR.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Radioactive ions accelerated
            by tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at the
            Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Holifield
            Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF).
INC-SOURCE  A radioactive 17F beam was produced using isotope
            separator on-line technique (ISOL).The 17F beam was
            contaminated with the stable isobar 17-O at a
            17-O/17F ratio of approx. 2/1 .
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between scattered protons detected
            in SIDAR and 17F detected in ionization chamber was
            requested. Inverse kinematics used.
