TITLE      Dynamic polarization in the Coulomb breakup of

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment was carried out at the
           Holifield Radioactive Ion  Beam Facility (HRIBF)
           using the Isotope Separator On-Line technique.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD,SISD) The reaction products were
           detected in a stack of three 5 x 5 cm2 silicon strip
           detectors. The front and middle detectors were single-
           sided with 16 strips each. They were mounted with their
           strips oriented perpendicular to each other yielding
           256 pixels in the active area. The thickness of the
           front detector was 4 mu-m and the middle detector
           278 mu-m. They were used for identifying projectile-
           like particles by measuring the energy loss dE in the
           front detector and the residual energy E in the middle
           detector. The breakup protons had sufficiently high
           energy to pass through the first two detectors. They
           were detected in the back detector which was double-
           sided with 16 horizontal strips on one side and
           16 vertical strips on the other. The thickness of the
           back detector was 295 mu-m.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The 17F beam was produced by the 16O(d,n)
           reaction using the Isotope Separator On-Line technique.
           The 17F ions were post-accelerated by the 25 MV tandem.
           The analyzing magnet located at the exit of the
           accelerator was set to select fully stripped 17F9+ ions
