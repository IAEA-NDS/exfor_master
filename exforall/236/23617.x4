FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR) .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR.
           The nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is
           5.86E+10 (n/cm2/sec) at 1 MW power operation.
           The AUTHORs confirmed that the higher part of the TC-Pn
           was well thermalized on the basis of Westcott
           convention using neutron flux monitors: Au-197, Co-59,
           and Mo-98. (See Fig. 5 in the REFERENCE.)
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott convention method.
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well
           thermalized, epithermal component in Westcott
           convention method was negligibly small.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 25%.
           The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of the Ge detector
           were measured using a Eu-152 source and a mixed source
           AM-8140 (Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113,
           Cs-137, Co-60 and Y-88) .
           The uncertainty in the source radioactivity was 1.5%
           for both of the standard sources.
ANALYSIS   The reaction rates of the target reactions were
           obtained from the yields of the gamma rays emitted
           from the irradiated samples.
           The thermal-neutron fluxes were derived using the
           reaction rates and the thermal cross section of the
           monitors.
           - For Sc-45, Cu-63, Ag-109 and In-113:
               (5.904+-0.102)E+10 (n/cm2/sec)
           - For Zn-64 and 68: (6.205+-0.107)E+10 (n/cm2/sec)
           The capture cross sections were derived using the
           reaction rates and the thermal-neutron fluxes.
           The thermal capture cross sections for monitors and
           the g-factors were taken from the REL-REF.
           For Mo-98, the thermal capture cross section was taken
           from an AUTHOR's unpublished previous measurement.
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for thermal neutrons were
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and
           area densities of the sample and the monitors.
           The coincidence summing effect was estimated from the
           peak-to-total ratios and the peak efficiencies.
