FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Hydraulic Conveyer in the Kyoto University
           Research Reactor(KUR) . KUR was operated at the
           thermal power of 5 MW.
SAMPLE     Cs-137 standard solution, Code# CS005, which was
           supplied by JRIA was used for the samples. Cs-135 was
           included as an impurity in the Cs-137 standard
           solution. Two Cs-137 standard solutions equivalent to
           about 200 Bq were prepared. The isotope ratios of
           Cs-135 to Cs-137 were determined with TIMS.
           Bare target: Cs-135/Cs-137 = 0.8970 +- 0.00024
           Gd Shield:   Cs-135/Cs-137 = 0.8990 +- 0.00014
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Cadmium-difference method. To set
            0.133 eV as cut-off energy, Gd foils with thickness
           of 25 um was used as neutron filter. Wires of Au/Al
           alloy and Co/Al alloy were used to monitor neutron
           fluxes. A set of the samples with and without the Gd
           filters were used for the experiments.
           Irradiations for the bare and Gd filtered targets
           were performed for 3 and 6 h, respectively.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 70% and 1.9 keV FWHM at the 1.33 MeV.
ANALYSIS   The activities of Cs-137, Cs-136 and monitor wires
           were measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. Neutron flux
           was deduced from the activities of the wires. (tables
           2 and 3 in the REFERENCE) Deduced neutron flux: (e+14
           n/cm2/sec) Thermal neutron Epi-thermal neutron Bare
           target: 1.07 +-0.03 0.313+-0.021 Gd Shield:
           0.155+-0.006 0.426+-0.012 The main contribution of
           the uncertainties came from uncertainties due to
           abundance of Co and Au in the wires and the detection
           effeciency of the Ge detector. On the basis of
           Westcott's convention, the cross section was derived
           from the activity ratio of Cs-136 to Cs-137, the
           half-lives of Cs-136 and Cs-137, the isotopic ratio
           of Cs-135 to Cs-137 in the sample, and the neutron
           fluxes.
CORRECTION The peak detection efficiencies were determined with
           a set of calibrated mixed sources: Cd-109, Co-57,
           Ce-139, Sn-113, Cs-137, Y-88, and Co-60.
