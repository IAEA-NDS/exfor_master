FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR) .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR. The
           nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is 2.84E+11
            (n/cm2/sec) at 5 MW power operation. The AUTHORs
           confirmed that the TC-Pn was well thermalized on the
           basis of Westcott convention using neutron flux
           monitors: Au-197, Co-59, and Mo-98. (See Fig. 3 in
           the REFERENCE.)
SAMPLE     (26-FE-58,NAT=0.00282)
           Sample:    Fe-nat metal foil  5.208+-0.001 mg
           Monitor:   Co-nat metal foil  0.640+-0.001 mg
                      Mo-nat metal wire 15.378+-0.001 mg
                      Au/Al Alloy wire   3.114+-0.001 mg
           The sample and the monitors were irradiated
           in the TC-Pn for 1 hour under 5-MW power operation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 25%.
           The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of the Ge detector
           were measured using a Eu-152 source and a mixed source
           AM-8140 (Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113,
           Cs-137, Co-60 and Y-88) .
           The uncertainty in the source radioactivity was 1.5%
           for both of the standard sources.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott convention method.
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well
           thermalized, epithermal component in Westcott
           convention method was negligibly small.
ANALYSIS   The reaction rate of Fe-58 was obtained from
           the yield of each decay gamma ray emitted from the
           irradiated Fe sample.
           The thermal-neutron flux was derived using the reaction
           rates and the thermal cross sections of the monitors.
           The derived flux was (2.6832+-0.0424)E+10(n/cm2/sec) .
           The cross section of Fe-58 was derived from the
           reaction rate of Fe-58 and the thermal-neutron flux.
           The thermal capture cross sections for monitors and
           the g-factors were taken from the REL-REF.
           For Mo-98, the thermal capture cross section was taken
           from an AUTHOR's unpublished previous measurement.
COMMENT    AUTHOR's assumed cross section of Mo-98, 0.132+-0.006 b
           is close to that given in REL-REF (0.130+-0.06 b) .
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for thermal neutrons were
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and
           area densities of the sample and the monitors.
           The coincidence summing effect was estimated from the
           peak-to-total ratios and the peak efficiencies.

ASSUMED    Thermal capture cross sections of the monitors were
           assumed to be well known to determine the thermal
           neutron flux.
