FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE) ANNRI(BL04) beam line of MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons (600 kW) .
           The proton beams were supplied at a repetition rate of
           25 Hz and in the "double-bunch mode".
           Produced neutrons were slowed down in a supercritical
           para hydrogen moderator.
           A Cd filter was used to cut the low-energy tail of
           neutron pulse.
           To reduce gamma-rays from a large 14.4 eV s-wave
           resonance, an enriched Xe-131 (84.4%) gas filter
           with a pressure of 0.43 MPa, and a thickness of 76 mm
           was installed upstream of the Xe-131 sample.
INC-SPECT  Relative neutron flux was reconstructed using the 478
           keV gamma-rays from gamma rays from the B-10 (n,alpha
           gamma) Li-7 reactions.
DETECTOR   (GE,BGO) An array of Ge detector consists of two
           cluster-Ge detectors and eight coaxial-Ge detectors
           with BGO anti-coincidence shields.
           DAQ: CAEN V1724 Digitizer (14bit, 100MHz)
SAMPLE     84.4% enriched Xe-131 gas sealed into a cylindrical
           cell with a pressure of 0.43 MPa, a diameter of 49 mm
           and a thickness of 76 mm.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight length: 21.5 m
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with a paralyzable
           dead time model.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The resonance parameters of the 3.2-eV p-wave
           resonance were determined by fitting the relative
           gamma yeild gated with the full absorption and single
           escape peaks of 7132 keV gamma rays. The 3.2-eV
           p-wave resonance was fitted with the Breit-Wigner
           function including the background and the s-wave
           component (1/v term) . The effects of the Doppler
           broadening (free gas at 295 K) and the resolution
           function of ANNRI were convolved with the
           Breit-Wigner function. In the fitting, the total
           width of the 3.2-eV p-wave resonance was used as the
           gamma width, because the neutron width of the p-wave
           resonance is negligibly smaller than the gamma width.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of resonance prameters
           were deduced from the uncertainty of the fitting
           result.
