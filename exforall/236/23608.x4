FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE) ANNRI(BL04) beam line of MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons (150 kW) . The proton
           beams were supplied at a repetition rate of 25 Hz and
           in the "double-bunch mode". Produced neutrons were
           slowed down in a supercritical para hydrogen moderator.
INC-SPECT  Relative neutron flux was reconstructed using the 478
           keV gamma-rays from gamma rays from the B-10
           (n,alpha gamma) Li-7 reactions.
DETECTOR   (GE,BGO) An array of Ge detector consists of two
           cluster-Ge detectors and eight coaxial-Ge detectors
           with BGO anti-coincidence shields. DAQ: CAEN V1724
           Digitizer (14bit, 100MHz)
SAMPLE     1-mm-thick La-nat metal plate.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight length: 21.5 m
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with a paralyzable
           dead time model.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The 0.758-eV p-wave resonance was fitted with
           the Breit-Wigner function including the background
           and the s- wave component (1/v term) . The effects of
           the Doppler broadening (free gas at 295 K) and the
           resolution function of ANNRI were convolved with the
           Breit-Wigner function. In the fitting, the total
           width of the 0.758-eV p-wave resonance was used as
           the gamma width, because the neutron width of the
           p-wave resonance is negligibly smaller than the gamma
           width.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of resonance prameters
           were deduced from the uncertainty of the fitting
           result.
