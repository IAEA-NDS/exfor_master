FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR).
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Hydraulic Conveyor of KUR,
           nominal: 1E+14 (n/cm2sec) under 5MW operation.
SAMPLE     The niobium samples were metal foils with a purity of
           99.99%; each had a diameter of 4 mm, a thickness of
           0.054 mm, and a mass in the order of 5 mg.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Decay gamma rays were measured with a high-
           purity Ge detector relative efficiency of 25%.
           The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of the Ge detector were
           measured using a mixed source AM-8140: Am-241, Cd-109,
           Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113, Cs-137, Co-60 and Y-88.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on the Westcott convention method
           with Cadmium-difference method.
           To set 0.133 eV as cut-off energy, Gd foils with
           thickness of 25 micro-meter was used as neutron filter.
           Au/Al alloy and Co/Al alloy were used as monitor
           materials to determine neutron fluxes.
           The bare and Gd filtered samples were irradiated for
           6 hours in the hydraulic conveyor.
           After nearly 2 years cooling, the decay gamma-rays
           from the Nb samples were measured for 10 h for the
           bare condition and 15 h for the Gd filtered condition.
ANALYSIS   The weighted averages of the reaction rates in the Nb
           samples were derived using 703-, and 871-keV
           gamma rays.
           At the time of the gamma-ray measurement, the isomer
           94mNb (Half life: 6.263 min) had fully decayed to
           94gNb (Transition Ratio: 99.5%).
           The thermal and epi-thermal neutron flux was derived
           using the reaction rates, the thermal cross sections,
           the resonance integral cross sections, and the
           g-factors of the monitor materials.
           These values were taken from the REL-REF.
           Based on  Westcott convention, thermal cross section
           and resonance integral were deduced.
           The g-factor of 93Nb (1.003) was taken from the
           REL-REF.
