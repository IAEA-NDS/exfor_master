FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR) .
INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR.
           The nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is
           5.86E+10 (n/cm2/sec) at 1 MW power operation.
           The AUTHORs confirmed that the TC-Pn was well
           thermalized in the previous experiment.
           See Fig. 9 in J,NST,58,1061,2021 (REL-REF) .
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott convention method.
           Samples and monitors were irradiated in the TC-Pn
           for 1 hour under 1-MW power operation.
           The decay gamma-rays were measured with a germanium
           detector.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 25%.
           The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of the Ge detector
           were measured using a Eu-152 source and a mixed source
           AM-8140 (Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203,
           Sn-113, Cs-137, Co-60 and Y-88) .
           The uncertainty in the source radioactivity was 1.5%
           for both of the standard sources.
ANALYSIS   The reaction rates of the target reactions were
           obtained from the yields of the gamma rays emitted
           from the irradiated samples.
           The thermal-neutron fluxes were derived using neutron
           flux monitors: Au-197 and Co-59.
           - For the Er sample: (5.326+-0.086)E+10 (n/cm2/sec)
           - For the Hf sample: (5.411+-0.087)E+10 (n/cm2/sec)
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well
           thermalized, epithermal component in Westcott
           convention method was negligibly small.
           The capture cross sections were derived using
           the reaction rates and the thermal-neutron fluxes.
           The thermal capture cross sections for monitors and
           the g-factors were taken from REL-REF.
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for thermal neutrons were
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and
           area densities of the sample and the monitors. The
           coincidence summing effect was estimated from the
           peak-to-total ratios and the peak efficiencies.

           assumed to be well known to determine the thermal
           neutron flux.
