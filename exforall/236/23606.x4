           Experimental setup and filtered neutron spectrum.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNJAE)ANNRI(BL04) beam line of MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons. The proton beam was
           supplied at a repetition rate of 25 Hz and in the
           "double-bunch mode", in which the pulsed protons
           consist of two bunches, each with a width of 100 ns,
           at intervals of 600 ns. To improve neutron energy
           resolution, Fe or Si neutron filters with thickness
           of 20 cm were installed.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) One standard deviation.
METHOD     (FNB,TOF) Neutron TOF experiment with a neutron
           filtering system.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 330 mm (diam.) and 203 mm in thickness, 90
           deg with respect to the neutron beam line.
           DAQ: CAEN V1720 Digitizer (12bit, 250MHz)
SAMPLE     A pellet of 7.47(10) mg (957 MBq) of Am-241 oxide
           enclosed in an Al casing with 46.0 mg of Y2O3 used as
           binder was used. The pellet was shaped like a disk
           with 10 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The
           sample was encapsulated in an Al container with 0.1-
           mm-thick walls and an outer diameter of 22.0(1) mm.
           A dummy sample, an Al container with the identical
           dimensions to the Am-241 sample, including only Y2O3,
           was also used for background measurements.
           A carbon sample with a diameter of 10 mm and a
           thickness of 0.5 mm was used as neutron scatterer
           to subtract background.
           A gold sample with a 10 mm diameter, 0.1 mm thickness
           was used for normalization.
           A boron sample with a 90.4% B-10 enrichment and a mass
           86.1 mg was used to deduce a neutron spectrum.
ANALYSIS   The pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) was
           applied to derive the neutron capture yield.
           Measurements with the carbon sample, "Dummy sample",
           and "Blank (no sample) " were used for background
           estimation. A measurement with the gold sample was
           used for the normalization. The neutron capture cross
           section of Am-241 was determined relative to the
           capture cross section of Au-197 at each energy point.
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with the extended
           dead-time model. Correction factors for self
           shielding and multiple scattering were deduced using
           the PHITS. Contributions of discriminated gamma-rays
           to the capture yields were estimated from theoretical
           calculation using the nuclear reaction model code
           CCONE and detector response functions. Correction
           factors for fission events were deduced using the
           capture and fission cross-sections of Am-241 in
           JENDL-5 and the gamma-ray multiplicities for the
           capture and fission reactions.
