FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNKEK) BL05 Low-Divergence beam branch in
           MLF at J-PARC
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The pulsed neutron beams are produced by the
           spallation process at the MLF in J-PARC.
           Pulsed neutrons were moderated by a liquid hydrogen
           moderator and directed to the experimental setup via
           a neutron mirror bender, a four-blade slit, and a
           vacuum guide tube.
           The proton beam power was approximately 620 kW.
DETECTOR   Interferometer:
           (SCIN)
           Interferometer with two beam-splitting etalons (BSEs)
           was used in the experiment.
           The BSEs were designed with half and total reflection
           mirrors. The first BSE splits neutron waves into two
           parallel paths and the second one recombines them.
           Samples were inserted one of the parallel paths.
           The interference pattern of the neutron waves was
           detected by a neutron detector equipped with a thin
           ZnS/6LiF scintillator.
SAMPLE     Two 0.3-mm-thick V metal plates (purity: 99%) and
           a 0.3-mm-thick V-Ni alloy plate (V:Ni = 94.58:5.32)
           were used as samples.
           Elemental analyses on the samples were performed with
           XRF and gas chromatography, and no significant
           impurities were identified.
           A 0.3-mm-thick N-type Si wafer was used for
           normalization.
METHOD     (TOF)
           The interference pattern of the neutron waves from
           the interferometer was detected by the neutron
           detector installed at flight length of 17.74 m.
ANALYSIS   The neutron-nuclear scattering length of V was
           derived using the phase shift between the interference
           patterns with and without samples.
CORRECTION To eliminate uncertainty arising from the neutron
           wavelength of the pulse source, the scattering length
           was determined relative to Si.
           The effects of impurities were eliminated.
           The effect of reducing the atmospheric path by the
           thickness of the sample was corrected.

ASSUMED    The following scattering length were assumed to
           deduce the effects of the impurities and the
           atmospheric phase shift.
