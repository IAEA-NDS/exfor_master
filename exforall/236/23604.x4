FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
           The Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR).
INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR. The
           nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is 5.86E+10
            (n/cm2/sec) at 1 MW power operation. The AUTHORs
           have confirmed that the TC-Pn was extremely
           thermalized on the basis of Westcott's convention in
           another experiment. (See Fig. 8 in the REL-REF.)
SAMPLE     Np-237 standardized solution (Np(NO3)4 in 4 M HNO3)
           was used for samples. Impurities of the solution were
           measured with an alpha-ray spectroscopy and a mass
           spectrometer.
                      -Np-237 : Am-241 = 1 : 0.0014.
                      -Am-243, Cm-244 and the other Np isotopes
                       were not observed.
           Two standardized solutions equivalent to about 950 and
           370 Bq were dropped onto pieces of glass filters.
           The filters were dried by an infrared ramp.
           The activity of the sample were determined using the
           312-keV gamma-ray emitted from Pa-233.
           The deduced activities were:
                      Sample1: 961 +- 22 Bq and
                      Sample2: 379 +- 9 Bq.
           The samples and the monitors were irradiated in
           the TC-Pn for 30 minutes under 1-MW power operation.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott's convention method.
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well
           thermalized, epithermal component in Westcott's
           convention method was negligibly small.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative
           efficiency of 25%. The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of
           the Ge detector were measured using a mixed source
           AM-8140 (Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, Germany) :
           Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113, Cs-137,
           Co-60 and Y-88 whose uncertainty of source-activity
           was 1.5%.
ANALYSIS   The reaction rates of the Np-237 samples were
           obtained from the yield of the 984.45-keV gamma rays
           emitted from the irradiated samples.
           The thermal-neutron fluxes were derived using the
           reaction rates and the thermal cross sections of the
           monitors (Sc-45, Co-59, Mo-98, Ta-181 and Au-197).
           Thermal capture cross sections and g-factors of
           the monitors were taken from the REL-REF.
           The cross section of Np-237 was derived from
           the reaction rates and the activities of the samples,
           and the deduced thermal-neutron flux.
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for the monitors were
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and
           area densities of the monitors.
           Those for the Np-237 samples were estimated to be
           unity from its number of nuclei.
