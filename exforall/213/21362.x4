TITLE       Pile neutron absorption cross sections of some of the
            elements
FACILITY   (OSCIP,2UK HAR) Pile oscillator, graphite low
            energy experimental pile.
INC-SPECT  .Maxwell spectrum
SAMPLE     .Natural elements, as pure as possible.
METHOD     .Pile oscillator, method described by A.M.Weinberg
            and H.C.Schweinler, Phys.Rev,74,851(1948). During
            oscillation the sample remains 20 seconds in the
            centre of the pile, and then 20 seconds at the edge.
DETECTOR   .No details given.

           From: M.Ross, J.S.Story,1949, Rep.Pros.Phys., 12
                    (London : Physical Society), p. 291.
COMMENT    .Slowing down and scattering of the neutrons by the
            sample were established to be negligible.
