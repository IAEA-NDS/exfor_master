TITLE      -PILE NEUTRON ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS OF SOME OF THE
            ELEMENTS.
FACILITY   (OSCIP,2UK HAR) PILE OSCILLATOR, GRAPHITE LOW
            ENERGY EXPERIMENTAL PILE.
INC-SPECT  .MAXWELL SPECTRUM
SAMPLE     .NATURAL ELEMENTS, AS PURE AS POSSIBLE.
METHOD     .PILE OSCILLATOR, METHOD DESCRIBED BY A.M.WEINBERG
            AND H.C.SCHWEINLER, PHYS.REV,74,851(1948). DURING 1
            OSCILLATION THE SAMPLE REMAINS 20 SECONDS IN THE
            CENTRE OF THE PILE, AND THEN 20 SECONDS AT THE EDGE.
DETECTOR   .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
MONITOR    (5-B-0(N,ABS),,SIG)
COMMENT    .SLOWING DOWN AND SCATTERING OF THE NEUTRONS BY THE
            SAMPLE WERE ESTABLISHED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
FLAG       (1.) ELEMENTS FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SELF-SCREENING
            CORRECTION, AND EITHER A COMPLETE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
            WAS MADE ON THE SAMPLE OR THE ELEMENT WAS SPECIALLY
            PREPARED IN A PURE STATE.
           (2.) ELEMENTS FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SEELF-SCREENING
            CORRECTION, BUT NO CHEMICAL ANALYSIS WAS MADE ON THE
            SAMPLE. THEREFORE THE DATA MAY BE SUBJECT TO SYSTE-
            MATIC ERROR, DUE TO IMPURITIES WITH A HIGH CROSS
            SECTION.
           (3.) ELEMENTS FOR WHICH A SELF-SCREENING CORRECTION
            WAS APPLIED AND NO CHEMICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON THE
            SAMPLE. THEREFORE THE DATA MAY BE SUBJECT TO SYSTE-
            MATIC ERROR, DUE TO IMPURITIES WITH A HIGH CROSS
            SECTION.
           (4.) DATA FROM AN ACTIVATION MEASUREMENT, MEASURING
