TITLE      -Investigations of the energy dependence of neutron
            induced reactions in the energy range of 12-19 MeV.-
            (In German).
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERHAM) 3 MeV Van De Graaff.
           (CCW,2GERHAM) 150 kV Cockcroft Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) deuteron-tritium reaction. Thin tritium
            containing titanium layer. This layer was regularly
            replaced by a new one in order to avoid d-d-reactions
            by accumulation of deuterium in the target.
METHOD     (PHD) Protons not detected since their stopping power
            is too low.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Same as sample, Ca-W-O(4) or Zn-O layers of
            35 to 65 mg/cm*cm on a non Tl-activated Cs-I-crystal
            (20 mm diam * 2 mm thick) as light conductor.
STATUS     (NDD) Data taken from NEUDADA.
