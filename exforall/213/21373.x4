REFERENCE  (J,PM,1,261,1956)
FACILITY   (VDG,2UK OXF) No details.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuterium beam on deuterium target.
METHOD     .Detection in singles and coincidence of inelastic
            gammas.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 1 in. cube NaI(Tl) crystal.
COMMENT    .The principal purpose was to establish level
            schemes for the target nuclei.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviations, principally statistical

            cross sections.
SAMPLE     The scatterer consisted of 105 g of finely powdered
           manganese packed in a cylindrical can of thin (0.3 mm)
           aluminum 3 cm in diam. and 1 cm deep.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Additionally, thin NaI (Tl) crystal (2.5 cm in
           diam., 1 mm thick) was used in order to reduce the
           background in the low energy region
