TITLE       The yields of I-129 in natural and in neutron
            induced fission of uranium
AUTHOR     (B.C.Purkayastha,G.R.Martin)
INSTITUTE  (2UK DUR)
METHOD     (ACTIV,RCHEM) Radioactivation technique
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Geiger-Muller tube.
SAMPLE     .Iodine extracted from pitchblende and from pile
            irradiated uranium metal.
CORRECTION .Corrected for contaminations with similar half
            lives such as Na-24, K-42 etc. Also corrected for
            losses due to finite resolving power of counter,
            self absorption in sample, radioactive decay, and
            chemical yield in separation procedures.
ERR-ANALYS .No errors given.

SAMPLE     The elementary iodine contained in the small silica
           ampoule prepared by radioactivation analysis  was sent
           for irradiation together with
            (a) a weighed sample of isotopically normal lead
                 iodide, and
            (b) a weighed piece of thin copper wire, each being
                contained in similar silica ampoules, all of which
                were placed within the same aluminum capsule for
                irradiation.
