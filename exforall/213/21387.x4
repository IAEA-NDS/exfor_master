TITLE      -ABSOLUTE FISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-235 FOR 2200 M/SE
            NEUTRONS -.
FACILITY   (CHOPF) FAST CHOPPER, ROTATED AT 625 RPM.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .THICK FOIL OF U-235, 92.93 PC U-235, 1.17 PC U-234,
            0.18 PC U-236, 5.72 PC U-238, 0.028 PC FE, 0.015 PC
            SILICON, 0.051 PC CARBON. THICKNESS 131 MG/CM*2.
METHOD     (TOF  ) TIME OF FLIGHT.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR, WITH PULSE SHAPE
            DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAMMAS.
ANALYSIS   .QUOTED DATA IS THE WEIGHTED MEAN OF MANY MEASUREMENTS
            WITH DIFFERENT FOIL THICKNESSES AND GEOMETRY FOR
            NEUTRON COUNTERS.
MONITOR    .NEUTRON FLUX MONITORED WITH A THICK B-10 BEAM STOP
            WITH DETECTION OF 478 KEV GAMMAS IN CALIBRATED
            NAI(TL) CRYSTALS.
            NAI(TL) CRYSTALS WERE CALIBRATED BY OBSERVING
            COINCIDENCES BETWEEN GAMMAS AND DISINTEGRATIONS IN
            A THIN SAMPLE OF B-10 IN AN IONISATION CHAMBER.
