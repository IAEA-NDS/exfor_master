INC-SPECT  The thermal neutron flux was determined by irradiating
           NH4H2PO4 with and without cadmium cover to correct for
           the activity produced by epi-cadmium neutrons.
SAMPLE     Two samples of 20 mg Sc2O3 and 4 mg K2CO3, one of each
           with cadmium cover, were irradiated for 2 h together
           with 100 mg (NH4)2SO4 and 40 mg NH4H2PO4 as fast and
           thermal flux monitors respectively.
ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined using two methods:
           1. Determination of the mean fission neutron cross-
           section on the basis of fluence ratios and cross-
           section ratios for fission and thermal neutrons
           2. Determination of the mean fission neutron cross-
           section on the basis of absolute fission neutron
           fluence measurements and absolute activity
           determinations
            The agreement of the results obtained by both methods
           is not merely a check but illustrates also the relative
           accuracy of the reference cross sections used.
CORRECTION .Corrected for thermal neutrons by comparing
            monitor irradiations with and without cadmium
            cover.
