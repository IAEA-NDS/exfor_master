TITLE       A measurement of the neutron-proton capture cross
            section
FACILITY   .Radio-active source.
INC-SOURCE (PO-BE) Polonium berilium source, in effectively
            infinite tanks of water and aqueous boric acid.
            Its output at the mid-point of the irradiation was
            about 2 x 10**6 neutrons/sec
SAMPLE     .Water and aqueous boric acid.
METHOD     .From determination of slow neutron density
            distributions from a steady source in water and
            aqueous boric acid.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Boron loaded emulsion. Track counting from the
            B-10(n,alpha) reaction, reproducible to 2%.
            All the disks were cut from the same
            10 in. x 8 in. x 100 mu-m sheet of unbacked emulsion
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) .Standard deviations from counting statistics.
            Since no significant difference was observed between
            results from the two scans (boron-loaded and unloaded
            disks), this possible source of systematic error was
            assumed to be negligible.

            Ratio of boron absorption to proton capture.
CORRECTION .Corrected for recoil proton background, 1.6%
            and disturbance of neutron density by detectors.

            standard times a factor of 0.985+-0.02 for the
            actual boron  used in this experiment.
CORRECTION .Corrected for proton recoil background and
