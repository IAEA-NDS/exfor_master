TITLE      -Neutron resonance parameters of Tc-99 in the
            energy range between 4.5 and 25 eV-.
FACILITY   (REAC) The FRG-1 reactor at IKK.
           (CHOPF) Fast chopper.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutrons from the reactor.
SAMPLE     .The Tc-99 was mixed with aluminum oxide and filled
            into two stainless steel sample holders to a sample
            thickness of 0.00078 and 0.00034 Tc-99 atoms/barn.
           .To check the homogeneity of the two samples,
            neutron radiographs were taken before and after the
            individual measurements.
           .Chemical purity of the material was tested with
            neutron activation and no essential impurities were
            found.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of Flight techniques using a flight
            path of 40 meters.
           .Resolution width was 17 milli-eV at E= 5.6 eV and
                                 50 milli-eV at E=20.3 eV.
           .Doppler width at room temperature was
                                 80 milli-eV at E= 5.6 eV and
                                150 milli-eV at E=20.3 eV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Li-6 glass-scintillator detectors.
PART-DET   (N) neutrons.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)
           (AREA)
            .Improved versions of the -SHAPE- and -AREA- codes by
             S.Atta and J.P.Harvey have been used.
            .The given values are weighted average values, deduced
             from several runs and different methods of analysis.
CORRECTION .No information given.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error is given, incl. uncertainties
            in sample thickness, resolution, doppler constant,
            potential scattering radius and energy scale.
COMMENT    .The authors point out, that the value of the total
            width do not agree with any earlier measurements, but
            correspond exactly to the average capture width of
            174 milli-eV given by Adamtschuk (C,73KIEV,2,172,1973)
