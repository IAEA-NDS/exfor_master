TITLE      -OBSERVATION OF DOUBLY RADIATIVE NEUTRON CAPTURE BY
            HE-3.-
FACILITY   (REAC ) HIGH-FLUX REACTOR AT ILL, GRENOBLE.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) THE H22 THERMAL NEUTRON GUIDE AT THE REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  THE THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX AT THE SAMPLE WAS
            2.6E+09 +- 0.1E+09 NEUTRONS/S.
SAMPLE     .PURE HE-3 GAS IN A 90 MM LONG GAS TARGET WITH A
            PRESSURE OF 2 BAR.
METHOD     (COINC) A STANDARD FAST-SLOW COINCIDENCE ELECTRONIC
            SYSTEM WAS USED.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) TWO NAI(TL) DETECTORS, 25 CM IN DIA. AND 30
            CM LONG, EACH SURROUNDED,EXCEPT FOR THE FRONT SIDE,BY
            A THICK PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR.
           .THE NAI(TL) DETECTORS WERE PEAK EFFICIENCY CALIBRATED
            BY MEANS OF THE H-3(P,G)HE-4 REACTION AT EP=1.0 MEV.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.

REACTION   (2-HE-3(N,2G)2-HE-4,,SIG,,MXW)
METHOD     .THE TWO GAMMA-RAYS WERE MEASURED WITH AN ANGLE OF 90
            DEGREES BETWEEN THE DETECTORS AND ASSUMING AN ANGULAR
            CORRELATION OF 1+(COS)**2 BETWEEN THE TWO GAMMA-RAYS.
