SAMPLE     252Cf electrodeposited target (1.7 ug) were collected
           on 0.5 mm, Al-catcher foil at 1 mm distance.
           245Cm target 3 ug, electrodeposited. Covered with the
           Al-catcher foil.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 60 cm3 with resolution 1.5 keV at 122 keV and
           3.9 keV at 1332 keV.
METHOD     Collection of fission fragments on Al-catcher foil.
           The amounts of the investigated fission product
           nuclei and of their daughters was determined by
           measuring the daughters' gamma activities at
           different cooling times.
ANALYSIS   The required half-lives of the fission products and
           their daughters were taken from the 'Karlsruhe
           Nuklid-karte' 1974.
           From the numbers of nuclei of a given fission product
           'm', n(m), and of its daughter 'd', n(d) , at the end
           of irradiation, the fractional cumulative yield ('FCY')
           was obtained from the relation FCY(m)= n(m)/n(m)+n(d).

COMMENT    In Table 3 of Phys.Rev.C,17,188, the fract. cum. yield
           of Te-134 is given as 0.69. According to the author,
           this is a misprint, and the average value given in
           the data-section below (taken from Table 1 of the
           paper) is correct.
FLAG       (1.) Data are from 77Pune,2,249. The decay data used
           are not given in this reference but they were also
           taken from the 'Karlsruhe Nuklidkarte',1974.
           (2.) Data are from Phys.Rev.C,17,188.
