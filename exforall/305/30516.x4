TITLE      - FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE YIELDS IN THE THERMAL FISSION
           OF CM-245 AND THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252.-
FACILITY   (REAC) REACTOR 'APSARA'
INC-SOURCE (REAC). FLUX= 10E+12 N/CM2*SEC APPROX.
SAMPLE     CF-252  1.7 MICROGRAMS, ELECTRODEPOSITED ON STAINLESS
                   STEEL. 0.5MM AL-CATCHER FOIL AT 1MM DISTANCE.
           CM-245  3 MICROGRAMS,ELECTRODEPOSITED. COVERED WITH THE
                   AL-CATCHER FOIL.
METHOD     COLLECTION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS ON AL-CATCHER FOIL.
           THE AMOUNTS OF THE INVESTIGATED FISSION PRODUCT NUCLEI
           AND OF THEIR DAUGHTERS WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE
           DAUGHTERS' GAMMA ACTIVITIES AT DIFFERENT COOLING TIMES.
DETECTOR   (GELI). 60 CM3. RESOLUTION= 1.5 KEV AT 122 KEV,
                                       3.9 KEV AT 1332 KEV.
ANALYSIS   THE REQUIRED HALF-LIVES OF THE FISSION PRODUCTS AND
           THEIR DAUGHTERS WERE TAKEN FROM THE 'KARLSRUHE NUKLID-
           KARTE' 1974.
           FROM THE NUMBERS OF NUCLEI OF A GIVEN FISSION PRODUCT
           'M', N(M), AND OF ITS DAUGHTER 'D', N(D), AT THE END
           OF IRRADIATION, THE FRACTIONAL CUMULATIVE YIELD ('FCY')
           WAS OBTAINED FROM THE RELATION
                          FCY(M)= N(M)/N(M)+N(D).

COMMENT    IN TABLE 3 OF PHYS.REV.C,17,188, THE FRACT.CUM.YIELD
           OF TE-134 IS GIVEN AS 0.69. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR,
           THIS IS A MISPRINT, AND THE AVERAGE VALUE GIVEN IN THE
           DATA-SECTION BELOW (TAKEN FROM TABLE 1 OF THE PAPER)
           IS CORRECT.
FLAG       (1.) DATA ARE FROM 77PUNE,2,249. THE DECAY DATA USED
           ARE NOT GIVEN IN THIS REFERENCE  BUT THEY WERE ALSO
           TAKEN FROM THE 'KARLSRUHE NUKLIDKARTE',1974.
