TITLE      THE MEASUREMENT OF THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PROMPT
           NEUTRONS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROMPT NEUTRON NUMBERS
           FOR CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION.
SAMPLE     NO DETAIL INFORMATION.
METHOD     LIQUID-SCINTILLATION METHOD.
DETECTOR   (STANK)
            111 LITRE OF TOLUEN-BASED GADOLINIUM-LOADED
           SCINTILLATION LIQUID FILLED IN A SPHERICAL ALUMINUM
           CONTAINER WITH A DIAMETER OF 60 CM.
           6 PHOTO-MULTIPLIERS EMI9530B WERE USED.
           .NEUTRON DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
            WAS CALCULATED BY MONTE CARLO CALCULATION CODE,
            WRITTEN BY XU SHU-YAN ET AL.,J.NUCL.SCI.TECH.(TO BE

           .SPONTANEOUS FISSION EVENTS WAS DETECTED BY FAST
           CURRENT IONIZATION CHAMBER.
