TITLE      Mass distribution in the neutron induced fission of
           232U
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SPECT  Cd-cutoff ratio for 232U(n,f) = 0.5 approximately
SAMPLE     (92-U-232,ENR=0.9914) Isotopic composition in percent =
             232U    99.14
             233U     0.85
             234U     0.004
           targets (10micrograms) were prepared by electrodeposi-
           tion and wrapped in 2.5 mm superpure Al-foil.
METHOD     - The relative 'r-value' method was applied, starting
           from the respective 235U fission yields with 99Mo
           as internal standard.
           (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the
           'thin target-recoil-catcher technique'.
           (CHSEP) For low yield products radiochemical methods
           were used.
           High yield products were measured by gamma-spectrometry
DETECTOR   (GELI). For high yield products.
           (PROPC) End window gas flow proportional counter for
           low yield products.
ANALYSIS   235U targets (2 micrograms) were irradiated together
           with the 232U targets. activities of the 235U fission
           products were measured in the same way as those of
           232U.
           The 235U fission product yields were taken from the
           compilation of meek+rider.

REACTION   (92-U-232(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,EPI)
MONITOR    (92-U-232(N,F)42-MO-99,CUM,FY,,EPI) Assumed to be equal
           to the 99Mo yield from 235U.
MISC-COL   (MISC) 'R'-value, R= A(99,5)*A(P,2)/A(99,2)*A(P,5)
             where  A(99,2),A(99,5)...activities of 99Mo as
             fission product from 232U, 235U respectively, and
                    A(P,2),A(P,5) ... activities of product 'p'
             from the fission of 232U,235U respectively.
CORRECTION A correction (2-5 percent) was applied for the
           contribution from u-233 fissions.
           The 'raw' yield data obtained from the r-values were
           complemented with the missing yields by interpolation.
           each wing of the mass distribution was then normalized
           to sum up to 100 percent.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty determined from:
              gamma counting statistics                 2-3%;
              compton subtraction                       2-3%;
              beta counting statistics                  5-7%;
           (ERR-1) chemical yield,self-absorpt       3%;
