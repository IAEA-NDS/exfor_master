TITLE      Neutron-induced fission of lead isotopes.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3POLIFJ) U-120 cyclotron of institute of nuclear
           physics in Cracow.
INC-SOURCE (D-BE)  Be-9(d,n)B-10 reaction.
INC-SPECT  Because of wide energy spread of the neutron beam,
           the spectrum averaged values are used.
SAMPLE     The lead isotopes were brought onto quartz plates in
           the isotope separator at the Institute of Nuclear
           Research.  In this mass-separator, contamination with
           neighbouring isotopes was less than 0.1%.
           The relative values of the amount of lead isotopes were
           obtained by the microphotometer and the absolute ones
           were determined by measuring backscattering of alpha
           particles.
METHOD     Dielectric track detector method for detection of
           fission fragments.
           To determine the number of neutrons passing through the
           Pb targets,
            (1.) natural U containing a known number of U-atoms
            was exposed during the experiment in the same geometry
            as the Pb target,
            (2.) the number of U-atoms was determined by irradiat-
            ing with thermal neutrons of the EWA reactor(thermal
            column) at Swierk.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Quartz track detectors.  Synthetic quartz
           plates of 20*80*1 mm cut along the cryst.plane(1010).
MONITOR    (92-U-0(N,F),,SIG)  No further information.
PART-DET   (FF)
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 1 of
                             J.Phys.G,Nucl.Phys.,5,(7),(1979)1001.
CORRECTION  (1.) The B.G. was determined by counting the track on
             the side of the detector which was not in contact
             with the lead.
            (2.) The excess of tracks which was not due to fission
             fragments from the Pb isotopes, was also taken into
             the consideration.

COMMENT    Because of a neutron beam of wide energy spread, only
           the number of Pb-208 fission fragment tracks per cm2
           is recorded as follows
             number of tracks from Pb region per cm2..  108 +- 14.
             nos.of B.G. tracks from Pb region/cm2 ..   102 +- 14.
           and since B.G. is large, number of Pb fission fragment-
           tracks per cm2 is not given.
