TITLE      Fission yields in the symmetric region yields of the
           stable isotopes of tin and cadmium in the thermal
           neutron fission of 235U and 239Pu.
EXP-YEAR   (1973)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANMCM)
SAMPLE     The samples of 235U (enriched to 93%) and 239Pu were
           purified by anion exchange with hydrochloric acid. The
           purified solution was evaporated into quartz
           irradiation vials, flamed to convert to oxide form, and
           sealed in vacuum. Each vial contained 10 mg 235U or
           8 mg 239Pu respectively.
METHOD     (CHSEP).The fission product tin and cadmium were
           separated from the irradiated samples by an anion
           exchange method that had been standardized before.
           Contamination from naturally occurring isotopes was
           minimized by performing the extraction procedures in a
           dry box set up in a fume hood with a high rate of
           exhaust.
           (ASEP) The isotopic analysis was carried out on a 38 cm
           radius tandem mass spectrometer, which was operated at
           a resolution = 1000. A modified electron impact ion
           source (described by De Laeter and Thode in Can. J.
           Phys. 47(1969)1409) was used. Its sensitivity to tin
           was enhanced by adding to the tin-sample (about 25
           nano-g) 1 microliter of 0.7sm phosphoric acid. Since
           this procedure produced a molecular ion peak at mass
           124, some tin separations were done without phosphoric
           acid, in order to also measure 124Sn.
STATUS     Data are taken from Phys.Rev. C,15,344.
HISTORY    (19790907C) TL.
           (19800729U) ML. Reaction changed from ratio to relative
           (20040311U) SD: corrected 4-dig. year and lower cases.
CORRECTION The mass discrimination was determined by analysis of
           natural tin samples. The resulting correction of 1.5
           percent/mass unit was also used to correct the
           Cd - abundances.

           Yields of cadmium-isotopes relative to 111Cd
COMMENT    The data are the means of measurements in 3 different
           samples, except for 116Cd, where 1 sample was
           contaminated by 116sn.
FLAG       (1.) For mass=113, read =113+114. the sum of the
           measured relative abundances is given, owing to the
           high neutron absorption cross-section of 113Cd.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated errors take into account the
           statistical error and the error introduced by
           correction for natural contamination.

           Yields of tin-isotopes relative to 126Sn
COMMENT    The data are the means of results for 2 samples,on each
           of which measurements at different filament tempera-
           tures and beam currents were made. The value for 124Sn
           is based on only 1 sample, which was loaded with nitric
           instead of phosphoric acid.
CORRECTION Each measurement was corrected separately for contamin-
           ation, as this factor varied with the measurements.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated errors take into account the
           dispersion between the samples as well as the
           dispersion in the different measurements on each sample

METHOD     The relative Cd-yield data were normalized to mass=111.
           The yield of mass=113 was established by smooth extra-
           polation of the curve through masses 111 and 112. Then
           the yield of mass=114 was obtained by subtraction of
           the 113-yield from the normalized measured sum of
           relative abundances of masses 113+114.
           The tin-yields were matched to the normalized Cd-yields
           by placing the 117Sn yield on a smooth curve towards
           the normalized 116Cd yield.
