REFERENCE  (R,HSJ-77091,197810) Corrected values. In Chinese.
            === Compiler's note.
           The experiment was performed in 1967
           and published in an internal Chinese
           report without giving the author's name.
           The numerical data of the 1967 experiment
           are quoted by Chou You-Pu, who
           reviewed and corrected the original data.
             The compiler has compiled only the corrected result
             by Chou You-Pu.  ===

CORRECTION Chou You-Pu applied the following corrections to the
           original data from 1967 =
           .The branching ratio for the 59.6 keV
           gammas was changed from the originally
           assumed 38% to 36%,
           resulting in a correction of -5.3%
           .An additional correction (which was not
           considered in the 1967 data) was applied
           for the effects from 102. keV X-ray
           and 207.8 keV gamma-ray, resulting
           in a correction of +18.5+-4%.
