           Corrected value given. The original experimental
            result was published in 1967 in an internal CIAE
            report without the author's name.
           All information was compiled from this 1978 report.

MISC-COL   (MISC) Data are corrected by Chou You-Pu. The original
            result was presented as internal report of Atomic
            Energy Institute without the author's name.
           The following corrections were made to the original
            data from 1967:
            - The branching ratio for the 59.6 keV gammas was
              changed from the originally assumed 38% to 36%,
              resulting in a correction of -5.3%.
            - An additional correction (which was not considered
              in the 1967 data) was applied for the effects from
              102 keV X-ray and 207.8 keV gamma-ray, resulting
              in a correction of +18.5+/-4%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 4 of Report HSJ-77091 (1978).
           The numerical data of the 1967 experiment are quoted
            by Chou You-Pu, who reviewed and corrected the
            original data.
