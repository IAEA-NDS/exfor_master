AUTHOR     (R.H.Iyer,R.Sampathkumar,N.K.Chaudhuri)
TITLE      14MeV neutron induced fission of Pb and Bi.
FACILITY   (CCW,3INDTAT). 1MW cascade generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     154.35 micrograms lead
           114.18 micrograms bismuth
           superpure metal, dissolved in superpure nitric acid,
           deposited on electro-polished stainless steel
           planchets.
METHOD     Fission track recording, counting on optical micro-
           scope.
DETECTOR   (TRD)  mica track detector
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) depleted uranium (99.783% 238U)
PART-DET   (FF)
STATUS     (APRVD) ,R.H.Iyer, on 4 feb.1980. data as in BARC-872
HISTORY    (19790927C) TL.
           (19800508U) ML. Author's approval added
           (20040311U) SD: corrected 4-dig. year and lower cases.
CORRECTION To estimate the heavy element impurities, identical
           targets were irradiated in the thermal column of the
           'apsara' reactor and counted on 'lexan' fission track
           detector. they were found to be = 1.3ppm approx.
           appropriate corrections were applied in determining
           the fission cross-sections of pb and bi.
