TITLE      - Energy spectra and yields of alfa particles in ter-
           nary fission of 235U by neutrons with energies ranging
           from thermal to 1.75 MeV.-
FACILITY   (VDG). 5.5MeV
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutrons were produced by surrounding the
           ionization chamber with paraffine blocks.
SAMPLE     5 mg/cm2 235U target
METHOD     (COINC) The alfa-spectra above 10MeV were recorded in
           coincidence with the fission fragments.
           Each fast neutron run was preceded and followed by a
           thermal neutron run, in order to check the detector
           stability.
DETECTOR   (IOCH). Ar-filled.the cathode was formed by the 235U
           target, the collector by a thin (about 7 mg/cm2) Al-
           foil. -for fragment detection.
           (SOLST). -For long range alfa('LRA') detection.
ANALYSIS   Gaussians were fitted by the least squares method to
           the measured LRA-spectra.
MONITOR    Weak 241Am and 239Np sources were used for on-line
           energy calibration of the LRA-detector.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data are taken from Tbl. 1 of 76LOWELL,1409
           They supersede the data given in 75CALCUTTA,2,131 and
           BARC-878,47.
CORRECTION The recorded LRA-spectra were corrected for the energy
           loss in the gas and in the Al-foil.
