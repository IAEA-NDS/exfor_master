TITLE      Energy measurements of delayed neutron groups from 235U
AUTHOR     (A.Naeem)
INSTITUTE  (3SARRIY)
REFERENCE  (J,ESJ,4,31,1978)
EXP-YEAR   (1970)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAVIP)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Mechanical beam chopper
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.99564) U(3)O(8), 14.935 g U-235 in the
           target, 3.8 cm diameter, 0.68 cm thickness; natural
           lead 15.02 g - for background data.
METHOD     Collimated neutron beam was pulsed by means of
            mechanical chopper. Delayed neutrons were counted
            when neutron beam was blocked
PART-DET   (DN)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) He-3 detector
ANALYSIS   First, the fraction of each delayed neutron group
            present in each chopper speed was calculated.
           Then the average energies for each group could be
            derived.
CORRECTION Pulse height spectrum was corrected for wall and
            recoil effects using an inversion matrix technique.
           Data were corrected also for detector efficiency
            (as a function of neutron energy) and resolution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main contribution of error was resolution
            of detector (about 18% at av.energy = 368 keV)
