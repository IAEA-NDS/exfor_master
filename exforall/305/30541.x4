TITLE      Energy measurements of delayed neutron groups
           from U-235
EXP-YEAR   (1970)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAVIP)
INC-SOURCE (REAC). Mechanical beam chopper
SAMPLE     Enriched U-235 (99.564%)
METHOD     Collimated neutron beam was pulsed by means of
           mechanical chopper. Delayed neutrons were counted
           when neutron beam was blocked
PART-DET   (DN)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) He-3 detector
ANALYSIS   First, the fraction of each delayed neutron group
           present in each chopper speed was calculated. Then
           the average energies for each group could be derived.
STATUS     Data from J.Eng.Sci.(Saudi Arabia)4,31,1978 (p.36,37)
CORRECTION Pulse height spectrum was corrected for wall and
           recoil effects using an inversion matrix technique.
           Data were corrected also for detector efficiency (as a
           function of neutron energy) and resolution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main contribution of error was resolution
            of detector (about 18% at av.energy = 368 keV)

                       made formal corrections.
