TITLE      THE SM-147(N,A)ND-144 REACTION ON 2 KEV NEUTRONS.
FACILITY   (REAC) VVR-S REACTOR
INC-SOURCE QUASI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS, ENERGY OF WHICH IS AROUND
           2 KEV. THE NEUTRONS WERE PASSED THROUGH A FILTER OF
           185 G/CM2 (600MM, DIAM.OF 20MM, PRESSED INTO LEAD
           RINGS) PURE METALLIC SCANDIUM.
            (2.4+-0.4)*E+6/CM2/SEC WITH AN ENERGY OF 2KEV AND
           FWHM OF 900 EV.
SAMPLE     ENRICHED SM-147. SM(2)-O(3),5.E-4 G/CM2 THICK.
           SAMPLE WAS IN A VACUUM CHAMBER.
METHOD     (PHD)
           THE ALPHA SPECTRUM WAS ACCUMULATED DURING 870 HOURS.
           AND BACKGROUND WAS MEASURED FOR 206 HOURS WITH NEUTRON
           BEAM ADDITIONALLY FILTERED BY 18.1 G/CM2 MANGANESE AND
           2.7 G/CM2 CERIUM.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)  8CM2 SILICON SURFACE-BARRIER DETECTOR.
           .GEOMETRICAL FACTOR WAS CALCULATED TO BE 1.6E-2.
MONITOR    NO FURTHER INFORMATION.
STATUS     DATA TAKEN FROM Z.PHYSIK, A294(1980)197.

EN-SEC      COMPILER'S NOTE === THE LEVEL ENERGIES OF ND-144 ARE
            TAKEN FROM TABLE OF ISOTOPES 6TH ED..
COMMENT     ALPHA EMISSION WIDTH TO GROUND (0+) STATE OF ND-144 IS
             ALPHA-WIDTH = (5.3+-1.4) MICRO-EV,
            AND FOR TRANSITION TO THE 1ST EXCITED STATE IS
             ALPHA-WIDTH = (1.3+-0.3) MICRO-EV.
