TITLE      The Sm-147(n,a)Nd-144 reaction on 2 keV neutrons.
FACILITY   (REAC,3CZRUJF) VVR-S reactor
INC-SOURCE Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons, energy of which is around
           2 keV. The neutrons were passed through a filter of
           185 g/cm2 (600mm, diam.of 20mm, pressed into lead
           rings) pure metallic scandium.
            (2.4+-0.4)*10**6/cm2/sec with an energy of 2keV and
           FWHM of 900 eV.
SAMPLE     Enriched Sm-147. Sm(2)-O(3),5./10**4 g/cm2 thick.
           Sample was in a vacuum chamber.
METHOD     (PHD,FNB)
           The alpha spectrum was accumulated during 870 hours
           and background was measured for 206 hours with neutron
           beam additionally filtered by 18.1 g/cm2 manganese and
           2.7 g/cm2 cerium.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)  8cm2 silicon surface-barrier detector.
           .Geometrical factor was calculated to be 1.6/10**2.
MONITOR    No further information.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No further information.
STATUS     Data taken from Z.Physik, A294(1980)197.

EN-SEC      Compiler's note === The level energies of Nd-144 are
            taken from Table of isotopes 6th ed..
COMMENT     Alpha emission width to ground (0+) state of Nd-144 is
             alpha-width = (5.3+-1.4) micro-eV,
            and for transition to the 1st excited state is
             alpha-width = (1.3+-0.3) micro-eV.
