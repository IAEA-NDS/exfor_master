TITLE      MOLYBDENUM-99 FISSION YIELD IN THE THERMAL NEUTRON-
           INDUCED FISSION OF PLUTONIUM-239 AND URANIUM-235.
FACILITY   (REAC) CIRUS-REACTOR
INC-SPECT  THE CD-RATIO FOR FISSION OR CO-ACTIVATION WAS GREATER
           THAN 200,
SAMPLE     ACCURATELY WEIGHED SOLUTIONS OF PURIFIED PLUTONIUM (AN-
           ALYZED FOR PU-239 CONTENT) AND NAT. URANIUM RESPECTIVE-
           LY WERE EVAPORATED ON SUPERPURE AL-FOIL AND WRAPPED
           IN ANOTHER AL-FOIL. THE TARGETS CONTAINED ABOUT
           10 MICRO-G OF PU-239 OR U-235.
METHOD     (CHSEP) AFTER IRRADIATION, THE TARGETS WERE DISSOLVED.
           A KNOWN AMOUNT OF MO-CARRIER WAS ADDED TO AN ALIQUOT
           OF THE SOLUTION. MO WAS THEN SEPARATED, PURIFIED AND
           PRECIPITATED AS LEAD-MOLYBDATE. AFTER DETERMINING THE
           CHEMICAL YIELD, MACRO-SAMPLES OF ABOUT 20 MG PRECIPIT-
           ATE WEIGHT ON STANDARD AL-PLATES WITH DOUBLE-COATED
           CELLULOSE TAPE, COVERED WITH 3 MG/CM2 THICK CELLOPHANE
           PAPER, WERE MOUNTED FOR BETA-COUNTING.
DETECTOR   (PROPC). END-WINDOW METHANE GAS FLOW, 4PI-GEOMETRY.
           (GELI). FOR PURITY CHECK AND BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE.
HALF-LIFE  (HL1,42-MO-99) DETERMINED BY FOLLOWING THE DECAY OF
           MORE THAN 60 SAMPLES.
COMMENT    COMPILER'S COMMENT  FROM A CD-RATIO=200 FOR CO-59, THE
           EPITHERMAL INDEX R=0.0022 IS DERIVED. IN HIS 1977-
           EVALUATION, NEDO-12154-2, B.F. RIDER ASSUMED A NEUTRON
           TEMPERATURE OF T=40 DEG.C. THE VALUES R AND T WERE USED
           FOR A RE-EVALUATION BY M.LAMMER (SYMPOS. ON NUCL. DATA
           IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, PARIS,1973,VOL.1,P.505).
STATUS     THE DATA ARE FROM TABLE 1 OF RADIOCHIM.ACTA 19,P.90.

METHOD     THE DETECTOR-EFFICIENCY FOR MO-99 BETA ACTIVITY WAS
           DETERMINED WITH THE AID OF ACCURATELY KNOWN AMOUNTS
           OF MO-99/TC-99-M IN RADIOACTIVE EQUILIBRIUM. THE BETA
           COUNTING EFFICIENCY FOR MO-99 AND THE CONV.EL.-COUNTING
           EFFICIENCY FOR TC-99-M WERE DETERMINED THROUGH GAMMA-TO
           -BETA/GAMMA COINC. RATIOS, AND THE TC-99-M CONTRIBUTION
           WAS THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE TOTAL COUNTING RATE.
