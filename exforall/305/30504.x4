TITLE      Molybdenum-99 fission yield in the thermal neutron-
           induced fission of plutonium-239 and uranium-235.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS-reactor
INC-SPECT  The Cd-ratio for contribution to fission products or
           cobalt activation was greater than 200
SAMPLE     Accurately weighed solutions of purified plutonium (an-
           alyzed for Pu-239 content) and nat. uranium respective-
           ly were evaporated on superpure Al-foil and wrapped
           in another Al-foil. The targets contained about
           10 micro-g of Pu-239 or U-235.
METHOD     (CHSEP) After irradiation, the targets were dissolved.
           A known amount of Mo-carrier was added to an aliquot
           of the solution. Mo was then separated, purified and
           precipitated as lead-molybdate. After determining the
           chemical yield, macro-samples of about 20 mg precipit-
           ate weight on standard Al-plates with double-coated
           cellulose tape, covered with 3 mg/cm2 thick cellophane
           paper, were mounted for beta-counting.
DETECTOR   (PROPC). End-window methane gas flow, 4pi-geometry.
           (GELI). For purity check and beta-gamma coincidence.
DECAY-DATA (42-MO-99,66.18HR) Determined by following the decay of
           more than 60 samples.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: From a Cd-ratio=200 for Co-59, the
           epithermal index r=0.0022 is derived. In his 1977-
           evaluation, NEDO-12154-2, B.F. Rider assumed a neutron
           temperature of T=40 deg.C. The values r and t were used
           for a re-evaluation by M.Lammer (Sympos. on Nucl. Data
           in Science and Technology, Paris,1973,vol.1,P.505).
STATUS     (TABLE) The data are from Table 1 of
                                        Radiochim.Acta 19,p.90.
           (APRVD) Approved by H.C.Jain 79/12/13
ERR-ANALYS The accuracies are estimated as follows:
              Number of fissile atoms:  1 percent,
              Pu-239 fission cross-section:  0.5 percent,
              U-235  fission cross-section:  2 percent
              Fission product activities:  2 percent.

METHOD     The detector-efficiency for Mo-99 beta activity was
           determined with the aid of accurately known amounts
           of Mo-99/Tc-99-m in radioactive equilibrium. The beta
           counting efficiency for Mo-99 and the conv.el.-counting
           efficiency for Tc-99-m were determined through gamma-to
           -beta/gamma coinc. ratios, and the Tc-99-m contribution
           was then subtracted from the total counting rate.

METHOD    1(RVAL) Using the following terminology
              Y(f,p)=yield of product with mass p, from fissile
                     with mass f,  and
              A(f,p)=activity (counts/sec) of product p from
                     fissile f,
              the Mo-99 yield is obtained by the 'R-value' method
              through the following formula
                   Y(239,99)= R * (Y(239,140)/Y(235,140)), with
                   R= (A(239,99)/(A(239,140))*
                      (A(235,140)/(A(235,99))
          2Using the same terminology, plus  n(f) and sig(f)=
              number of atoms and fission cross-section of fissile
              f respectively, the Mo-99 yield is obtained by the
              'Modified comparison' method through the following
              formula
                   Y(239,99)=(A(239,99)/A(235,99))*(n(235)/n(239))
                             *(sig(235)/sig(239)) * Y(235,99)

COMMENT   1The resulting yield value is the average of 7 single
           determinations.
           Author's comments  fission cross-sections are not
           involved.Values were obtained from the same irradiation
           as that used for modified comparison method and
           absolute method.
          2The resulting yield value is the average of 10 single
           determinations.
           Compiler's comment  correcting the 2200m/sec cross-
           sections as used by the authors for the Maxwell distri-
           bution + estimated epithermal factor, the Mo-99 yield
           from the 'modified comparison' method becomes  6.25%.
