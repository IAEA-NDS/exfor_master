SAMPLE     Natural silicon
MONITOR    Sodium and aluminum standards were irradiated together
           with the silicon samples.
FACILITY   (REAC,3DDRROS) Rossendorf Research Reactor
           Static generator - for 14MeV neutrons.

METHOD     (ACTIV). After irradiation of the silicon samples, the
           contents of Na-24 are measured.
            Na-24 can be produced either by impurities, i.e.:
                    Na-23(n,g) (with thermal neutrons), or
                    Al-27(n,a) (with fast neutrons)
            or by the reaction
                    Si-28(n,ap), which has a q-value of 14.7 MeV.
DETECTOR   (GELI).60 cm3.
ANALYSIS   Cd-wrapped Si irradiated in the reactor core gave
           higher amounts of Na-24 than Si irradiated in the 14MeV
           neutron generator. Because of the high q-value, it was
           assumed that the Si-28(n,ap)reaction could not take
           place in the 14MeV neutron beam. Therefore, the
           difference of Na-24 produced in the fission spectrum of
           the reactor and in the 14MeV beam was attributed to the
           Si-28(n,ap) reaction.

INC-SPECT  Cd-wrapped sample in reactor core with:

COMMENT     -Note that the cross-section value is an average over
             the whole fission spectrum, although the threshold
