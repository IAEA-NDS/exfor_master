           (P,ZFK-340,,7709) SHORT NOTE.
SAMPLE     NATURAL SILICON
MONITOR    SODIUM AND ALUMINUM STANDARDS WERE IRRADIATED TOGETHER
           WITH THE SILICON SAMPLES.
FACILITY   (REAC) ROSSENDORF RESEARCH REACTOR
           STATIC GENERATOR - FOR 14MEV NEUTRONS.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
           (D-T)
METHOD     (ACTIV). AFTER IRRADIATION OF THE SILICON SAMPLES, THE
           CONTENTS OF NA-24 ARE MEASURED.
            NA-24 CAN BE PRODUCED EITHER BY IMPURITIES, I.E.:
                    NA-23(N,G) (WITH THERMAL NEUTRONS), OR
                    AL-27(N,A) (WITH FAST NEUTRONS)
            OR BY THE REACTION
                    SI-28(N,AP), WHICH HAS A Q-VALUE OF 14.7 MEV.
DETECTOR   (GELI).60 CM3.
ANALYSIS   CD-WRAPPED SI IRRADIATED IN THE REACTOR CORE GAVE
           HIGHER AMOUNTS OF NA-24 THAN SI IRRADIATED IN THE 14MEV
           NEUTRON GENERATOR. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH Q-VALUE, IT WAS
           ASSUMED THAT THE SI-28(N,AP)REACTION COULD NOT TAKE
           PLACE IN THE 14MEV NEUTRON BEAM. THEREFORE, THE
           DIFFERENCE OF NA-24 PRODUCED IN THE FISSION SPECTRUM OF
           THE REACTOR AND IN THE 14MEV BEAM WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE
           SI-28(N,AP) REACTION.
