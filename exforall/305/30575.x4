TITLE      Absolute yields of short-lived fission products in the
           thermal neutron induced fission of 235U and 239Pu

SAMPLE     A known weight (not given in the paper) of the fissile
           material solution was sealed in a polypropylene tube.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement: an accurately diluted portion of
           the sample solution was sealed together with a thin
           mica strip in a polypropylene tube for determination of
           the number of fissions.no weight or dimension is given.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM).CIRUS,natural uranium fuel,candu type.
                          pneumatic irradiation facility.
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor neutrons.No other information given.
METHOD     'Track-etch-cum-gamma-ray spectrometry'
           The monitor was irradiated together with the sample
           fission track counting using an optical microsope. The
             track density was detrmined by scanning a small
             representative area of the mica detector.
           Direct gamma-ray spectrometry of unseparated fission
             products for the determination of the number of
             fission product atoms.The whole sample was measured
             starting immediately after irradiation. gamma spectra
             were taken at every 2 minutes interval.
DETECTOR   (TRD).Thin mica strip
           The track registration efficiency has been determined
           by two independent methods:
            - direct comparison with the number of fissions in a
              thin target-detector assembly
            - accurate measurement of the thermal neutron flux.
           (GELI).of 60 ccm,coupled to a 4096 channel analyser.
           The calibrated system was used in an international
           intercomparison of gamma-ray emission rate measurements
           which has proven the correctness of the efficiency curv
ANALYSIS   The total number of fissions was derived from the
           fission track density,taking inot account:
             - weight of the fissile material
             - efficiency for track registration in solution
             - concentration of the target material in solution
           gamma-ray spectra were analyzed by a computer program
             with automatic peak location and integration.
           The formula given for the calculation of fission yields
             from measured fission product activities does not
             include any precursors.
           Compilers comment: this may be problematic in the case
           of 89Rb, 104Ru, 138Cs, 139Ba and 142La,as the half-
           lives of their precursors are comparable to the cooling
           time (and possibly also to the irradiation time,which
           is not given),and in 2 cases (89Kr, 138Xe) they are
           also comparable to those of their daughters.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error (1 sigma)
           (ERR-T) Total error: sum of random error and total
                                systematic error.
           Systematic error: composed of e.g.(listed in paper):
            - error in Ge(Li)-detector efficiency calibration
            - error in track counting
            - errors in nuclear decay data
           The accuracy of the Ge(Li) efficiency calibration,as
             derived from the international intercomparison (see
             'detector'),is about 1 % from 300 to 1500 kev.
COMMENT    Cooling time: the transportation of the sample from the
             irradiation to the measurment position took almost
             10 minutes.(improvements are planned.)
           A separate sample (diluted to reduce the track density)
             had to be used for recording the number of fissions,
             which had an additional uncertainty due to volume
             correction.
           A comparison of the decay data used with the data file
             of A.Tobias (UK,1977) shows a number of discrepancies
             for gamma-ray abundances,as indicated with the decay-
             data,which are a major source of error.
