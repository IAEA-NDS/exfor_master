FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS-reactor
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.939) 1 mg/cm2 235U, electroplated on
            an aluminum backing of 8 mg/cm2.
METHOD     The fissile foil was mounted at an angle of 45 degrees
            with respect to the joining line between the LRA-
            detector (D1) and one of the fragment detectors (D4).
           The Al-backing faced the LRA-detector, in order to
            absorb the natural alphas.
           The other two fragment detectors (D2,D3) were placed
            at angles of 90 and 45 degrees with respect to the
            joining line D1-D4.
           (COINC) Between D1 on the one hand and D2,D3,D4 resp.
           (PHD) LRA-energy above 11 MeV.
           The ungated LRA-pulses (D1) and each of the coincident
            LRA-pulses were recorded in one quarter of a 1024-
            channel analyzer each.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) One of 8 mm radius for long range alpha (LRA)
            detection.
           Three with sensitive area=9x9 mm2, for fission
            fragment detection.
ANALYSIS   The average angles between LRA and fragments were
            determined from the detector positions by Monte Carlo
            calculations.
CORRECTION The recorded LRA-spectra were corrected for chance
            coincidences and energy loss in the target backing.
