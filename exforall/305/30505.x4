TITLE      Correlation between energies and angles of alpha-
           particles emitted in thermal neutron fission of 235U.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Cirus-reactor
SAMPLE     1 mg/cm2 235U (93.9% enriched), electroplated on an
           aluminum backing of 8 mg/cm2.
METHOD     The fissile foil was mounted at an angle of 45 degrees
           with respect to the joining line between the LRA-
           detector (D1) and one of the fragment detectors (D4).
           the Al-backing faced the LRA-detector, in order to
           absorb the natural alphas.
           The other two fragment detectors (D2,D3) were placed at
           angles of 90 and 45 degrees with respect to the joining
           line D1-D4.
           (COINC).Between D1 on the one hand and D2,D3,D4 resp.
           (PHD). LRA-energy above 11 MeV.
           The ungated LRA-pulses (D1) and each of the coincident
           LRA-pulses were recorded in one quarter of a 1024-
           channel analyzer each.
DETECTOR   (SOLST). One of 8 mm radius for Long Range Alpha('LRA')
           detection.
           Three with sensitive area=9x9 mm2,for fission fragment
           detection.
ANALYSIS   The average angles between LRA and fragments were
           determined from the detector positions by Monte Carlo
           calculations.
CORRECTION The recorded LRA-spectra were corrected for chance
           coincidences and energy loss in the target backing.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data are taken from Nucl.Phys. A196,209.
HISTORY    (19790730C) TL.
           (20040311U) SD: corrected 4-dig. year and lower cases.
           (20100303A) SD: REACTION code in Subent 003 was changed
               according to EXFOR rules.
