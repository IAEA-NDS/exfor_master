TITLE      Correlation between energies and angles of alpha-
           particles emitted in thermal neutron fission of 235U.
FACILITY   (REAC) Cirus-reactor
SAMPLE     1 mg/cm2 235U (93.9% enriched), electroplated on an
           aluminum backing of 8 mg/cm2.
METHOD     The fissile foil was mounted at an angle of 45 degrees
           with respect to the joining line between the LRA-
           detector (D1) and one of the fragment detectors (D4).
           the Al-backing faced the LRA-detector, in order to
           absorb the natural alphas.
           The other two fragment detectors (D2,D3) were placed at
           angles of 90 and 45 degrees with respect to the joining
           line D1-D4.
           (COINC).Between D1 on the one hand and D2,D3,D4 resp.
           (PHD). LRA-energy above 11 MeV.
           The ungated LRA-pulses (D1) and each of the coincident
           LRA-pulses were recorded in one quarter of a 1024-
           channel analyzer each.
DETECTOR   (SOLST). One of 8 mm radius for Long Range Alpha('LRA')
           detection.
           Three with sensitive area=9x9 mm2,for fission fragment
           detection.
ANALYSIS   The average angles between LRA and fragments were
           determined from the detector positions by Monte Carlo
           calculations.
STATUS     The data are taken from Nucl.Phys. A196,209.
HISTORY    (19790730C) TL.
           (20040311U) SD: corrected 4-dig. year and lower cases.
CORRECTION The recorded LRA-spectra were corrected for chance
           coincidences and energy loss in the target backing.

COMMENT    The kinetic energies given are the maxima of gaussian
           fits to the measured spectra.
           The distance between the target and the detectors was
           2.3 cm
ERR-ANALYS The errors given are the widths at half maximum.
