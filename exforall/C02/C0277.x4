TITLE      High-Sensitivity Mass Spectrometric Measurement of
            Stable Helium and Argon Isotopes Produced by High-
            Energy Protons in Iron
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Cosmotron
           (SYNCY,1USACHI)
SAMPLE     At 0.16-GeV, two steel pieces, 1-mm thick used;
           At 0.43-GeV, three pieces of 0.3-mm thick nonmagnetic
            steel used;
           At 3.0-GeV, vacuum-fused pure iron used.
METHOD     (ASEP,BCINT) The helium was determined in the mass
           spectrometer and compared with the current as indicated
           by the Faraday cup.
           All the measurements were determined at least two times
           In the case of the 0.43-Bev Chicago irradiations, two
           separate bombardments were performed.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The mass spectrometer used in the studies
           had a symmetrical 60.degr. magnetic analyzer with
           6-in. radius of curvature.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The results accurate to  +-10%.

SAMPLE     0.16-GeV targets were two steel pieces, 1-mm thick.
           0.43-GeV target was made of three 0.3-mm thick
            nonmagnetic steel pieces;
           3.0-GeV target was made of vacuum-fused pure iron.
