SAMPLE     The target was pressed in the form of a rectangular
           tablet (15x4x1 mm3) of scandium oxide. In the
           scandium fraction, separated after the irradiation,
           no isotopes with mass numbers > 44 have been found.
           Those isotopes would be inevitably produced in the
           presence of heavy target contaminants.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,INTB) Targets were irradiated in the
           internal proton beam of the Joint Nuclear Research
           Institute synchrocyclotron during 15-20 min. The
           thickness of the target along the beam was ~ 1 mm.
           The variation of the incident proton energy was
           achieved by suitable choice of target radius. The
           determination of the proton beam intensity was made
           by the yield of the reaction A127(p,3pn) Na24. The
           major mass of the irradiated target was dissolved in
           the concentrated hydrochloric acid saturated with
           gaseous HC1, 15 mg of the titanium carrier being
           present.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The above values are average from three or
           four determinations, with standard errors. The total
           accuracy of the cross section determination is ~ 10%
           according to our evaluation. In our estimation as
           well as calculation of the cross sections and
           standard errors possible systematic errors due to the
           inaccuracy in the decay schemes and in the cross
           section of the monitor reaction were not taken into
           consideration. It is worth noting that the evaluation
           of the accuracy of the determination of the isomeric
           cross-section ratio is about 5%.

ANALYSIS   The contribution of the reaction (n,2n) to the cross-
           section of the reaction (p,pn) was neglected, the
           earlier estimates being taken into consideration.
