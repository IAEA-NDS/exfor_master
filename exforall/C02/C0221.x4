TITLE      C-12(P,PN)C-11 CROSS SECTION FROM 3 TO 6 BEV
FACILITY   (SYNCY)
SAMPLE     TARGETS CONSISTING OF THREE PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS
           MOUNTIED BEHIND A NUCLEAR EMULSION.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (SCIN,TRD) PROTON FLUX WAS MEASURED BY COUNTING
           TRACKS IN EMULSIONS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE FOLLOWING: TRANSITION-
           EFFECT, FLUCTUATIONS IN PROTON-BOMBARDMENT INTENSITY,
           NONUNIFORMITY OF PROTON SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, PLASTIC
           SCINTILLATOR FRACTION.
ERR-ANALYS ESTIMATED TATOL UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE BOTH STATISTICAL
           AND SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY OF +-5%.
