           (J,BAP,1,(2),225,1956) Preliminary results at 4.1 BeV.
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) Bevatron.
SAMPLE     Targets consisting of three plastic scintillators
           mounted behind a nuclear emulsion.
METHOD     (ACTIV) A plastic scintillator was sandwiched between
           two photographic emulsions and exposed to the
           internal proton beam. The number of C11 nuclei was
           measured by counting beta activity in the
           scintillator, and the number of incident protons was
           determined by counting tracks in the emulsion.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,TRD) Proton flux was measured by counting
           tracks in emulsions.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The uncertainty due to systematic errors is
           estimated.
HISTORY    (19870417C)
           (20181204A) BP: Corrected institute, facility,
           reaction and uncertainties, added doi, updated to new
           date formats, lower case. Corrections according last
           EXFOR rules and Dict. Added preliminary 4.1 BeV data.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Estimated total uncertainty in weighted mean
           value. The systematic uncertainty has been
           vectorially added to the statistical uncertainty in
           the mean value to give the total uncertainty.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the following: transition-
           effect, fluctuations in proton-bombardment intensity,
           nonuniformity of proton spatial distribution, plastic
           scintillator fraction.
FLAG       (1.) Mean of three measurements.
           (2.) Second exposure with center scintillator and
            emulsion center portion counted.
