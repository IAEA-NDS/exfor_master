TITLE      C12(p,pn)C11 cross section at 28 GeV
FACILITY   (SYNCY)
SAMPLE     Plastic scintillators
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (SCIN,TRD) Proton fluxes were determined using
           nuclear emusions.
CORRECTION Corrections of 2% included an estimation of additional
           effect due to neutrons which would not have been
           observed in emulsions.
ERR-ANALYS Standard deviations were about 4%, systematic error
           was 4.1%.
STATUS     Data taken from article, tables III,IV,V.
HISTORY    (870423C)
           (960422A) REACTION corrected, converted to lower case.
