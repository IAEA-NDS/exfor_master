FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAMIN) Used at 17.9, 21.7, and 24.0 MeV.
           (VDGT,1USALAS) Used at 17.9 and 24.0 MeV.
SAMPLE     (2-HE-3,ENR=0.99) 99.9% pure 3He gas at about 400
           torr, contained in cylindrical cell with Kapton foil
           window located at center of an evacuated scattering
           chamber.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Telescope consisting of 3 silicon surface-
           barrier detectors.
METHOD     (BCINT,EDE) Also, E* method which depends on the
           symmetry about 90 degrees in cm system of the
           reactions for identical particles in the incident
           channel.
MONITOR    (2-HE-3(D,P)2-HE-4,,DA) Used to calibrate secondary
           particle spectrum energies.)
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . contributions from low-energy tail of elastic peak,
           . effect of collimator assembly on detector at forward
             angles,

           Production angular distribution data are extrapolated
           to 0 degrees at forward angles and to at value of
           zero from the largest measured angle. Data at 17.9
           and 24.0 MeV result from combining data measured at
           both facilities.
