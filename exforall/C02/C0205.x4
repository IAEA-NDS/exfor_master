TITLE      3He+3He reaction cross sections at 17.9, 21.7, and
            24.0 MeV
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAMIN) Used at 17.9, 21.7, and 24.0 MeV.
           (VDGT,1USALAS) Used at 17.9 and 24.0 MeV.
SAMPLE     99.9% pure 3He gas at about 400 Torr, contained in
            cylindrical cell with Kapton foil window located at
            center of an evacuated scattering chamber.
METHOD     (BCINT,EDE)
           Also, E* method which depends on the symmetry about 90
            degrees in cm system of the reactions for identical
            particles in the incident channel.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Telescope consisting of 3 silicon surface-
            barrier detectors.
MONITOR    (2-HE-3(D,P)2-HE-4,,DA) Used to calibrate secondary
            particle spectrum energies.
CORRECTION Corrected for:
           . contributions from low-energy tail of elastic peak,
           . effect of collimator assembly on detector at forward
             angles,
           . 3He gas background.
STATUS     Data taken from reference.

ANALYSIS   Taken as equal to alpha production cross section.
           Production angular distribution data are extrapolated
            to 0 degrees at forward angles and to at value of
            zero from the largest measured angle.
           Data at 17.9 and 24.0 MeV result from combining data
            measured at both facilities.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error includes extrapolation uncertainties
            added in quadrature to uncertainties due to counting
            statistics, corrections and background subtractions.
