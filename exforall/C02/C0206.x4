AUTHOR     (VASTUPAL PARIKH)
TITLE      Absolute cross-sections of C12(p,pn)C11
            from 288 to 383 MeV
FACILITY   (SYNCY)
INC-SOURCE The incident beam energy spread was about +- 3 MeV.
SAMPLE     Graphite thickness about 0.17-0.54 g/cm2.
           C13 impurity 1.1 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
CORRECTION Corrections of beam intensity variation,finite
           source size and absorption of proton in target
           were made. Correction due to C13 impurity was not made.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Compounded error due to uncertainty in
            - efficiency calibration       (2.7%)
            - monitoring proton flux       (1.3%)
            - counting statistics for 11C.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error in counting 11C.
