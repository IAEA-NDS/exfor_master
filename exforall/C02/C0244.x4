TITLE       (p,pn) reactions at proton energies from 0.3 to
             3.0 BeV
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Most of the irradiations were carried
           out in the circulating beam of the Brookhaven Cosmotron
           with protons of energies between 0.4 and 3.0 Bev.
           (ISOCY,1USACOL) A few bombardments were performed with
           0.28- and 0.38-Bev protons at the Nevis
                       synchrocyclotron at Columbia University.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
SAMPLE     All of the target materials were of sufficiently high
           purity that only negligible quantities of the observed
            (p,pn) products could have been formed by reactions
           with other elements present.
           The enriched isotopes were electroplated onto
           0.0005-inch gold foil by standard procedures.
           The target foils and the 21-mg/cm2 aluminum monitor
           foil where lined up in a target holder and always
           irradiated with the aluminum foil "upstream" with
           respect to the beam direction, i.e., the aluminum was
           struck first by the protons.
           The Na22 standard sample used was prepared from a
           solution whose positron emission rate had been
            calibrated by the National Bureau of Standards.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The root-mean-squares errors resulting
           from uncertainties in counting efficiencies, chemical
           yields, decay curve resolutions,and branching ratios
           were estimated to be +-10% except in the cases of N-13
           and Ta-180, where they were assumed to be +-20% and
           +25%, respectively.
           These errors didn't include the uncertainty of 0.6 mb
           in the 10.7-mb cross section for
                            Al-27(p,n+3p) Na-24 monitor reaction.
