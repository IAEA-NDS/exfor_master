SAMPLE     A natural mixture of Ca isotopes was used for
           irradiation. The target was pressed in the shape of a
           rectangular wafer (15x4x1.5 mm) from calcium carbonate.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A scintillation gamma-spectrometer having a
           NaI(TI) 40 x 40 mm crystal and a 128-channel AMA-3c
           analyser.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The target was irradiated in the
           internal beam of the synchrocyclotron of the Joint
           Institute for Nuclear Research for 15 to 20 min. The
           proton beam was parallel to the 1.5 mm side of the
           target. The incident proton energy was varied by
           positioning the target at different radii in the
           accelerator chamber. The irradiated target was
           dissolved in a small amount of diluted HC1 with ~ l0
           mg of Sc carrier. After CO2 has been removed by
           boiling the solution, scandium hydroxide was
           precipitated by addition of NH4OH. Then the calcium
           and scandium fraction were purified radiochemically.
           The proton beam intensity was determined by the yield
           of the A127(p,3pn)Na24 reaction. The target was
           wrapped in three layers of 20 micron aluminum foil.
           To measure the Na24 activity, middle layers on both
           sides of the target were used. The layers had been
           cut strictly to the size of the target. The
           difference in the activities of these foils did not
           exceed 10% and amounted on the average to some 5%.
           The ratio of absolute activities of the reaction
           products and Na24 was derived by comparing the
           intensities of characteristic gamma-lines, taking
           into account the decay schemes and the efficiency of
           counting.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The cross sections indicated are averages
           of two or three measurements with quadratic mean
           errors. The general accuracy for the cross sections
           is estimated to be about 15%. Besides, the cross
           sections contain errors due to uncertainties in  the
           decay schemes and in the cross section for the
           monitoring reaction.
