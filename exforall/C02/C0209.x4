CORRECTION THE CORRECTIONS MADE FOR CALCULATING THE CROSS SECTION
            CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING -
            - 11.0+-1.0 % DECAY OF NA-22 TAKE PLACE VIA K CAPTURE
              AND DO NOT PRODUCE POSITONS;
            - NA-22 EMITS 1.28 MEV GAMMA RAYS THAT PRODUCE A
              COMPTON DISTRIBUTION.THIS EFFECT INCREASED THE NA-22
              COUNTING RATE BY 14.6+-1.0 %;
            - A CORRECTION OF 2.3% WAS APPLIED DUE TO DIFFERENCE
              IN ABSORPTION OF 0.51 MEV GAMMA-RAYS IN PLYTHENE
              PLATE ASSEMBLY AND NA-22 CONTAINER.
ANALYSIS   AVERAGE OF DATA ON 6 SAMPLES.
