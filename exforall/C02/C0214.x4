TITLE      Excitation function of the C-12(p,pn)C-11 reaction in
           the BeV region
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL)
SAMPLE     Targets were made up of several layers of polythene
           of thickness varying from 5 to 10 mg/cm2 and one or
           two layers of aluminum foil 1 mil or 3 mils thick.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
CORRECTION Small corrections for self-absorption effects were
           applied to the data obtained.
