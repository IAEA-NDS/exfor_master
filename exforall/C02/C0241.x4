TITLE      Anomalous behavior of the proton-induced fission
            cross sections of 235U and 238U at extreme sub-barrier
            energies
FACILITY   (VDG)
METHOD     (BCINT)
DETECTOR   (TRD)
ANALYSIS   Sources of background taken into account:
            1) fission caused in the target by neutrons,
            2) fissionlike tracks produced in SSTR A because of
               the high rate of incidence of scattered protons,
            3) fission caused in fissionable impurities located
               in the vicinity of SSTR by neutrons or through
               spontaneous fission,
            4) spontaneous fission in the target and the natural
               background of fission tracks in the detector.
