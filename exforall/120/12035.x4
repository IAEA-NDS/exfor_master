REACTION   (54-XE-125(N,ABS),,SIG,,SPA)
STATUS     (SPSDD) AUTHORS WERE UNAWARE THAT I-125 CROSS SECTION
            IS ABOUT 1100 B. NEUTRON CAPTURE IN I-125 WOULD
            ACCOUNT FOR INCREASE OBSERVED IN XE-126 ABUNDANCE.
            THEREFORE, XE-125 CROSS SECTION IS MUCH LESS THAN
            5600 B AND MAY EVEN BE ZERO.
