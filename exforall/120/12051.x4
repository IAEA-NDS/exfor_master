FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) The NRX Chalk River heavy water reactor.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The cross section of Ce142 has been
           determined by the activation method. Samples of
           spectroscopically pure cerium oxide were sealed into
           small quartz ampoules and irradiated in a position in
           the NRX Chalk River heavy water reactor where the
           neutron spectrum was predominantly thermal. With each
           sample was enclosed a piece of fine weighed cobalt
           wire which was used as a flux monitor. After
           irradiation the cerium oxide was chemically
           separated. Disintegration rates were determined by a
           4pi counter.
