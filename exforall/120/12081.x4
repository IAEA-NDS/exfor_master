INC-SPECT   Reactor spectrum.
SAMPLE     Enriched samples. Sample #1: Er162,164<0.1%,
           Er166=72.9%, Er167=17.7%, Er168=8.5%, Er170=0.8%.
           Sample #2: Er162,164<0.1%, Er166=14.0%, Er167=58.8%,
           Er168=25.3%, Er170=1.93%.
METHOD     (REAC) Reactivity coefficient measurement. Enriched
           samples were compared with natural erbium to obtain
           capture areas.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) 20% accuracy: includes 10% natural erbium
           cross section uncertainty and assumes that the
           resonances are distributed among isotopes in the
           ratio of their thermal cross sections.
           (ERR-1) Natural erbium cross section uncertainty.
