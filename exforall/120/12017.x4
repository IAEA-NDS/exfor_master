TITLE      The cross-section of the reaction Cs-134(n,gamma)Cs-135
           and the half-life of Cs-134.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAINL) Materials Test Reactor (MTR), Idaho, USA
           (REAC,1CANCRC)  heavy water moderated, light water
           cooled, nuclear research reactor (NRX) at the Can.

SAMPLE     Two long irradiations were carried out:
           1. approximately 10 mg of spectroscopically pure Cs2CO3
           in the M.T.R., for 140 days.
           2. approximately 10 mg of CsNO3 in the NRX reactor,
           for 356 days. Two short irradiations were made, each
           of 16 hr. using a position in NRX similar to that used
           for the long irradiation. For these irradiations the
           cesium compounds which were of spectroscopic purity,
           were dried at 110.C and weighed into silica tubes which
           were then sealed. CsC1, 36.8 mg, was used in the first
           irradiation and Cs2CO3, 32.1 mg, in the second.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (D4PI) The Beta-counter was of conventional 4Pi design,
            using methane as counting gas.
           (IOCH) The monitors were irradiated in the same
           capsule as the cesium samples and then, after a
           decay period of 5 days the 60Co activity was measured
           in an ionization chamber.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Overall uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) error in the absolute disintegration rate
           (ERR-2) error in the calibration of the flux
                                             monitoring system
           (MONIT-ERR) uncertainty in monitor reaction
           (DATA-ERR) The errors quoted are the non-systematic
           ones of which the fluctuation between sources, standard
           deviation +-2%, is the most important.

ASSUMED    (ASSUM,55-CS-133(N,G)55-CS-134,,SIG,,MXW)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include those arising from the
           experimental errors in the isotopic composition, from
           the uncertainty in the 134Cs half-life and from the
           uncertainty in the 135Cs(n,gamma)136Cs cross-section,
           but not that from the uncertainty in the
           133Cs(n,gamma)134Cs cross-section which introduces a
           further error of +-7 barns (see ASSUM).
