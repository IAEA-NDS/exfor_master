TITLE      Mass spectrometric studies of pile poisons and their
           yields in the fission of uranium-233, uranium-235, and
           plutonium-239

INSTITUTE  (1CANMCM)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) NRX, Chalk River reactor.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,IOCH) Well-type ionization chamber.
METHOD     (ASEP,COINC) Sample of metal and oxide 238U and 15%
           233U were irradiated at various fluxes and
           irradiation times in Chalk River reactor. Associated
           with samples were one or more 0.127 mm cobalt wires
           weighing 1.148 mg. The cobalt standard was calibrated
           by coincidence and 4pi counting techniques. The
           thermal fluxes were calculated from the observed
           activity after corrections assuming a value of 36.5
           barns for 2,200 m/sec cross section of 59Co. The mass
           spectrometry was carried out using a Nier-type
           spectrometer of 25 cm radius with an all metal tube.

DECAY-MON  (27-CO-60-G,5.28YR)
CORRECTION Corrections for decay of cobalt standard were less
           than 10%, the self-shielding of cobalt wire was
           estimated at 2.3%, contribution of activation by
           epithermal neutrons was a compensating factor from
           about 1% to to about 2.8%.
