TITLE      On the production of Mo-99 and Tc-99-m by cyclotron.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERDKZ) the Heidelberg compact cyclotron
           (ISOCY,2GERKFK) the KFK compact cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT) 1 muA beam current.
SAMPLE     Seven foils of natural molybdenum, each 150 mum thick,
           which were placed in a water-cooled target, were used.
           A 10 mum thick copper foils was inserted between the
           two last molybdenum foils, to check the total charge
           indicated by the electronic current integrator.
           The Mo-100 abundance was corrected from 9.63% to
            97.42%. It means that the experimental data were
           multiplied by the factor (100-97.42)/(100-9.63)

DETECTOR   (GELI)
ADD-RES     The percents of Tc-93, Tc-94, Tc-95 and Tc-96
           impurities in the Tc-99-m directly produced as a
           function of the incident proton energy on a thick
           target of 97.42% isotopically enriched Mo-100 are seen
           in fig.5
COMMENT    *By authors*.The thick target yield was obtained
           through an integration of the respective excitation
           function. The bars on one of the points of each curve
           are the average standard deviation over the seven
           points of each curve. The standard deviation for each
           point was deduced from the yields obtained in the three
           chosen experiments.
