            new result from the same group, but from measurements
            at Laboratori Nazionali del Sud, Catania, Italy.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP)
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene targets CD(2) of about
            192 ug/cm2 was bombarded with a 27-MeV B-10 beam.
DETECTOR   (TELES,PS,PROPC) The detection setup consisted of a
           1000 um position sensitive detector(PSD)-PSD1 and a
           telescope system, having a proportional counter(PC)
           as delta-E and an E-detector made of a standard 500 um
            PSD(PSD2). The PC was filled with 13.3 mbar buthane
           gas and a foil of 1.5 um Mylar was used as a window.
           Position and energy calibration of the involved
           detectors were performed by using the data
           from C-12(Li-6,alpha)N-14, C-12(Li6,Li6)C-12 and
           Au-197(Li6,Li6)Au-197  reactions induced at a beam
           energy of 10 MeV and 16 MeV.
           An alpha-source of 5.48 MeV was also used.
METHOD     (EDE)
ANALYSIS   (TROJA) Reaction H-2(B-10,alpha+Be-7)n was used
COMMENT    - By author. The B-10(p,alpha)Be-7 reaction was studied
             by means of the Trojan-horse-method applied to the
             d(B-10,alpha+Be-7)n three-body reaction performed at
             an incident energy of 27-MeV.
