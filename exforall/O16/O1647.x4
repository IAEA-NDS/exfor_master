SAMPLE     The targets consisted of 393 mug/cm**2 thick layers
           of 164DyF3, were evaporated on 42-mug/cm**2 thick
           carbon foils.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2GERGSI) The UNILAC accelerator.
           (FRS,2GERGSI) The velocity filter SHIP(Separator for
            Heavy-Ion reaction Products) at GSI.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SISD,HPGE) The evaporated residues(ERs) were
           separated from the beam by the velocity filter SHIP and
           implanted into a position-sensitive 16 strip Si
           detector(focal-plane stop detector) which had an active
           area of 80*35 mm**2. Gamma rays were detected by a
           HP-Ge clover detector consisting of four crystals, each
            50 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length, which were
           shaped and assembled to form a block of
            102*102*70 mm**3. This detector was placed at a
           distance of 30 mm behind the stop detector.
METHOD     (COINC) Isomeric states in Th-214 and Th-213 were
           identified by means of gamma-rays measured in delayed
           coincidence with the implant evaporation residues.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross-sections for the production of
           the isotopes Th-214 and Th-213 cannot be obtained
           individually for these isotopes, because their ground-
           state properties(alpha energies and half-lives) are
           almost identical. These values include the production
           of the ground states directly in the reaction and
           feeding by the decay of the isomers.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).The error bars represent statistical
           fluctuations only. Systematic errors could modify the
           values up to a factor of two, however, at a constant
           ratio.
