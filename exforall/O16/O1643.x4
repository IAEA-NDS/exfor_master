SAMPLE     A 0.1 mg/cm**2 self-supporting C-13 was used.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR PAR) The Orsay tandem.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were momentum analyzed
           by the magnetic spectrometer Splitpole and the tritons
           were detected at the focal plane by a position-
           sensitive gas chamber and a delta-E proportional gas
           counter could be obtained.
METHOD     (SITA)
ADD-RES    (COMP).DWBA analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors on fig.
           (ANG-ERR-D).Digitizing error of angle.
STATUS     (PRELM)
COMMENT    *By authors*.Preliminary results of the angular
           distribution of the state of interest(6.356 MeV) are
           displayed in fig.2. A further analysis to better
           evaluate the 6.356 MeV yield at each angle and the
           corresponding errors coming from the fitting procedure
           is under development. A finite-range DWBA calculation
           of the C-13(Li-7,t)O-17 reaction is also in progress
           in order to calculate the angular distribution of the
           differential cross sections and to extract the
           spectroscopic factor.
