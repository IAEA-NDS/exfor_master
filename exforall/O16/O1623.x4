FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERDKZ) the Heidelberg compact cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT) beam currents up to 8 muA.
SAMPLE     The target 122-TeO(2), isotopical composition-
           Te-122 94.71%, Te-120 0.05%, Te-123 0.48%,
           Te-124 0.62%, Te-125 0.65%, Te-126 1.10%,
           Te-128 1.27% and Te-130 1.12%, were used.
           Targets were prepared by melting the 122-TeO(2) on
           platinum backing plates and the covering them by 6 mum
           havar foils, thickness TeO(2) ranged from 133- to
            141-mg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
COMMENT    *By authors*.Four 1 hour bombardments were made to
           determine the yields of I-121 and of contaminating
           radionuclides.
ADD-RES     Animal experiments show that the biological half-life
           of the daughter Te-121 is 10.3 days and calculation
           shows that the total radiation dose from I-121 and its
           daughter Te-121 is low even compared to I-123.
