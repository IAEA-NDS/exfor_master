SAMPLE     The Maya active target was fulled with deuterium gas,
           at a pressure of 1050 mbar, forming a pure deuterium
           target of 1.6-mg/cm**2(equivalent to a target of
            6.3 mg/cm**2 of CD(2).)
METHOD     (COINC) All the cross sections presented in this paper
            are those from the analysis of the coincidence
            spectra.

INC-SOURCE The secondary Ni-56 beam was produced by fragmentation
           of a 75 MeV/nucleon Ni-58 beam from the GANIL cyclotron
           which bombarded a carbon target of thickness
            70.5 mg/cm**2 located between the two superconducting
           solenoids of the SISSI device and purified by passing
           through a 135-mg/cm**2 Al degrader placed between the
           two dipoles of the alpha fragment spectrometer before
           being sent to the SPEG area.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)  magnetic spectrometer (SPEG) (see Nucl.Instr.
             Meth. A276 (1989) 509-520)).
           High energy light particles such as deuterons with
           energy more or equal 2 MeV were not stopped in the Maya
           gas volume. For such escaping particles, was added
           ancillary 500-mum Si detector.
           For normalization purposes the beam was counted in a
           polycrystalline diamond detector of 1-cm**2 surface and
            100-mum thickness, after traversing the Maya target.

           (PS) The angles of the incident beam particles were
           measured event-by-event using two position sensitive
           drift chambers. The combined efficiency of the two
           chambers was approximately 88% for the Be-11 beam and
            96% for the N-15 beam.
           A position-sensitive microchannel detector was used as
           a diagnostic device.
           (PSSCN) The recoiling deuterons were detected in an
           array of ten position-sensitive sheet-resistive silicon
           detectors(CHARISSA). Each detector was 5*5-cm**2 in
           area and 500-mum thick.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The contribution of the deuteron breakup
           was estimated from direct kinematic measurement for
           Ni-58 at 50 A*MeV at larger angles c.m more than 8-
           degree. These data are extrapolated to lower angles and
           transformed to the reverse kinematics frame, corrected
           for the geometrical acceptance of the Maya detector and
           normalized to the experimental data(see fig.1).
