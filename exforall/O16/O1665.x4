SAMPLE     Thin Th-232 targets were prepared by sputter deposition
           from a Th-232 metal source in an Ar plasma as thin
           films. Zinc or Al foils of 200 mum thickness(99.99%)
           were used at appropriate positions in the stacks as
           proton-energy degrader. A copper foil of 12.5 mum
           thickness(99.99%) was placed as a monitor foil.

REACTION   (90-TH-232(P,3N)91-PA-230,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The uncertainty of incident proton energies
           in individual foils was calculated from the
           uncertainties of thickness of monitor, target and
           degrader foils and ranges from 5% to 10%.
           (DATA-ERR) total uncertainty includes:
            * statistical uncertainty of gamma-ray counting,
            * uncertainty in the monitor foil thickness
            * the uncertainty in efficiency calibration of the
           gamma-ray detector ranges from 5% to 21%.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The thick target yield of Pa-230 was
           calculated as 8.41 MBq/muAhr at 33.5 MeV, resulting in
            0.24 MBq/muAhr of U-230 at 28 day after end of beam.
