SAMPLE     A sputtered TiN target with 55 keV thickness, was used.
DETECTOR   (BGO).The gamma-rays from the reaction to be studied
           were detected in a Eurisys Clover-BGO detection system.
           The front end of the Clover crystals was positioned
           at 9.5 cm distance from the target, at an angle of 55
           degree with respect to the beam axis.
           The gamma-ray detection efficiency was obtained using
           Cs-137 and CO-60 radioactive sources calibrated to 1.5
           and 0.75%, respectively.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2ITYLGS) The 400 kV LUNA accelerator.
METHOD     (SITA)
COMMENT    *By authors*.The effective energy E was determined from
           the centroids of the gamma lines for capture to the
           ground state and to the 6792 keV state and leads to
            2.0-2.4% uncertainty.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross section ratio with Sigma(g.s)(E)
           and Sigma(6792-keV)(E) the cross sections for capture
           to the ground state and to the 6792 keV state in O-15,
           respectively, was calculated for each bombarding energy
           The addback and singles mode data for Rg.s/6792 were
           found to be in agreement. Because of their lower
           statistical uncertainty, the addback data were adopted
           for the further analysis.
           *By authors*.The data given in table 2 normalized with
           the weighted average(uncertainty 7.5%) of the S-factor
           results for the 6792 keV transition given in following
           references. See Rel-Ref.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The error in effective energy.
           (ERR-SYS).The systematics uncertainty depends on
            -the summing -in correction for the ground state
           gamma-ray,
            -the slope of the detection efficiency curve,
            -the anticoincidence efficiency,
            -the summing-out correction contribute to the
           systematic uncertainty.
           The effects of target composition and profile, stopping
           power, beam intensity and absolute gamma-ray detection
           efficiency cancel out in the relative experiment.
           (ERR-S).The errors due to statistics-activity
           measurements.

            S-factor for capture to the ground state.

STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
           (DEP,O1693002)
COMMENT    *By authors*.The ground state capture contributes
           less than 4% uncertainty to the total S-tot(0), instead
           of the previous 15%, based on a data set that is nearly
           free from summing problems. On the basis of the present
           results S-total(0)=1.57+-0.13 keV*barn is recommended
           with the uncertainty including also systematic effects.
           For this sum, S-6792(0)=0.09+-0.07 keV*barn has been
           adopted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in text.
           (EN-ERR).This error was reported in table 2.
