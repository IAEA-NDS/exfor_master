SAMPLE     A 4 cm diameter and  a 15 cm length long cylindrical
           gas cell filled with He-4 at the pressure of 150 mbar.
           The gas target cell was connected to the end of the
           beam pipe through a approx. 5 mum(nominal thickness)
           Ni entrance window.
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (D4PI).The neutron were detected by the Polycube 4-pi
           thermalization counter, consisting of 12 cylindrical
           proportional counters filled with He-3 at the pressure
           of 4 bar embedded into a 40*40*40 cm**3 polyethylene
           moderator.
           (MCPLT) Two micro-channel-plate (MCP) detectors
            (MCP1 and MCP2) were located upstream along the beam
           pipe, at 150 and 50 cm from the Ni entrance window,
           respectively
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYLNS)
INC-SOURCE  The Li-8 beam was delivered by the EXCYT ISOL facility
           at LNS in Catania. It was produced by injecting a C-13+
           primary beam of 45 MeV 1/amu on a graphite target.
METHOD     (EXTB) secondary Li-8 beam
           (PLSED) The neutrons were moderated and adsorbed in the
           detector.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The experiment consisted of the three
           types of measurements-
            - a measurement without beam
            - a set of projectile correlated measurements without
           He-4
            - a set of projectile correlated measurements with
           He-4

COMMENT    *By authors*.The new determination cross section value
           turns out to be about 10% smaller than that given in
           previous letter(See reference-J,PL/B,664,157,2008),
           while the effect of the sources of systematic
           uncertainties has proved to be negligible.
           *By authors*.In the present neutron-inclusive
           measurement, the background contribution has been
           carefully identified and evaluated. Since different
           sources of systematical uncertainties and of background
           are involved, the present data strongly confirm and
           support the complementary B-11 inclusive data.
