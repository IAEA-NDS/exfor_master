REACTION   (6-C-12(6-C-13,5-B-13)7-N-12,PAR,DA)
SAMPLE     A Be-9 target of 400 mug/cm**2 thickness contained
           contaminations of C-12 and O-16 with a thickness of
            12 mug/cm**2 and 9 mug/cm**2,respectively,was used.
           A C-12 target, thickness approx. 150 mug/cm**2 and
           self-supporting a V(2)O(5) target, thickness 200 mug/
           cm**2 used also.
INC-SOURCE  The C-13 beam was produced in a sputter ion-source,
           preaccelerated in an 8 MV tandem and accelerated up to
           the final energy by the cyclotron.
COMMENT    *By authors*.This reaction was used for the precise
           calibration of the energy scale.
METHOD     (BCINT) The reaction was measured with a beam current
           of approx. 50 nA. The current was integrated for
           normalization purposes.

REACTION   (6-C-12(6-C-14,3-LI-9)9-F-17,PAR,DA)
SAMPLE     The C-13 target of highly enriched material, 98% C-13
            2% C-12 had a thickness of 300 mug/cm**2.
           The C-12 target for the calibration reaction had the
           same thickness.
INC-SOURCE  The C-14 beam was produced in a dedicated sputter ion
           source with a Cs-beam impinging on a steel pellet. The
           carbon content of the pellet consisted of 85% C-14,
            1% C-13 and 14% C-12.
           preaccelerated in an 8 MV tandem and accelerated up to
