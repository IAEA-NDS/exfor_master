            description.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERDKZ)
METHOD     (BCINT) a 10-13 muA beam current
           (RCHEM)
SAMPLE     The target consists of quartz liner inside a
           cylindrical stainless steel vessel. The quartz liner is
           connected to a rotor which was coupled magnetically to
           an external multipole magnet. The proton beam enters
           through the double foil system(6 mum Havar) cooled by
           a flow of helium gas(2.0 l/min), precooled to -20
           degree. Before irradiation, the target was evacuated
           and filled to 3.0 bar with krypton gas of natural
           abundance(99.99%). A motor driven injection system
           operated remotely through a four way solenoid valve
           allows the introduction and removal of the washing
           solution under sterile conditions. 20 ml of sterile
           water for injection was added to the target and the
           quartz liner slowly rotated during irradiation. Ten
           revolutions per minute has been found optimal.
           The solvent was removed from the target after the
           irradiation and injected onto the cation-exchange resin
           of the generator. Washing of the target was repeated
           twice more in 20 min intervals with 20 ml portions of
           sterile water. An overall radiochemical extraction of
           greater than 80% was achieved.
COMMENT    *By authors*.Thick target yield calculation indicates
           that the variation between theoretical and experimental
           yields differ by less than a factor of two. Large
           errors are expected for products that have a magic or
           double magic nucleus.
