TITLE      A feasibility study of the cyclotron production of
           Na-21.

           (C,95VANCOU,,60,1995) It is O1598 and production of
            F-18 through Ne-20(d,a) reaction.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERDKZ) the Heidelberg compact cyclotron
METHOD     (BCINT)
SAMPLE     The gas target consisted of water-cooled cylindrical
           stainless-steel chamber(diameter=4 cm*15 cm long
           internal dimensions) attached via a beam collimator to
           the cyclotron beam pipe. An Al foil(350 mum) was used
           to degrade the incident deuteron beam to less than
            3.0 MeV. Neon gas, 99.99% purity, was passed through
           the flow meter, drying columns of silica gel and
           magnesium perchlorate, prior to reaching the target
           cavity.
           For measurement of the charge of the Na-21 species
           produced during the nuclear reaction special water-
           cooled steel target, diameter=8.2 cm*15 cm long,
           internal dimensions, was constructed. This system was
           also used to determine the charge of the F-18 species
           produced via the Ne-20(d,a)F-18(See O1598) reaction.
           A second electrode system was used for measurement of
           the charge of Na-21 species swept out of the production
           target by Ne gas.
CORRECTION  All results were corrected to the end of bombardment.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The experimental setup consisted of the
           reaction chamber-target, a capillary tube, traps and
           system for the measurement of the activity.
           It is generally difficult to express the yields of
           Na-21, Ne-23 and F-18 -short-lived radionuclides in
           units of muCi/muAhr. The yield in this work will be
           expressed as the rate of produced activity in muCi
           continuously monitored by sweeping gas in a 2.0 ml
           reservoir in calibrated ionization chamber,
           approximately 10 m from the target. From these results,
           knowing the volume of the target chamber and transport
           system and the flow of the target gas it is possible
           to calculate the activity produced direct in the
           target. The dependence of the production rate of Na-21
           and Ne-23 on the incident energy deuteron beam at 0.5
           up to 6.0 MeV was examined.
DETECTOR   (GELI) a 21 cm**3 Ge(Li) detector.
