FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) The fragment separator was used in
            energy-loss mode to transmit the O-23 secondary beam
            to the breakup carbon target at the intermediate focal
            plane and the O-22 fragments to the final focal plane.
METHOD     (EXTB) a Ar-40 primary beam with an energy of
            1.0 GeV/nucleon, delivered by the heavy-ion
           synchrotron SIS in a 4-g/cm**2 Be target.
           (TOF)
           (COINC) The O-22 fragments were detected in coincidence
           with de-exciting gamma rays.
DETECTOR   (COIN,PS,IOCH,SCIN,NAICR)
            PS-position sensitive time projection chambers for
            particle tracking and longitudinal momentum
            measurements,
            IOCH-ionization chambers for determining the fragment
            charge,
            SCIN-scintillators for determining the time of flight
            between the different parts of the FRS.
            NAICR-32 NaI crystals for detection of gamma rays
            emitted by the fragments around the reaction target.
SAMPLE     Carbon target was used.
ADD-RES    (COMP) An Eikonal model.
            Inclusive longitudinal momentum distribution for O-22
            fragments after one-neutron removal from O-23 and
            exclusive one for O-22 in its ground state have been
            observed.
CORRECTION A Doppler shift correction was made.
COMMENT    *By Authors*.The inclusive one-neutron removal cross
           section was measured by directly counting O-23 and
           O-22 in front of and behind the carbon breakup target.
           This ratio was corrected for the experimental
           transmission evaluated with the code MOCADI(see N.Iwasa
           et.all, Nucl.Instrum.Methods B,126,284,1997) after
           adjusting the simulated fragment longitudinal momentum
           width to the measured one.
           The relative weight of the exclusive one-neutron
           removal cross-section involving O-22 in any excited
           states to the inclusive measurement amounts to 41+-10%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The associated error bars includes
           statistical errors, assumptions for the level scheme of
           O-22 and uncertainties in the gamma-efficiency
           simulation.
