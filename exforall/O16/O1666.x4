TITLE      Evaluation of irradiation parameters of enriched Xe-124
           target for I-123 production in cyclotrons.

SAMPLE     An isotopically enriched Xe-124 target was used.
           The experimental target system was made of copper
           coated by a thin layer of nickel. two molybdenum foils,
           cooled by a compressed flux of helium gas, were set
           between the target and beam line.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLIPE) The Cyclone-30 cyclotron installed at
            IPEN.
METHOD     (BCINT) All irradiations were carried out at a beam
           current ranging from 10 to 30 muA between 20 and 40 min
           given an average integrated current at the target of
COMMENT    *By authors*.After EOB, the target was allowed a
           cooling time for the Cs-123 to decay to Xe-123 and
           I-123.
           The recovery of high-purity I-123 adsorbed on the walls
           of the target chamber was performed by washing with
           water. The effects of the length of time that the water
           remained inside the target and the heating temperature
           were studied. this procedure was made in order to
           improve the removing of the I-123 from the target wall,
           thereby decreasing product losses.
ADD-RES     The experimental I-123 yield was determined as a
           function of the decay time after the EOB and as a
           function of the temperature target chamber to remove
           I-123 from the walls and as a function the gas Xe-124
           load pressure.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The Xe-124 pressure was 1.8*10E+3 hPa
           and the decay time after EOB was fixed at 7 Hr. The
           target heating time was fixed at 10 min at 65C-degree.
