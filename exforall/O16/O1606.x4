HISTORY    (20070511C) S B
           (20070516U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Targets of isotopically enriched Sm-147 98% and Sm-149
            97.4% with thicknesses of 40-mug/cm**2 and
            125-mug/cm**2, respectively, evaporated onto thin
           carbon backings were used.
           The Yb-evaporation residues were trapped in an Al-foil
           of 800-mug/cm**2, which was placed 2-mm behind the
           samarium target. The thickness of the catcher foil was
           sufficient to stop the evaporation residues letting
           through the products of the reaction of O-16 with the
           oxygen impurity in the target, with the carbon of the
           target backing and with the aluminium of the some
           catcher foil. During selected runs a second catcher
           foil was located behind the first one in order to
           verify that none of the evaporation residues was lost.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Statistical model calculations of the x-n
           distributions.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3ARGCNE) The 20-UD tandem accelerator at the
            tandar-laboratory in Buenos Aires.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two surface barrier silicon counters were
           placed at +-30-degree to the beam and at a distance
           of 31-cm from the target for monitoring the elastic and
           inelastic scattering of O-16 with the samarium
           isotopes.
           Following irradiations of about 100-120 min, the
           catcher foils were removed from the scattering chamber
           and placed in front of a 5-cm**3 Ge-planar X-ray
           detector. The X-ray detector had an energy resolution
           of 480-eV(FWHM) at 50-KeV. The absolute photopeak
           efficiency of the detector was determined using a set
           of calibrated sources that were carefully mounted in
           the same geometry as the catcher  foils. The efficiency
           was 3.7+-1.2% at an energy of 40-60-KeV.
CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for summing effects
           due to the simultaneous detection of more than one
           photon.
METHOD     (SITA)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).The error from the absolute normalization based
           on rutherford scattering is 9%.
           (ERR-2).The error from the absolute efficiency of the
           X-ray detector is 5%.
           (ERR-3).The error in the coefficients of expression
           is 10%.
           (ERR-4).The error on the cross section arising from the
           statistical uncertainty in the peak areas and the
           fitting of the decay curves. There error were typically
            5%.
           (ERR-T).By summing in quadrature the different sources
           of error (see above), excluding beam energy an overall
           error of approx. 12% in the fusion cross sections was
           calculated. The errors are higher 15-20% at lowest
           bombarding energies, where the counting statistics were
           lower. See table 2.
           (EN-ERR).The absolute energy of the O-16 beam has an
           uncertainty of +-0.5%, which has been determined by
           calibrating the 90-degree analyzing magnet of the
           tandem accelerator .
