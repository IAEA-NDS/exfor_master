TITLE      Fusion of O-16+Sm-148,150,152,154 at sub-barrrier
           energies.

HISTORY    (20070516C) S B
           (20070517U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum evaporation of
           samarium oxide enriched Sm-148(95%), Sm-150(95%),
           Sm-152(98%) and Sm-154(99%). The target material was
           backed by a carbon film having a thickness typically
           of 20-mug/cm**2. The Sm-oxide was first mixed with
           tantalum and thus was reduced to elemental form during
           the evaporation. The thickness of the targets varied
           between 100 and 200-mug/cm**2.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3ISLWZI) The 14-UD pelletron accelerator.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two surface barrier silicon counters were
           used to monitor the elastic scattering from the target.
           They placed at +-40-degree to the beam and at a
           distance  of 25-cm  from the target.
           (GE) The X-ray detector consisted of 1.5-cm**3 of
           intrinsically pure Ge. A resolution of 350-eV(FWHM) was
           obtained at 50-KeV. The catcher foil was positioned
           in front of the detector such that the photopeak
           efficiency in the range of 30-60-KeV was 5.5%. This
           efficiency was determined using a variety of
           calibrated point sources-Am-241, Cs-137, Co-57 and
           Eu-152.
CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections for the simultaneous detection
           of more than one photon were applied.
METHOD     (SITA)
ERR-ANALYS The sources of error has several categories-
           pure systematic errors consist only of the absolute
           Ge-detector efficiency(+-3%) and the solid angle of the
           monitor detectors(+-1%).
           Pure random errors include the number of counts in the
           monitor detector and the reproducibility of the monitor
           system in different runs and is +-2%. The main
           additional source of error was the absolute X-ray
           intensities  and the corrections for summing of
           coincidental radiations is 3%.
           A summation in quadrature of random and partially
           random errors yields a standard deviation of 8.4%.
           The corresponding value for purely systematic errors is
            3.2%.
           (ERR-T).By summing in quadrature the different sources
           of error (see above) adopted an error of 10% for each
           cross section was reported.
