INC-SOURCE (REAC) Filtered neutrons with average energy 59 keV
           scattered on hydrogen, included in the sample-scatterer
           CH2, at scattering angles 15,20,25,30 degrees.
           The 59 keV filtered neutrons were extracted from the
           reactor spectrum using an interference filter of the
           following composition:S-116.53 g/cm2, Ni58-81.42 g/cm2,
           V-24.44 g/cm2, Al-5.4 g/cm2, B10-0.517 g/cm2.
           Purity of the 59 keV filtered beam was about 95.2%,
           other additions to the main spectra were for lines
           47.8 keV-0.95%, 51.7 keV-1.72%, 349 keV-0.18%,690 keV-
           0.11%. The limits of 95% response function for the
           59 keV filter spectrum were defined as 53.3 to 61.4 keV
INC-SPECT  Neutron spectra obtained at the different scattering
           angles had the following parameters:
           at 15 deg.- Eav.=55 keV, Emin-48.6 keV,Emax-57.7 keV;
           at 20 deg.- Eav.=52 keV, Emin-45.8 keV,Emax-55.3 keV;
           at 25 deg.- Eav.=48.4 keV, Emin-42.5 keV,Emax-52.3 keV;
           at 30 deg.- Eav.=44.2 keV, Emin-38.1 keV,Emax-48.6 keV.
METHOD     (FNB,TRN)Transmission measurement of filtered neutrons.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proportional hydrogen counter LND 281 (Gas
           filling-H+CH4+N2,diameter-38.1 mm,length-254 mm,
           gas pressure-4.3 atm).
SAMPLE     (24-Cr-52,ENR=0.993)
           (24-Cr-50,ENR=0.001)
           (24-Cr-53,ENR=0.005)
           (24-Cr-54,ENR=0.001)
           52Cr metal powder,loaded into aluminum container. Two
           52Cr samples were used in measurements at the angles
           15,20,25 degrees - with thickness 0.01731+-0.00006 and
           0.03024+-0.00010 atom/b. One 52Cr sample with thickness
           0.03024+-0.00010 atom/b was used in measurements at the
           angle 30 degree.
           The sample-scatterer CH2 had a thickness 4.52+-0.01 mm,
           the sample-scatterer C had a thickness 10.02+-0.01 mm.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error includes: statistical error of the
           transmission measurements; meausurement errors of
           dimension and weight of the sample; error due to
           presence of impurites in the sample.
CORRECTION Correction on the contribution of other chromium
           isotopes to the Cr-52 total cross section was done.
