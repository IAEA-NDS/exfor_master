TITLE      Cross sections of (n, p) nuclear reactions on zirconium
           isotopes
FACILITY   (CCW,4UKRKGU)  Neutron generator NG-300/15
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted from the irradiated samples
           and the monitor foils were acquired with closed-end
           HPGe detector with sensitive volume of  110 cm3,
           placed in 50 mm thick lead shielding. Energy resolution
           was determined as 2.1 keV  1332 keV 60Co and 1.2 keV
           for  122 KeV 152Eu.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)
COMMENT    The mean neutron energy was determined by the Zr/Nb
           method.
SAMPLE     Disks of natural zirconium. Size of samples:
           1)for diameter 12 mm, thickness 120micro-m; 2)for
           diameter 30 mm, thickness 30 micro-m or 300 micro-m.
           Irradiation of samples was done at the 75 mm distance
           to T-Ti target at the angles 0, 30, 120, 150 degrees to
           axis of deutron beam.
MONITOR    (40-ZR-90(N,2N)40-ZR-89,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total error
STATUS     (TABLE,APRVD) Approved by N.R.Dzysiuk
CORRECTION The correction on true coincidence summing of gamma-
           quanta was calculated with the NuclideMaster code. The
           self-absorption correction was calculated by Monte-
           Carlo simulation method using the MCNP4C code taking
           into account detailed counting geometry.
DECAY-DATA Decay data for all considered reactions and monitors
           were taken from Richard B. Firestone. Table of Isotopes
           CD-ROM, Eight Edition, Version 1.0, March 1996.
HISTORY    (20080711) UKRNDC
           (20100721A) SD: ref.code on ZNJD was corrected on YFE.

CORRECTION Contribution of the 934.44 keV gamma-line of 92mNb from
           impurity niobium (1.21%) in zirconium samples was taken
           into account for the 934.47 keV gamma-line of 92Y.
