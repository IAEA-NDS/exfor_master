FACILITY   (NGEN,4UKRKGU)Neutron pulse generator (NPG-200),
           designed and manufactured at Nuclear Physics Department
           of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, was
           used as a neutron source.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Reaction 3H(d,n)4He in Ti-T target was used to
           generate fast neutrons. Pulse generation frequency was
           equal to 7.25 MHz, average neutron intensity 10E7/s in
           4PI.
SAMPLE     Investigated samples of nat Sn and nat C with masses
           mSn=3208 g, mC=1600 g were irradiated by neutrons.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The emitted prompt gamma-rays are traversed
           the flight path and detected by the NaI(Tl)
           scintillator cylindrical detector of sizes: diameter
           150 mm, height 100 mm. The flight path equals 1.76 m
           to ensure reliable separation of prompt gamma-rays from
           neutron and gamma-ray background. For reducing
           influence of cosmic rays, the NaI(Tl) detector was
           surrounded by Geiger counters working in
           anti-coincidence mode with spectrometer signals.
METHOD     (TOF)   Time-of-flight method was employed to separate
           prompt gamma-rays signals from the whole time spectrum.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental results were compared with
           theoretical calculations performed using EMPIRE 3.2
           and TALYS 1.6 codes.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)Uncertainties of the cross section were
           estimated in assumption that the amplitude spectrum is
           followed by Gauss distributions due to the large number
           of external independent factors.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were received from B.M.Bondar 20171002.

COMMENT    Observation of gamma-transitions for natC was been able
           only from the first excited level with  Eg=4.43 MeV due
           to low intensities of gamma-transitions with other
           energies.
