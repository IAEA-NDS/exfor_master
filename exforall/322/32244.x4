METHOD     (TRN)
           The neutrons scattered by two samples located one
           after another along the beam were registered, neutron
           absorption by one of which (scatterer) is negligible.
           The difference in the counting of the detector when
           the position of the sample and the scatterer is
           changed is proportional to the number of neutrons
           absorbed by the sample under study.
           The scatterer was a fluoroplastic. To select the effect
           due to thermal neutrons, a cadmium plate 1 mm thick was
           used.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Assembly of proportional counters filled with
            He-3, length 500 mm, width 150 mm. Geometry is close
           to 4pi, the detector efficiency is about 95%.
CORRECTION Correction for multiple scattering, calculated by the
           Monte Carlo method
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) Gold sample was
           used as a reference, the cross section was taken from
           REL-REF at an energy of 0.0253 eV

SAMPLE     Samples were selected thin - n * sigma less than 0.2,
           diameter of the samples and the scatterer was 10 mm.
