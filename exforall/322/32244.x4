FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
SAMPLE     Thin sample  (n*sigma<0.2), 10 mm in diameter for
            samples and scatterer (fluoroplastic)
METHOD     The neutrons scattered by two samples located one
            after another along the beam were registered.
           Neutron absorption by one of which (scatterer) is
            negligible.
           The difference in the counting of the detector when
            the position of the sample and the scatterer is
            changed is proportional to the number of neutrons
            absorbed by the sample under study.
           Cd plate 1 mm thick was used to separate effect due to
            thermal neutrons.
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) length 500 mm, width 150 mm, close to 4pi
            geometry, detection efficiency of ~95%
CORRECTION Corrected for multiple scattering calculated by
            Monte Carlo method
