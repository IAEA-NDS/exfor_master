TITLE      Investigation of the scattering cross sections of
           neutrons on carbon nuclei at the reactor filtered beams
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  1)Filter 2 keV. Filter components: Sc, 60Ni, 54Fe, Al,
           S, Co, 10B.
           2)Filter 3.5 keV. Filter components: 60Ni, 54Fe, 10B,
           Al, S.
           3)Filter 24 keV. Filter components: Fe, Al, S, 10B.
           4)Filter 133 keV. Filter components: 58Cr, 58,60Ni, Al,
           Si, 10B.
METHOD     (FNB)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)The detector consisting of 3He counters
            (58 units), was located just above the carbon samples.
           The 3He counters (CHM-37, 7 atm, diameter=18 mm, L=50
           cm) are placed in five layers (12 or 11 in each layer).
           The detector was covered by cadmium sheet with
           thickness 0.5 mm; it was protected then by borated
           polyethylene bricks.
SAMPLE     From two to four carbon samples were used for
           measurements at each energy. The samples are a set of
           carbon disks (from one to four units), each with a
           thickness of 1mm and a diameter of 30.4 mm(C 99.997 %).
           These carbon disks were made by GoodFellow Cambridge
           Limited Company (England).
           1)Filter 2 keV. Four samples thick: 0.008877+-1.2E-05,
           0.017753+-2.4E-05, 0.02663+-3.6E-05,
           0.035507+-4.8E-05 atom/b.
           2)Filter 3.5 keV. Two samples thick: 0.008877+-1.2E-05,
           and 0.02663+-3.6E-05 atom/b.
           3)Filter 24 keV. Two samples thick: 0.017753+-2.4E-05,
           and 0.02663+-3.6E-05 atom/b.
           4)Filters 133 keV. Three samples thick: 0.008877+-
           1.2E-05, 0.017753+-2.4E-05, 0.02663+-3.6E-05 atom/b.
MONITOR    (82-PB-208(N,EL)82-PB-208,,SIG,,AV)
CORRECTION The normalization factor, which is a function of
           detector efficiency, thickness of the carbon samples,
           thickness of the 208Pb sample, geometry, etc., for each
            sample and for each filter energy has been obtained
           through Monte Carlo calculations by means of the MCNP4C
           code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)Total error includes: statistical error of
           measurements;errors of dimension and weight of samples.
