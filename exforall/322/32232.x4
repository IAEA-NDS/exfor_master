FACILITY   (CCW,4UKRKGU)Reaction T(d,n)4He in Ti-T target was used
           as neutron source. Deuterons were accelerated by
           low-voltage accelerator with klystron bunching of
           deuteron beam and finally Ed was 130 keV which
           corresponds to the angle 90 degrees relative to the
           deuteron beam line.Pulse generation frequency was equal
           to 7.25 MHz, average neutron intensity 10E7/s in 4PI.
SAMPLE     Ring sample of natural cadmium with big radius 16.5 cm,
           thickness 2 cm, mass 6050 g.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)15x10 cm NaI(Tl) detector. Flight path between
           the neutron source and detector was equal to 172 cm
           which provides reliable separation of prompt gamma-rays
           from neutron and gamma-ray background. Geiger counters
           applied in anti-coincidence with spectrometer signals
           were used in order to reduce influence of cosmic rays.
ANALYSIS   Differential cross sections of  gamma-rays were
           unfolded from amplitude spectra by using regularization
           procedure on the compact set of limited variations.
           Theoretical calculations have been performed using the
           Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. Sensitivity of the
           calculations to characteristics of excited nuclei were
           analyzed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors given. The contribution of errors
           are estimated as
           (ERR-S,10.,15.) - statistical error - 10-15%
             and systematic errors (ERR-1 and ERR-2)
           (ERR-1) neutron flux error-2%,
           (ERR-2) gamma absorption error-2%.
