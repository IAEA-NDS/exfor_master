COMMENT    A.O.Kadenko (2016-03-23):
            The  cross sections for three (n,a) reactions at
             14.7 MeV compiled in this entry and those compiled in
             EXFOR 32219 are from the same experiment.
            En=14.7+/-0.2 MeV is correct though it is printed as
            14.6+/-0.2 MeV in the article.
           N.R.Dzysiuk (2016-03-23):
            Two papers(PR/C,81,014610,2010 and 2012KYIV,,444,2013)
             are from two experiments. The 2010 paper describes
             the measurements performed for my PhD thesis. Then
             in 2012 Artem Kadenko with me as coauthor repeated
             one of the experiments on Lu and Tb.
           Compiler (2016-03-24):
            It is not very clear if 159Tb,175Lu and 176Lu(n,a)
             cross sections in two entries (32219 and this entry)
             are from the same experiment. The values of the
             cross sections and their uncertainties show perfect
             agreement between them but with different energies
             (En=14.6 MeV in 32219, 14.7 MeV in this EXFOR entry).
             The compiler decided to delete this entry.
