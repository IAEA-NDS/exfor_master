FACILITY   (CCW,4UKRKGU)  Neutron generator NG-300/15
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted from the irradiated samples
           were measured with a lead-shielded high-purity Ge
           spectrometer with sensitive volume of  110 cm3. Energy
           resolution was determined as 2.0 keV  1332 keV 60Co
           and 0.9 keV for 122 keV 57Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
COMMENT    The experimental Zr/Nb method was used to more reliably
           determine the average neutron energy over the specimen.
SAMPLE     The samples of dysprosium, erbium, and ytterbium of
           natural composition were utilized. Lu specimens were
           in the shape of disk foil with 1.3 mm thickness and
           6.3 g mass. Tb specimen was in the shape of disk foil
           with 2 mm thickness and 1.9 g mass.
MONITOR   1(41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
           for flux monitoring (kept constant with accuracy 5%)
          2(13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           for normalization. For this reason, each specimen was
           sandwiched between two Al foils.

CORRECTION The corresponding correction factors for self-
           absorption and coincidence summing effects were
           calculated by means of a Monte Carlo approach with
           utilization of the MCNP4C code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error
           Principal sources of cross-section uncertainties:
           (MONIT-ERR,1.,5.)Monitor cross-section value (1%-5%)
           (ERR-S,1.,35.)Counting rate (1%-35%)
           (ERR-1,0.6,6.5)Efficiency calibration (0.6%-6.5%)
           (ERR-2,1.,5.)Self-absorption of gamma-ray (1%-5%)
           (ERR-3,1.,5.)Correction for coincidence summing (1%-5%)
           (ERR-4,,1.)Mass constants (<1%)
           (ERR-5)Fractional contribution (about 0.05%)
           Delta Neutron energy (170-269 keV)
ADD-RES    Theoretical calculations of cross-section values have
           been performed with codes EMPIRE-3.0 and TALYS-1.2.
