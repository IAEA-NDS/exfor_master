           (D-D) D(d,n)3He 2.85 MeV
           (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  1)Filter 2 keV. Filter components: 10B, Sc, S, 60Ni.
           The energy distribution center of this line is at 1.926
           keV; its relative intensity is 94.2% of the entire
           neutron flux. Besides, in the spectrum there are
           impurity lines: 6.039 keV(0.35%),7.448 keV(3.1%),27.59
           keV(0.35%), 42.816 keV (0.47%), 64.596 keV (1.31%) and
           a group of lines with energies less 300 eV (0.049%).
           2)Filter 59 keV. Filter components: 10B, V, S and 58Ni.
           The energy distribution center of this line is at
           58.735 keV; its relative intensity is 99.2% of the
           entire neutron flux. Besides, in the spectrum there are
           impurity lines: 36.101 keV(0.04%),345.663 keV(0.18%),
           367.674 keV(0.29%), 689.829 keV (0.13%), 783.644 keV
           (0.0161%), 1006.52 keV (0.001%),and a group of lines
           with energies less 300 eV (2e-7%).
           3)Filter 144 keV. Filter components: 10B, Si, Ti.
           The energy distribution center of this line is at
           144.485 keV; its relative intensity is 97.5% of the
           entire neutron flux. Besides, in the spectrum there are
           impurity lines: 35.420 keV(0.05%),53.899 keV(2.1%),and
           a group of lines with energies less 300 eV (0.12%).
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted from the irradiated samples
           and the monitor foils were acquired with closed-end
           HPGe detector with sensitive volume of  110 cm3.
           Distance between detector cap and irradiated foil was
           equal 5 cm and fixed with centering device.  Energy and
           efficiency calibration of spectrometer was done with
           133Ba, 152Eu, 57Co, 60Co, 137Cs standard sources.
           (SPEC,GELI) Spectrometer with  Ge(Li) detector
           DGDK-32B was placed at the horizontal channel and used
           to determine the incident neutron flux using reaction
           10B(n,alpha+gamma).
           (HE3SP)Exposing the tantalic targets, simultaneously
           the monitoring of the neutron flux has been done by the
           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
SAMPLE     For measurements at filtered beam:
           Thicknesses of Ta and In samples are 100 micro-m and
           650 micro-m correspondingly. The diameters of tantalum
           foil sample and In foil sample were the same and equal
           to 28.2 mm. The 115In(n,g)116mIn reaction was used for
           monitoring an absolute value of neutron flux.
           For measurements at 2.85 and 14.34 MeV:
           Thicknesses of Ta samples were 400 micro-m, diameters
           equal to 13, 14, and 18.5 mm.
MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,G)49-IN-116-M,,SIG)
           (40-ZR-90(N,2N)40-ZR-89,,SIG)
           (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
CORRECTION Due to short half-time and varying activity during the
           time of measurement the differential method has been
           utilized to make the correction for "dead" time effect.
           True coincidence and self absorption effect were taken
           into account.
