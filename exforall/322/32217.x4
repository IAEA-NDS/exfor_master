TITLE      Measurements of neutron capture cross-section for
            tantalum at the neutron filtered beams
AUTHOR     (O.Gritzay, V.Libman)
INSTITUTE  (4UKRIJD)
REFERENCE  (C,2008AKERSL,,549,2008) All results presented
           (C,2008KYIV,,548,2008) first result at 59 keV

           (W,GRITZAY,20110318) Data with revised uncertainties
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
METHOD     (FNB,ACTIV) Activation of tantalic samples was done
           during 84 hours for 2 keV and 62 + 84 hours for 59 keV,
           then the targets were removed to the clean zone for the
           further measurements.
DETECTOR   (GELI)Detector type - DGDK-45A; energy resolution -
           3.4 keV at 1332 keV gamma-line; lead shield with 15 cm
           thickness.
           (SPEC,GELI) Spectrometer with two Ge(Li) detectors
           DGDK-32B was placed at the horizontal channel and used
           to determine the incident neutron flux.
           The spectrometer was calibrated on energy and
           efficiency using the sources 133Ba and 152Eu from the
           SOSGI-M standard set. The value of the absolute
           efficiency of registration for gamma-line 478 keV from
           reaction 10B(n,alpha+gamma) was (3.08+-0.17)*10-5.
           (HE3SP)Exposing the tantalic targets, simultaneously
           the monitoring of the neutron flux has been done by the
           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter. The measurements
           of the neutron beam have been done every 1000 s after
           each 2600 s of the total exposition.
SAMPLE     (73-TA-181,ENR=0.99988) The tantalic targets were made
           of natural tantalum foil and the targets had the
           28.0 mm diameter.
           (5-B-10,ENR=0.85) The boron target used to define the
           neutron flux value, was made of the boric powder,
           enriched by 10B. This target is placed inside the
           container  with 28 mm diameter. The thickness of the
           boron target was 1 mm, weight = 0.6732 g.
DECAY-DATA The following nine gamma lines were used for
            determination of the sample activities:

                                DG,1231.0157,0.1144)
CORRECTION Correction on the resonance self-shielding of neutrons
           in the tantalic samples was done. The real values of
           cross-sections were received by extrapolation the
           observed cross sections to zero thickness of the
           samples.
           To estimate a share of cross-section from the impure
           lines, a numerical simulation was performed.
           Corrections for backward scattering of neutrons by the
           output collimator were computed with program package
           MCNP-4C for real irradiation conditions.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG,G) The neutron flux was
           defined by area of the full absorption peak of gamma
           rays with 478 keV energy (the excited state of 7Li).
           Cross sections of the 10B(n,alpha+gamma)7Li* reaction
           were calculated as mean values of the averaged on a
           filtered neutron beam shape of the point-wise cross
           sections, taken from CENDL-2, ENDF/B-VI, JENDL-3.3 and
           JEF-3.0.
