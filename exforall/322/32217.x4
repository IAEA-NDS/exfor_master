TITLE      Measurements of neutron capture cross-section for
            tantalum at the neutron filtered beams
AUTHOR     (O.Gritzay, V.Libman)
INSTITUTE  (4UKRIJD)
REFERENCE  (C,2008AKERSL,,549,2008) All results presented
           (C,2008KYIV,,548,2008) first result at 59 keV
           (C,2006KYIV,,569,2006) first result at 2 keV
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  1)Filter 2 keV. Filter components: 10B, Sc and 60Ni.The
           main part of the filtered neutron spectrum is a line in
           the energy range 0.24-3.0 keV. The energy distribution
           centre of this line is at 1.97 keV; its relative
           intensity is 95.47% of the entire neutron flux.Besides,
           in the spectrum there are impurity lines:
           6.2+7.5 keV(2.93%), 27 keV (0.39%), 43 keV (0.14%), and
           a group of lines in the 48-66 keV range (1.08%).
           2)Filter 59 keV. Filter components: 10B, V, S and 58Ni.
           The main part of the filtered neutron spectrum is a
           line in the energy range 54.8-60.1 keV. The energy
           distribution centre of this line is at 58.96 keV; its
           relative intensity is 94.36% of the entire neutron
           flux. Besides, in the spectrum there are impurity
           lines: 3 groups of lines in the energy range 1-40 keV
            (0.01%), 70-230 keV (0.11%) and 235-1570 keV (5.52%).
METHOD     (FNB,ACTIV)Activation of tantalic samples was done
           during 84 hours for 2 keV and 62 + 84 hours for 59 keV,
           then the targets were removed to the clean zone for the
           further measurements.
DETECTOR   (GELI)Detector type - DGDK-45A; energy resolution -
           3.4 keV at 1332 keV gamma-line; lead shield with 15 cm
           thickness.
           (SPEC,GELI) Spectrometer with two Ge(Li) detectors
           DGDK-32B was placed at the horizontal channel and used
           to determine the incident neutron flux.
           The spectrometer was calibrated on energy and
           efficiency using the sources 133Ba and 152Eu from the
           SOSGI-M standard set. The value of the absolute
           efficiency of registration for gamma-line 478 keV from
           reaction 10B(n,alpha+gamma) was (3.08+-0.17)*10-5.
           (HE3SP)Exposing the tantalic targets, simultaneously
           the monitoring of the neutron flux has been done by the
           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter. The measurements
           of the neutron beam have been done every 1000 s after
           each 2600 s of the total exposition.
SAMPLE     The tantalic targets were made of natural tantalum foil
           and the targets had the 28.0 mm diameter. A pile of
           four 0.2 mm thickness targets and a pile of eight
           0.1 mm thickness targets were used for measurements
           with 2 keV and 59 keV filter, respectively. Percentage
           of the 181Ta in natural tantalum is 99.988%.
DECAY-DATA The following nine gamma lines were used for
            determination of the sample activities:

CORRECTION Correction on the resonance self-shielding of neutrons
           in the tantalic samples was done. The real values of
           cross-sections were received by extrapolation the
           observed cross sections to zero thickness of the
           samples.
           To estimate a share of cross-section from the impure
           lines, a numerical simulation was performed.
           Corrections for backward scattering of neutrons by the
           output collimator were computed with program package
           MCNP-4C for real irradiation conditions.
