REL-REF    (O,G4088001,Zheltonozhsky+,J,NIM/B,438,20,2019) Data
           for 178Hf(g,n)179m2Hf and 181Ta(g,n+p)reactions
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD)
INC-SPECT  Parameters of the reactor neutron spectra:
            In the used channel the fluxes were, n/(cm2*s):
            Fr=4.35E13, Fth=2.42E13 (56% of Fr), Fepi=1.51E13 (35%
            of Fr), Ffast = 0.42E13 (9% of Fr)
SAMPLE     The hafnium powdery target HfO2 (178Hf - enriched till
           92.4%, 180Hf admixture - 1.6%), which was put in the
           round quartz vessel with the diameter of 5 mm. The
           target had a cylinder form with the diameter of 2.5 mm,
           height of 2.1 mm and weight of 5.2 mg.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced gamma-activity was measured.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The induced activity was measured using a gamma-
           spectrometers at the 1.8 -2 keV resolution for the Co60
           gamma-line 1.173 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties.
