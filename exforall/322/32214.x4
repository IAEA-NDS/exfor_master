REFERENCE  (C,2004SANTA,,969,2004)
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
            of the reactor
INC-SPECT  Filtered neutron spectrum with average energy 24.3 keV
            and 58.8 keV.
METHOD     (FNB) Transmission measurement of filtered neutrons.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proportional hydrogen counter CHM-38 (90% H2+
            9.56% CH4+0.44% He3 at 3 atm.), voltage 2500 V.
SAMPLE     (24-CR-52,ENR=0.993)
           52Cr metal powder loaded into Al container. For
            background counting rate the polyethylene sample with
             thickness 0.731 - 0.550 g/cm2 was used.
ERR-ANALYS Total error includes:
            - statistical error of the transmission measurements;
            - meausurement errors of dimension and weight of the
              sample;
            - error due to presence of impurites in the sample;
CORRECTION Corrected for the contribution of 50Cr (0.1%),
            53Cr (0.5%), 54Cr (0.1%) to the 52Cr total cross
            section.

CORRECTION The unshielded values of 52Cr total cross
           sections we received by linear extrapolation to
           zero thickness of our experimental results.
