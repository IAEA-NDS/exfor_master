TITLE      Total Cross Section And Self-Shielding Effects Of
           Cr-52 Isotope Measured At Kyiv Research Reactor
           Neutron Filtered Beams
FACILITY   (REAC) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  Filtered neutron spectrum with average energy
           24.3keV and 58.8keV
METHOD     (FNB) Transmission measurement of filtered neutrons.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proportional hydrogen counter CHM-38 (the
           counter is filled: 90% H2 + 9.56% CH4 + 0.44% He3,
           pressure 3 atm.,voltage 2500V)
SAMPLE     52Cr metal powder(enrichment 99,3%),loaded into
           aluminum container. For background counting rate the
           polyethylene sample with thickness 0,731 - 0,550 g/cm2
           was used.
ERR-ANALYS Total error includes:
           statistical error of the transmission measurements;
           meausurement errors of dimension and weight of the
           sample; error due to presence of impurites in the
           sample;
CORRECTION Correction on the contribution of other chromium
           isotopes(Cr-50(0.1%),Cr-53(0.5%),Cr-54(0.1%) to the
           Cr-52 total cross section was also made.

CORRECTION The unshielded values of 52Cr total cross
           sections we received by linear extrapolation to
           zero thickness of our experimental results.
