TITLE      The total neutron cross section for natural carbon in
           the energy range 2 to 148 keV
FACILITY   (REAC) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  1)Filter 2 keV. Average energy of filtered neutron
           spectrum 2.004 keV,filter components(Sc, 60Ni, 54Fe,
           Al, S, Co, 10B ),purity of beam about 99.92%, other
           additions to the main spectra were negligible: 43 keV -
           0.06%, 65 keV - 0.02%.The limits of 95% response
           function for the 2 keV filter spectrum were defined as
           1.051 to 2.710 keV.
           2)Filter 3.5 keV. Average energy of filtered neutron
           spectrum 3.267 keV,filter components(60Ni, 54Fe, 10B,
           Al, S),purity of beam about 98.7%, other additions to
           the main spectra were: 43 keV - 0.5%, 65 keV - 0.3%,
           87 keV - 0.1%. The limits of 95% response function for
           the 3.5 keV filter spectrum were defined as 0.438 to
           4.409 keV.
           3)Filter 13 keV. Average energy of filtered neutron
           spectrum 12.738 keV,filter components(58Ni,57Fe,10B,Al,
           S,Si),purity of beam about 98.3%, other additions to
           the main spectra were: (60-70) keV-1.7%, 270 keV-0.2%.
           The limits of 95% response function for the 13 keV
           filter spectrum were defined as 12.537 to 13.448 keV.
           4)Filter 134 keV. Average energy of filtered neutron
           spectrum 133.59 keV,filter components(58Cr, 58,60Ni,
           Al,Si,10B),purity of beam about 99.8%, other additions
           to the main spectra were: 13 keV- 0.01%, 60 keV- 0.02%,
           155 keV - 0.02%. The limits of 95% response function
           for the 134 keV filter spectrum were defined as 132.206
           to 135.325 keV.
METHOD     (FNB)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)For neutron energies equal and less than 13 keV,
           the He-3 counters: a) CHM-37 (diameter-18mm,
           length-500 mm, gas pressure-7 atm); b) LND 2527 (dia-
           meter-25.4 mm,length-386.84 mm,gas pressure-20 atm)
           For neutron energies equal and more than 13 keV, the
           hydrogen recoil counters: a) CHM-38 (Gas filling-90% H2
           + 9.56% CH4 + 0.44% 3He2,diameter-30 mm,length-300 mm,
           gas pressure-4 atm); b) LND 281 (Gas filling- H+CH4+N2,
           diameter-38.1 mm,length-254 mm, gas pressure-4.3 atm).
SAMPLE     Three types of natural carbon samples:
           a)solid samples from reactor graphite(C99.9%);
           b)powder samples, loaded into Al container with
           internal diameter 31.75mm(C99.9%);
           c)carbon disks, each of them has thickness 1mm and
           diameter 30.4mm(C99.997%)
           1)Filter 2 keV. Six samples of reactor graphite thick
           0.044657, 0.047326, 0.127593, 0.172569 atom/b (type a)
           and 0.186890, 0.247653 atom/b (type b).
           2)Filter 3.5 keV. Two samples thick 0.00888+-0.00001
           and 0.02663+-0.00002 atom/b (type c).
           3)Filter 13 keV. One sample thick 0.127593 +- 0.000010
           atom/b (type c).
           4)Filter 134 keV. Two samples thick 0.00887+-0.000012
           and 0.02660+-0.00026 atom/b (type c).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)Total error includes:
           statistical error of the transmission measurements;
           meausurement errors of dimension and weight of the
           sample
