TITLE      Measurements of Cr-52 total cross section at the
           energy 24 keV
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in horizontal channel
           of the reactor
INC-SPECT  Filtered neutron spectrum with average energy
           24.3+-0.8keV and flux density at the filter output
           (2.28+-0.20)*10**5 neutron/cm2*s
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission measurement of filtered neutrons
           Neutron filter composition:
           Fe(236.1g/cm2), Al(115.02g/cm2),S(19.02g/cm),
           B-10(1g/cm2);
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proportional hydrogen counter CHM-38 (the
           counter is filled: 90% H2 + 9.56% CH4 + 0.44% He3,
           pressure 3 atm.,voltage 2500V)
SAMPLE     Metal powder of Cr (with isotope Cr-52 enrichment
           99.3%) loaded into aluminum container with internal
           diameter 31.75 mm, sample thickness
           0.1208+-0.004 at/barn
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes the following components:
            * statistical error of the transmission measurements;
            * measurement errors of dimension and weight of the
                                                       sample;
            * error due to presence of admixtures in the
                                               sample, etc.
           correction on the contribution of other chromium
           isotopes(Cr-50(0.1%),Cr-53(0.5%),Cr-54(0.1%) to the
           Cr-52 total cross section was fulfilled

CORRECTION No resonance self-shielding factor was taken
           into account.
           Evaluated value of data (with self-shielding factor
           taken into account) were calculated from different
           ENDF/B libraries.
           Possible value of Cr52 isotope total neutron
           cross-section is in limits from 2.172 +- 0.012 to
           2.493+-0.014 barns.
