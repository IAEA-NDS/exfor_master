FACILITY   (NGEN,4UKRKGU)Neutron pulse generator (NPG-200),
           designed and manufactured at Nuclear Physics Department
           of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, was
           used as a neutron source.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Reaction 3H(d,n)4He in Ti-T target was used to
           generate fast neutrons. Deuterons are accelerated up
           to 130 keV energy by low-voltage accelerator with
           klystron bunching of the beam. Pulse generation
           frequency was equal to 7.25 MHz, average neutron
           intensity 10E7/s in 4PI.
SAMPLE     The nat Ni sample has the ring torus shape with the
           main radius R=10.0 cm and minor radius r = 1.5 cm.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The emitted prompt gamma-rays are traversed
           the flight path and detected by the NaI(Tl)
           scintillator cylindrical detector of sizes: diameter
           150 mm, height 100 mm. The flight path equals 1.76 m
           to ensure reliable separation of prompt gamma-rays from
           neutron and gamma-ray background. For reducing
           influence of cosmic rays, the NaI(Tl) detector was
           surrounded by Geiger counters working in
           anti-coincidence mode with spectrometer signals. The
           NaI(Tl) detector and Geiger counters were placed in a
           special composed shielding with concrete and lead
           bricks.
           (SCIN) The neutron beam monitoring is performed by
           the use of additional plastic scintillator detector
           with sizes: diameter 30 mm, height 40 mm. This
           detector was placed at a distance 3.36 m from Ti-T
           target. The angle between the deuteron beam and the
           detector is 140 degrees (the neutron beam has the
           energy 13.5 MeV in this direction).
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental results were compared with
           theoretical calculations performed using EMPIRE 3.2
           and TALYS 1.6 codes for statistical models of
           compound and precompound decays. The impact of
           different expressions for photon strength function
           and nuclear level density on the calculation results
           for nat Ni was considered.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)Uncertainties of the cross section were
           estimated in assumption that the amplitude spectrum is
           followed by Gauss distributions due to the large number
           of external independent factors.
