TITLE      The measurements of the differential elastic neutron
           cross-sections of carbon for energies from 2 to 133 keV
FACILITY   (REAC,4UKRIJD) Reactor WWR-M
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron filters installed in the 8-th horizontal
           channel of the reactor.
INC-SPECT  1)Filter 2 keV. Filter components: Sc, 60Ni, 54Fe, Al,
           S, Co, 10B.
           2)Filter 59 keV. Filter components:10B, S, 58Ni, V, Al.
           3)Filter 133 keV. Filter components: 52Cr, 58Ni,60Ni,
           Si, 10B, Al.
METHOD     (FNB)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)For registration of the scattered neutrons,
           five specially designed detectors were used. Every
           detector is the assembly of seven helium-3 counters
           CNM-17 (18 mm diameter, 220 mm length, 7 at
           pressure), which works with one preamplifier. For
           every assembly of the counters the units were picked
           up with the identical gas amplification, so that no
           expansion of helium peak took place in spectrums.
           These assemblies have the individual radiation
           shielding as the cylinder thin-walled container (100
           mm external diameter, 300 mm length) filled with the
           boron carbide.
SAMPLE     From two to four carbon samples were used for
           measurements at each energy. The samples are a set of
           carbon disks (from one to four units), each with a
           thickness of 1mm and a diameter of 30.4 mm(C 99.997 %).
           These carbon disks were made by GoodFellow Cambridge
           Limited Company (England).
           1)Filter 2 keV. Four samples thick: 0.007344, 0.008888,
           0.017261, 0.026597 atom/b.
           2)Filter 59 keV. Two samples thick: 0.008888 and
           0.02659927 atom/b.
           3)Filters 133 keV. Two samples thick: 0,0088707 and
           0.02659927 atom/b.
MONITOR    (82-PB-208(N,EL)82-PB-208,,SIG,,AV) The thickness of
           the 208Pb sample was 0.00616+-1E-05 nucl/barn,
           enrichment of 208Pb to 98.3%, chemical purity 99.98%.
           Values for elastic scattering cross section of 208Pb
           were taken from JENDL-3.3.
CORRECTION The normalization factor, which is a function of
           detector efficiency, thickness of the carbon samples,
           thickness of the 208Pb sample, geometry, etc., for each
           sample and for each filter energy has been obtained
           through Monte-Carlo calculation with our codes ROZSI
           and ROZSMK.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Total error includes: statistical error of
           measurements;errors of dimension and weight of samples.
