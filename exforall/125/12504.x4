TITLE      Neutrons per Fission from 49 Compared with 25:
           Slightly Delayed Neutron from 49 and 25

INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Paraffin-lined proportional counter.
           (IOCH)
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between 239Pu (49) fissions in an
           ionization chamber and proton recoils in a paraffin
           lined proportional counter caused by the neutrons
           given off during fission are compared to similar
           coincidence when 235U (25) is used in an identical
           geometry. To produce fissions, the chamber was placed
           in the 11'x7'x6'8" graphite block about 4' back from
           the face exposed to the cyclotron neutrons.
ANALYSIS   Weighted mean of nubar239Pu/nubar235U for all data was
           adopted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental and theoretical probable
           errors.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Los Alamos notation uses 49 for
           Z=94, A=239 (239Pu) and 25 for Z=92, A=235 (235U).
