TITLE      Capture Cross-Section of Americium-241 for Pile
           Neutrons
AUTHOR     (G.T.Seaborg,W.M.Manning)
REFERENCE  (R,CS-3471,4,1946)
INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) U-graphite reactor, X-10.
INC-SPECT  Reactor spectrum.
SAMPLE     1.7 microg sample of 241Am.
PART-DET   (A)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Americium sample was bombarded for five weeks
           in the Clinton pile. After bombardment the alpha
           activity of the sample was observed to consist of
           40.3% at 4.1 cm range of 241Am and 59.7% at the 4.7
           cm range of 242Cm [formed as a result of the reaction
           241Am(n,gamma)242Am(beta-)242Cm].
HISTORY    (19760804T) Translated from SCISRS.
           (19841004A) Converted to reaction formalism.
           (20180608A) BP: Updated to new date formats,lower
           case. Corrections according last EXFOR rules and
           Dict. and CP-D/841 Rev.=WP2014-45, clarified the
           situation with the cross section recalculation and
           added present day half lives and branching ratios for
           comparison.

STATUS     (DEP,12576002)
           (RNORM,12576002)
COMMENT    Cross section was recalculated by NNCSC using 1970s
           values for the half lives and branching ratios: 84%
           for 16hr Am242 beta branch to Cm242. Assumed Am241
           T1/2= 459yr and Cm242 T1/2=163d.
           Compiler's comment: The 2018 values for 242Am
           T1/2=16.02 h, 241Am T1/2=432.6 y, and 242Cm T1/2=162.8
           days. Beta decay branching ratio of 242Am to 242Cm is
           82.7%.
