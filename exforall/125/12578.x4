TITLE      Branching ratio of 242m Am decay.
SAMPLE     Approximately 1 mg samples of this americium were
           sealed in quartz capsules and irradiated in the
            'rabbit' facility of the MTR.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALRL) U235-H2O reactor, MTR.
INC-SPECT  Four irradiations of 24 hours and one of 48 hours were
           made in neutron fluxes in the range
            1-2 x 10**14 neutrons/cm2/sec. The neutron fluxes
           were monitored using cobalt activation standards.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The alpha counting was done in an argon-filled,
           ionization-type counter of known efficiency  (52%).
           The alpha pulse analyses were performed in an argon
           filled ionization chamber connected to a 50 channel
           differential pulse-height analyser. The mass analyses
           of the plutonium were performed using a 12 in. radius,
           60.degr. sector, magnetic mass-spectrograph.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty includes statistical errors in
           the alpha counting and mass analyses and the
           uncertainties in flux measurements and in the assumed
           cross-section for 242m-Am destruction.

ANALYSIS   Neutron capture cross-sections to form 242Cm were
           measured for all five irradiations. Total cross-
           sections for Am-241(n,g)Am-242g have been derived from
           these measurements and the measured branching ratio of
           Am-242g and assuming total destruction cross-section
           of 6000 barns to Am-242g.
