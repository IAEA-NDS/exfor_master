INC-SOURCE (D-D) The d-d reaction was used as a neutron source.
           The deuterons were accelerated by the voltage
           supplied by the transformer-rectifier set in this
           laboratory.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) For the present experiments a special
           ionization chamber was constructed which makes
           possible the application of high fields over large
           volumes.
METHOD     (REC) Experiments were carried out in the following
           three gas mixtures: 5 atmos. Kr+4 atmos. H2, 5 atmos.
           Kr+4 atmos. D2, 7 atmos. He. Krypton is added in
           order to reduce the range of the recoil protons and
           deuterons. The maximum range of the H recoils from
           25-MeV neutrons was 1.2 cm, that of the D and He
           recoils smaller.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The main uncertainty of this result is due
           to the uncertainty in the value of the absolute
           neutron yield of the d-d reaction which is estimated
           to be +-20%.
CORRECTION This number is corrected for scattered neutrons which
           do not come directly from the target.
