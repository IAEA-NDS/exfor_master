TITLE      Search for spontaneously fissioning isomer of Am-242
           formed by thermal neutron capture.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE A neutron beam from the Livermore reactor was filtered
           by 30 cm of large quartz crystals cooled by liquid
           nitrogen.
SAMPLE     Five mg of 241 Am in oxide form was electroplated on a
           nickel foil which was then mounted about 0.6 cm from
           the sensitive face of a spark chamber
