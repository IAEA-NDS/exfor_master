INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) The East Thermal Column(graphite) of the
            Juggernaut reactor.
INC-SPECT  Up to 10**11 neutrons /cm2/sec. A cadmium ratio,
           taken with gold monitors, indicated 1.4% of the
           neutrons were epithermal 18 in. from the core face,
           where most of the work was done, and 0.16% of the
           neutrons were epithermal 30 in. from the core face.
DETECTOR   (D4PI,FISCH) Back-to-back fission counter.
METHOD     (ASEP,BSPEC) The Argonne Isotope Separator, the low
           background counting system, the high neutron flux.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Computer analyses of the decay curves.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors, based upon standard deviations,
           are estimates of the reproducibility of the
           measurements at Juggernaut, with the assumptions
           stated. The ambiguities implicit in the presence of
           epithermal neutrons made repetitions to increase
           precision unprofitable.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG) Based on U-235 thermal fission.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table II, page 2556.
HISTORY    (19760804T) Translated from SCISRS.
           (19841004A) Converted to reaction formalism.

REACTION   (94-PU-243(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
SAMPLE     Plutonium that was largely 242Pu was further enriched
           with the isotope separator to 99.98% 242Pu, 0.0051%
           241Pu, and 0.0068% 239Pu. This was then irradiated in
           the CP-5 reactor in order to prepare a sample of
           243Pu, and purified from fission products by a
           thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) extraction.

REACTION   (99-ES-254(N,F),,SIG,,MXW)
SAMPLE     Attempts to measure 254Es (276d) led to erroneous
           results until an aged sample of einsteinium from an
           extensive Savannah River Reactor irradiation was
           obtained. In this sample the 255Es content (20.7d)
           had decayed to the point where alpha particle pile-up
           in the fission counter did not obscure the
           neutron-induced fission activity. The quantity of
           254Es in the sample was measured by comparing the 1
           MeV gamma ray activity from the 250Bk in equilibrium
           with 254Es to the gamma ray activity of a small, pure
           254Es standard.
