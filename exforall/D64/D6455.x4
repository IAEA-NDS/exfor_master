TITLE      Investigation of the role of neutron transfer and
           fusion hindrance in 28Si+158Gd at deep sub-barrier
           energies

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15 UD Pelletron accelerator facility
SAMPLE     (64-GD-158,ENR=0.9732) of thickness ~134.4 ug/cm2 were
           fabricated on ~50 ug/cm2 carbon foil backing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier detectors with 1 mm
           diameter aperture mounted at +/- 15.5 degrees about
           about the incident beam direction. The detectors were
           to monitor the beam and cross-section normalization.
           (MAGSP,MWPC) A position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counter, with an active area of
           15 x 5 cm2 was mounted at the HIRA focal plane for
           detection of evaporation residues.
METHOD     (TOFDE) Delta E-TOF for evaporation residue
           selection.
           (OLMS) Fusion cross-sections were measured
           using the Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer (HIRA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The corresponding uncertainty in the fusion
           cross section is due to
            - Statistical error in ER and monitor yields
            - error in determining HIRA transmission efficiency
