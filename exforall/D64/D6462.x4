FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15 UD Pelletron + SC-LINAC accelerator
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 187Re target (~200 ug/cm2 thick)
           on a carbon backing (~ 13 ug/cm2 thick).
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWPC) Position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counter of area 15 cm X 5 cm detect the
           ER cross section. The gas detector was operated with
           isobutane gas of about 2.5 mbar pressure.
           (SIBAR) Two silicon detectors were placed inside the
           target at angle of +/-26 degree are used to detect
           elastically scattered particles from the target.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (OLMS) The heavy ERs are separated from the enormous
           beam background using hybrid recoil mass analyzer
            (HYRA).
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on the source of uncertainty
