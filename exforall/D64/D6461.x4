SAMPLE     (58-CE-142,ENR=0.9215) An isotopically enriched thin
           target (~200 ug/cm2 thick) with carbon backing of
           20 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,MWPC) Position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counter of area 15 cm X 5 cm2 detect the
           evaporation residue cross section. The gas detector was
           operated with isobutane gas of about 2 Torr pressure.
           The detection efficiency of HYRA spectrometer is
           13.6+/-1.47%.
           (SIBAR) Two silicon detectors placed inside the target
           chamber at distance of ~42 mm from the target at an
           angle of 26.1 degree with respect to beam direction.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (OLMS) The heavy ERs are separated from the enormous
           beam background using hybrid recoil mass analyzer
            (HYRA).
CORRECTION The incident energies were corrected for the energy
           losses of ~8 MeV in 650 ug/cm2 carbon window foil,
           carbon backing and half thickness of the target.
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical error and the error in the
           estimation of the HIRA transmission efficiency.
