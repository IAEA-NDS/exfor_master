FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) Pelletron + LINAC accelerator facility
SAMPLE     (62-SM-154,ENR=0.9889)
           Isotopically thin targets of 154Sm of thickness
           118 ug/cm2 had carbon capping and backing of
           10 and 25 ug/cm2, respectively.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier detectors, placed
           47 mm from the target center at an angle of 23.4 degree
           in the horizontal plane, were used to cross-section
           normalization.
           (MAGSP,MWPC) A position-sensitive multiwire
           proportional counter, with an active area of
           150 x 50 mm and was operated using isobutane gas at a
           pressure of ~2.0 Torr. A 0.5-um-thick mylar foil was
           used to separate the MWPC from the gas-filled region
           of HYRA.
METHOD     (TOFDE) Delta E-TOF for evaporation residue
           selection.
           (ASEP) The heavy ERs are separated from the enormous
           beam background using hybrid recoil mass analyser
            (HYRA).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total cross-section uncertainty ranges
            from 10% at high energies to 20% at low energies.
