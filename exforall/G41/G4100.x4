TITLE      Study of the excitation of the isomeric state 7/2+

METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-resolution spectrometer based on an HP
           Ge-detector with a volume of 175 cm3. The detector's
           resolution was ~2 keV for the 1332 keV line of
           cobalt-60.
SAMPLE     The investigated targets were high-purity powdered
           metallic selenium disks pressed into caprolon
           cassettes. The target weighed 2 g and had a diameter
           of 30 mm.
ADD-RES    Cross-section of excitation of metastable states in
           the reaction (gamma,n) on the 82Se nucleus.
           (COMP) Using the software package TALYS-1.9,
           theoretical calculations of the cross-section of the
            (gamma,n) reaction were performed.
