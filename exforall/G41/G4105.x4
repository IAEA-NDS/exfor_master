METHOD     (ACTIV) Induced beta-delayed gamma-activity measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectrometer based on the HPGe-detector,
           model Canberra GC-2018 with the energy resolution of
           0.8 and 1.8 keV at 122 and 1332.5 keV, respectively.
           Its detection efficiency at 1332.5 keV was 20% relative
           to the NaI(Tl) scintillator, 3 inches in diameter and
           3 inches in thickness. Calibration of the detection
           efficiency was done by using a set of gamma-ray
           radiation sources: 22Na, 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu,
           241Am.

ADD-RES    (COMP) Experimental data are compared with theoretical
            predictions calculated with TALYS 1.95 code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty of measured flux-averaged
           cross sections was determined as a square root of the
           quadratic sum of statistical and systematic errors.
           (ERR-S,2.,9.) Mainly due to statistics in the full
           absorption peak of the corresponding gamma-ray - 2-9%,
           (ERR-1) exposure time and the electron curren - 0.5%,
           (ERR-2,2.,3.) gamma-ray detection efficiency  - 2-3%
           (ERR-3) normalization of the experimental data to the
                  yield of the monitoring reaction 100Mo(g,n)99Mo,
           (ERR-4,2.,2.06) the half-life T1/2 of the reaction
           products and the intensity of the analyzed gamma-rays.

DECAY-DATA (72-HF-180-M,5.5HR,DG,443.09,0.819)
            Data from Tab.1 (p. 268).
FLAG       (1.) A converter made of a natural tantalum plate with
           transverse dimensions of 20x20 mm and a thickness of
           1.05 mm. The flux of bremsstrahlung gamma-quanta was
           cleaned fromelectrons using an Al absorber of
           cylindrical shape with a diameter of 100mm and a length
           of 150mm.
           (2.) A natTa converter foil with a thickness of
           100 mu-m, and a bending magnet to clean the
           bremsstrahlung gamma-flux from electrons were used.
