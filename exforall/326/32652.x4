SAMPLE     The tellurium powder of 99.999% purity was compressed
           into a disk 20mm in diameter and 2.16-3.62mm in
           thickness was then sandwiched between two 0.28-0.36-mm
           -thick niobium foils (99.99% purity) of the same
           diameter, finally wrapped in 1-mm-thick cadmium
           foil in order to absorb thermal neutron.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 110 cm3 coaxial high-purity germ.detector
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The major errors  from the errors of counting
            statistics, detector efficiency,monitor reaction cross
            sections, weights of samples, selfabsorption of
            gamma-rays, coincidence summing effect of cascade
            gamma-rays, sample geometry and the effect of the
            scattering neutrons.
CORRECTION  Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption in
            the sample, for gamma-gamma coincidence summing
            effects, for fluctuation of the neutron flux during
            the irradiation and for sample geometry.
