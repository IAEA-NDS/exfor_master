FACILITY   ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 1.3-1.4mg/cm2 thick.

SAMPLE      Pure gallium metal was used as the target material.
            the samples of aluminum and gallium were always made
            into circular foils with a diameter of about 2 cm.
            The samples in each group were sandwiched between
            two Al foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Resolution 3keV, 110 cm3 coaxial high-purity
            germanium detector
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The errors in  result from neutron energy
           1-1.5%,irradiation time (0.1%), counting statistics
           5-8.2%, decay data (1%), standard cross-sectional
            uncertainties (1.5-2.1%), detector efficiency (1.5%),
            weight of samples (0.5%), neutron fluence fluctuation
            (2.0%), self-absorption of g rays (1.2%), the countin
              geometry (2.6%) and the coincidence sum effect
            of cascade g rays (1.0%).
