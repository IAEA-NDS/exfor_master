FACILITY   ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 1.3-1.4mg/cm2 thick.

SAMPLE      Pure gallium metal was used as the target material.
            the samples of aluminum and gallium were always made
            into circular foils with a diameter of about 2 cm.
            The samples in each group were sandwiched between
            two Al foils.

            germanium detector
METHOD     (ACTIV)
