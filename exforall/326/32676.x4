FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) The 4.5-MV Van de Graaff accelerator
           of the Institute of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking
           University.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Monoenergetic neutrons were produced through
           the D(d,n)3He reaction with a deuterium gas target,
           2.0 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The gas cell
           was separated from the vacuum tube by a molybdenum
           foil 5 mu-m in thickness. The pressure range was
           3.14x10**5-2.94x10**5 Pa. The energies of the deuteron
           beam before enter the foil were 1.79, 2.46 and
           3.26 MeV, and the neutron energies were 4.0, 5.0
           and 6.0 MeV, with energy spreads 0.23, 0.16 and
           0.12 MeV, respectively.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Twin-gridded ionization chamber.
           The shape is cylindrical, 29.0 cm in height, 37.0 cm
           in diameter, and 2.0 mm in thickness.  The grids
           were composed of gilded parallel tungsten wires,
           0.10 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in spacing, and the
           effective area is 16x18 cm2. Distances from the
           cathode to grid and from the grid to anode were 75
           and 20 mm, respectively. The working gas was
           Kr + 2.89%CO2. The pressures of the working gas was
           1.37x10**5 Pa.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
           monitor.
PART-DET   (A)Alphas
SAMPLE     (42-MO-95,ENR=0.968)
           Two 95Mo samples (The thickness and diameter for each
           sample are 5.0 mg/cm2 and 11.0 cm)attached back-to-back
           to the common cathode were used for simultaneous alpha
           event measurements of forward (0 to 90 deg) and
           backward (90 to 180 deg) angles. The isotopic
           abundance of the 95Mo samples was 96.8%. The backings
           are aluminum sheets 0.127 mm in thickness.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) Taken from the ENDF/B-VII.0.
           The  absolute neutron flux was determined by
           measuring the fission rate with a  238U foil (2.0 cm
           in diameter, 547.2 +- 7.1 mu-g in mass , and 99.997%
           in abundance)placed  at the third position of the
           sample changer. The working gas of the fission chamber
           was flowing Ar+2.85%CO2 gas, and the pressure slightly
           higher than atmospheric pressure.
