SAMPLE     Both U3O8 and metallic uranium were used for sample,
           its weight are as follows :

FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) Heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons from horizontal hole of reactor. The
           fission spectrum neutrons were produced by a 150 gram
           enriched uranium (90% of U-235) convertor
           irradiated by the thermal neutrons beam. The intensity
           was about 1. x 10**9 n/4Pi/sec
METHOD     (FPGAM)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 145 cm3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector with
           resolution 2.0 keV at 1332.5 keV gamma ray of Co-60
           was used for gamma measurement. The absolute efficiency
           was calibrated with a series of standard sources :
           Sc-46,(Zr-95)-(Nb-95),Ag-108m,Cs-137,Ce-144,
            (Ba-140)-(La-140),Ta-182.
           (FISCH) a back-to-back fission ionization chamber was
           used for fission rate measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for
           . pulse pile-up
           . gamma self-absorption in U-235 sample
           . geometry

           the fission yields.
