SAMPLE     Both U3O8 and metallic uranium were used for sample,
           its weight are as follows :

                        neutron (mg)           neutrons (mg)
           metallic U    744.15 and 839.10      754.80 and 812.80

           Isotopes component are as follows :
           U-234      U-235      U-236      U-238

FACILITY   (REAC) Heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons from horizontal hole of reactor. The
           fission spectrum neutrons were produced by a 150 gram
           enriched uranium (90 percent of U-235) convertor
           irradiated by the thermal neutrons beam. The intensity
           was about 1*e+9 n/4pi/sec
METHOD     (FPGAM)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 145 CM3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector with
           resolution 2.0 keV at 1332.5 keV gamma ray of Co-60
           was used for gamma measurement. The absolute efficiency
           was calibrated with a series of standard sources :
           Sc-46,(Zr-95)-(Nb-95),Ag-108m,Cs-137,Ce-144,
            (Ba-140)-(La-140),Ta-182.
           (FISCH) A back-to-back fission ionization chamber was
           used for fission rate measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for
           . pulse pile-up
           . gamma self-absorption in u-235 sample
           . geometry
DECAY-DATA The decay data given below were used for calculating
           the fission yields.

           as follows :
           1.5     percent for fission rate error
           0.2     percent for error due to pulse pile-up time
                   correction
           0.3     percent for error due to self absorption
                   correction
           1-6     percent for branch ratio error
           1.2-3.5 percent for efficiency error
           0.2     percent for half-life error
           and statistical error
