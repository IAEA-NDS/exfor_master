TITLE      Cross-section measurements for the (n,a) reactions

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CHPLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator at
           Lanzhou University, the yield was about 3*e10~4*e10
           n/s.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 1.35 mg/cm2 thick. An effective
           deuteron beam energy was 135 KeV and a beam current
           was 500 micro-A.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium detector
           made in the People Republic of China, sensitive
           volume was 110 cm3, with a relative efficiency of 20%
           and an energy resolution of 3 KeV at 1332 KeV.
SAMPLE     The groups of samples were placed at 0, 45, 90, 135
           degree angles relative to the beam direction. The
           samples in each group were sandwiched between two Al
           or two Nb foils.

           The cross sections of monitor reaction were defined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference
           from "Physik Daten - Physics Data, Evaluation of Cross
           Sections for 14 Important Neutron-Dosimetry Reactions.
           Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, Gesellschaft fur
           wissenschaftlich-technische Information mbH, Federal
           Republic of Germany, No. 13-5 (1990)".
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty include the uncertainty of
           counting statistics, detector efficiency, monitor
           reaction cross sections, weight of samples, self-
           absorption of gamma-ray, coincidence summing effect of
           cascade gamma-rays, sample geometry and effect of the
           scattering neutrons.
CORRECTION The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections were made for small
           variations in the yield. The sample gamma-ray
           self-absorption, neutron flux fluctuation and sample
           geometry were corrected.
