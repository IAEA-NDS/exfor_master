FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
            generator was 1.35 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium detector
            made in the People Republic of China with a relative
            efficiency of 20% and an energy resolution of 3 keV
            at 1332 keV.
SAMPLE     About 1.5 gram Pt(>99.99% purity) was made into a
            pellet (10 mm diameter). Thin Nb(>99.999% purity) or
            Al(>99.999% purity) foils were attached in the front
            and at the back of each sample as neutron flux
            monitor foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation lasted 6-10 h with a yield of
            around 3E10 to 4E10 n/(4pi.s).

           The cross sections of monitor reaction were obtained
            by interpolating the evaluated values.

           14.1 and 14.6 MeV, respectively.
           (MONIT2-ERR) Uncertainties of standard cross section
           of 27-Al(n,a)24-Na is 0.8, 0.6 and 0.6 mb at 13.5,
           14.1 and 14.6 MeV, respectively.
CORRECTION The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections were made for small
           variations in the yield. The self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays in the investigated
           nuclide and in the counting geometry were taken into
           account in data analysis, respectively.
