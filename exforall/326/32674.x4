FACILITY   (NGEN,3CHPLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator at
           Lanzhou University.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 1.35 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium detector
           made in the People Republic of China with a relative
           efficiency of 20% and an energy resolution of 3 keV at
           1332 keV.
SAMPLE     About 1.5 gram Pt(>99.99% purity) was made into a
           pellet(10mm diameter). Thin Nb(>99.999% purity) or
           Al(>99.999% purity) foils were attached in the front
           and at the back of each sample.

CORRECTION The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections were made for small
           variations in the yield. The self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays in the investigated
           nuclide and in the counting geometry were taken into
           account in data analysis, respectively.
