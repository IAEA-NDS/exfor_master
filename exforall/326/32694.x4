            Another measurement of the same reaction
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5MV Van de Graaff accelerator were
           used.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The length and diameter of the deuterium gas
           cell are 2.0 cm and 0.9 cm, respectively. The gas
           cell was separated from the vacuum tube by a
           molybdenum foil 5 mu-m in thickness. The deuterium
           gas pressure range was about 3.1-2.9 atm.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)A twin gridded ionization chamber was used as
           the charged particle detector with forward and
           backward asymmetrical sections. It has the advantages
           of high detection efficiency (about 100%), large
           detection solid angle (about 4Pi). The shape of the
           chamber is cylindrical, with diameter 28.2 cm and
           height 27.2 cm. The shape of electrodes is
           rectangular and include one common cathode, two grids,
           two anodes and two shields. For the forward section,
           the distances from cathode to grid, grid to anode,
           and anode to shield were 44.0, 22.0 and 11.0 mm,
           respectively. For the backward section, they were
           18.0, 9.0 and 11.0 mm, respectively. The working gas
           of the ionization chamber was a Kr+2.89%CO2 mixture
           at pressure of 1.10 atm. High voltages for the
           cathode, grids and anodes were -1100, 0 and +900 V,
           respectively.
           (BF3)A BF3 long counter was used for neutron flux
           monitoring and normalization. The axis of the BF3
           long counter and the normal line of the electrodes of
           the gridded ionization chamber were at 0 degree to
           the beam line. The distance from the cathode of the
           ionization chamber to the center of the neutron
           source was 15.9 cm, and that from the front side of
           the moderator of the BF3 long counter to the neutron
           source was about 2.40 m.
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.940) The thicknesses of the forward and
           backward samples are 21.3 and 23.0 mu-g/cm2,
           respectively, and the diameter of both 10B samples is
           42.0 mm. Each 10B sample was vacuum evaporated on a
           circular tantalum backing 48.0 mm in diameter and 100
           um in thickness. The mass and the diameter of the 238U
           sample  were 7.85+-0.10 mg and 4.50 cm, and the
           enrichment of the 238U is 99.999%.

COMMENT    The cross section values of monitor reaction were
           provided and confirmed by author.
           This paper is first time to report the information of
           Leaking alpha. Usually, measure the Forward and
           Backward alpha and sum of those two part contribution
           as total (n,a) reaction. However, especially for the
           target is light nuclei, the contribution of Leaking
           alpha couldn't be ignored. As an example, the
           contribution of Leaking alpha is 15.6% at 4 MeV in this
           measurement.
