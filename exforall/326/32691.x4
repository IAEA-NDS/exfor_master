FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II intense neutron
           generator at Lanzhou University
SAMPLE     About 3 g of HfO2 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (>99.95% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.3 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium detector
           made in the People's Republic of China with a
           relative efficiency of 20% and an energy resolution
           of 3 keV at at 1332 keV gamma ray from Co-60.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in
           135 deg. accompanying alpha particle tube was at a
           distance of 119.7 cm from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out at
           the ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator at Lanzhou
           University and lasted about 22 h with a yield around
           0.8E11 to 2.4E11 n/s.

           The cross sections of monitor reaction were defined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference
           from "Physik Daten - Physics Data, Evaluation of Cross
           Sections for 14 Important Neutron-Dosimetry Reactions.

           wissenschaftlich-technische Information mbH, Federal
           Republic of Germany, No. 13-5 (1990)".
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 0.9 mg/cm2 thick. The effective source
           neutron energy at irradiation position was determined
           by the Nb/Zr method, and the uncertainty in the
           neutron energy at around 5 cm was estimated to
           be 200 keV from a consideration of the sample sizes,
           beam diameter of about 3-4mm, and the uncertainty in
           the Nb/Zr method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of the measurement.
           (ERR-S,0.1,15.) Counting statistics is between 0.1%
           and 15%.
           (MONIT-ERR) Standard cross sections uncertainty (1.%)
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) Detector efficiency (2%-3%)
           (ERR-2) Weight of sample (0.1%)
           (ERR-3) Self-absorption of gamma-ray (0.5%)
           (ERR-4,0.,5.) Coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays (0%-5%)
           (ERR-5,0.1,1.0) Uncertainties of irradiation, cooling
           and measuring times (0.1%-1.0%)
CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for gamma-ray
           attenuations, random coincidence (pile-up), dead time
           and fluctuation of neutron flux. The neutron fluence
           rate was monitored by the accompanying alpha-particle
           so that corrections were made for small variations in
           the yield.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data are taken from
           Table2 at page 147 in J,JRN,288,143-148,2011. And the
           monitor reaction data are taken from the page  147 in
           J,JRN,288,143-148,2011.
