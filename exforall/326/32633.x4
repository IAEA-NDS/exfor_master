TITLE      The absolute determination of cumulative yield of
           several nuclides from thermal neutron and fission
           spectrum neutron induced fission of U-235

SAMPLE     The U3O8 powder and metallic uranium were used as
           sample respectively, both diameter were 16 mm, the
           thickness was 0.2 mm for metallic uranium sample, the
           isotope component for both sample were as follows :
            U-234   1.1%
            U-235   90.2%
            U-236   0.3%
            U-238   8.4%
FACILITY   (REAC) Heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons from the horizontal hole of reactor.
           The neutron flux at the sample was about 1.0 x 10**5
           neutrons/cm2/sec. The fission spectrum neutron was
           produced by a convertor which was made of metallic
           uranium foil (90% for U-235,diameter 66 cm, weight
           150 grams) and irradiated by the thermal neutron beam.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           First,fission products were separated from the
           irradiated samples by radiochemistry method and
           weighed for the determination of the chemical yield.
           Then the gamma rays or beta particle from fission
           products were measured by using gamma
           spectrometer or beta measurement device respectively.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A double fission ionization chamber was used
           for measuring the fission rate of thick target.
           (NAICR) two Nai(Tl) single channel spectrometers were
           used for measuring the gamma rays from Mo-99 (Mo-99 to
           Tc-99m balance system).
           (GEMUC) two low-background beta devices were used for
           measuring the beta particles from Zr-95,Ce-144 and
           Nd-147. All devices have been calibrated by using
           different gamma and beta sources respectively.

CORRECTION The following corrections have been made:
           . 2-3% for extrapolating to zero discrimination
             threshold of pulse amplitude discrimination curve.
           . 2-3% for fission fragments self-absorption in
             the U-235 sample.
           . 0.1-1% for counting loss of counting system.
           . 1-2% for neutron flux stability during the
             irradiating period.
           . 0.3% for contribution of other isotopes
             fission.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total errors were given, it consists of
           . random error  due to thermal neutrons or fission
             spectrum neutrons
           . systematic error due to weight of thickness uranium
             target, fission rate measurement error and device
             efficiency calibration error
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 3 and 5 of j,HFH,vol.2,
           No.1,p.1,1980 for thermal and fission spectrum neutron
           respectively.
