FACILITY   (CCW) 200 kV Cockcroft Walton accelerator.
           (VDG) 2.5 MV Van De Graaff.
           (VDG,3CPRFUD) 3.0 MV Van De Graaff at Fudan Univ.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 0.03 and 0.12 to 0.50 MeV neutrons were gene-
           rated by the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction at 2.5 MV VDG.
           (P-T) 0.50 to 1.65 mev neutrons were generated by the
           T(p,n)He-3 reaction at 2.5 MV VDG and 1.60 to 2.20 MeV
           neutrons generated at 3.0 MV VDG.
           (D-D) 2.5 to 3.0 MeV neutrons were generated at the
           CCW and 3.0 to 5.6 MeV neutrons were generated at the
           2.5 MV VDG.
           (D-T) 14 to 15 MeV neutrons were generated at the CCW
           and 15 to 18 MeV neutrons at the 2.5 MV VDG.
SAMPLE     Uranium was electroplated on a platinum foil. The ura-
           nium layer was 26 mm in diameter, 200 micro-gram/cm2
           in thickness. The total weight was 1.103+-0.012 mg for
           the U-233 sample and 1.182+-0.018 mg for the U-235
           sample.The isotopic composition for uranium sample, as
           obtained by mass spectrographic analysis, was as
           follows:
           isotope    U-233 sample     U-235 sample
           u-233      99.0+-0.5
           u-234       0.4+-0.1         1.0+-0.1
           u-235       0.4+-0.1        90.5+-0.9
           u-238       0.2+-0.1         8.5+-0.8
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A back-to-back ionization chamber containing
           U-233 and U-235 samples and filled with 1 atoms argon
           and methane (5-10 percent) was used for fission event
           measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for
           . fission counts due to other fission isotopes in the
             U-233 and U-235 samples
           . fission fragments self-absorption in sample and
             momentum effect resulting from the nuclear recoil
             generated by neutron induced fission
           . interference neutrons from d(d,n) reaction in the
             t(d,n) neutron source.
           . background
           . scattering neutrons from target tube, target cooling
             water, and target backing
           . neutrons back-scatter by the platinum backing of
             fission sample, and neutron absorption in the wall
             and cadmium cover of ionization chamber
           . sterad and neutron beam angular distribution
MONITOR    Absolute measurement, neutron flux was determined with
           a hydrogen containing gaseous recoil proportional
           counter.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error was 5.0 and 5.1% for U-233 and
           U-235 respectively, the main error sources are as
           follows :
           - 1.1 and 1.5% for the weight of U-233 and
             U-235 sample respectively.
           - 0.6 and 0.4% for efficiencies of fission
             detection of U-233 and U-235 respectively
           - 0.04 and 0.1% for correction of fission counts
             due to other fission isotopes in the U-233 and U-235
             samples respectively.
           - 0.2% for correction of distance between
             sample and neutron source.
           - 3.0% for efficiency of neutron detection.
           - 2.0% for correction of fission fragments
             self-absorption in sample and momentum effect.
           - 3.0% for correction of neutron back-scatter
             by the platinum backing of fission sample, and
             neutron absorption in the wall and cadmium cover of
             ionization chamber.
           - 0.4% for correction of scattering neutrons
             from target tube, target cooling water and target
             backing.
           - 0.6% for correction of sterad and neutron
             beam angular distribution.
           (ERR-S) 1.0% for counting statistics of fission
             counts, background neutron fission counts and
             neutron counts.
