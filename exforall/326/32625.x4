FACILITY   (VDG) 2.5 MV Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 0.12 to 0.50 MeV neutrons
           (P-T) 0.50 to 1.65 MeV neutrons
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A back-to-back ionization chamber filled with
            1 atoms Ar and methane (5-10%)
           (PROPC) Hydrogeneous proportional counter for flux
            determination
CORRECTION Corrected for
           . fission counts due to other fission isotopes in the
             U-233 and U-235 samples
           . fission fragments self-absorption in sample and
             momentum effect resulting from the nuclear recoil
             generated by neutron induced fission
           . interference neutrons from D(d,n) reaction in the
             T(d,n) neutron source.
           . background
           . scattering neutrons from target tube, target cooling
             water, and target backing
           . neutrons back-scatter by the platinum backing of
             fission sample, and neutron absorption in the wall
             and cadmium cover of ionization chamber
           . sterad and neutron beam angular distribution
