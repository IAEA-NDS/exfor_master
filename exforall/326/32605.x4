FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) TRITIUM TITANIUM TARGET WAS USED.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED BY
           THE ASSOCIATED ALPHA PARTICLE METHOD.
DETECTOR   (PSSCN) POSITION-SENSITIVE NEUTRON DETECTOR CONSISTS
           OF A LONG CYLINDRICAL LIQUID SCINTILLATOR OF 100 CM IN
           LENGTH AND 5.3 CM IN INNER DIAMETER AND A
           PHOTOMULTIPLIER AT EACH END OF SCINTILLATOR.

CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE BY THE MONTE-CARLO METHOD FOR
           NEUTRON FLUX ATTENUATION

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  THE ERRORS GIVEN IN THE DATA TABLE
           ARE STATISTIC ERRORS ONLY.
           THE OTHER MAJOR SOURCES OF ERROR ARE AS FOLLOWS:
           5  PER-CENT   NON-UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF THE
                         COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM ETC.
           3  PER-CENT   NEUTRONS SMALL ANGLE SCATTERED FROM
                         THE SURFACE OF THE COLLIMATOR.
           LESS THAN 3 PER-CENT  THE SUM OF THE ERROR CAUSED BY
                         THE MONTE-CARLO CORRECTION, CORRECTION
                         FOR DEAD TIME OF ALPHA PARTICLE COUNTING
                         AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE NUMBER OF
                         NUCLEI IN SAMPLE.
           THE TOTAL ERRORS ARE 7 TO 10 PER-CENT IN VARIOUS
           ANGLES.
