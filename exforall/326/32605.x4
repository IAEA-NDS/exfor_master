INC-SOURCE (D-T) Tritium-titanium target was used.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) The neutron flux was determined by
            the associated alpha particle method.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Position-sensitive neutron detector consists
            of a long cylindrical liquid scintillator of 100 cm
            in length and 5.3 cm in inner diameter and a
            photomultiplier at each end of scintillator.

CORRECTION Corrections were made by the Monte-Carlo method for
            - neutron flux attenuation;
            - multiple neutron scattering;
            - finite geometry
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T,7.,10.) The total errors are 7 to 10% in
                           various angles
           (ERR-S) Only statistical error given in data tables
           The other major sources of error are as follows:
           (ERR-1) Non-uniform distribution of the collimated
                    neutron beam etc.  (5%);
           (ERR-2) Neutrons small angle scattered from the
                    surface of the collimator. (3%)
           (ERR-3,,3.) The sum of the error caused by the Monte-
                        Carlo correction, correction for dead
                        time of alpha particle counting and the
                        uncertainty of the number of nuclei in
                        sample.
