INC-SOURCE (D-T) Tritium-titanium target was used.
METHOD     (TOF,ASSOP) The neutron flux was determined by
           the associated alpha particle method.
DETECTOR   (PS) Position-sensitive neutron detector consists
           of a long cylindrical liquid scintillator of 100 cm in
           length and 5.3 cm in inner diameter and a
           photomultiplier at each end of scintillator.

CORRECTION Corrections were made by the Monte-Carlo method for
           neutron flux attenuation
           multiple neutron scattering
           finite geometry
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  The errors given in the data Table
           are statistic errors only.
           The other major sources of error are as follows:
           (ERR-1) 5%   non-uniform distribution of the
                         collimated neutron beam etc.
           (ERR-2) 3%   neutrons small angle scattered from
                         the surface of the collimator.
           (ERR-3,,3.) Less than 3%  the sum of the error caused
                         by the Monte-Carlo correction, correction
                         for dead time of alpha particle counting
                         and the uncertainty of the number of
                         nuclei in sample.
           (ERR-T,7.,10.)The total errors are 7 to 10% in various
                                             angles.
