SAMPLE     Enriched metallic uranium (more than 90% of
           U-235), 16mm diameter, weight (1.0-1.5) g/cm2
FACILITY   (REAC) Light-water swimming-pool reactor and
           heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Spontaneous fission neutrons of Cf-252 source used for
           measured reaction.The neutron intensity was 5. x 10**7
           neutrons/4Pi/sec, thermal neutrons from thermalizing
           column  used for thermal irradiation.
METHOD     (RVAL) The following formula were used:
           Y(x1)=r(x)*Y(x2)*(Y(S1)/Y(S2))
           R(x)=(a(x1)*a(S2))/(a(x2)*a(S1))
           here Y=absolute yield, a=decay rate,
                x=measured nuclide, S=standard nuclide,
                1=measured reaction, 2=standard reaction.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 130 cm2 high resolution coaxial Ge(Li)
           detector together with SCORPIO-3000 Multi Channel-
           Computer system used for fission products gamma ray
           spectrum measurement.The resolution (FWHM) was 2.0 keV
           at 1.332 MeV of Co-60,efficiency more than 30 percent.

           monitor 3 was evaluated by author.
CORRECTION Made for fission products of U-238 in the sample
           induced by fission neutrons and gamma rays
           self-absorption in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error including the errors of
           gamma peak and standard yield was given.

COMMENT    The R value measured in this paper was 1.025(1+-1.7%)
           together with the standard fission yields given in
           common Table. The measured Mo-99 cumulative yield was
           obtained.
