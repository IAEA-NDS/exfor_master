SAMPLE     Enriched metallic uranium (more than 90 percent of
           U-235), 16mm diameter, weight (1.0-1.5) g/cm2
FACILITY   (REAC) Light-water swimming-pool reactor and
           heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Spontaneous fission neutrons of Cf-252 sourec used for
           measured reaction.The neutron intensity was 5*E+7
           neutrons/4pi/sec, thermal neutrons from thermalizing
           column  used for thermal irradiation.
METHOD     (RVAL) The following formula were used:
           y(x1)=r(x)*y(x2)*(y(s1)/y(s2))
           r(x)=(a(x1)*a(s2))/(a(x2)*a(s1))
           here y=absolute yield, a=decay rate,
                x=measured nuclide, s=standard nuclide,
                1=measured reaction, 2=standard reaction.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 130 cm2 high resolution coaxial Ge(Li)
           detector together with Scorpio-3000 multi channel-
           computer system used for fission products gamma ray
           spectrum measurement.The resolution (fwhm) was 2.0 keV
           at 1.332 MeV of Co-60,efficiency more than 30 percent.

MONIT-REF  (,YANG YAN,J,CST,15,(4),483,8107) For monitor 1 and 2.
           Monitor 3 was evaluated by author.
CORRECTION Made for fission products of U-238 in the sample
           induced by fission neutrons and gamma rays
           self-absorption in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS Total error including the errors of gamma peak and
           standard yield was given.
STATUS     Data taken from J.HFH,VOL.7,NO.4,P.234,(1985).

COMMENT    The r value measured in this paper was 1.025(1+-1.7
           percent) together with the standard fission yields
           given in common table. The measured Mo-99 cumulative
           yield was obtained.
