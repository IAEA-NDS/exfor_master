TITLE      Yields of short-lived  fission products in the
            235U(nth,f)

REFERENCE  (J,ANS,49,209,1985)
FACILITY   (REAC,3CHFTHU)
SAMPLE     The 39% enriched uranium was irradiated in the 500W
            THOR facility in Taiwan
METHOD     (GSPEC,FISCT)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Samples was irradiated
ANALYSIS   Fission yields were obtained from measured photopeak
           areas and fission rates
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of CFY is counted as
            the square  root of th sum of square of individual
            error,ranging  from 9% to 37%.
