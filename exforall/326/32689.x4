FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
SAMPLE     (30-ZN-67,ENR=0.954)
           Two 67Zn samples were back-to-back as a set.
           The isotopic abundance of 67Zn sample material was
            95.4% and each sample was vacuum evaporated on a
            tantalum backing 4.8 cm in diameter and 50 micron
            in thickness.
           The mass and the thickness of the forward sample were
            9.864 mg and 680 ug/cm2.
           And those of the backward sample were 6.818 mg and
            470 ug/cm2.
           The abundance of the 238U isotope in the monitor sample
           was better than 99.999%. The diameter and mass of the
           238U sample were 4.50 cm and 7.85 +- 0.10 microgram,
           respectively.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin gridded ionization chamber were used as
            alpha particle detector. The distances from the
            cathode to grid, grid to anode, and anode to shield
            were 61.0, 18.0 and 12.0 mm, respectively.
           The working gas was Kr+2.89%CO2 and the pressure was
            1.30 atm.
           The high voltages for the cathode, grids and anodes
            were -1900, 0 and +1200 V, respectively.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
            monitor for each run normalization.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
           A 238U film sample was applied to determine the
           absolute neutron flux. It was placed at the forward
           direction of the 3rd position of the sample changer
           for fission fragments measurement.
MONIT-REF  (,,3,ENDF/B-VII.0,9237,2006)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuterium gas cell was 2.0 cm in length and
            0.9 cm in diameter with molybdenum film 5.0 micron
            in thickness.
           The deuterium gas pressure was 2.9-3.1 atm during
            experiments.
           The energy of accelerated deuteron beam before
            entering the molybdenum film were 3.281, 2.455 and
            1.790 MeV, respectively.
           From Monte Carlo simulation, the corresponding energy
            of produced neutrons on the sample were 6.0, 5.0 and
            4.0 MeV, with the energy spreads of 0.12, 0.16 and
            0.23 MeV.
