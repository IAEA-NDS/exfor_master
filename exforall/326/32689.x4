FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)Experiments were performed at the 4.5 MV
           Van de Graaff accelerator of Peking University, China.
SAMPLE     (30-Zn-67,ENR=0.954)Two 67Zn samples were back-to-
           back as a set. The isotopic abundance of 67Zn sample
           material was 95.4% and each sample was vacuum
           evaporated on a tantalum backing 4.8 cm in diameter
           and 50 micron in thickness. The mass and the thickness
           of the forward sample were 9.864 mg and 680
           microgram/cm2. And those of the backward sample were
           6.818 mg and 470 microgram/cm2.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)A twin gridded ionization chamber were used as
           alpha particle detector. The distances from the
           cathode to grid, grid to anode, and anode to shield
           were 61.0, 18.0 and 12.0 mm, respectively. The
           working gas was Kr+2.89%CO2 and the pressure was 1.30
           atm. The high voltages for the cathode, grids and
           anodes were -1900, 0 and +1200 V, respectively.
           (BF3)A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
           monitor for each run normalization.

MONIT-REF  (,,3,ENDF/B-VII.0,9237,2006)
COMMENT    A 238U film sample were applied to determine the
           absolute neutron flux. The abundance of the 238U
           isotope was better than 99.999%. The diameter and
           mass of the 238U sample were 4.50 cm and 7.85 +- 0.10
           microgram, respectively. It was placed at the forward
           direction of the 3rd position of the sample changer
           for fission fragments measurement.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)The deuterium gas cell was 2.0 cm in length and
           0.9 cm in diameter with molybdenum film 5.0 micron
           in thickness. The deuterium gas pressure was 2.9-3.1
           atm during experiments. The energy of accelerated
           deuteron beam before entering the molybdenum film were
           3.281, 2.455 and 1.790 MeV, respectively.
           From Monte Carlo simulation, the corresponding energy
           of produced neutrons on the sample were 6.0, 5.0 and
           4.0 MeV, with the energy spreads of 0.12, 0.16 and
           0.23 MeV.
