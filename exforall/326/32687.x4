FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 2 x 1.7 MV tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 7Li(p, n)7Be reaction to obtain 0.57 MeV
           neutron source, the thickness of LiF target is 1
           mg/cm2.
           (P-T) T(p, n)3He reaction to obtain 1.0 and 1.5 MeV
           neutron source, the thickness of Ti-T target is 5
           mg/cm2.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.902) Enriched metal U sample
           including 234U(1.1%), 235U(90.2%), 236U(0.3%) and
           238U(8.4%). The mass thickness of thick and thin
           sample (as standard sample in fission chamber) is 0.6-
           0.8 g/cm2 and 0.3-0.4 mg/cm2, and the diameter is 16
           mm. The metal U samples were enveloped by Al foil,
           and the sample backing Pt thickness is 0.10-0.15 mm.
METHOD     (ABSFY,EXTB) Absolute measurements of fission
           products 95Zr, 140Ba and 147Nd. The sample was
           irradiation at 2 x 1.7 MV tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
           1)The volume of HPGe detector is 110 cm3.
           2)For gamma energy 1332.5 keV from 60Co, the
           gamma-energy resolution FWHM is 1.8 keV.
           3)The uncertainty of efficiency is less than 2%.
ANALYSIS   Decay gamma spectrum area were determined with SPAN
           code.
CORRECTION 1) Correct gamma self-absorption  for thick sample
           2) To subtract the contamination from neutron which was
           from scattering and other production neutron reaction.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from Table 4 at page 324 in
           J,HFH,32,(6),321,2010.
