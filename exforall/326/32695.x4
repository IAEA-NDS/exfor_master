           Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)
SAMPLE     The natural nickel foils of 99.9% purity and
           0.5-0.7 mm thickness were made into circular samples
           with a diameter of 2.0 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial HPGe
           detector with a relative efficiency of around 68% and
           an energy resolution of around 1.69 keV FWHM at 1.33
           MeV gamma ray from Co-60. And the crystal geometry is
           70.1 x 72.3 mm in diameter and length.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiations were carried out at the K-400
           Intense Neutron Generator and lasted from 0.5 to 1 hour
           with a yield of about around 3E10 - 4E10 n/s.

           The cross section of monitor reaction were defined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference
           from "Physik Daten - Physics Data, Evaluation of Cross
           Sections for 14 Important Neutron-Dosimetry Reactions.

           wissenschaftlich-technische Information mbH, Federal
           Republic of Germany, No. 13-5 (1990)".
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick. The effective source
           neutron energy at irradiation position was determined
           by the (n, 2n) reaction ratio between Nb and Zr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty are mainly include the
           counting statistics, the detector efficiency, the
           self-absorbability of gamma-rays, the standard cross
           section, the weight of samples and the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays.
CORRECTION During irradiation, the neutron flux was monitored by
           accompanying alpha particles so that the corrections
           could be made for small variations in the yield. The
           self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma-energy,
           the coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays in
           the investigated nuclide and in the counting geometry
           were taken into account in data analysis, respectively.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor
           reaction data are taken from Table2 at page 644 in
           J,NIM/B,269,2011.
COMMENT    According to the contents of measurement, in Table1 1
           the reaction production nuclei decay information for
           61Ni(n, p) isn't 61mCo. It should be 61Co, and there
           are not exist isomeric state for 61Co.
