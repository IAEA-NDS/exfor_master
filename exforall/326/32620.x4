TITLE      The Nb-93(n,xp)reaction at En=14.6 MeV
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRHST) 150 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Metallic niobium sample,thickness=0.8 mm,
           purity=99.99 per-cent.
METHOD     (EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC,CSICR)
           The multi-telescope system consists of two-layer
           ring-shaped energy loss (delta E) detectors and a
           central CsI(Tl) energy detector.
           the outer detector (delta E1) consists of 32
           separate proportional counters used to obtain the
           energy signals of charged particles. the inner
           detector (delta E2) consists of 16 separate
           proportional counters, and its signals serve as one of
           the triple-coincidence signals.
              A 25 mm diam.* 1mm thickness CsI(Tl) crystal serves
           as the central energy detector.
              A mixture of 95 per-cent argon and 5 per-cent co2
           gas was used in this system. The system operates at a
           low gas pressure (100 mbar) and in the gas flow mode.
PART-DET   (P)
MONITOR    Absolute measurement.
ERR-ANALYS   The statistical error and all identified systematic
           errors are combined to obtain the total error.
             The total systematic error is 5.4 per-cent, it
           includes:
           3.3 per-cent for neutron flux
           1.0 per-cent for target thickness
           3.0 per-cent for solid angle of the central detector
           2.0 per-cent for de/dx value
           2.0 per-cent for data reduction procedure
             The statistical error is calculated according to
           the counts in individual energy bins.

STATUS     The double-differential proton emission spectra were
           measured for reaction angles from 33 to 159 deg, and
           proton energy from 4 to 14 MeV. From them the
           angle-integrated proton emission cross section, i.e.
           the energy spectra were obtained.
