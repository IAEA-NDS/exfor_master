INC-SOURCE (D-T) Effective average energy of deuteron beam about
                 125 keV and beam current about 20 mA, the
                 thickness of T-Ti target about 0.9 mg/cm2,
                 neutron yield about (1-2) x 10**12 neutrons/sec.
                 The neutron energies corresponding to the various
                 directions of the samples, with respect to the
                 deuteron beam axis, were determined by cross
                 section ratios of the Zr-90(n,2n)Zr-89 and
                 Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92m reactions.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Co-axial high-purity Germanium detector with
                  relative efficiency 20% and energy resolution
                  3 keV at 1.33 MeV for gamma ray detection.
                  The detector efficiency was calibrated with
                  the standard gamma source srm4275.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for
