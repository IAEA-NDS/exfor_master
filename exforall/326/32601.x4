                 125 KEV AND BEAM CURRENT ABOUT 20 MA , THE
                 THICKNESS OF T-TI TARGET ABOUT 0.9 MG/CM2,
                 NEUTRON YIELD ABOUT (1-2)*E+12 NEUTRONS/SEC.
                 THE NEUTRON ENERGIES CORRESPONDING TO THE VARIOUS
                 DIRECTIONS OF THE SAMPLES, WITH RESPECT TO THE
                 DEUTERON BEAM AXIS, WERE DETERMINED BY CROSS
                 SECTION RATIOS OF THE ZR-90(N,2N)ZR-89 AND
                 NB-93(N,2N)NB-92M REACTIONS.

                  DETECTION.
                  THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS CALIBRATED WITH
                  THE STANDARD GAMMA SOURCE SRM4275.
