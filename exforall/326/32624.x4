INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beam from the horizontal experimental
           hole incident into a NaCl(200) crystal monochromator.
           After Bragg diffraction by the monochromator, the
           0.0253 eV monochromatic neutron beam was obtained
           which passed through a simple chopper monochromator to
           reduce the higher-order diffracted neutrons component.
SAMPLE     Uranium was electroplated on a platinum foil. The
           uranium layer was 26 mm in diameter,400 micro-gram/cm2
           in thickness.The total weight was 2.1132 mg for the
           U-233 sample, 1.9983 mg for the U-235 sample(1) and
           2.1602 mg for the U-235 sample(2). The isotopic compo-
           sition for the uranium sample by mass spectrographic
           analysis was as follows:
           isotope  U-233 sample  U-235 sample(1)  U-235 sample(2)
           U-233    99.0+-0.5
           U-234    0.4 +-0.1     1.15+-0.10       1.0 +-0.1
           U-235    0.4 +-0.1     90.0+-0.9        90.5+-0.9
           U-236                  0.15+-0.10
           U-238    0.2 +-0.1     8.4 +-0.7        8.5 +-0.8
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A back-to-back ionization chamber filled with 1
           atoms argon (95.0%) and methane (5.0%), containing the
           U-233 and U-235 samples, was used for fission
           event measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied for
           . neutron flux attenuation due to passing through the
             ahead sample including the backing.
           . fission counts due to the minute quantity U-235 in
             the U-233 sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  The total error is 2.1 percent, it includes :
           (ERR-S) 0.25% for U-233 fission counting statistics
           (DATA-ERR) 0.25% for U-235 fission counting statistics
           (ERR-1) 1.10% for weight of U-233 sample
           (ERR-2) 1.50% for weight of U-235 sample
           (ERR-3) 0.80% for efficiency of U-233 fission
             detection
           (ERR-4) 0.40% for efficiency of U-235 fission
             detection
           (ERR-5) 0.20% for correction of neutrons flux
             attenuation due to passing through the ahead sample.
           (ERR-7,,0.1) less than 0.1% for correction of fission c
             due to the impurity element of U-235 in the U-233
             sample.
