FACILITY   (REAC) HEAVY-WATER REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beam from the horizontal experimental
           hole incident into a NaCl(200) crystal monochromator.
           After Bragg diffraction by the monochromator, the
           0.0253 eV monochromatic neutron beam was obtained
           which passed through a simple chopper monochromator to
           reduce the higher-order diffracted neutrons component.
SAMPLE     Uranium was electroplated on a platinum foil. The
           uranium layer was 26 mm in diameter,400 micro-gram/cm2
           in thickness.The total weight was 2.1132 mg for the
           U-233 sample, 1.9983 mg for the U-235 sample(1) and
           2.1602 mg for the U-235 sample(2). The isotopic compo-
           sition for the uranium sample by mass spectrographic
           analysis was as follows:
           Isotope  U-233 sample  U-235 sample(1)  U-235 sample(2)
           u-233    99.0+-0.5
           u-234    0.4 +-0.1     1.15+-0.10       1.0 +-0.1
           u-235    0.4 +-0.1     90.0+-0.9        90.5+-0.9
           u-236                  0.15+-0.10
           u-238    0.2 +-0.1     8.4 +-0.7        8.5 +-0.8
DETECTOR   (FISCH) A back-to-back ionization chamber filled with 1
           atoms argon (95.0 percent) and methane (5.0 percent),
           containing the U-233 and U-235 samples, was used for
           fission event measurement.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied for
           . neutron flux attenuation due to passing through the
             ahead sample including the backing.
           . fission counts due to the minute quantity U-235 in
             the U-233 sample.
ERR-ANALYS   The total error is 2.1 percent, it includes :
           - 0.25 percent for U-233 fission counting statistics
           - 0.25 percent for U-235 fission counting statistics
           - 1.10 percent for weight of U-233 sample
           - 1.50 percent for weight of U-235 sample
           - 0.80 percent for efficiency of U-233 fission
             detection
           - 0.40 percent for efficiency of U-235 fission
             detection
           - 0.20 percent for correction of neutrons flux
             attenuation due to passing through the ahead sample.
           - less than 0.1 percent for correction of fission count
             due to the impurity element of U-235 in the U-233
             sample.

           selected experimental data for U-235, published from
           1953 to 1973, was used as reference cross section.
