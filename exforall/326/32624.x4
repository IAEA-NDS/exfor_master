INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron beam from the horizontal experimental
            hole incident into a NaCl(200) crystal monochromator.
           After Bragg diffraction by the monochromator, the
            0.0253 eV monochromatic neutron beam was obtained
            which passed through a simple chopper monochromator
            to reduce the higher-order diffracted neutrons
            component.
SAMPLE     Uranium was electroplated on a platinum foil.
           The uranium layer was 26 mm in diameter, 400 ug/cm2
            in thickness.
           The total weight was
             2.1132 mg for the 233U sample,
             1.9983 mg for the 235U sample(1),
             2.1602 mg for the 235U sample(2).
           The isotopic composition for the samples by mass
            spectrographic analysis was as follows:

DETECTOR   (FISCH) Back-to-back ionization chamber filled with
            1 atom argon (95.0%) and methane (5.0%) containing
            the 233U and 235U samples
CORRECTION Corrected for
            - neutron flux attenuation due to passing through the
              ahead sample including the backing.
            - fission counts due to the 235U impurity in the 233U
              sample.
