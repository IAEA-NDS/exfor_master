SAMPLE     UO2(NO3)2 x 6H2O
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRIMP)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 300 keV deuteron beam bombarding the T-Ti target,
            neutron intensity was 2 x 10**11 neutrons/sec in
            general and 4.8 x 10**11 neutrons/sec for
            rotating T-Ti target.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
            First, fission products were separated from the
             irradiated sample by radiochemistry methods and
             weighed for the determination of the chemical yield.
            Then fission product gamma rays were measured with
             calibrated Ge(Li) detector.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Resolution was 8.0 keV for 1.332 MeV gamma ray
            of Co-60.
CORRECTION No information given

CORRECTION in order to obtain the cumulative yield of I-134,
           corrections were made for its precursor decay.

RESULT     (FRIND)
COMMENT    In order to convert the independent yield into
            fractional independent yield, it needs the mass yield,
            which were obtained from the cumulative yield measured
            by author and other published cumulative yield.
           In this subentry, for Br-82, the fractional independent
            yield (1.3+-0.3) x 10**(-4) was larger than the
            independent yield (7.5+-1.7)x 10**(-5) presented in
            above subentry (32634003).this seems unreasonable,so
            one of these two values should Be wrong. Unfortunately
            the compiler cannot contact with authors, so users
            should be careful when use the values for Br-82.
