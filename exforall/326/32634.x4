SAMPLE     UO2(NO3)2.6H2O
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 300 keV deuteron beam bombarding the T-Ti target,
           neutron intensity was 2*E+11 neutrons/sec in general
           and 4.8*E+11 neutrons/sec for rotating T-Ti target.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           First,fission products were separated from the
           irradiated sample by radiochemistry methods and weighed
           for the determination of the chemical yield. Then
           fission product gamma rays were measured with
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Resolution was 8.0 keV for 1.332 MeV gamma ray
           of Co-60.
CORRECTION No information given

COMMENT    In order to convert the independent yield into
           fractional independent yield, it needs the mass yield,
           which were obtained from the cumulative yield measured
           by author and other published cumulative yield.
           In this subentry, for Br-82, the fractional independent
           yield (1.3+-0.3)*E-4 was larger than the independent
           yield (7.5+-1.7)*E-5 presented in above
           subentry (32634003).This seems unreasonable,so one of
           these two values should be wrong. Unfortunately the
           compiler cannot contact with authors, so users should
           be careful when use the values for Br-82.
