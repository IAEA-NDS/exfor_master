SAMPLE     UO2(NO3)2 x 6H2O
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRIMP)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 300 keV deuteron beam bombarding the T-Ti target,
           neutron intensity was 2 x 10**11 neutrons/sec in
           general and 4.8 x 10**11 neutrons/sec for
             rotating T-Ti target.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           First,fission products were separated from the
           irradiated sample by radiochemistry methods and weighed
           for the determination of the chemical yield. Then
           fission product gamma rays were measured with
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Resolution was 8.0 keV for 1.332 MeV gamma ray
           of Co-60.
CORRECTION No information given

           corrections were made for its precursor decay.

COMMENT    in order to convert the independent yield into
           fractional independent yield, it needs the mass yield,
           which were obtained from the cumulative yield measured
           by author and other published cumulative yield.
           in this subentry, for Br-82, the fractional independent
           yield (1.3+-0.3) x 10**(-4) was larger than the
           independent yield (7.5+-1.7)x 10**(-5) presented in
           above subentry (32634003).this seems unreasonable,so
           one of these two values should Be wrong. Unfortunately
           the compiler cannot contact with authors, so users
           should be careful when use the values for Br-82.
