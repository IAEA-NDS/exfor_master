TITLE      Measurement of neutron capture cross section of Cr-50
           in the energy range from 50 to 1052 keV
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRSIU) 2.5 MV Van de Graaff at Sichuan
           University.
INC-SOURCE (P-T,P-LI7)
SAMPLE     Naturally metallic chromium powder were pressed into
           a disk with 20 mm in diameter, 1.5 mm in thickness and
           packed in Al film.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity Ge detector.
PART-DET   (G)
MONITOR    Absolute, the gold disk each of 20 mm in diameter and
           0.1 mm in thickness were used as the neutron flux
           measurement.
ERR-ANALYS The main uncertainties of the result are as follows:
           . efficiency error of gamma-ray full energy peak 2.5 %
           . counting statitics 1.2-2.2 %
           . decay schems 1.5 %
           . self-absorption correction 1.0 %
           . neutron scattering back-ground 0.5 %
           . sample weight 0.5 %
           . stadard cross section of gold 3.0-4.5 %
STATUS     The cross section data were taken from
           Comm.of Nucl.Data Prog. 28, 1, 2002
