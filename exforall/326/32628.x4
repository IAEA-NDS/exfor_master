SAMPLE     Uranium nitrate (natural Uranium)
FACILITY   (CCW) 600 kV Cockcroft Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
           Neutron flux about (1-2)*e+11 neutrons/4pi/sec,
           average neutron energy=14.7+-0.4 MeV
METHOD     (CHSEP,FPGAM)
           First, fission products were separated from the
           irradiated samples by radiochemistry methods and
           weighted for the determination of the chemical yield.
           Then fission product gamma rays were measured with
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector for determining the
           cumulative fission yield.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 140 cm3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector, resolution
           was 2.8 keV at 1.332 MeV of Co-60, together with a
           4096 channel analyser. The relative detection
           efficiency was calibrated using well know intensity
           gamma ray sources.

CORRECTION Made for the loss of photoelectrons due to cascade
           gamma rays coincidence and counting dead time.
ERR-ANALYS Errors given in the data table are total experimental
           errors, they contain mainly the detection efficiency,
           least-squares fit of gamma photoelectron peak, counting
           statistics, and correction for cascade gamma rays.

ANALYSIS   The data given below was the same experimental data
           as in Subent 2 but processed using another code GAMA81.
           These data are in agreement with the other published
           data better than the above subent (SUBENT 2).
