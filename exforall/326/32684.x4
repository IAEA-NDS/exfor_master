METHOD     (TOF,BCINT,PSD) The measured raw TOF spectra are
           included sample-in and sample-out to determine the
           background. The flight paths for 3 main detectors are
           609, 654 and 515 cm, respectively. To obtain absolute
           differential cross-section data, determined the
           neutron flux per area at the location of the bismuth
           target.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The 13MV HI-13 Tandem Accelerator in
           China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE).
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Three main detectors ST-451 10.4 x 5.0 cm in
           diameter and thickness were used. Each detector was
           well collimated and massively shielded. For the
           measurements at angles less than 30 deg., only one
           detector was used because of the difficulty of
           shielding from the primary neutrons.
CORRECTION The corrections due to the finite-geometry sample
           size effects, flux attenuation, multiple scattering,
           etc., were made with Monte Carlo simulation.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The 4-MHz pulsed deuteron beam was provided by
           the HI-13 tandem accelerator. The deuteron beam
           current delivered to the tritium gas target was 2.5
           microampere. Tritium gas target contains tritium gas
           cell and helium gas cell, which is a stainless-steel
           cylinder.
            1)Tritium gas cell: 4.6 x 1.2 cm in length
           and diameter, and has a wall thickness of 0.2mm. The
           cell was sealed by a Mo foil of 15 mg/cm2 and by two
           O-rings, one made of indium and the other of rubber.
           Golden backing was used as a beam stop and as a
           liner. The gas pressure is 2.2 atm.
            2)Helium gas cell: It is located upstream in the beam
           line in relation to the tritium cell. 2.3 x 1.2 cm in
           length and diameter, the thickness of entrance Mo foil
           is 10 mg/cm2. The gas pressure is 0.2 atm.
INC-SPECT   1)The time resolution of the TOF spectrometer, which
            was estimated to be no greater than 2.5 ns;
            2)The diameter of the 209Bi sample (2.5 cm) causes a
            time spread of about 0.3 ns;
            3)The thickness of the detectors (5.0 cm) contributes
            about 0.6 ns to the time spread;
SAMPLE     Metallic Bi was placed 20 cm away from the center of
           the tritium gas target:
           1)lab angles theta greater than 26 degree: 25 x 35 mm
           cylinder;
           2)lab angles theta less than 26 degree: 15 x 35 mm
           cylinder;
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty;
           (ERR-1,4.,20.) The statistical uncertainties were
           4%-9% and 10%-20% for the angle range 11 to 70 deg.
           and 75 to 160 deg., respectively;
           (ERR-2,,1.) The statistical uncertainty was less than
           1% at 0 deg. measurement;
           (ERR-3,,2.) The uncertainty of the dead-time
           correction;
           .The uncertainty of scattering angle is less
            than 0.2 deg.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from Table 1 in page 4 of
           J,PR/C,82,024601,2010.
