SAMPLE     (30-ZN-67,ENR=0.954) Two 67Zn samples were back-to-
            back as a set.
           The mass and the thickness of the forward sample were
            9.864 mg and 680 ug/cm2.
           The mass and the thickness of the backward sample were
            6.818 mg and 470 ug/cm2.
           Each sample was vacuum-evaporated on a tantalum
            backing of 4.8 cm in diameter and 50 um in thickness.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin gridded ionization chamber composed of
            two symmetric sections with a common cathod was used
            as charged-particle detector.
           The shape of the chamber is cylindrical, with diameter
            28.2 cm and height 27.2 cm, and the thickness of the
            stainless-steel wall is 2.0 mm.
           The chamber has one cathode, two grids, two anodes and
            two shields.
           The shape of the electrodes is rectangular.
           The cathode and the anode are aluminum boards coated
            with tungsten layer, and the grid was composed of
            parallel tungsten wires coated  with gold 0.10 mm in
            diameter and 2.0 mm in spacing.
           The distances from the cathode to the grid, the grid
            to the anode, and the anode to the shield were 44.0,
            22.0 and 11.0 mm respectively.
           The working gas was Kr+2.89%CO2 and the pressure was
            1.85 atm.
           The high voltages for the cathode, the grids and the
            anodes were -2000, 0 and +1600 V, respectively.
           (FISCH) A small parallel plate 238U fission chamber
            placed between the gridded ionization chamber and the
            gas target was used for absolute neutron flux
            determination.
           The abundance of the 238U isotope was better than
            99.997%.
           The diameter and mass of the 238U sample were 2.0 cm
            and 547.2 (1+-1.3%) ug, respectively.
           The working gas of the fission chamber was a flowing
            Ar+3.73%CO2 gas with pressure slightly higher than
            1.0 atm.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
            monitor.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,,3,ENDF/B-VII.0,9237,2006)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuterium gas cell was 2.0 cm in length and
            0.9 cm in diameter with 5.0 micron molybdenum film
            as window and fresh gold foil as beam stop.
           The deuterium gas pressure was 2.9-3.1 atm during
            experiment.
           The deuteron beam energy before entering the
            molybdenum film was 3.26 MeV.
           From Monte Carlo simulation the average energy of
            deuterons in the gas cell was 2.74 MeV, and the
            corresponding energy of produced neutrons was 6.0 MeV.
           The neutron source intensity was about 3.3E+8 neutrons
            per second.

CORRECTION The final cross-section was already corrected for the
            attenuation of the neutron flux through the 2 mm
            thick stainless wall of the ionization chamber using
            the total neutron cross-section of 56Fe in the
            ENFD/B-VII.0 library.
