DETECTOR   (GELI) A 40 cm3 coaxial Ge-Li detector with resolution
           3.0 keV for 1332 kev gamma-ray of Co-60 was used for
           gamma-ray measurement.
           The efficiency of the detector for full energy peak
           and double escape peak was calibrated prior to the
           measurement.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement, the neutron fluence was
           determined by associated alpha-particle counting with
           an Au-Si surface barrier detector at 90 degree.
CORRECTION corrections applied for
            . gamma-ray peak area
            . neutron fluence on sample
            . efficiency of ge-li detector
            . nuclei number in sample
            . multi-scattering and attenuation of neutrons in
              sample
            . gamma-ray self-absorption in sample
ERR-ANALYS   The total error is 10 per-cent (not include the
           statistical error for peak area),
           main error sources are as follows:
            . 1 per-cent absorption of neutrons by target,
              target backing and cooling water etc.
            . 1 per-cent dead time of time amplitude converter.
            . 3 per-cent back-ground without sample
            . 1 per-cent time-window for gamma-ray
            . 1 per-cent distance between the sample
              and detector.
            . 4 per-cent angle between the sample and incident
              neutron direction
            . 3 per-cent ununiformity of sample thickness and the
              solid angle subtended by the target at sample.
            . 5 per-cent calculation processing of peak area
            . 4 per-cent efficiency of detector
            . 2 per-cent multi-scattering and self-absorption of
              neutrons
            . 1 per-cent gamma-ray self-absorption in sample
SAMPLE     Pure metallic lead disk diameter=130 mm,
           thickness=6 and 10 mm; bismuth disk diameter=100 mm
           thickness=10 mm
