FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff
SAMPLE     (60-ND-143,ENR=0.835)
            143Nd(2)O(3) were 4.077 and 3.875 mg/cm2 thick for
             forward (0-90 deg) and backward (90-180 deg) alpha
             events, respectively, and the diameter of both
             samples was 10.8 cm.
            The backings of the samples were 0.005 inch thick
             aluminum.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 long counter as a neutron flux monitor
           (IOCH) The twin gridded ionization chamber,
             comprised of two symmetric sections with common
             cathode.
            The outer wall of the chamber was an aluminum
             cylinder, 29.0 x 37.0 cm in height and diameter,
             with 2.0 mm thick walls.
            The cathode, grids, and anodes were rectangular.
            The grids consisted of parallel tungsten wires,
             coated with gold, which were 0.10 mm in diameter
             and spaced 2.0 mm apart.
            The effective grid area was 16 x 18 cm2.
            Distances from the cathode to grid and from the grid
             to anode were 75 and 20 mm, respectively.
            A mixture of Kr+2.89% CO2 was used as the working gas
             for the ionization chamber.
            A gas pressure is 1.90 atm for present measurement.
            The high voltages for the cathode, grid and anode
             were -3000, 0 and 1500 V, respectively.
           (FISCH) Neutron flux determination
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            Absolute neutron flux was determined by a small
             parallel plate 238U fission chamber.
            The abundance of the 238U sample was better than
             99.997%.
            The mass of the 238U sample was 547.2 +/- 7.1 ug,
             the diameter was 2.0 cm.
            The working gas fission chamber is flowing Ar+2.85%
             CO2 gas at a pressure slightly higher than 1.0 atm.
MONIT-REF  (,,3,ENDF/B-VII.0,9237,2006)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuterium gas target were used for production
             neutron.
            The diameter and the length of the cylindrical gas
             cell were 0.9 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
            The incident window Mo foil is 5.0 um in thickness.
            The gas pressure was between 2.9 and 3.1 atm during
             experiment.
PART-DET   (A) Alphas
CORRECTION The final cross sections were corrected for
            attenuation of the neutron flux through the 2 mm
            thick aluminum wall of the ionization chamber.
           Using the total neutron cross section of aluminum in
            ENDF/B-VII.0, this correction factor was calculated
            to be 0.971, 0.972 and 0.975 for 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 MeV
            neutrons, respectively.
