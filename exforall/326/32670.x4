SAMPLE     About 3g of Dy2O3 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (>99.99% pure)was pressed at 10ton/cm2,
           and a pellet,0.2cm thick and 2.0cm in diameter,was
           obtained.Three such pellets were prepared.

            5cm was estimated to be 200keV from a consideration
            of the sample sizes,d+ beam diameter of about 3-4mm,
            and the uncertainty in the Nb/Zr method

COMMENT    By author:
            Standard cross-sections uncertainties is 0.45%.
            The value printed in p1894 (1%) is a misprint.
CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for gamma-ray attenuations,
           random coincidence(pile-up), deadtime and fluctuation
           of neutron flux.
