INC-SOURCE (D-D) Fast neutrons were produced through the
           D(d,n)3He reaction with a deuterium gas cell, 2.0 cm
           in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The gas cell was
           separated from the beam-line vacuum by a molybdenum
           foil 5.0 mu-m in thickness. The deuterium gas
           pressure was 3.1-2.9 atm. The total neutron source
           intensity was about 3.1x10**8/s.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A two-section gridded ionization chamber was
           used as the charged particle detector. Distances
           from the cathode to grid and from the grid to anode
           were 75 and 18 mm, respectively. The working gas
           mixture was Kr+2.85%CO2,the pressures of the working
           gas was 2.0 atm.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
           monitor. The distance between the gas cell and the
           detector was about 3.0 m.
PART-DET   (A)Alphas
SAMPLE     (62-SM-149,ENR=0.946) Two circular 149Sm2O3 samples
           (The diameters of both were 11.5 cm, the thicknesses
           of the forward and backward were 0.739 and 1.236
           mg/cm2)placed back-to-back on the cathode of the
           ionization chamber. The aluminum backings foils were
           0.10 mm in thickness.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) Taken from the ENDF/B-VII.0.
           The absolute neutron flux was determined by a small
           parallel plate 238U fission chamber.
