INC-SOURCE (D-D) Fast neutrons were produced through the
             D(d,n)4He reaction with a deuterium gas cell, 2.0 cm
             in length and 0.9 cm in diameter.
            The gas cell was separated from the beam-line vacuum
             by a molybdenum foil 5.0 um in thickness.
            The deuterium gas pressure was 3.1-2.9 atm.
            The total neutron source intensity was about
             3.1x10**8/s.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A two-section gridded ionization chamber was
             used as the charged particle detector.
            Distances from the cathode to grid and from the grid
             to anode were 75 and 18 mm, respectively.
            The working gas mixture was Kr+2.85%CO2, the
             pressure of the working gas was 2.0 atm.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux
             monitor.
            The distance between the gas cell and the detector
             was about 3.0 m.

SAMPLE     (62-SM-149,ENR=0.946)
            Two circular 149Sm2O3 samples (The diameters of both
             were 11.5 cm, the thicknesses of the forward and
             backward were 0.739 and 1.236 mg/cm2) placed back-
             to-back on the cathode of the ionization chamber.
            The aluminum backings foils were 0.10 mm in thickness.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            The absolute neutron flux was determined by a small
             parallel plate 238U fission chamber.
