FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRAEP) 600 kV Neutron Generator
DETECTOR   (HPGE,SIBAR) The diameter of the sensitive area for
           the HPGe detector is 60 mm. The Au-Si surface
           barrier detector used in the 155 degree accompanying
           alpha particles tube was at a distance of 195 cm from
           the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The thickness of the solid tritium-titanium(T-Ti)
           target is 1.0 mg/cm2,
