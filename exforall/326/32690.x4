FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator at Chinese
           Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)
SAMPLE     About 3 g of Lu2O3 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (>99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out at
           the K-400 Neutron Generator and lasted 128 min with a
           yield around 4E10 to 5E10 n/s.

           The cross sections of monitor reaction were determined
           by interpolation of the evaluated values of the
           reference as "Physik Daten - Physics Data, Evaluation
           of Cross Sections for 14 Important Neutron-Dosimetry

           Information mbH, Federal Republic of Germany,
           No. 13-5 (1990)".
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick. The effective source
           neutron energy at irradiation position was determined
           by the Nb/Zr method, and the uncertainty in the
           neutron energy at around 3 to 5 cm was estimated to
           be 200 keV from a consideration of the sample sizes,
           beam diameter of about 3-4 mm, and the uncertainty in
           the Nb/Zr method.

CORRECTION The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections were made for small
           variations in the yield. The self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays in the investigated
           nuclide and in the counting geometry were taken into
           account in data analysis, respectively.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor
           reaction data are taken from Table2 at page 1695 in
           J,ANE,38,2011.
