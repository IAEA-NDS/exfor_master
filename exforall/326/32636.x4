SAMPLE     Analytically pure thorium nitrate, weight 800 mg for
           measurement by using direct gamma ray spectrometry,
           and 6 grams for measurement by using chemical
           separation followed by gamma ray spectrometry.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRIMP) 600 kV Cockcroft Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron intensity 2. x 10**11 neutrons/sec
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector volume: 60cm3;resolution (FWHM)
           was 2.0 keV at 1332 keV gamma ray for Co-60. The
           efficiency was calibrated with a series of standard
           gamma sources provided by China Institute of Atomic
           Energy.
METHOD     (FPGAM) The direct gamma ray spectrometry method was
           used for measuring most fission products in this work.
           (CHSEP,GSPEC) For the long half-life fission products
           Ru-103,Ru-106,Sb-125 and Cs-137. the yields were
           determined by chemical separation followed by gamma
           ray spectrometry.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma self-absorption in the
           sample. In the gamma energy range of considered
           fission products, the correction factor was 0.89-1.0.
DECAY-DATA The decay data given below were used for calculating
           the fission yields. This list includes the fission
           products measured and their precursors.
