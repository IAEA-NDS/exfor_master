INSTITUTE  (3CPRPDU) Pingdingshan University
           (3CPRLNZ) Lanzhou University
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
           at Lanzhou University.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The thickness of the tritium-titanium(T-Ti)
           target used in the generator was 1.35 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A coaxial HPGe detector were used to detect
           gamma ray from residual nucleus. The sensitive
           volume of HPGe is 110 cm3.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) the total uncertainty

            (2-3%)

           (ERR-4) self-absorption of gamma-ray (1.%)
           (ERR-5,1.,1.1) the coincidence sum effect of cascade
            gamma-rays (1.0-1.1%),
           (ERR-6,1.,1.2) sample geometry (1-1.2%)
           (ERR-7,0.1,1.) the uncertainties of irradiation
            cooling and measuring times (0.1-1%)
CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption in
            the sample, for gamma-gamma coincidence summing
            effects, for fluctuation of the neutron flux during
            the irradiation and for sample geometry.

REACTION   (39-Y-89(N,G)39-Y-90-M,,SIG)
SAMPLE     The natural Y2O3 powder of 99.99% purity was compressed
           into a disk 20 mm in diameter and 3.52-5.44 mm in
           thickness, which was then sandwiched between 0.28-0.36
           mm thick niobium foils (purity better than 99.99%) of
           the sample diameter, finally wrapped in 1 mm thick
           cadmium foil.
