            Another measurement of the same reaction.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The length of the deuterium gas cell was 1.80 cm.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Double-section gridded ionization chamber was
           used as the alpha particles detector, two 149Sm2O3
           samples were attached back to back on the common
           cathode.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used to monitor the
           neutron flux.
           (FISCH) Absolute neutron flux was determined using the
           small 238U fission chamber by counting the fission
           fragments.
SAMPLE     (62-SM-149,ENR=0.946) Sample material was 149Sm2O3,and
           the purity was 99.96%. The thicknesses of the forward
           and backward samples were 4.72 and 3.97 mg/cm2,
           respectively, and the diameter of both samples were
           11.5 cm.
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.99997) Sample material was 238U3O8.
           The thickness and diameter of the 238U sample were
           0.174 mg/cm2 (238U only) and 2.0 cm.
METHOD     (FLUX)
PART-DET   (A,FF) Alpha particles and fission fragments.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of the cross sections
                   including the uncertainty of monitor reaction
                   cross sections.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of the number of alpha events are
                   come from:
                   1) Counting statistics of the alpha counts
                   above the threshold is 4.5-9%;
                   2) Threshold location is 6%;
                   3) The uncertainty is 20-25% for the fraction
                   of alpha events below threshold in total alpha
                   events.
           (ERR-2) 238U fission counts
           (ERR-3) Ratio of neutron fluxes
           (ERR-4) Number of atoms in the 149Sm samples
           (ERR-5) Number of atoms in the 238U samples
           (MONIT-ERR) 238U fission cross section
