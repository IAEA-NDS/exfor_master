TITLE      The absolute determination of cumulative yields of
           several nuclides from 14.9 MeV neutron-induced fission
           of U-238

SAMPLE     Metallic uranium foil, diameter=16 mm,
           weight=600-800 mg.
FACILITY   (CCW) 600 KV Cockcroft Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 250 keV deuteron beam bombarding T-Ti target,
           thickness=0.8-1.6 mg/cm2, neutron intensity=(2-20)*e+9
           neutrons/sec.
METHOD     (RCHEM)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Double fission ionization chamber was used for
           fission rate absolute measurement.
           (NAICR,GEMUC) the NaI(Tl) crystal detector was used for
           gamma detection and low-background 2pi beta counter
           was used for beta detection.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement
DECAY-DATA No information given
PART-DET   (G,B)
ERR-ANALYS Total error was given, it consists of:
           . accidental error (statistical error) and
           . systematic error (2.1-3.7 percent) which mainly
             including the detector efficiency error
             (1.5-3.3 percent) and fission rate measurement error
             (1.5 percent). The errors due to the correction for
             fission yield contributed by the experimental hall
             scattering neutrons and d-d neutrons and sample
             weight determination as well as the decay constant
             can be neglected.
CORRECTION Correction was made for fission induced by low energy
           neutrons which were from experimental hall scattering
           and d-d reaction.
STATUS     Data taken from table 3 of J,HFH,VOL.2,NO.4,P.193,8011.
