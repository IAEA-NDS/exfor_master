TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS PER FISSION FOR
            CF-252-
FACILITY   .NOT RELEVANT.
INC-SOURCE .NONE.
SAMPLE     .THIN (LESS THAN 0.25 MG/CM-SQ) FOIL ON 0.005 CM THICK
            PLATINUM BACKING.
METHOD     (MANGB) MANGANESE BATH TO MEASURE ABSOLUTE NEUTRON
                   EMISSION RATE.
                   FISSION FRAGMENT COUNTING TO DETERMINE FISSION
                   RATE.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) FISSION FRAGMENTS DETECTED IN SILICON SURFACE
                   BARRIER DETECTOR, BIASSED TO 25 MEV.
STATUS     (NDD  ) FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (791129T)
           (800110E)
CORRECTION .NO CORRECTION FOR BACKSCATTERING FROM PLATINUM WAS
            MADE BUT A CONTRIBUTION OF 0.5 PERCENT WAS ADDED TO
            THE FINAL ERROR TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY.
ERR-ANALYS .NEUTRON MEASUREMENT INCLUDED COUNTING STATISTICS
            (0.2 PERCENT, STANDARD DEVIATION) AND SYSTEMATIC
            ERRORS IN CROSS-SECTION RATIOS (0.25), COUNTER
            EFFICIENCY (0.30), FAST NEUTRON ESCAPE (0.02), FAST
            NEUTRON LOSSES DUE TO CHARGED PARTCLE REACTIONS
            (0.10), NEUTRON CAPTURE IN SOURCE CONTAINER (0.05),
            MANGANESE RESONANCE CAPTURE (0.10)- ALL IN PERCENT.
           .FISSION MEASUREMENT INCLUDED COUNTING STATISTICS
            (0.2 PERCENT, STANDARD DEVIATION) AND SYSTEMATIC
            ERRORS IN SOLID ANGLE (0.15), BACKSCATTERING (0.50),
            UNCERTAINTY IN TIME DISTRIBUTION OF CF-252 LOSS DUE
            TO SELF-TRANSFER (0.40)- ALL IN PERCENT.
           .OTHER SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WERE UNCERTAINTY IN DELAYED
            NEUTRON FRACTION (+0.03 PERCENT), CHEMICAL AND
            ISOTOPIC PURITY (0.1 PERCENT).
           .TOTAL ERROR 0.3 PERCENT (RANDOM), 0.79 PERCENT
            (SYSTEMATIC).
