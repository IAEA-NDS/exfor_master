TITLE      -Measurement of the number of neutrons per fission for
            Cf-252-
SAMPLE      Thin (less than 0.25 mg/cm**2) foil on 0.005 cm thick
            platinum backing.
METHOD     (MANGB) Manganese bath to measure absolute neutron
                   emission rate in NPL .
           (ABSFY) Fission fragment counting to determine fission
                   rate.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Fission fragments detected in silicon surface
                   barrier detector, biassed to 25 MeV.
           (IOCH) Two 2-pi counters - gridded ion chamber filled
            with argon/10% methane and parallel plate ionization
            chamber filled with xenon/10% carbon dioxide- to
            measure the fraction of fragments backscattered from
            platinum backing.
EXP-YEAR   (1966)
STATUS     (NDD) From NEUDADA.
CORRECTION .No correction for backscattering from platinum was
            made but a contribution of 0.5 % was added to the
            final error to allow for the possibility.

ANALYSIS   Measured neutron output and the measured fission rate
           give a value for the average total number of neutrons
           per fission. Allowing ASSUM value of delayed neutron
           per fission, the average number of prompt neutrons per
           fission was obtained.
