AUTHOR     (P.A.Egelstaff)
TITLE      -The operation of a thermal neutron time-of-flight
            spectrometer-
FACILITY   (CHOPS) Slow chopper.
            Rotating laminated Cd-Al shutter.Double-sided mirror
            attached to shutter. P.E. cell trigger.
            Observed gate lengths were constant to 0.5% over
            period of 1 hour.Average motor speed was constant to
            at least 0.5%.
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal column of the Bepo reactor. Collimated.
            Modified bismuth filter.
INC-SPECT   Maxwellian distribution function was fitted to short
            wavelength side of spectrum. Long wavelength side is
            increased relative to short one. Discontinuity in
            spectrum at 4 Angstrom is due to 1001-planes in
            graphite. For neutron wavelengths > 6 Angstrom an
            additional short length of filter material was placed
            outside the pile shield.
            Density spectrum is smooth Maxwellian distribution.
SAMPLE      Gold plates of thickness 0.992,0.950,0.954 and 0.948
            gm/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight. 358 cm and 204 cm path lengths.
           (TRN) Transmissions of combinations of four gold
            plates for measurement at energy range 0.001 eV to
            0.1 eV.
            Three sources of background were considered:
            - stray neutrons coming from all directions, reduced
             by B4C and paraffin wax shield,
            - epi-cadmium neutrons in beam, only slightly
              attenuated by shutter,
            - neutrons scattered by collimating slits, shutter
              and samples.
            Shutter was set running at synchronous speed and all
            pulses from detector were recorded for two-minute with
            sample in beam and then with it out.
            Test of spectrum and counting rate at 300 micro-sec/m
           -a. for normal condition,
           -b. with graphite block reduced intensity by factor
            about 15,
           -c. with boron glass plate reduced intensity by same
            factor, changing spectrum to give factor 4 between
            the counting rates in first and last channels,
            showed that various measurements agree better than 1%.
DETECTOR   (BF3) BF3 proportional counter as neutron detector.
            7 cm diameter cylinder filled to pressure of 30 cm Hg
            with natural BF3.
PART-DET   (N) Neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Error in measured velocity from 0.5 to 0.25 %
            due to four causes:
           (ERR-2) motor hunting,
           (ERR-3) error in measurement of gate length,
                   error in angular delay,
                   gate and counter triggering.
            Uncertainty in measurement of path length was assumed
            to be negligible.
           (DATA-ERR) Fluctuations of measured values were mainly
            statistical, it was established by analysis of
            measurement on gold.
CORRECTION  Small correction to counting rate to allow for the
            departure from exact proportionality of counter
            efficiency to time-of-flight.
            Correction for shutter and air transmission.
            For background.
