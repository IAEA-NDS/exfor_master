TITLE      -A MEASUREMENT OF THE RADIATIVE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION
            OF GOLD AT AN ENERGY OF 966 KEV-
FACILITY   .NONE.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) NA-BE PHOTONEUTRON SOURCE CONSTRUCTED AT AWRE.
                   SOURCE CONSISTED OF 2 CM DIAMETER SPHERE OF
                   NA-F WITH A 3 CM THICK CLOSELY FITTING SHELL
                   OF BERYLLIUM.
SAMPLE     .MATCHED PAIRS OF THIN HEMISPHERICAL SHELLS WITH THIN
            NICKEL BACKINGS FOR STRENGTH. SHELLS 3 AND 4 CM IN
            RADIUS, GOLD 0.019 MM THICK, BACKINGS 0.05 CM THICK.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4-PI BETA COUNTER, CALIBRATED BY IRRADIATING
                   SAMPLE FOILS IN GLEEP REACTOR AND USING A
                   4-PI BETA/GAMMA COINCIDENCE COUNTER.
           (NAICR) TWO NAI(TL) WELL CRYSTALS TO COUNT DECAY
                   GAMMAS. CALIBRATION USING GOLD SOLUTIONS
                   STANDARDISED BY 4-PI BETA/GAMMA COUNTING.
PART-DET   (B    ) BETAS.
           (DG   ) DECAY GAMMAS.
STATUS     (NDD  ) FROM NEUDADA.

CORRECTION .CORRECTION FACTOR TO ALLOW FOR THE FACT THAT THE
            NEUTRONS ARE NOT MONOENERGETIC AND DO NOT PASS
            THROUGH THE GOLD SHELLS NORMALLY CALCULATED BY MONTE-
            CARLO METHOD. CORRECTION FACTOR 1.028+-0.005 FOR THE
            SMALLER SHELL, 1.025+-0.005 FOR THE LARGER.
           .BACKGROUND DUE TO SCATTERING IN THE GOLD SHELLS AND
            NICKEL BACKINGS, IN THE CADMIUM-GOLD LINED SHELL, AND
            ROOM AND AIR SCATTERED BACKGROUNDS CORRECTED USING
            THE METHODS OF RYVES+,J.NUCL.ENERGY,20,(1966),249.
            CORRECTION 2.1+-0.5 PERCENT FOR THE 3 CM DIAMETER
            SPHERE, 2.7+-0.5 PERCENT FOR THE 4 CM SPHERE.
           .ALUMINIUM CAN SURROUNDING THE SAMPLE GAVE ADDITIONAL
            ACTIVITY OF 0.2 AND 0.4 PERCENT FOR THE SMALLER AND
            LARGER SHELLS RESPECTIVELY.
           .CORRECTION FOR RESONANCE SELF-SHIELDING NEGLIGIBLE.
           .CORRECTION MADE FOR INELASTIC SCATTERING OF SOURCE
            NEUTRONS FROM THE SOURCE STRUCTURE.
           .CORRECTION FOR COMPTON SCATTERING OF SOURCE GAMMAS
            TO ENERGIES ABOVE THE BE PHOTO-THRESHOLD, YIELDING
            NEUTRONS BELOW 966 KEV. CORRECTION 2.0+-0.5 PERCENT
            FOR BOTH SPHERES.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) QUADRATIC ADDITION OF FOUR 0.5 PERCENT
            SYSTEMATIC ERRORS TO GIVE TOTAL OF 1 PERCENT.
           (ERR-S) RANDOM ERROR.
           (ERR-T) TOTAL ERROR.
