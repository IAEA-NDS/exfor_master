TITLE      -A Measurement Of The Radiative Capture Cross Section
            Of Gold At An Energy Of 966 keV-
FACILITY   .NONE.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Na-be Photoneutron Source Constructed At AWRE.
                   Source Consisted Of 2 Cm Diameter Sphere Of
                   Na-F With A 3 cm Thick Closely Fitting Shell
                   Of Beryllium, encased in 0.3mm thick stainless
                   steel shield.
INC-SPECT   1.067E+07 +- 0.5% n/sec at start of gold irradiation
             was determinded by MANGB technique.
SAMPLE     .Matched Pairs Of Thin Hemispherical Shells With Thin
            Nickel Backings For Strength. Shells 3 And 4 cm In
            Radius, Gold 0.019 mm Thick, Backings 0.05 cm Thick.
            After irradiation separated gold prepared in form of:
           - discs 1.905cm diameter, 0.0125 cm thick -for PROPC
            counter measurement,
           - liquid samples for NAICR Measurement.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation of samoles.
           (COINC) 4pi-beta-gamma coincidence counting for
             calibration.
           (MANGB) Two separate determinations of source strength
           were made using the manganese bath technique.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4-pi Beta Counter, Calibrated By Irradiating
                   Sample Foils In GLEEP Reactor And Using A
                   4-pi Beta/Gamma Coincidence Counter.
           (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) Well Crystals To Count Decay
                   Gammas. Calibration Using Gold Solutions
                   Standardised By 4-pi Beta/Gamma Counting.
PART-DET   (B)     Betas.
           (DG)    Decay Gammas.
STATUS     (NDD)   From NEUDADA.
CORRECTION .Correction Factor To Allow For The Fact That The
            Neutrons Are Not Monoenergetic And Do Not Pass
            Through The Gold Shells Normally Calculated By Monte-
            Carlo Method. Correction Factor 1.028+-0.005 For The
            Smaller Shell, 1.025+-0.005 For The Larger.
           .background due to scattering in the gold shells and
            nickel backings, in the cadmium-gold lined shell, and
            room and air scattered backgrounds corrected using
            the methods of RYVES+,J.NUCL.ENERGY,20,(1966),249.
            Correction 2.1+-0.5 Percent For The 3 Cm Diameter
            Sphere, 2.7+-0.5 Percent For The 4 Cm Sphere.
           .Aluminium Can Surrounding The Sample Gave Additional
            Activity Of 0.2 And 0.4 Percent For The Smaller And
            Larger Shells Respectively.
           .Correction For Resonance Self-shielding Negligible.
           .Correction Made For Inelastic Scattering Of Source
            Neutrons From The Source Structure.
           .Correction For Compton Scattering Of Source Gammas
            To Energies Above The Be Photo-threshold, Yielding
            Neutrons Below 966 keV. Correction 2.0+-0.5 Percent
            For Both Spheres.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Quadratic Addition Of Four 0.5 % Systematic
            Errors To Give Total Systematic Error Of 1%.
           (ERR-S) Random Error.
           (ERR-T) Total Error.
           (ERR-1) Error due scattered neutron contribution.
           (ERR-2) Error due Compton scattering of gamma-rays in
                   source.
