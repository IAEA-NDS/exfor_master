TITLE       On the ratio between the activation cross-sections
            of Sr-84 and Sr-88 for slow neutrons

REFERENCE  (J,NP,1,420,1956)
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) Reactor irradiated samples provided by
                   AERE Harwell.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Reactor.
INC-SPECT  No other information than slow neutrons given.
SAMPLE      Sr-Co3 samples.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
DETECTOR    For the Sr-85 activity
           (PROPC) Ar/ch4 proportional counter of known
                   efficiency to measure K x-rays from K-capture
           (COIN,PROPC,SCIN) x-gamma coincidence spectrometer
                   consisting of proportional counter to detect
                   K x-rays and NaI(Tl) scintillator to detect
                   gammas.
           (SCIN)  Scintillator for comparison of 513 keV Sr-85
                   photopeak and the annihilation radiation photo-
                   peak from Na-22 whose absolute intensity had
                   been calibrated.
            For the Sr-89 activity
           .intermediate image magnetic beta spectrometer.
            Transmission measured using Cs-137 source calibrated
            with the Ar/ch4 proportional counter.
DECAY-DATA (38-SR-85-G,65.D,DG,513.) K conversion coeff.
            Of the 513 keV gammas was taken as 0.008.
           (38-SR-89,50.4D,B-,1462.,1.)
RAD-DET    (38-SR-85,XR,DG) K x-rays from Sr-85 and 513 keV
            gammas from Rb-85 following the decay from Sr-85.
           (38-SR-89,B-) decay betas from Sr-89.
CORRECTION  Correction for gammas from the isomeric level of
            Rb-85 (half-life 0.9 micro-sec) missed by the
            coincidence apparatus because of its relatively
            short (3.7 micro-sec) resolving time.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainty
