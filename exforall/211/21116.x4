            OF SR-84 AND SR-88 FOR SLOW NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) REACTOR IRRADIATED SAMPLES PROVIDED BY
                   AERE HARWELL.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  NO OTHER INFORMATION THAN SLOW NEUTRONS GIVEN.
SAMPLE     .SR-CO3 SAMPLES.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   .FOR THE SR-85 ACTIVITY-

                   EFFICIENCY TO MEASURE K X-RAYS FROM K-CAPTURE
           (COIN,PROPC,SCIN) X-GAMMA COINCIDENCE SPECTROMETER
                   CONSISTING OF PROPORTIONAL COUNTER TO DETECT
                   K X-RAYS AND NAI(TL) SCINTILLATOR TO DETECT
                   GAMMAS.
           (SCIN ) SCINTILLATOR FOR COMPARISON OF 513 KEV SR-85
                   PHOTOPEAK AND THE ANNIHILATION RADIATION PHOTO-
                   PEAK FROM NA-22 WHOSE ABSOLUTE INTENSITY HAD
                   BEEN CALIBRATED.
           .FOR THE SR-89 ACTIVITY-
           .INTERMEDIATE IMAGE MAGNETIC BETA SPECTROMETER.
            TRANSMISSION MEASURED USING CS-137 SOURCE CALIBRATED
            WITH THE AR/CH4 PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.
