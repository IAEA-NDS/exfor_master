INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) SB-BE PHOTONEUTRON SOURCE CALIBRATED ABSOLUTELY
                   IN A MANGANESE BATH TO +-0.5 PC. HALF-LIFE OF S
                   124 TAKEN TO BE 60.2+-0.03 D TO COMPUTE CHANGES
                   OF SOURCE STRENGTH WITH TIME. SOURCE STRENGTH A
                   THE TIME OF IRRADIATION WAS 7.37X10**6 N/SEC.
SAMPLE     .CSI CRYSTAL OF DIAMETER 2.54 CM AND THICKNESS 0.38 CM.
ANALYSIS   .CROSS SECTION EXTRACTED BY FITTING A STRAIGHT LINE TO
            THE VARIATION OF I-128 ACTIVITY WITH INVERSE SQUARE OF
            THE DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE.

STATUS     .TABLE 2.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS MADE FOR-
              1.EFFICIENCY OF BETA COUNTING- I.E. LOSS OF BETAS
                EMITTED BELOW THE BIAS ENERGY AND THOSE HIGH ENERG
                BETAS WHICH LOSE LESS THAN THE BIAS ENERGY BEFORE
                ESCAPING FROM THE CRYSTAL- TOTAL B EFFICIENCY 90.9
                IN ADDITION THERE IS AN UNDETECTED ELECTRON CAPTUR
                BRANCH OF THE I-128 DECAY OF 6.4+-0.6 PC.
                TOTAL DETECTION EFFICIENCY=85.1 PC FOR ALL DECAYS.
              2.ENERGY SPREAD IN THE SOURCE DUE TO KINETICS, COMPT
                SCATTERING AND IMPURITIES MEAN THAT THE MEASURED X
                DIFFERS FROM THE 24 KEV XSEC.
                SIGMA(24 KEV)/SIGMA(MEASURED) = 0.992 FOR KINETIC
                SPREAD ALONE- THE OTHER EFFECTS WERE NEGLECTED.
              3.INCREASE IN AVERAGE PATH LENGTH THROUGH THE SAMPLE
                DUE TO SCATTERING WHICH RAISES THE PROBABILITY OF
                ABSORPTION. CORRECTION FACTOR IS 0.8+-0.1 PC.
              4.RESONANCE SELF SHIELDING IN INFINITELY DILUTE
                APPROXIMATION. CORRECTION FACTOR OF 1.3 PC USED.
ERR-ANALYS .TOTAL ERROR OF 3.2 PC COMPOSED OF A LINEAR ADDITION OF
              1.A RANDOM ERROR OF 1.25 PC FROM THE INVERSE SQUARE
                LAW FIT.

INC-SOURCE (REAC ) GLEEP REACTOR AT AERE USING FLUX VALUE AS
                   CALIBRATED BY AXTON- REACTOR SCI.TECH.,17,
                   (1963),125.
INC-SPECT  WESTCOTT EPITHERMAL FLUX PARAMETER, R = 0.049.
            EFFECTIVE NEUTRON TEMPERATURE = 80+-10 DEG C.
           .THOUGH THE REACTOR FLUX HAS AN EPITHERMAL COMPONENT
            ITS EFFECT WAS ELIMINATED BY PERFORMING THE EXPERIMENT
            WITH AND WITHOUT A CADMIUM CASE ROUND THE SAMPLE TO
            ABSORB THE THERMAL NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .CSI CRYSTAL OF DIAMETER 2.54 CM AND THICKNESS 0.38 CM
            PLACED IN AN AIR CAVITY IN A LARGE GRAPHITE BOAT IN
            THE REACTOR.
COMMENT    .THE THERMAL MEASUREMENT WAS MADE TO SHOW ANY GROSS
            ERRORS IN THE METHOD OF MEASURING THE 24 KEV CROSS
            SECTION AND THE AUTHOR MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THIS IS
            THE BEST WAY OF MEASURING THE THERMAL CROSS SECTION.
