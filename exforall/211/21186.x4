TITLE      -THE THERMAL NEUTRON ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION OF U-233
FACILITY   (OSCIP) PILE OSCILLATOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) BEPO REACTOR AT AERE.
SAMPLE     .SOLUTION OF U-O2-SO4 IN D2-O USING U-233. SOLUTIONS
            CONTAINED IN PTFE CANS AND SEALED IN WELDED ALUMINIUM
            CONTAINERS.
           .SOLUTION OF BORIC ACID IN D2-O FOR COMPARISON
            MEASUREMENT.
METHOD     .COMPARISON OF FLUX MODULATION OF OSCILLATED SAMPLE
            WITH THAT OF GOLD.
DETECTOR   (BF3  ) BORON CHAMBER WITH CYLINDRICAL HOLE ALONG ITS
                   AXIS.
                   BORON THERMOCOUPLE TO MEASURE RELATIVE NEUTRON
                   FLUX AT VARIOUS POINTS ALONG THE CHAMBER AXIS,
                   ABSOLUTELY CALIBRATED USING GOLD ACTIVATION.

CORRECTION .CORRECTION FOR THE EFFECT OF FISSION NEUTRONS FROM
            U-233 ON THE PILE.
ERR-ANALYS .TOTAL ERROR MADE UP OF-
            1.ERROR IN MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVE CROSS-SECTION
            COMPOSED OF-
            UNCERTAINTY IN U-233 CONTENT OF SAMPLE, 1.3 PERCENT.
            INCONSISTENCIES IN EMPTY CAN CROSS-SECTIONS, LESS
            THAN 1 PERCENT.
            CURVE FITTING UNCERTAINTIES 0.13 PERCENT.
             .FINAL MEASUREMENT ERROR 1.6 PERCENT.
            2.ERROR IN CORRECTION FOR FISSION NEUTRONS, COMPOSED
              OF-
            UNCERTAINTY IN THE CALIBRATION OF THE NEUTRON SOURCE
            OF 3.5 PERCENT.
            UNCERTAINTY OF 2 PERCENT IN CALIBRATION OF RESISTOR
            USED IN MEASURING EFFECT OF THE OSCILLATING SOURCE.
            5 PERCENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE FLUX DETERMINATION.
            UNCERTAINTY OF 8 PERCENT IN THE RESPONSE OF THE
            CHAMBER TO FISSION NEUTRONS.
            UNCERTAINTY IN THE VALUES OF NU AND FISSION CROSS-
            SECTION USED.
             .TOTAL ERROR IN THIS CORRECTION OF 13 PERCENT, ADDS
              1.3 PERCENT ERROR TO THE FINAL RESULT.
