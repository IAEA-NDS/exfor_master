TITLE      -The thermal neutron absorption cross-section of U-233
FACILITY   (OSCIP) Pile oscillator.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) Bepo reactor at aere .
SAMPLE     .Solution of U-O2-so4 in d2-O using U-233. Solutions
            contained in Pt-Fe  cans and sealed in welded
            aluminium containers.
           .Solution of boric acid in d2-O for comparison
            measurement.
METHOD     .Comparison of flux modulation of oscillated sample
            with that of gold.
DETECTOR   (BF3)   Boron chamber with cylindrical hole along its
                   axis.
                   Boron thermocouple to measure relative neutron
                   flux at various points along the chamber axis,
                   absolutely calibrated using gold activation.
PART-DET   (N)     Reactor neutrons.
