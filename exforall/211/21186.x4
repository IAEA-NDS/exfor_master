TITLE      -The thermal neutron absorption cross-section of U-233
FACILITY   (OSCIP) Pile oscillator.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) BEPO Reactor at AERE .
SAMPLE     .Solution of U-O2-so4 in d2-O using U-233. Solutions
            contained in PT-FE  cans and sealed in welded
            aluminium containers.
           .Solution of boric acid in d2-O for comparison
            measurement.
METHOD     .Comparison of flux modulation of oscillated sample
            with that of gold.
DETECTOR   (BF3)   Boron chamber with cylindrical hole along its
                   axis.
                   Boron thermocouple to measure relative neutron
                   flux at various points along the chamber axis,
                   absolutely calibrated using gold activation.

            Measured in BEPO oscillator using same B2-O3 in
            d2-O specimen as used here.

CORRECTION .Correction for the effect of fission neutrons from
            U-233 on the pile.
ERR-ANALYS .Total error made up of-
            1.Error in measurement of effective cross-section
            composed of-
           (ERR-1)  Uncertainty in U-233 content of sample,
                    1.3%
           (ERR-2)  Max error due to inconsistencies in empty
                    can cross-sections, less than 1%
           (ERR-3)  Error of curve fitting uncertainties 0.13%
           (ERR-4)   .Final measurement error 1.6 %
            2.Error in correction for fission neutrons, composed
              of-
           (ERR-5)  Uncertainty in the calibration of the neutron
                    source of 3.5 percent.
           (ERR-6)  Uncertainty of 2 percent in calibration of
             resistor used in measuring effect of the oscillating
             source
           (ERR-7)   5% uncertainty in the flux determination.
           (ERR-8)  Uncertainty of 8% in the response of the
            chamber to fission neutrons.
           (ERR-SYS) .Final error 3 percent.
           .Additional uncertainty in the values of NU and
            fission cross-section used - not given explicitely
           (ERR-T)  .Total error in this correction of 13 percent,
              adds 1.3 percent error to the final result.
