ANALYSIS   .DATA DERIVED FROM CROSS-SECTION FOR NATURAL SM BY
            ATTRIBUTING ALL ABSORPTION TO SM-149 AT THERMAL
            ENERGIES. THIS ASSUMPTION WAS VERIFIED BY IRRADIATING
            SAMARIUM SULPHATE IN THE NRX PILE AT CHALK RIVER AND
            ANALYSING WITH A MASS SPECTROMETER TO CONFIRM THAT
            THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS THE CONVERSION OF
            MASS 149 TO MASS 150.
           .SM-149 CONTENT OF NATURAL SAMPLE 13.82+-0.04 PERCENT.
