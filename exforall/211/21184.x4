TITLE      -The pile-neutron absorption cross-section of
            samarium-149-
FACILITY   (OSCIP,2UK HAR) Pile oscillator.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) GLEEP reactor at AERE.
INC-SPECT  .Pile spectrum of the GLEEP reactor.
SAMPLE     .Concentrated solution of Sm2-SO4 in D2-O made from
            spectroscopically standardised samarium oxide.
METHOD     .Comparison of effect of samarium and Harwell standard
            boron in pile oscillator, by oscillating an aluminium
            sample which had previously been standardised against
            boron.

REACTION   (62-SM-149(N,G)62-SM-150,,SIG,,MXW)
ANALYSIS   .Data derived from cross-section for natural Sm by
            attributing all absorption to Sm-149 at thermal
            energies. This assumption was verified by irradiating
            samarium sulphate in the NRX pile at Chalk River and
            analysing with a mass spectrometer to confirm that
            the only significant change was the conversion of
            mass 149 to mass 150.
           .Sm-149 content of natural sample 13.82+-0.04%.

CORRECTION .Correction for epithermal absorption by Sm-147 and
            Sm-152 in the pile spectrum due to resonances at
            3.4 and 8 eV respectively, estimated to be 88 b.
