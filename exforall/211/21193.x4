METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross-section measured using activation method
           for flux monitor.
           The principle of this method is to determine the
           neutron flux strength by the radioactivity of the
           reaction product 7Be in the LiF target. In this case,
           it is of special advantage, that the y-ray energies
           occurring in the decays of 7Be and l98Au are very
           similar and therefore the ratio of the
           gamma-efficiencies of the used NaI(Tl) detector is
           near to one.

           mental method as the one of Subent 002, but with a
           better geometric arrangement of the target and the
           manganese bath, resulting in a smaller loss of neutrons
           due to leakage at the edge of the manganese bath.
