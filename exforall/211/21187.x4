CORRECTION .SEVERAL CORRECTIONS MADE FOR SCATTERING AND
            BACKGROUND-
            1.INELASTIC SCATTERING IN FISSION COUNTER MATERIALS
              ABOVE 2 MEV, CORRECTION ABOUT (10+-10) PERCENT AT
              THE HIGHEST ENERGY USED (7.6 MEV). SIMILAR CORR-
              ECTION FOR SCATTERING IN TARGETS, (5+-5) PERCENT
              AT 7.6 MEV.
            2.BACKGROUND DUE TO ROOM SCATTERING AND PRODUCTION OF
              NEUTRONS IN BEAM TUBES ETC., (0.4+-0.4) PERCENT.
            3.BACKGROUND DUE TO DEUTERON INTERACTIONS WITH THE
              NICKEL TARGET WINDOWS AND WITH DEUTERIUM ABSORBED
              IN THE BEAM STOP, (20+-10) PERCENT AT 5 MEV,
              (50+-20) PERCENT AT 7.6 MEV.
            4.CORRECTION AT 7.6 MEV FOR BACKGROUND FROM DEUTERON
              BREAKUP D(D,NP)D OF 8 PERCENT, CALCULATED USING THE
              DATA OF L.CRANBERG,PHYS.REV.,104,(1956),1639.
           .CORRECTION ALSO MADE FOR BUILD UP OF BETA ACTIVE
            PA-233 FROM THE TRACER.
ERR-ANALYS .BELOW 800 KEV ERRORS MADE UP TYPICALLY OF-
            FISSION COUNTER CALIBRATION................2%
