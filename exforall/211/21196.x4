REACTION   (5-B-0(N,A),,SIG)
ANALYSIS   .VALUE OF ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION DERIVED FROM
            FROM TOTAL CROSS-SECTION OF BORIC OXIDE .
            THE VALUE GIVEN IS THE RESULT OF THE COMBINATION OF
            VALUES FROM EXPERIMENTS (774+-6 B.) ON BORIC OXIDE
            AND ON BORAX (765+-8 B.).
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,5-B-CMP(N,EL),,SIG) THE BOUND ATOM SCATTERING
            CROSS SECTION OF BORAX (B2O3) IS TAKEN AS 21 B.
STATUS     .DATA FROM TEXT OF PUBLICATION.
            THIS VALUE DIFFERS FROM THAT GIVEN IN AERE-N/M-62, AND
            SUPERSEDES THIS VALUE.
