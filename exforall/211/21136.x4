REACTION  1(49-IN-115(N,G)49-IN-116-M2/M1,,SIG/RAT) Ratio of
            cross-sections to second and first isomeric states
            obtained from count rate In 163 keV photopeak of
            the 2 sec state and In 408, 1085 and 1270 keV peaks
            of the 54 minute spectrum.
          2(49-IN-115(N,G)49-IN-116-M2/M1,,SIG/RAT) Isomeric
            ratio from initial increase In Sn-116 activity due
            to decay of second to first isomeric states.
           .Both ratios are for the first resonance in In-115.
STATUS     .Data from text of publication.
ERR-ANALYS1(DATA-ERR) Error in DATA 1, mainly due to the
            uncertainty in the absolute gamma intensity per
            decay for the 2 sec and 54 min transitions.
          2(DATA-ERR) Error in DATA 2, mainly due to the
            statistical fluctuations on the counting rate.
