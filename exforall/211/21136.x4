STATUS     .DATA FROM TEXT OF PUBLICATION.
ERR-ANALYS (RATIO-ERR1) ERROR IN RATIO1, MAINLY DUE TO THE
            UNCERTAINTY IN THE ABSOLUTE GAMMA INTENSITY PER
            DECAY FOR THE 2 SEC AND 54 MIN TRANSITIONS.
           (RATIO-ERR2) ERROR IN RATIO2, MAINLY DUE TO THE
            STATISTICAL FLUCTUATIONS ON THE COUNTING RATE.
