TITLE       A note on the isotopic assignment of slow neutron
            resonances in samarium, iridium and gadolinium
FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK HAR) 15 MeV electron Linac.
INC-SOURCE .No details.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Set of up to 4 NaI scintillators coupled to
           E.M.I. 6260 photomultipliers to detect capture gammas.
           (BF3) BF-3 counter to monitor flux.
PART-DET   (G) Capture gammas.
REL-REF    (I,21117001,E.M.Bowey,J,NP,3,553,1957)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The neutron energy include possible timing
            error of 1 micro-sec (0.11 micro-sec/m) together with
            very small uncertainty in the flight path length.
