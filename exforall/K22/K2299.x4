PART-DET   (G)
EN-SEC     - ANG1 is polar angle (lab.) between beam and prompt
             gamma 1
           - ANG2 is polar angle (lab.) between beam and prompt
             gamma 2
INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is 2.0E+08 PPS.
           (BRST) 50 micro meter platinum target was used for
                  producing the photon beam
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is unknown.
           - Physical-form of target is liquid.
           - Target-thickness: Liquid hydrogen target container -
             cylinder with diameter 6 cm and length 10 cm,
             container material is 5-mil Mylar
METHOD     (COINC) Detect prompt gamma and prompt gamma in
                   coincidence.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNTOK) 750 MeV electron synchrotron at
                           Institute for Nuclear Study (INS)
ANALYSIS   (PHDIF)
DETECTOR   - Solid angle of detector is 0.09 sr.
           - Detector resolution: approximately 30% at 600 MeV
             and is about 50% at 200 MeV
           - Calibration: The calibration curve (Fig.3) is
             responded the nearly proportional to the energy of
             the incident electron over the energy range from 60
             to 600 MeV.
           - Efficiency: less than 4% at 100 MeV and greater than
             97% at 400 MeV.
           (SCIN) Two lead-scintillator sandwich type shower
                  counter. Each counter consists of seventeen
                  10-mm-thick sheets of plastic scintillator and
                  sixteen 3-mm sheets of lead alternately
                  arranged.
