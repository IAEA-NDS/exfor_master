           of experiment.
SAMPLE     A small diameter implanted Be-7 target was used.
           The target consists of copper, Be-7 and Li-7. After
           Implantation was 1.17E+16 Be-7 atoms and 10E+15 Li-
           atoms in a cylindrical volume of copper, 2-mm diameter
           and  2500-angstroem deep, containing a total of 6.7E+16
           Cu-atoms the B-8 backscattering loss to be 0.2%,  small
           enough to be ignored.
           The target was calibrated for Be-7 content by
           monitoring the gamma-rays following the Be-7-Li-7-beta
           decay.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC) The gamma measurements were carried out in
           standard counting arrangements, which however required
           the gamma-activity of the sample to be below a limit
           much smaller than the actual activity of used target.
           It was possible to produced a secondary target about
           300 times weaker than the primary target, identical
           with it in all aspects but the gamma activity.
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A 40 micron surface barrier detector.
           The detector was surrounded by a shroud to prevent
           scattered beam panicles from reaching the detector.
FACILITY   (VDG,3ISLWZI) 3 MV accelrator.
HISTORY    (20060410C)
           (20060419U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is shown in data table.
CORRECTION On backscattering of product nuclei.
COMMENT    -By authors. In attempting to compare this results with
           other recent measurements was note that while this work
           emphasizes a selected energy point, all other
           measurements are spread over wide ranges with
           relatively large individual errors. Those errors in
           turn are partially statistical and partially systematic
           and may be common to the whole range.

            E-lab=992-KeV, the slightly different values of E-cm
            are due to gradual carbon build-up as derived from
            repeated measurements of the Be-7(p,g)B-8 resonance.
