COMMENT    -By authors. A nondestructive method for carbon
           determination in layers of 3-10-mum thickness is
           considered. The method is based on using the C-12(d,n)
           nuclear reaction with simultaneous account of surface
           contamination by means of the C-12(d,p)C-13 competitive
           reaction.
SAMPLE     The thin target containing 15-mug/cm**2 of carbon was
           used. The thin target was made by means of C-12 ion
           implantation into high purity molybdenum backing.
ADD-RES    1. Spectrum of prompt particles of nuclear reactions
           measured after the annealing.
           2.  Relative backscattering yield of N-13 recoil nuclei
           as a function of the atomic number of target.
           3. Metrological parameters of proposed method.
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,NAICR) The activity of N-13 nuclide was
           measured with a NaI(Tl) coincidence spectrometer.
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSJIA)
METHOD     (ACTIV) For measurements from 0.4 to 0.8 MeV.
           (COINC) To detect N-13 activity.
           (EXTB) A deutron beam of an intensity up to 40
           microamperes.
           (SITA)

REL-REF    (R,T0287001,E.KASHY+,J,PR,117,1289,1960) The data were
           used as standard for C-12(d,p)C-13 reaction.
COMMENT    -By authors. Total cross sections from 0.8 to 1.7-MeV
           were calculated using the C-12(d,p)C-13 reaction
           differential cross section
           the total cross sections from 0.4 to 0.8-MeV were
           obtained by direct measurements of N-13 activity.
FLAG       (1.).The data were obtained from C-12(d,p) reaction.
           (2.).The data were obtained by direct measurements.
