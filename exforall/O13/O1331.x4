SAMPLE     The assemblies: target -  Solid State Nuclear Track
            Detector - target were used.

DETECTOR   (TRD) The experimental estimation of fission cross
           section of 181-Ta for protons in the energy range
           200-1000 MeV was carried out by method of solid-state
           nuclear track detectors based on 6-mumeters Lavsan
           film.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB) The Dubna Synchrophasotron
METHOD     (REC) In the case of thin target, whose thickness is
           much less than average path length of fission fragments
           in the target, the critical angle of registration of
           fission fragments by 6-mumeters Lavsan Solid State
            Nuclear Track Detector is 29 degrees, which is
           equivalent to registration in the angular intervals
           0-61 and 119-180 degrees by used assembly
           target-detector-target.
           (RELFY) Relative to lead target.
           -By authors.  For estimation of the fission cross
           section of 181-Ta for protons in the energy range 200-
           1000 MeV the following assumptions were used:
           1.  Fission fragments leaving tantalum and lead targets
           have the same registration properties.
           2.   Kinematic characteristics of fission fragments are
           such that a magnitude of ratio of the measured number
           of fission fragments to their total number emitted in a
           total solid angle.  Is energy-independent in the
           studied energy interval.
           3.  The contribution to the total number of counts from
           the nuclear fragments arising in other processes is
           small in this energy range and can be taken into
           account by a small correction.
           4.   The value of this correction can be estimated from
           results obtained for lighter targets (we used cadmium)
           where the process of fission can be neglected in
           comparison with the contribution from reactions of
           fragmentation and spallation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty which is produced by:
           (ERR-S) High limit of the statistical uncertainty of
           the measured number of fission fragments.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of the determination of number
           of counts.N 12
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of determination of proton flux
ADD-RES    (COMP) A comparison of the obtained data with the
           available experimental results is performed.
