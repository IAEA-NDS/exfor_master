REL-REF    (M,O1028001,V.I.Yurevich+,J,YF,65,1417,2002) The
           details of used method. See PAN,65,1383,2002 for
            English translation too.
SAMPLE     The assemblies: target -  Solid State Nuclear Track
            Detector - target were used.
PART-DET   (FF)
DETECTOR   (TRD) The experimental estimation of fission cross
           section of 181-Ta for protons in the energy range
           200-1000 MeV was carried out by method of solid-state
           nuclear track detectors based on 6-mum Lavsan
           film.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB) The Dubna Synchrophasotron
METHOD     (REC) In the case of thin target, whose thickness is
           much less than average path length of fission fragments
           in the target, the critical angle of registration of
           fission fragments by 6-mum Lavsan Solid State
            Nuclear Track Detector is 29 degrees, which is
           equivalent to registration in the angular intervals
           0-61 and 119-180 degrees by used assembly
           target-detector-target.
           (RELFY) Relative to lead target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty which is produced by:
           (ERR-S,,5.) High limit of the statistical uncertainty
           of the measured number of fission fragments.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of the determination of number
           of counts.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of determination of proton flux
ADD-RES    (COMP) A comparison of the obtained data with the
           available experimental results is performed.
