TITLE      Yield of the 123-Te(p,p')123-Te-m reaction at 15 MeV

SAMPLE     Two 95% enriched tellurium-123 dioxide targets were
           each of 320 mg/cm2 thickness on 0.3 mm thick platinum
           backing.  One target was freshly made and the other was
           used for production of iodine for two years.
           Tellurium targets were prepared by smelting of the
           tellurium dioxide on a platinum plate.  The target
           activity after irradiation belongs mainly to platinum
           backing and isomer 123m-Te (t1/2 = 119.7 days).
           Activation of the platinum plate is mostly conditioned
           by the activity of 196-Au (t1/2 = 6.18 days).  This
           part of the target activity can be excluded by cooling
           for about two weeks or by change of the platinum plate.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSRI) MGC-20 cyclotron.
METHOD     (EXTB) The targets were irradiated two (new target)
           and four times (old target).

DECAY-DATA (52-TE-123-M,119.7D,DG,159.)
COMMENT    -By compiler.  Isomer state of Te-123 could not be
           produced due to radioactive decay of I-123.
           By authors. 1. The "DATA" is the 123m-Te yield averaged
           with weights from MISC1 and MISC2.
           2.  The main gamma line of 123m-Te is of the same
           energy of 159 KeV as of the iodine one.  Therefore
           gamma measurements of the 123m-Te activity were carried
           out two weeks after the end of bombardment when the
           rest of iodine remaining after it's extraction has
           completely decayed.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) The result for new target.
           (MISC2) The result for old target.
           (MISC1-ERR) The uncertanty of MISC1.
           (MISC2-ERR) The uncertainty of MISC2.
