SAMPLE     The Au-foils were analyzed spectroscopically and it was
           found that the quantities of impurities were
           negligible.  The thickness of these foils was about
           19-mg/cm2, whereas the one corresponding to Cu was
           about 29-mg/cm2. Each foil was wrapped in Al  of
           surface density 3.72-mg/cm**2 in order to avoid the
           loss of radioactive nuclei by recoiling.

           The standard excitation functions were used for the
           determinations of the energy of the incident beam and
           the flux of alpha-particles.  The fluxes obtained
           through both standard functions differ only in 1%,
           whereas the error in its determination is less than
           11%.

METHOD     (INTB) The maximum incident energy was approximately
           90-MeV and tintensity of the beam was varied between
            5 and 8-muA.
           (STTA) Cu foils were interleaved between the Au-foils:
           their function was to monitor both the flux and the
           energy beam in the stack.

HISTORY    (20060224C)
           (20060602A) According to O.Schwerer remark 5-subent is
           corrected.
           (20060602U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty is given in data table.
           It is arise essentially from the errors in the peak
           area and efficiency calibration.
           (ERR-2) The low limit of the contribution on the first
           factor depends on the peak area and the background.
           Was estimated to be around 5 to 8%.
           (ERR-3) The high limit of the contribution on the first
           factor depends on the peak area and the background.
           (ERR-4) The uncertainty of efficiency calibration.
           (ERR-1) An overall error of target thickness
COMMENT    -By  authors.   The uncertainty in the energies, due to
           the dispersion of the incident beam and the dispersion
           produced on the target, was estimated to be 0.5 MeV for
           10 MeV alpha-particles. No corrections for changes in
           dispersion due to the non-uniformity of the foil
           thickness were made.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The complex code-hybrid model combined with the
           statistical model.
