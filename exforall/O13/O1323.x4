HISTORY    (20070606C) S.B
           (20070607U) Last checking has been done.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The gamma-ray were detected in the GASP-
           spectrometer in coincidence with fast charged particles
           detected in the ISIS-silicon ball.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The projected shell model.
           The experimental interaction strengths are determined.
COMMENT    *By authors*.Two complementary experiments were
           performed.The first experiment was to measure absolute
           cross sections. The reaction mechanism-relative cross
           sections were deduced by measuring the total gamma-flux
           into the ground states of different nuclei in the
           gamma-gamma coincidence data. The intensities of all
           gamma-transitions have been corrected for the energy
           dependent efficiency of the detectors and internal
           conversion. To determine absolute cross sections from
           relative ones, the intensities of the X-rays from the
           Gd-target observed in a Ge-detector within absorber
           have been used and correction for binding energy and
           Coulomb deflection were used.
           The Dy-isotope is populated via three different
           reaction channels. Based on these cross-section
           measurements the reactions Gd-158,160(Li-7,(p,d,t)xn)
           at a beam energy of 56-MeV were employed to populate
           high-spin states in the band crossing region of the
           heavy even Dy-isotopes (second experiment, at LNL)

FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERMPH)
DETECTOR   (GE) Seven Ge-detectors
           (TELES) Delta-E-E Si-ring telescope, delta-E is
            100-mum, E-detector is 1000-mum, in forward direction
            and a 300-mum Si-detector in the backward direction.
            A 470-mum Al-absorber was mounted in front of the
            delta-E detector to protect it against elastically
            scattered Li-7 ions.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors is

COMMENT    *By authors*.For an incomplete fusion reaction only
           part of the projectile is fusing with the target nuclei
           while the rest is continuing to fly in the forward
           direction.
