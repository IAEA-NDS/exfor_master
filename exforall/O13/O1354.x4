TITLE      Production of Np-235, Pu-236 and Pu-237 via nuclear

SAMPLE     Targets of uranium and neptunium-oxide (236,238U(3)O(8)
           and 237Np-O(2)) were prepared by multiple thermal
           decomposition of uranium or neptunium nitrate cellulose
           painted on 10-mum, 50-mum and 100-mum thick Al-backing.
           The average thickness of the actinide layer was 60-120
           mug/cm**2 for the thin targets and 1.5-2-mg/cm**2 for
           the thick targets. The thickness variations were within
            3% for all types of targets used.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).The calculated thick-target yield of Np-235
            at 42.4-MeV projectile energy is 5.8-kbq/mua*hr.

DETECTOR   (SIBAR) For alpha activity of Pu-236 and Pu-238.
           The energy resolution of the alpha spectrometers was
            20-35-KeV at 5767-KeV. The efficiency errors were 3-
            6%, but as a results of the negative covariance
            coefficients the error of the efficiency ratio was
            less than 1% for all alpha detector assemblies.
           (GELI) And hpge-detector for X-ray activity of Np-235
            and Pu-237. Gamma spectra were measured with energy
            resolutions of 1.8-KeV at 1332.5-KeV. The error of the
            gamma detector efficiency was about 2%.
COMMENT    -By authors. For all measurements the induced alpha
           activities were normalized with the target material
           alpha emission.
CORRECTION The dead time correction was automatically taken into
           account with normalization procedure.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors.  The
           uncertainties of the detector surface area and the
           distance between the detector and the sample give the
           main contribution to the efficiency error.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
