TITLE       He-4(d,d) scattering as polarization standard

SAMPLE     A gaseous 4-He target was placed in the center of the
           scattering chamber.  The cylindrical target had a
           diameter of 5 cm, and contained helium of atmospheric
           pressure.  Entrance and exit windows, made from 5.8
           mg/cm2 Havar foil, were outside the acceptance
           defined by the slit system that proceeded the
           detectors.
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) The polarization of the beam was flipped once a
           second through 3 different polarization states:  the
           unpolarized state (0), and two tensor- and vector-
           polarized states (1,2), the polarization of which was
           equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign.
           The left-right asymmetry of d-12-C elastic scattering
           was continuously measured using a 200 mug/cm2 carbon
           target and NaI detectors placed at + and - 50 degrees
           scattering angles.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The deuterons and alpha-particles were detected
           using stacks of totally depleted Si surface barrier
           detectors, with thicknesses ranging from 40 nm to 1 mm.
           (NAICR) Two the detectors were used in polarimeter to m
           measure scattered deutrons.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWTBAS)
METHOD     (EDEG) The thickness of the degraders was known to
           <1%.  The effective energy loss of the deuterons was
           measured via the energy of the reaction products from
           d-He-4 scattering.
           (EDE) By measuring both energy loss in the thin
           detectors, and the total energy, particles could be
           cleanly identified, without background.

CORRECTION For dead time of the different spin states.  The
           dead-time corrections never exceeded 2%.

STATUS     (APRVD) By J.Jourdan 18-04-2006
ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR) An angular acceptance.
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) The normalization of the data to the ones of
           W.Gruebler+' results would add a systematic error of
           +/- 2.1%.

           normalize authors' data.
