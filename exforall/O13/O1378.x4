REL-REF    (M,O1366001,F.Smend+,J,ZP,207,28,1967) Details of
           experiment.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERGOE)
SAMPLE     Natural silver dicks 10-mu, purity 99.96%.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Statistical model calculations.
           (DECAY) Gamma-rays energies and half-lives were
           measured.
DETECTOR   (GE) 7-mm Ge-detector. Detector type is not given.
METHOD     (SITA)
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time for In-109 production was
           selected as 1.5 minutes, for In-111 the time was
           selected as 5 minutes.
           (INTB) Beam particles energy has been changed by
           changing of irradiation radius.
