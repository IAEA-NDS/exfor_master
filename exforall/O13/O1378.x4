REL-REF    (R,O1366001,F.SMEND+,J,ZP,207,28,1967) Details of
           experiment.
HISTORY    (20060412C)
           (20060424U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Natural silver dicks 10-mu, purity 99.96%.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Statistical model calculations.
           (DECAY) Gamma-rays energies and half-lives were
           measured.
DETECTOR   (GE) 7-mm Ge-detector. Detector type is not given.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERGOE)
METHOD     (SITA)
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time for In-109 production was
           selected as 1.5 minutes, for In-111 the time was
           selected as 5 minutes.
           (INTB) Beam particles energy has been changed by
           changing of irradiation radius.
           (GSPEC)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
            figure.
           (EN-ERR-DIG).Digitizing error of incident energy.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
