DETECTOR   (COIN,GELI,NAICR,SCIN) A Ge(Li)-NaI(Tl) gamma
           spectrometer was used to record photons and measure
           their energy. A Ge(Li) crystal of volume 100-cm**3
           placed in a cryostat.
           A signal from six NaI crystals was required to be in
           anticoincidence with a signal from a germanium detector
           was suppressed by a factor of 20 to 30.
           The energy scale of the germanium detector was
           calibrated on the basis of 14 known gamma lines of a
           Ra-226 source in the range between 180 and 3100-KeV.
INC-SPECT  *En-rsl* the overall energy resolution.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSITE) The U-10 accelerator of ITEP.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (EXTB) Three runs of measurements in the beam was
           performed.
ERR-ANALYS (E-ERR) The uncertainty of gamma quantum energy.
           An analysis of the uncertainty is not given.
           (ERR-S) The quoted error in the cross sections are
           purely statistical and are determined by the errors
           with which the parameters were determined from a fit to
           the peaks.
           In addition, there are errors associated with choosing
           the boundaries of fitting and intervals of the back-
           ground, with misidentifying peaks, and with including
           nearby peaks in the fitting procedure.
           (ERR-1) The inaccuracy stemming from these error for
           intense peaks, for example, those at 1780, 418, 1369,
           441 and 1276-KeV.
           (ERR-2) The inaccuracy for the remaining peaks.
           (ERR-SYS) A systematic error in determining the
           efficiency of the spectrometer and in beam monitoring
CORRECTION The correction for the contribution of closely lying
           transitions from different reaction was estimated.
STATUS     (TABLE) In the paper.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Emitting element.
           (MISC2) The mass of emitting isotope.
