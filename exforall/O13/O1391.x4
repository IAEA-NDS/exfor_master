REL-REF    (R,C0642001,E.IROM+,J,PR/C,28,2380,1983)The precise
            pd-elastic analyzing power data at 0.796 mev.  the
           Data were used by the authors to measure beam
           polarization at 800 MeV.
HISTORY    (20060423C)
           (20060506A) Correction.
           (20060529U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The deuterium cluster jet produced a target density of
           about 2.E+14 atoms/cm2 with a target length along the
           beam of 12-mm and a width of 4.9-mm.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The results are compared with a model taking
           into account one-nucleon exchange, single scattering
           and delta(1232) excitation in the intermediate state.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The set of used detectors includes:
           (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR,SIBAR) The silicon detector
           telescope to record recoils deuterons from small-angle
           elastic pd scattering. the detector provided an unambig
           Deutron identification with a detector resolution of
           300 KeV,
           and
           (TELES,MWPC,MWPC,MWPC,SCIN,SCIN) The telescope
           comprises a set of three multiwire proportional
           chambers and a two-plane scintillation hodoscope,
           consisting of vertically oriented counters (eight in
           first plane, nine in second). The detector was used to
           record a fast proton pair emitted in the forward
           direction with small excitation energy (< 3 MeV).
INC-SOURCE (POLIS)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERJUL) The ANKE-spectrometer at the internal
           beam of COSY-Julich with about 3.E+9 stored vertically
           polarized protons.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (INTB)
           (COINC) Recoil deuterons at angles around 90 degrees (I
            [L-system] were detected in first telescope in
           coincidence with elastically scatterd protons in second
           telescope.
COMMENT    -By authors. The absence of azimuthal symmetry of the
            ANKE-spectrometer does not permit one to measure a
           vector analyzing power from the left-right count rate
           assymetry. The analyzing power was measured by
           reversing every two cycle the orientation of the
           polarization.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty of the analyzing
           power contains contributions from various sources,
           which were all added in quadrature.
