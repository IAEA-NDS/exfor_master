SAMPLE     A natural thorium of thickness 250-mug/cm**2 deposited
           on a 6-mum thick aluminum foil, were used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) The fragments were detected by
            del'ta-E (20-mum)-E-(1000-mum) silicon telescopes.
           (TELES,IOCH,SIBAR)  Some of the measurements were also
           carried out employing del'ta-E(IOCH)-E(silicon)
           telescopes consisting of a common del'ta-E gas
           ionization chamber followed by three discrete E(Si)
           detectors spaced at 10-degree intervals.
           A monitor detector placed at 50-degree detected
           the elastics for overall normalisation of the data.
