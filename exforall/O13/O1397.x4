SAMPLE     Self-supporting target of Co-59.  Aluminium foils were
           used as degrader.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (GSPEC) The cross sections of the individual reaction
           products were determined by adding the intensities of
           the gamma-transitions populating the respective ground
           states or in some cases the first excited states of
           given products.
COMMENT    -By compiler. The authors wrote in abstract:
           "reaction product cross sections have been measured for
           reactions of He-4 projectile with 54,56-Fe, 58-Ni and
           Co-59 targets in the bombarding energy range 14-27 MeV"
           But the paper contains cross sections on cobalt target.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The statistical model calculations.
           The cross-section-weighted average charge and mass
           removed from the compound system were deduced and
           compared with the results reported for heavy-ion
           induced reactions.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
