METHOD     (STTA) See sample.
           (ACTIV) The irradiations lasted one to two hours with
           beam intensities of 0.13 - 1.92 microamperes.
           (GSPEC) Each sample was measured several times during
           about one year.
SAMPLE     The foil thicknesses were determined to within about
            2% by weighing an accurately measured area of each
           foil and were about 15-mg/cm**2-vanadium, 25-mg/cm**2-
           carbon and 4-mg/cm**2-aluminium. The carbon catchers
           used were spectrally pure with a main impurity of less
           or equal 0.1-ppm Si.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Monte-Carlo cascade evaporation calculations.
           The recoil data have been analyzed with the two step
           vector model to deduce the mean kinetic parameters.
           Thick target/thick catcher recoil data for
           radionuclides produced in the interaction of vanadium
           with 258-, 350- and 910-MeV He-3-ions and 1032-MeV C-12
           ions.

ERR-ANALYS The errors listed are standard deviations based on
           spread among parallels and the combined errors from
           single bombardments due to counting statistics,
           relative photopeak efficiency, corrections for recoil
           losses and errors in thickness measurements for target
           and monitor foils. For cross sections obtained, using
           chemical separation, uncertainties in chemical yield
           determination were also included. Systematic errors in
           the monitor cross section are not included.
           (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.

METHOD     (INTB)
           (CHSEP) In two irradiations at 350-MeV He-3 was
           determined the transtarget formation of Mn-51, Mn-52
           and Mn-52-m by chemical separation.
CORRECTION The results which were obtained after radiochemical
           separation were corrected for chemical yield.

REACTION   (23-V-51(6-C-12,X)ELEM/MASS,IND,SIG)
           The cross sections were determined relative to the
           monitor
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(6-C-12,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           It is the value from technical memorandum HS-RP/TM/80-5
           CERN,1977
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT-ERR).The error is reported in paper.
SAMPLE     A target stack consisting of three high purity Al-foils
           as monitor foils, followed by a carbon guard foil and
           a vanadium target foil, covered by two carbon foils
           serving as forward and backward recoil catchers.
