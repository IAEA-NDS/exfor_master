FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK MAN) Heavy ion linear accelerator.
           Experiment was performed at 38.4-MeV for values of
           recoil range.

           Experiment was performed at 58.6-MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           The thick target/thick catcher technique

ADD-RES    (COMP) The compound nucleus model. Pre-equilibrium
           process.
           (RANGE) The recoil ranger of Tc were obtained.
SAMPLE     The Nb-targets were about 3-mg/cm**2 and the escaping
           fraction about 10% so that the recoil ranges were
           around 300-ug/cm**2.
