COMMENT    -By authors. The thick target between thick catchers
           technique has not been used for the natural Cu-target,
           nevertheless, summing partial cross sections in thin
           catchers and in target, an estimation of the total
           cross-section has been made.
           - By compiler. The authors did not distinguish
           cumulative and direct productons.
SAMPLE     A 1.5-mg/cm**2 thick target placed between two 20-mum
           thick aluminium catchers, able to stop all the products
           recoiling from the irradiated sample.

SAMPLE     For the angular distributions measurements, the thin
           target, 200-400-mg/cm**2 thickness, was placed at
           45-degree against the beam axis. The recoil nuclei were
           stopped in angular 100-mum MYLAR catcher foils arranged
           inside the chamber. In several angular distribution
           measurements, the 100-mum MYLAR foil was replaced by
           one MYLAR layers associated with an Al-layer to
           discriminate different kinetic energies at different
           angles for a given final product. In other experiments,
           at a mean of 30-degree, the 100-mum thick MYLAR
           collector has been replaced by a series of 3.5-mum
           thick MYLAR catchers able to give range estimations at
           a given angular domain.

SAMPLE     For the angular distributions measurements, the thin
           target, 200-400-mg/cm**2 thickness, was placed at
           45-degree against the beam axis. The recoil nuclei were
           stopped in angular 100-mum MYLAR catcher foils arranged
           inside the chamber. In several angular distribution
           measurements, the 100-mum MYLAR foil was replaced by
           one mylar layers associated with an Al-layer to
           discriminate different kinetic energies at different
           angles for a given final product. In other experiments,
           at a mean of 30-degree, the 100-mum thick MYLAR
           collector has been replaced by a series of 3.5-mum
           thick MYLAR catchers able to give range estimations at
           a given angular domain.
