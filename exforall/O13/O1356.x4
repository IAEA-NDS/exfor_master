           (29-CU-63(A,X)30-ZN-65,CUM,SIG) The reactions were used
           to  determine the beam incident energy and to calculate
           the alpha-particles flux.
           The fluxes obtained through both standard functions
           differ only in 1%, whereas the error in its
           determination is less than 11%.

SAMPLE     The targets were assembled according to the
           stacked-foils method. Cu-foils were put between the Pt-
           foils. The Pt-foils were analyzed spectroscopically,
           the quantities of impurities were negligible. The
           surface density of these foils was 18.9-mg/cm**2,
           whereas the one corresponding to Cu was 28.8 mg/cm**2.
           Each one of the foils constititing a target was wrapped
           in Al of surface density 3.72-mg/cm**2, in order to
           avoid the loss of radioactive nuclei by recoiling.

           were evaluated by propagating in quadrature of the
           individual magnitudes involved in these determination-
           absolute efficiency of the detector, target thickness,
           alpha-particle flux, photopeak areas, time of
           measurement and of irradiations and all those

COMMENT    -By authors.  Order to detect the presence of 194-Au,
           the 328.4 KeV photopeak was followed.  It is
           interesting to note that 194-g-Ir (19.15hr) and
           194-m-Ir(171days) decay through the same excited level
           of 194-Pt, therefore, the analyzed ray is shared by
           three istopes.  As the measurements were done 9 days
           after the end of the irradiation, the contributions  of
           the 194-g-Ir may be neglected.  The contributions of
           the isomer of 171 days may be neglected too since the
           measurements lasted not more than 10 minutes.  The
           194-Au is fed by its parent, 194Hg (260 years), and
           this additional formation was subtracted.  This
           correction is neglected due to the very long period  of
           the mother.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The decay of 195(m+g)Au (183 d) was
           studied considering the gamma-ray 98.9 KeV.  There are
           three more isotopes which by their disintegration
           populate the same excited level of 195-Pt:  195-m-Ir
            (3.8 hours), 195-g-Ir (2.5 hours) and 195-m-pt (4.02
           days).  These isotopes are neglected since they were
           measured forty days after the end of irradiation.  As
           regards 195 Au, obtained from the decay of 195-m-Hg and
           195-g-Hg, the contributions of the 41.6 hours isomer
           was the only one that could be discounted.  The other
           contributions could not be taken into account, since
           the excitation function for 195-g-Hg was not available.

COMMENT    -  By authors.  The activities of 196(m+g)-Au (8.1 sec,
           6.18 days) were determined by means of the photopeak of
           426.1 KeV and 355.7 KeV.  The contribution of the
           196-Ir (52 S, 1.4 hour) isomer to the 355.7 KeV
           gamma-ray was not considered since the measurements
           were done 9 days after the irradiation.  By the way,
           the 196-Hg and 196-Pt isotopes are stable and therefore
           they do not lead to the formation of 196-Au.
           Nevertheless,  there exists an isomeric state of 196-Au
            (9.7 hours), which decays by isomeric transition to an
           8.2 seconds isomer and afterwards to the ground state .
           These contributions could not be subtracted since the
           cross sections for this isomer were unknown.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The disintegration of 198-g Au was
           followed by the photopeak of 411.8 KeV the only
           discount done is the one corresponding to the
           contribution of the 2.3 days isomer.  The isotope
           191-Pt (2.8 days) decays emitting a gamma-ray of 409.4
           KeV, which cannot be separated from the
           gamma-corresponding to 198-g-Au by the detector used in
           the  measurements.  Nevertheless, by means of the cross
           sections of 191-Pt, it could be verified that the 409.4
           KeV photopeak only contributes 2% to the whole area.

COMMENT    -By authors.  The activities of 199-Au were calculated
           with the areas obtained in the measurement of the
           photopeak of 158.4 KeV.  This gamma-deexcitation is
           shared by the 199m-Hg (42.6 min) in its decay to 199Hg,
           but at the time of the measurements it was completely
           decayed.  On the other hand, the 199-Pt isotope feeds
           the main isotope and this discount could not be
           performed because the corresponding excitation function
           was not available.  In spite of this difficulty, the
           formation of this isotope is believed to be of no
           importance since it is only obtained by the (a, 2pn)
           reaction on 198-Pt, its isotopic abundance in the
           irradiated target being only 7.2%.
