            209Bi + alpha are presented (same data are on fig.2 of
            ZP/A,351,129,1995).
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) The U-400M and U-400 cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The helium isotopes were produced using the
           primary ion beams of B-11(18.5-MeV/A) and
           Li-7(35.5MeV/A).
           In first case B-11 ion beam bombarded a 200-mum thick
           tantalum target stopping the primary beam and secondary
           particles with Z<5 were produced.  The intensities of
           He-4(He-6) with an energy of 54-(50)-MeV and a 3%
           resolution reached  3000 (300) particles /per second
           and a purity of 98(95)% were obtained.
           In  second case the striping of proton from the Li-7 on
           the 1.1-mm carbon target was used.  The intensity of
           He-6 was  6000- particles per second.
SAMPLE     The special 'sandwich-type' piles of targets of Bi-209,
            820-mug/cm**2 thickness, 55-mum thick Mylar films for
           registration of fission fragments and additional
           absorbers made of Al(60-200-mum) were manufactured.
           The aluminum-foils and bismuth targets were tested on
           uranium contamination using neutron activation method.
DETECTOR   (SILI) For monitoring the secondary beam. Si(Li) with
           dimentsions 32. mm in diam. x 4.15 mm2 was about
           6000 pps for 2.1011 pps of 7Li ions
           Additionally, an dE detector 4150 mu-m in thickness
           reduced the energy down to 70 MeV+-8% (FWHM) at the
           experimental target position.
           (TRD) 55 mu-m-thick Mylar films for registration of
           fission fragments and additional absorbers made of
           Al (60+220 mu-m) were manufactured
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of the measured fission
           cross section. The uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) High limit of counting error.
           (ERR-2) The losses of ions connected with the
           absorption inside the targets and aluminum foils and
           with multi-scattering.
