            209Bi + alpha are presented (same data are on fig.2 of
            ZP/A,351,129,1995).
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) The U-400M cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE The helium isotopes were produced using the primary ion
           beams of Li-7(35.5MeV/A) on carbon.
           The striping of proton from the Li-7 on the 1.1-mm
           carbon target was used.  The intensity of He-6 was
           6000- particles per second.
SAMPLE     The special 'sandwich-type' piles of targets of Bi-209,
            820-mug/cm**2 thickness, 55-mum thick Mylar films for
           registration of fission fragments and additional
           absorbers made of Al(60-200-mum) were manufactured.
           The aluminum-foils and bismuth targets were tested on
           uranium contamination using neutron activation method.
DETECTOR   (SILI) For monitoring the secondary beam. Si(Li) with
           dimensions 32. mm in diam. x 4.15 mm2 was about
           6000 pps for 2.1011 pps of 7Li ions
           Additionally, an dE detector 4150 mu-m in thickness
           reduced the energy down to 70 MeV+-8% (FWHM) at the
           experimental target position.
           (TRD) 55 mu-m-thick Mylar films for registration of
           fission fragments and additional absorbers made of
           Al (60+220 mu-m) were manufactured
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of the measured fission
           cross section. The uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) High limit of counting error.
           (ERR-2) The losses of ions connected with the
           absorption inside the targets and aluminum foils and
           with multi-scattering.
