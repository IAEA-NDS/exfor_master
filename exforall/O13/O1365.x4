FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) The U-400M and U-400 cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The helium isotopes were produced using the
           primary ion beams of B-11(18.5-MeV/A) and
           Li-7(35.5MeV/A).
           In first case B-11 ion beam bombarded a 200-mum thick
           tantalum target stoping the primary beam and secondary
           particles with Z<5 were produced.  The intensities of
           He-4(He-6) with an energy of 54-(50)-MeV and a 3%
           resolution reached  3000 (300) particles /per second
           and a purity of 98(95)% were obtained.
           In  second case the striping of proton from the Li-7 on
           the 1.1-mm carbon target was used.  The intensity of
           He-6 was  6000- particles per second.
SAMPLE     The special 'sandwich-type' piles of targets of Bi-209,
            820-mug/cm**2 thickness, 55-mum thick mylar films for
           registration of fission fragments and additional
           absorbers made of Al(60-200-mum) were manufactured.
           The aluminum-foils and bismuth targets were tested on
           uranium contamination using neutron activation method.
DETECTOR   (SILI) For monitoring the secondary beam.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of the measured fission
           cross section. The uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1) High limit of counting error.
           (ERR-2) The losses of ions connected with the
           absorption inside the targets and aluminium foils and
           with multi-scattering.
           (EN-ERR).The error is shown by authors on figure.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Excitation energy of compound nuclei.
STATUS     (CURVE).By Cajad.
HISTORY    (20060402C) S B
           (20070528U) Last checking has been done.
