TITLE      Alpha-induced reaction on natural erbium.

           used to determine the beam energy and to calculate the
           alpha-particles flux.

DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
SAMPLE     The target was composed of several foils of natural
           erbium, thickness 11.28-mg/cm**2, purity 99.9%.
           Aluminium and copper foils were interleaved in erbium
           stack to degrade the beam energy and to monitor the ion
           current and maximum incident energy.
METHOD     (STTA) The target stack was thick enough to stop the
            85-MeV internal alpha beam.
           (INTB) No absolute beam energy determination was
           performed in this experiment.  The authors observed
           excellent agreement incident beam energy with known
           excitation function of monitor reaction.
           (ACTIV) An information about irradiation and cooling
           times is not given.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY,AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main sources of error in the cross sections
           are the uncertainties in the photopeak areas and in the
           efficiency calibration.
           (ERR-1,,5.) High limit of uncertainty of first factor.
           The importance of the factor depends on the area value
           and its contribution to the total error is always lower
           than 5%.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of efficiency calibration.
