TITLE      Radiative capture of deuterons in Ba and Au
AUTHOR     (R.Kantus, W.-D.Schmidt-Ott)
INSTITUTE  (2GERGOE)
REFERENCE  (J,ZP/A,291,377,1979)
SAMPLE     Targets of natural BaCl(2) and of Au were used.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERGOE)
METHOD     (INTB) Used current of deuteron beam was to be 10 uA.
           (SITA)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental cross section values are
           compared with compound nuclear reaction cross sections
COMMENT    -By authors. In order to compare the experimental cross
           section values and the semi-experimental values with
           theory, absolute cross section for the two (d,gamma)
           reactions were calculated.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An analysis is not given.
HISTORY    (20060327C) By CAJAD.
           (20060331U) Last checking has been done.

DECAY-DATA (57-LA-140,40.HR,DG,1596.,0.96)
SAMPLE      BaCl(2) (71.7% of Ba-138) was compressed, packed in
           10 um Al-foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 30 minutes irradiation by a deuteron beam.
           (GSPEC) Of each sample three spectra were taken in
           consecutive 22 hours periods starting 48 hours after
           bombardment.

REACTION   (79-AU-197(D,G)80-HG-199-M,,SIG)
DECAY-DATA (80-HG-199-M,42.6MIN,DG,158.,0.53)
SAMPLE     Au-foils of 22 um thickness.  After the bombardments
           the produced Hg was separated from the remaining Au.
           An irradiated Au-foil was heated in vacuum to 800
           centigrade and the evaporating Hg collected in 1 cm3
           quartz flask, which was held at the temperature of
           liquid nitrogen.  It was carefully checked that at
           least 97% of the produced Hg was transferred to the
           flask, which was subsequently sealed off.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) A calibrated 10 mm in diam. x 7 mm intrinsic
           Ge-detector with a resolution of 480 eV at
           122 keV was used.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The duration of irradiation was to be 15 min.
           (GSPEC) The decay was measured from 15 to 200 min.
           after bombardment in counting intervals of 45  min..
COMMENT    -By authors. The comparison with well known cross
           section values of the 197-Au(d,2n) reaction were
           performed.
           2.  An upper limit of 0.5% was found for (alpha,p+n)
           reactions contributing to (d,gamma) cross section
           values.
CORRECTION On 158-keV gamma-rays attenuation in the quartz (4%).
