HISTORY    (20060327C)
           (20060331U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Targets of natural BaCl(2) and of Au were used.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERGOE)
METHOD     (INTB) Used current of deutron beam was to be 10
           muamperes.
           (SITA) See SAMPLE
ADD-RES    (COMP).The experimental cross section values are
           compared with compound nuclear reaction cross sections
COMMENT    -By authors. In order to compare the experimental cross
           section values and the semi-experimental values with
           theory, absolute cross section for the two (d,g)
           reactions were calculated.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An analysis is not given.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainties are shown on figures.
STATUS     (CURVE) By CAJAD.

SAMPLE      BaCl(2) (71.7% of Ba-138) was compressed, packed in
           10-mumeters Al-foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 30 minutes irradiation by a deuteron beam.
           (GSPEC) Of each sample three spectra were taken in
           consecutive 22 hours periods starting  48  hours  after
           bombardment.

SAMPLE     Au-foils of 22-mum thickness.  After the bombardments
           the produced Hg was separated from the remaining Au.
           An irradiated Au-foil was heated in vacuum to 800
           centigrades and the evaporating Hg collected in 1 cm3
           quatz flask, which was held at the temperature of
           liquid nitrogen.  It was carefully checked that at
           least 97% of the produced Hg was transferred to the
           flask, which was subsequently sealed off.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The duration of irradiation was to be 15
           minutes.
           (GSPEC) The decay was measured from 15 to 200 minutes
           after bombardment in counting intervals of 45  minutes.
COMMENT    -By authors. The comparision with well known cross
           section values of the 197-Au(d,2n) reaction were
           performed.
           2.  An upper limit of 0.5% was found for (alpha,p+n)
           reactions contributing to (d,gamma) cross section
           values.
CORRECTION On 158-KeV gamma-rays attenuation in the quartz (4%).
