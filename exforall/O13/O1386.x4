TITLE      Yield of near-target product interaction of 47 MeV/A
           12-C ions with bismuth targets
AUTHOR     (Zongwei Li, Zhizheng Zhao, Weifan Yang, Xianghua Zeng)
INSTITUTE  (3CPRIMP)
REFERENCE  (J,JRN/L,212,409,1996)
REL-REF    (R,,D.Z.MOLZAHN,J,JRC,80,109,1983) The isotopic
           distributions of Po, Bi and the formation cross
           sections of at, Rn, with the reaction of 86 MeV/A
           12-C bombarding Bi and thin Pb targets.
SAMPLE     The targets were 1.28 g/cm2 Bi2-O3 powders.
           According to calculation of the authors, 12-C
           particles were completely stopped in the target
           powders.
           The Al foils of 6.8 mum thickness were installed in
           front of the targets.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(6-C-12,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) To measure the gamma-decay spectra of the
           separated sources and unseparated target powders.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,3CPRIMP) HIRFL
METHOD     (EXTB) The average beam current intensity of 47 MeV/A
           12-C was 8 nanoAmperes.  The irradiation beam time was
           Separated for several sections in order to make mother
           - daughter decay modifications and to obtain the
           average production cross sections of residues.
           (BCINT) The beam current was monitored by a Faraday
           cup.  Both methods of beam current measurements gave
           the same results within the limit of error.
           (ACTIV) The whole irradiation time was 6.8 hours.
           (GSPEC) Off-line gamma-spectroscopic method.
           (CHSEP) Reaction products from a part irradiated target
           were separated by a standard radiochemical separation
           method.
ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
CORRECTION Decay correction of the experimental values was
           provided by the measured yields of mother isotopes.
           Partial isotope cross-sections were obtained from the
           correction of mother decay effects, similar to the
           method of decay correction of mass distribution and
           charge distribution in order to get independent yields.
