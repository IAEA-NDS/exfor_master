DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
SAMPLE     Each stack consisted of several samarium foils with
           thickness 18.7-mg/cm**2, purity 99.9%.
           Aluminium and copper foils were interleaved in samarium
           stack to degrade the beam energy and to monitor the ion
           current and maximum incident energy.
METHOD     (STTA) The target stack was thick enough to stop the
            87-MeV internal alpha beam.
           (INTB) No absolute beam energy determination was
           performed in this experiment.  The authors observed
           excellent agreement incident beam energy with known
           excitation function of monitor reaction.
           (ACTIV) An information about irradiation and cooling
           times is not given.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY,AREA)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty, which is produced by:
           (ERR-1)  The uncertainty in the measurement of foil
           thickness was 2%.
           (ERR-2) The error due to energy fluctuations was 0.3%.
           (EN-ERR1) The error of incident alpha-particle energy
           in each foil of the stack was about 5%.
           (EN-ERR2) Estimated uncertainty in the energy for the
           region of 20-70 MeV was +-1.5-MeV.

             1. To get presentation of cr.section in usual form,
           someone should multiplying values on the average atomic
           mass of target (in this case: ~150.36)
             2. Half-life value of Eu-146 is incorrect. According
           to ENSDF  t1/2=4.61 days.  The authors suppose, that a
           check of half-lives and gamma-rays energies was
           carried out.  Therefore a misprint can not be excluded.
             3. Half-life of 146-Gd is 48.37 days. Therefore
           Eu-146 production due to radioactive decay 146-Gd is
           very  small.
             /By authors/ Only Sm-144(alpha,n+p) reaction take
           place up to 40 MeV of energy.
