           nuclear reactions of U-236 with 21 to 60-MeV He-3-ions.

SAMPLE     Targets of UO(2) were prepared by multiple thermal
           decomposition of uranium nitrate cellulose painted on
           10- and 100-mumeters thick Al-backing.  The average
           thickness of the U-236 layer was about 100-mug/cm**2.
           The thickness variations were within 3%.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The results are discussed and compared with
           previous data on the other reactions yielding the same
           final products.
           (TTY-C).The calculated thick-target yields of Pu-236,
            Pu-237, Pu-238 and Np-235.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV) The K-130 cyclotron of the University
            of Jyvaskyla.
METHOD     (EXTB) The beam current was approximately 3 muA at
           41-MeV and 0.5 muA at 60-MeV He3 beam.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time, 4 hours at 41-MeV and
           20-hours at 60-MeV.
           (STTA) In each irradiation six U-236 targets and
           energy-degrading Al-foils of different thickness were
           mounted in a multiple target system on two water-cooled
           Al-plates.  The He-3 ion energy at each target was
           calculated from the range-energy relation-ships in Al
           and in the target materials.
           (CHSEP)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR1) The initial energy spread of the He-3 ion
           beam.
           (EN-ERR2) The energy spread in the last foil.
COMMENT    -By authors: two irradiations of U-236 targets were
           performed with 43- and 60-MeV He-3 ion beams. The
           initial energy spread of the He-3 ion beam was +-0.2-
           MeV.

COMMENT    -By compiler.  Np-235 production is possible across
            U-236(He3,4n)Pu-235 ----electron capture-->Np-235 and
            (He3,p+3n)Np-235 reactions.
           -By authors: in order to determine the activity of
           Np-235 and Pu-237 in the irradiated uranium targets,
           neptunium and plutonium should be chemically separated
           from each other and from uranium and fission products.
           Method of extraction chromatography was used.
