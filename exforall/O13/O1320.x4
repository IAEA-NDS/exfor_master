FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD) The LNL-tandem van de Graaff accelerator
            with energies ranging from 31 to 39-MeV.
SAMPLE     Pb-208 targets of two different thicknesses were used-
            150-mug/cm**2 with 10-mug/cm**2 carbon backing
           and 200-mug/cm**2 self-supporting.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (COINC) The exclusive breakup process was studied via
            alpha+d and alpha+p coincidences.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Detector was the 8-pi-lp device, consisting
            of two parts-a 'wall' and a'ball.The ball consists
            of 126-telescopes, each telescope consist of 300-mum
            delta silicon detector, followed by 5-mm CsI(Tl)
            E-detector.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Coupled-channels calculation.
            Spectra of a ring B-delta-E detector collected with
            three different targets-Pb-208 200-mug/cm**2(E=31-MeV)
            and Pb-208 150-mug/cm**2 onto C-12 10-mug/cm**2(E=31--
            MeV) and only C-12 20-mug/cm**2(E=29-MeV) were
            reported on figure 2.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross sections for the inclusive
           breakup events were evaluated from the counts of the
           alpha bump plus the events occurring between the Li-6
           elastic peak and the Li-6 inelastic peak from the first
           excited state of Pb-208.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross sections for the exclusive
           breakup events were evaluated for the a-p channel from
           the coincidence data only. For the a-d channel was
           added to the coincidence data the contribution from
           the peak at 1.5-MeV relative energy.
           The exclusive angular distributions from both onefold
           and twofold coincidence events turned out to be the
           same within statistical errors.
CORRECTION *By authors*.The exclusive coincidence data have been
           corrected for various factors affecting the efficiency
           of the detector system-
           dead area is approximately 20%,
           reduced efficiency of the deuteron(proton) detection-
           the correction factors(fraction of lost counts) finally
           adopted for the deuterons were 38%, 34%, 30% and 22%
           for 31-, 33-, 35- and 39-MeV beam energy,respectively.
           In proton case an average fixed correction factor of
            39% for each energy was applied.
           Absence of detector at backward angles(angle > or equal
            163-degree) at forward angles(angle < or equal
            34-degree) and around 90-degree(10-degree).
