SAMPLE     High purity foils of natural Ti and Ni, 50+/-1 mumeters
           thickness, and Zr, 259+/-5 mumeters thickness, were
           used as target.
MONITOR    (29-CU-63(P,2N)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
           (29-CU-65(P,N)30-ZN-65,,SIG) The reactions were used to
           measure beam energy and current.

DETECTOR   (HPGE)  An  energy  resolution of 1.69 KeV for the 1332
           KeV transition of 60-Co.  A covariant method was used
           to make the energy and efficiency calibration.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLIPE) The Cyclone-30 cyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA) Foils of Al with various thickness were inserted
           between the samples for energy degradation.   In  front
           of each sample were placed Cu foils of 50+/-1 mumeters
           thickness for energy and current monitoring,

           (20060102U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors quoted for the cross sections
           include uncertainties in the determination of the
           proton flux, counting statistics and reproducibility of
           the photopeak integration, absolute detector
           efficiency, target thickness and half-life, branching
           ratios and decay and measurement times.
           (EN-ERR) An analysis is not given.
