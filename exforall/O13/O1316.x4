HISTORY    (20070517C)
           (20070517U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     A 2-mg/cm**2 Sn-120 target was used.
ADD-RES    (COMP).CDCC calculations.
DETECTOR   (TELES) The detection system consisted of two pairs of
           delta-E-E detector telescopes placed symmetrically.
           Delta-E is 230-mum thick p-n junction silicon detector
           and E-detector is 4-mm thick lithium drifted silicon
           detectors. The detectors were energy calibrated using
            5.486-MeV alpha particles from Am-241 sources.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2UK UK) The Daresbury laboratory, Warrington.
           The beam polarization was determined from the
           H-1(Li-7,a)He-4 reaction using purpose-built,
           downstream polarimeter.
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
STATUS     (TABLE) The data were received from N.J.Davis.

COMMENT    *By authors*.For this reaction spectra were
           reconstructed corresponding to breakup via the O+
           ground state of Be-8. The unresolved ground 9/2+ and
            0.31-MeV 1/2- first excited states of In-119 were
           found to be populated strongly in these spectra.

REACTION   (50-SN-120(3-LI-7,3-LI-6)50-SN-121,20/PAR,POL/DA,,TAP)
COMMENT    *By authors*.For this reaction spectra were
           reconstructed corresponding to breakup via the 2.18-MeV
            3+ state of Li-6. There latter spectra were observed
           to contain three strong structures corresponding to
           the unresolved ground 3/2+, 0.006-MeV 11/2- first
           excited and 0.06-MeV 1/2+ second excited states.
