TITLE      Excitation functions for production of heavy residues
           in the interaction of C-12 with Ta-181.

SAMPLE     The Ta-181 targets, 800 and 1000-mug/cm**2 thick and
           Al-catchers 810-mug/cm**2 thick, downstream
           the targets, were used.

           up.
ADD-RES    The analysis the excitation functions data of isotopes
           and isomers allows one to estimate the reaction cross
           section and the cross sections for complete fusion of
           C-12 and the incomplete fusion of Be-8 and alpha-
           fragments with tantalum.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYLNS)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation times varied from 30 to 60
           minutes at the various energies, according to the
           half-lives of the isotopes that were expected to be
           produced with the highest intensity.
           (GSPEC) Gamma ray activities were counted for several
           weeks.  To reduce experimental errors authors analysed,
           when it was possible, up to four characteristic gamma
           lines for each isotope.  The production cross section
           was then obtained as a weighted mean of the values
           deduced from the activity of each gamma ray.
COMMENT    -By authors. The cross section for cumulative
           production of a given residue is the sum of the cross
           section for its independent production and the cross
           sections for independent production of its precursors
           multiplied by numerical coefficients proportional to
           the branching ratio for the decay of the precursors to
           the residue and depending on the half-life of the
           precursors and the residue.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T,10.,15.) The cross sections are usually affected
           by an uncertainty varying from 10 to 15% mainly due to:
             * the statistical error in gamma-intensity,
             * the uncertainty in the background subtraction,
             * the uncertainty in the detector dead time,
               usualy a few percent all together;
           (ERR-1) the uncertainty in target thickness due
           to local thickness disuniformities approx.5%;
           (ERR-2,,5.) the uncertainty in the beam fluence <5%;
           (ERR-3,,10.) the uncertainty in the abundance of the
           residue characteristic gamma lines usually < 10%.
           In a few cases the abundances are known with an
           uncertainty much greater than that given above.
