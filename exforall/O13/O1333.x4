SAMPLE     The target was prepared by closely mixing and pressing
            Mg- and Cu-powdered metals, 80% and 20%, respectively.
           The final pellet was 1-cm in diameter and 0.1-cm thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLIEN) CV-28 cyclotron.
METHOD     (CHSEP) The chemical separation was performed 6-days
           after the bombardment to allow the 14.9-hr Na-24 to
           decay.  The overall yield for the process was higher
           than 98%.
ERR-ANALYS Any information is absent.
