SAMPLE      Ten kg of uranium oxide powder , mixed with a small
           portion of ammonium carbonate, placed in a glass
           container, surrounded by a few cm of paraffin.
           Container was inserted as close as possible to
           neutron source. Irradiation time ~3 hr.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ASEP) Inert gases from U were pumped off by a
           Toepler pump, using the gas given off by the ammonium
           carbonate (NH(3), CO(2), H(2)O) as carrier of activity.
           Isotopes separation was started in mass-spectrograph
            ~1/2 hr after stopping of cyclotron.
           Mass-spectrograph run time ~1 hr.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Formulas 1, 2 were used.

ANALYSIS    Average for two series of measurements.
            Contribution of ling-lived Kr-85 was neglected.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
           article.

COMMENT    Of compiler. In the article there is no information
           about incident neutron energy, about energy of
           deuterons at cyclotron. EN-DUMMY was supposed by
           compiler as 1.MeV.
