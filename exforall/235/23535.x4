FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Pneumatic tube of the KUR
SAMPLE     A Np-237 standardized solution (0.5 mol/L(M) HCl)
            supplied by Nycomed Amersham plc. was used  for
            Np-237 samples.
           Six Np-237 standardized solutions equivalent to about
            200 Bq were dropped onto pieces of glass micro
            filters by a glass capillary.
           The filters were dried by an infrared ramp.
           Three sets of samples with and without neutron filters
            were used for the experiments.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cadmium-difference method.
           To set 0.133 eV as cut-off energy, Gd foils thickness
            of 25 um was used as neutron filter.
           Wires of Au/Al alloy (Au: 0.112 +- 0.01 wt%, 0.510 mm
            in diameter) and Co foils (Co: 99.9 +- 0.1% in purity,
            5 um in thickness) were used to monitor neutron
            fluxes at an irradiation position.
           Three sets of samples with and without the Gd filters
            were used for the experiments.
           The irradiation time was 600 s and the live time of
            the measurement was 13,704 s.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 25% relative to 3'x3' NaI detector efficiency
            and resolution of about 1.9 keV at 1.3 MeV.
           The peak detection efficiencies were determined with
            a set of calibrated mixed sources: Sn-133, Cs-137,
            Y-88, and Co-60.
           Distance between samples and end cap of HPGe detector
            was about 10 cm.
CORRECTION Because of sample condition, no correction is required.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Following uncertainties were propagated:
            - Statistical
            - Half-lives of Np-237,238
            - Emission probabilities of Pa-233,Np-238
            - Gamma-ray detection efficiency
            - Neutron Flux components
