FACILITY   (REAC,2GRCATH) 5MW swimming pool "Democritos" reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Fission neutrons moderated to
            optimum epi-cadmium flux at sample position.
            No other details in the article.
SAMPLE      Few milligrams of Pa-231 oxide in a powder form
           in a Cd capsule put inside a polyethylene sample
           carrier.
COMMENT     Of authors.
            Cd capsule was necessary to avoid fission by thermal
           neutrons of Pa-232 produced via n-gamma reaction.
           Pa-232 fission cross-section with thermal neutrons is
           very high, while for Pa-231 is only 4.3 mb.
DETECTOR    No information in the article.
METHOD      50 repetitive cycles of measurements.
            Irradiation time 20 sec,
            cooling time 5 sec,
            measuring time 272 sec.
ADD-RES     Table 2 - calculated fractional cumulative yields.
