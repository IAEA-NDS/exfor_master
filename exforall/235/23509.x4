REACTION   ((36-KR-78(N,ABS),,SIG,,SPA)/
           (36-KR-84(N,ABS),,SIG,,SPA))
INC-SPECT   Pile neutrons, flux 8.E+11 n/(cm2*sec),
SAMPLE      15 cm3 of Kr at atmospheric pressure
METHOD     (ACTIV,ASEP) Irradiation time 7 days at Harwell,
           Kr was electromagnetically separated,
           15 hr from end of irradiation to start of separation,
           measurement time 20 hr at Sweden.
DETECTOR        Beta-tube with mica window of 2.2 mg/cm2 thickness
           window.
DECAY-DATA (36-KR-79-G,34.HR)  Measured value 36+-1 hr
           (36-KR-85-M,4.4HR)
ANALYSIS    Derived from measured activity spectrum ( fig.7).
           Agree with
           E.J.Hoagland,K.Sugarman, NNES 9,paper 70 (ref.50H12)
           if take into account K-capture;
            0.096 b for Kr-84, 2.0 b for Kr-78
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. Mean energy of pile neutrons is not
           given in the article, supposed by compiler as wide
           spectrum with EN-DUMMY=0.0253eV
