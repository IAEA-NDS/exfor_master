SAMPLE      Metal samples: U - 33.6 kg, Th 23.8 kg.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Eight proportional counters filled  with B-10F(3)
           embedded symmetrically in the wax around axis of hole.
           . Absolute intensity of the arrangement for neutron
           detection from calibrated Ra-Be source was ~ 1. % .
METHOD      Cube (70cm side) of paraffin wax with central
           cylindrical hole was used. Cd cylinder was placed in
           the center hole to eliminate any effects caused by slow
           neutrons induced fission.

ANALYSIS   Energy spectra of spontaneous fission of two nuclides
           U and Th were assumed as approximately the same.
