           to absorption in U235 brtween 1 eV and 100 eV incident

           At 400 pulses/sec.
INC-SPECT   Slow neutrons . Energy < 0.045 eV .
            Neutron beam was monitored by counting neutrons
           scatterired from lead block at the entrance to the
           final collimator tube.
SAMPLE      U-235 metal disc of 3.1 inch diameter, 0.2 inch
           thickness, on a Al frame.
           U-235 - 92.7%, U-238 - 7.24 %, Al - 0.017%,
           Ni - 0.05%, Si - 0.0085%, Fe - 0.032 %, Cr - 0.003 %,
           W - 0.01 %, Mo-0.0225%, B - 0.0005% . U-234 (~1.%)
           included in U-238 content.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillating plastic detectors, 4.5 cm long,
           4.5 cm diameter, viewed by EMI type 6099D
           photopultiplier. Datectors were placed on either side
           of the sample.
           (BF3) For transmission measurement. Detection
           efficiency proportional to SQRT(E) within 1 % down
           to 1.2 eV. 4% deviation at 0.1 eV.
           (BF3) For scattering measurement.
           Annual ring of 10-BF(3) counters, sample in the center
           of ring. Efficiency is proportional to SQRT(E).
           Measuremet with and without B4C sleeve surrounding
           the sample.
METHOD     (TOF,COINC) Flight path 7.36 . Fission events as
           function of time-of-flight. Coincidences from pair
           detectors.Resolution 0.1 microsec.
           Fission detection efficiency in calibrated Pu-240
           SF source was measured to be ~1%.
           Tested by U and Cd samples.
           (TRN) Thransmission was measured by three 10-BF(3)
           counters replaced the sample.
           .Lead sample was used to count scattered neutrons.
           Resolution 0.22microsec/m at scattering measurement,
            0.29 microsec/m at transmission and fission
            measurements.
CORRECTION  For overlap neutrons from previous pulse < 10.% .
            For backgraund measured when beam was swiched off
           < 2.%.

           Disagree due to effect of resolution.
ANALYSIS   (SLA) Derived by single-level Breit-Wigner formula (7)
           ETA=NU*(GANNAfis/(GAMMAfis+GAMMAgamm))
           from measured ETA assuming that NU and gamma-width do
           not fluctuate from resonance to resonance.
FLAG       (1.) These estimates of the fission widths are
           probably in error on account of neglect ot the effect
           of resolution ( authors' comment).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
           article.
