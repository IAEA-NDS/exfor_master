           by 14-MeV neutrons

            Details for counting corrections.
INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
FACILITY   (CCW,2UK HAR)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutrons were checked and found to be
           negligible.
SAMPLE      Natural uranium. The U-235 effect was ignored and
           experiments considered to be effectively the U-238
           fission.
            ~40 g weight of uranium metal, cylinder
DETECTOR   (PROPC) @PI-beta-proportional flow counter, methane as
           the counting gas.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Chemical yields were obtained by direct
           weighting.
CORRECTION For self-absorption, self-scattering, back-scattering,
           conversion electrons,growth of daughter nuclides, other
           genetic phenomena.

DECAY-DATA ((1.)48-CD-115-G,54.HR)
           ((2.)48-CD-115-M,43.D)  Estimated.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,92-U-238(N,F),PR,NU) Used to plot mirror points.
            Value was estimated from the best fit of mass curve.
ANALYSIS    Fission yield curve ( dependence from mass) was
           normalized to 200 % area under it.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation.
           An error of +-10% in Mo-99 yield due to the absent
           values of fission yields for mass 99 - 111.
