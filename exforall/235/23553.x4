TITLE       The yield of Cs137 in the pile neutron fission of
           natural uranium

FACILITY   (REAC,2UK HAR) BEPO
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Pile neutrons. No other information in the
           article.
SAMPLE      Four peaces of U rod, ~2mm diameter, ~1 g weight.
           Two were irradiated two weeks, and two - four weeks.
DETECTOR   (D4PI) Methane flow 4PI proportional counter.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Cooling time ~ a week. Dissolved in nitric acid
           containing 2.24 mg of Ba++ and 2.46 mg of Cs+.
           Details of chemical separation - given in the article.
CORRECTION For counting losses ( < 0.5% for Ba),
           for background ( <1.% for Ba),
           for aliquots and chemical yield,
           self-absorption (< 0.5 % for Ba, < 2.% for Cs)
