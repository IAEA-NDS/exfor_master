INC-SOURCE Deuteron beam of ~50 microA at 930keV bombards targets
           of heavy phosphoric acid (neutrons of 1.8 - 3.75 MeV)
           or carbon (neutrons of 0.35-0.55 MeV), mounted on a
           brass plate.
           Measurements were done at different angles relative to
           the deuteron beam.
           (D-D)
           (D-C12)
SAMPLE     Be samples - cylinders of 3.8 cm diameter, placed at
           27 cm distance from the neutron source.
           . Be (75.4%) - Al(24.6%) alloy .
           . Separate Al sample.
           . Pure Be samples.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Ionization chamber of 2.5 cm diameter, filled
            with 3 atm of argon and 0.7 atm of hydrogen, placed
            at 27 cm from Be sample.
           . Similar ionization chamber - to monitor the primary
           neutron density.
           Arrangement of sample and ionization chamber moves in
           horizontal plane and was fixed at angle between 0 and
           150 deg angle.
METHOD     (TRN)
CORRECTION  For backgrounds - ~10%.
            For neutron beam variation.
            For spread of incident neutrons to obtain monoenergy
            cross section - maximally 6% for Be.
            For finite size of samples and ionization chamber <1%.
