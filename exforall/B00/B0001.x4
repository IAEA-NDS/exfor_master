           The Data of Saha Seem to be Shifted Systematically
           Toward Higher Energies. This May be at Least Partly Due
           To an Overestimation of the Projectile Energy.

           In the Paper of Gadioli Et Al. Calculated Excitation
           Functions are Compared to Experimental Data of Several
           Authors. The Results of Saha Et Al. Below 30 MeV
           Were Assumed to be Overestimated. This was Concluded
           By Comparing Total Reaction Cross Sections Measured
           Via the Beam Attenuation Method to a Cross Section
           Calculated As the Sum of the Individual Cross Sections

           In the Paper of Gadioli Et Al. Calculated Excitation
           Functions are Compared to Experimental Data of Several
           Authors. The Results of Saha Et Al. Below 30 MeV
           Were Assumed to be Overestimated. This was Concluded
           By Comparing Total Reaction Cross Sections Measured
           Via the Beam Attenuation Method to a Cross Section
           Calculated As the Sum of the Individual Cross Sections
           As Quoted by Saha. This Sum Reveals a Much Larger
           Value Than the Directly Measured Total Reaction Cross
           Section.

COMMENT    - By Kachapag -
           High Spin State  (4-). In the Meanwhile There was Found
           A Low Spin State (1+) With a Half-Life of 4.6 Sec Which
           Decays Via B+ and Ec Transitions to Sr-84. Since No
           Isomeric Transition was Found, It is Unclear Which
           Isomer is the Ground State. It is Adopted by the
           Compiler That the Measured Cross Section is Only
           Partial.
           - By CAJAD - According to ENSDF Ground State of Y-84
           Has Half-Life 4.6 Sec.
