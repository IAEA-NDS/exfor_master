TITLE      Excitation Function and Recoil Ranges of at-211
           Produced Through Ar-40 + Bi-209 Transfer Reactions
AUTHOR     (R.BIMBOT, D.GARDES, M.F.RIVET)
INSTITUTE  (2FR PAR)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,4,2180,1971)
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,EDEG,REC)
           Projectile Energies were Calculated According to
           L.C.Northcliffe Et Al., Nucl.Data A7,233(1970)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2FR PAR).Alice Accelerator at Orsay
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Errors of the Cross Sections Result
           Mainly from the Statistical Uncertainties in the
           Activity Measurement and the Beam-Flux Determination.
           (EN-ERR). Any Information is Absent.

           (84-PO-211-G,,A,7450.).In Equilibrium with at-211
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The Decay Curve of the 7.45 MeV Alpha Peak was
           Resolved Into Two Components Resulting from the
           Exponential Decay of at-211 and the Accumulation
           Of at-211 from Rn-211 (HALF-LIFE IS 14.6 HR).
ADD-RES    (RANGE)
SAMPLE     Bi-209, Thickness 1 Mg/Cm**2, Evaporated onto 0.6 and
           1 Mg/Cm**2 Aluminium.
STATUS     (SPSDD,B0113018)
           Energies had to be Corrected For a Systematic Error in
           The Cyclotron Parameters Used, Cross Sections were
           Corrected Due to Better Calculation of Selfabsorption.
