METHOD     (BCINT,SITA,EXTB)
           During the Irradiation Periods of 156 Msec the Detector
           Was Shielded Against Protons Elastically Scattered from
           The Target Backing by Use of a Chopper Disk.
HISTORY    (19781121C)Lakw
           (19940711A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19980610A) Lower Case. Err-Analys is Corrected.
           (20011010U) Last checking has been done.

REACTION   (4-BE-7(P,G)5-B-8,,SIG,,,EXP)
RAD-DET    (4-BE-8,A)
DECAY-DATA (5-B-8,0.77SEC,B+). Measured  Beta-Delayed Alphas
           From Dissociation of be-8 Formed in Beta-Decay of B-8.
FACILITY   (CCW,2GERMST)
SAMPLE     Be-7-Oxide, Thickness (2.37+-0.21)E16 Atoms be-7/Cm**2
           Deposited on 0.2 mm Tantalum in a Spot of 4 mm in
           Diameter.
           Be-7 was Produced by Irzadiating Metallic Li with
           7.5 MeV Protons from the Bochum Dynamitron. The Yield
           From a 40 Hr Bombardment at 20 Micro-Amps was 0.5
           Micrograms.
           The Thickness was Determined from the Activity of the
           478 KeV Gamma-Rays Having an Abundance of 0.104.
           The Inhomogeneity in Thickness was Determined to be
           Less Than 3 %.
DETECTOR   (SOLST).Surface Barrier Detector, Thickness 0.2 mm
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Error Consists Mainly of the Statistical
           Error of About 0.02 Microbarns and of the Same Amount
           Due to the Uncertainty in the Number of be-7 Nuclei Per
           Cm**2.
CORRECTION Background Correction For the Delayed Alpha Particle
           Spectrum was Achieved by Recording a Spectrum While
           The Accelerator was Turned Off. Apart from Noise at
           Low Energies No Background Count Above 0.95 MeV was
           Observed.
