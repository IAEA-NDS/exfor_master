           The Collimated Recoiling Compound Nuclei from a Thin
           Target Travel Down an Evacuated Path Surronded For the
           First 12 Inches in Near 2Pi Axial Geometry by Plastic
           Foils.
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,REC,TOF)
SAMPLE     92-U-235, Enrichment 93% U-235, Thickness
           48 Microgram/Cm**2,Evaporated onto a Ni- And Cu-Backing
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Tabulated Errors are Standard Deviations
           Of  a Least-Squares Fit to a Two-Component Decay Curve.
           Systematic Errors are not Included.
ADD-RES    (POT,STRUC)
           The Excitation Energy of the 1120-Nsec Spontaneous -
           Fission Isomer of 237-Pu has Been Shown to be 0.30+-
           0.15 MeV Above That  of the 82-Nsec Isomer.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The Excitation Fucnions have Been Fitted with a
           Modified Jackson Neutron Evapration Model to Extract
           The Thresholds.

           It is Uncertain, Whether the 1120 Nsec Isomer Decays
           By Spontaneous Fission Directly or by Gamma Rays
           Feeding the 82 Nsec Isomer.
COMMENT    The Values have to be Divided by a Factor of About
           10**7 to Give Peak Ratios Consistent with Measured
           Absolute Values.
