PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (PROPC).Signals Proportional to De/Dx
           (NAICR).Signals Proportional to the Energy E
           By Means of Both Detectors Outgoing Particles were
           Identified.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)
CORRECTION Corrections For Scattering Effects from the Beam
           Defining Slits were Performed and Amounted to 2 Per
           Cent. Corrections Due to Multiple Scattering were
           Negligible.
ERR-ANALYS The Beam Energy was Kept Constant to +-0.15% and was
           And was Measured with a Precision of +-1%.
           (ERR-T) The Quoted Errors Include Contributions from
           Statistics, Beam-Current Integration (1%),
           Geometrical Factors, and Non-Uniformity of the Thin
           Targets, For Which the Mean Variation was Found to
           Be Considerably Smaller Than 4%.
ADD-RES    (ANGD)
           Angular Distributions were Measured For (P,A)- As Well
           As For (P,P')-Reactions. Data For the Latter are Given
           In the Publication.
           (TRCS)
           Only Charged-Particle (P,Q) Cross Sections were
           Determined from Which Total Reaction Cross Sections
           Can be Deduced by Adding the Corresponding (P,N)-Cross
           Sections Given in the Literature.
HISTORY    (19770816C)Lapf
           (19940704A) Some Corrections have Been Included by
            CAJAD
           (19971009A) Reaction Lines are Corrected.
           (20011010U) Last checking has been done.
