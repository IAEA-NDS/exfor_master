           In the Second Paper the Individual Formation Cross
           Sections For Pm-148-M and Pm-148-G from Th-232(A,F)
           Reaction are Contained
METHOD     (INTB,BCINT,SITA,CHSEP)
           The Mean Energy of the Projectiles in the Th-Foil
           Was Determined According to C.F.Williamson Et Al.,
           Cea-R3042(1966)
           Typical Beam Currents were 12-20 Microamperes.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Estimated from the Uncertainties in the
           Energies of the Projectiles Before Entering the
           Th-Foils, the Energy Loss in the Foil, and the Cross
           Sections For the Th-232(A,F) Reaction. The Latter were
           Used to Calculate the Average Projectile Energy in the
           Target Foils.
            (RATIO-ERR) Compounded from the Statistical Errors in
           The Activity Measurements, the Uncertainties in the
           Decay Schemes and Counter Efficiencies.
           (DATA-ERR) Estimated from Random Errors of Peak Area
           Determination and Systematic Errors of Detector
           Efficiencies, Decay Schemes and Chemical Yields.
ADD-RES    In Addition to the Isomeric Ratios from the Charged
           Particle Induced Reaction the Paper Contains Isomeric
           Ratios from Thermal Neutron Induced Fission of U-233
           And U-235. The Results are (3.0+-0.5)For the Reaction
           92-U-233(N,F)61-Pm-148-M/G and (2.6+0.9-0.5) For the
           Reaction 92-U-235(N,F)61-Pm-148-M/G.
           Values For the Average Intrinsic Spin of the Primary
           Fragments are Deduced from the Isomeric Ratios, Using
           A Simple Statistical-Model Analysis.
           From the Individual Formation Cross Sections the
           Independent Fractional Chain Yield For Pm-148 and the
           Most Probable Charge For the Mass 148 Chain is Deduced
