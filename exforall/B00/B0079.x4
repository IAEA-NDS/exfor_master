TITLE      Excitation functions of reactions of 7 to 24 MeV He-3
           ions with Cu-63 and Cu-65

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,EDEG,BCINT,CHSEP)
           Stacks were bombarded at beam energy settings of 12 and
           24 MeV. In general cross sections from the 12 MeV beam
           agreed with the low energy cross sections from the
           24 MeV bombardments and should have uncertainties
           not greater than 0.25 MeV.
           The energies of the particles were determined
           before and after each bombardment by exposure
           emulsion plates to particles scattered out of the beam
           by an Au-foil. The energy calibration was taken from
           J.J.Wilkins,Aere-G/R664(1951) and were known to 0.15
           MeV. Additional measurements with a solid state
           detector for 25 MeV He3 and 15 MeV alphas agreed
           within 0.1 MeV.
           The energy degradation in the stacks were calculated
           by range-energy values which were derived from
           H.Bichsel Et Al.,Phys.Rev.105,1788(1957)
           H.Bichsel,Phys.Rev.112,1089(1958)

           P.E.Schambra et al.,Phys.Rev.120,1758(1960).
           The values used are listed in Tab.2 of the publication.
CORRECTION Corrections for recoil effects (about 1% at 10 MeV,
           3% at 24 MeV) were limited to the first Cu-foil and the
           Cu-foil immediately following an Al-foil in a stack,
           Because for such foils there is no influx of recoil
           products to compensate for recoil losses.
