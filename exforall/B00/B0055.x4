TITLE      Reactions of Protons with Ni-58 and Ni-60.

           The Maximum Proton Energy was 19 MeV. The Beam Current
           Was Measured with the Target Stack Withdrawn from
           The Beam.
           (STTA,EDEG)
           The Proton Energy in Each Foil was Calculated According
           To H.A.Bethe Et Al.  Experimental Nuclear Physics,
           Vol.1,(WILEY AND SONS,NEW YORK,1953), H.Bichsel Et Al.,

           At First All Directly Produced Co-Activities were
           Separated from Ni. After Ni-57 in the Ni-Fraction
           Had Decayed Completely a Second Ni/Co-Separation
           Was Performed and Co-57 from the Co-Fraction was
           Counted. The Activity Measured was Free of Co-56,
           Co-58 and Co-60 As Experimentally Shown.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data Uncertainty -
           The Data-Error Given is the Standard Deviation Due to
           Counting Only.
           The Cross Sections are Accurate to About 10%, Mainly
           Due to Variations in the Beam Current. The Consistency
           Of Cross Sections from Different Bombardments is
           About 10%.
              Energy Uncertainty -
           The Energy Errors Due to Initial Energy Spread (0.25
           MEV) And to Straggling are +-0.34 MeV at 8 MeV and
           +-0.28 MeV at 14 MeV.

           Data Above 12 MeV were Obtained by Subtracting the
           Ni-58(P,2P)Co-57 Cross Section from the Co-57
           Production Cross Section Measured with the Natural
           Ni-Target. At Lower Energies this Contribution is
           Negligible.
