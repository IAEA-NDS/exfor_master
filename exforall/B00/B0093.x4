           parameters in the 4 to 5.5 MeV energy region

           The compiler assumes flux measurement via beam current
           integration on the target, through no information is
           given in the publication.

DETECTOR   (LONGC).Boron Trifluoride
           Calibrated with a mock fission source having a strength
           known to about 5% accuracy.
SAMPLE     Natural element, thickness about 1 mg/cm**2, evaporated
           onto a Ta-backing thick enough to stop the proton beam.
COMMENT    No information is given, whether neutrons produced in
           the thick target-backing did disturb and how they were
           corrected for.
ERR-ANALYS 1. The cross sections given which are averages for
           several repeated measurements are believed to be about
           15% accurate. Neutrons emitted from the targets
           were measured with an instrumental error within about
           10%. The proton current was monitored to about 2%
           accuracy without giving details how this was done.
           2. The energy spread of the beam within the target due
           to straggling and primary inhomogeneity was about
           100 keV.
CORRECTION No corrections for charged-particle emission were made,
           since in the present energy region between Q-value and
           Coulomb barrier neutron emission is strongly favoured
           over charged particle emission.
