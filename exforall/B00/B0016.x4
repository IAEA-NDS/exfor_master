TITLE      Excitation functions of some monitor reactions
AUTHOR     (S.Meghir)
INSTITUTE  (1CANMCG) Department of chemistry
REFERENCE  (T,MEGHIR,196206)
            PhD thesis submitted to McGill Univ. in June 1962.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP,CHSEP)
SAMPLE     Target of 3 foils of natural aluminium, graphite and
           natural copper, where the beam impinged first on the
           Al-foil. The total target thickness never exceeded 84
           mg/cm**2.
           The following specifications are given:
           for Al - purity greater than 99.9 %, thickness
           13.30+-0.15 mg/cm**2.
           For C - prepared from high purity graphite electrodes,
           thickness between 18 and 25 mg/cm**2.
           For Cu - purity 99.99 %, thickness 45.57+-0.1 mg/cm**2.
ANALYSIS   The cross sections were determined by two independent
           measurements with beta- and gamma detectors,
           respectively.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) In case of the beta-measurements the monitor
           C-11 was counted with a gas proportional counter.
           (D4PI) The product nuclides Cu-64 and Na-24 with a
           4PI-counter.
           (NAICR) For the gamma-measurements a well-type
           scintillation counter was used in all cases.

DETECTOR   (PROPC) In case of the beta-measurements the monitor
           C-11 was counted with a gas proportional counter.
           (D4PI) The product nuclides Cu-64 and Na-24 with a
           4PI-counter.
CORRECTION Recoil losses were checked and found to be
           insignificant for the energy range and target
           thickness used.
FLAG       (1.) Irradiation No. 3; irradiation time 0.500 h.
           (2.) Irradiation No. 4; irradiation time 0.750 h.
           (3.) Irradiation No. 14; irradiation time 0.392 h.
           (4.) Irradiation No. 15; irradiation time 0.500 h.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The given errors are total errors (standard
           deviations) resulting from the combined measurements of
           product nuclide and monitor.
           This total error in the case of beta- consists of:
           decay data (+-2%),
           (ERR-S) Statistics (+-1 %)
           (ERR-1) Dilution factor (+-2%),
           (ERR-2) Self-absorption, absorption (+-2%),
           (ERR-3) Chemical yield (+-3%),
           (ERR-4) Target thickness (1%),
           (ERR-5) Beam stability (1%),
           (ERR-6) Abundance (+-1%),
           (MONIT-ERR) Monitor reaction values (+- 13%)
           additional errors are included for the monitor
           measurement
                    The energy spread of the beam was +-2 MeV.
