FACILITY   (SYNCY,1CANMCG)
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP,CHSEP)
SAMPLE     Target of 3 Foils of Natural Aluminium, Graphite and
           Natural Copper, Where the Beam Impinged First on the
           Al-Foil. The Total Target Thickness Never Exceeded 84
           Mg/Cm**2.

           For Al - Purity Greater Than 99.9 %, Thickness
           13.30+-0.15 Mg/Cm**2.
           For C - Prepared from High Purity Graphite Electrodes,
           Thickness Between 18 and 25 Mg/Cm**2.
           For Cu - Purity 99.99 %, Thickness 45.57+-0.1 Mg/Cm**2.

COMMENT    - By Kachapag -
           Meghir Used the Original Values Given by Aamodt Lowered
           By 13 % According to W.E.Crandall Et Al., Phys.Rev,101,
           329,1952.

ANALYSIS   The Cross Sections were Determined by Two Independent
           Measurements with Beta- And Gamma Detectors,
           Respectively.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) In Case of the Beta-Measurements the Monitor
           C-11 was Counted with a Gas Proportional Counter.
           (D4PI) The Product Nuclides Cu-64 and Na-24 with a
           4Pi-Counter.
           (NAICR) For the Gamma-Measurements a Well-Type
           Scintillation Counter was Used in All Cases.

           Thickness Used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Given Errors are Total Errors (STANDARD
           DEVIATIONS) Resulting from the Combined Measurements of
           Product Nuclide and Monitor. For the Beta-Measurement

           %, For the Gamma-Measurement to be 17 %.  As an Example

           Measurements of Errors from Statistics (+-1 %),

STATUS     (RNORM,B0016002)
           These Data Originally Measured by Meghir were
           Renormalized by G.B.Saha, Leading to a Change of the
           Shape of the Excitation Function, Especially in the
           Region of the Maximum. No Details were Given About
           The Reason of this Renormalization Nor the Procedure
           Applied. An Inquiry to Mcgill University of 28.2.1978
           Did not Yield Further Informations
