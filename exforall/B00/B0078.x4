TITLE      Production of neon-24 and sodium-24 in the 1-3 GeV
           proton bombardment of copper, silver, gold, and
           uranium targets

REL-REF    (R,,A.A.Caretto+,J,PR,110,1130,1958) Cross section for
           cumulative production of Na-24.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Cosmotron
METHOD     (INTB,CHSEP,SITA,MOSEP)
           after dissolution of the target foils in 1.8 to 2.5 min
           after the end of irradiation Ne-24 was separated from
           Na-24 within 20 sec. After Ne-24 had decayed to Na-24
           this nuclide was used in the different fractions either
           for the determination of the cumulative production of
           Ne-24 or the independent production of Na-24.
SAMPLE     Targets consisted of three 0.001 inch Al-foils and
           three 0.001 to 0.003 inch foils of the specified
           metal. The middle foils were used for monitoring and
           to determine Na-24 and Ne-24, respectively.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG,,,EVAL)
MONIT-REF  (B0022003,J.B.Cumming,J,ARN,13,261,1963)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
           used when sufficient Na-24 activity was present
           (PROPC)
           used at lower Na-24 activities. a few samples with
           very low counting rates were measured on low-level
           beta counters.
COMMENT    In approximately half the experiments the cumulative
           yield of Na-24 was measured also in one of the
           remaining foils. These cross sections agreed to +-15%
           with those of the sums of cumulative Ne-24 plus
           independent Na-24.
           Additional external irradiations of Cu and Ag targets
           at 3 GeV using a continuous flow system to collect the
           Ne-24 produced during the irradiation yielded values
           which agreed within +-10% with those obtained from
           internal irradiations. Thus No appreciable amount of
           Ne-24 compared to Na-24 was lost during the internal
           irradiations as a result of target heating.
           In general two independent experiments were performed
           for determination of the cross section ratios. Four
           experiments were made for Ag and U with 1 GeV protons
           and three experiments for Au with 3 GeV protons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The ratio-errors given are the mean
           deviations of several runs or 10% if the mean deviation
           is smaller than this figure as stated by the author.
           Uncertainties of +-(10 to 15) seconds in the separation
           times, the quantity known with least precision,
           resulted in uncertainties of 5 to 10%. No further
           details are given.
