TITLE      Production of Neon-24 and Sodium-24 in the 1-3 GeV
           Proton Bombardment of Copper, Silver, Gold, and
           Uranium Targets

REL-REF    (R,,A.A.CARETTO+,J,PR,110,1130,1958) Cross Section For
           Cumulative Production of Na-24.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Cosmotron
METHOD     (INTB,CHSEP,SITA,MOSEP)
           After Dissolution of the Target Foils in 1.8 to 2.5 Min
           After the End of Irradiation Ne-24 was Separated from
           Na-24 Within 20 Sec. After Ne-24 had Decayed to Na-24
           This Nuclide was Used in the Different Fractions Either
           For the Determination of the Cumulative Production of
           Ne-24 or the Independent Production of Na-24.
SAMPLE     Targets Consisted of Three 0.001 Inch Al-Foils and
           Three 0.001 to 0.003 Inch Foils of the Specified
           Metal. The Middle Foils were Used For Monitoring and
           To Determine Na-24 and Ne-24, Respectively.

DETECTOR   (NAICR)
           Used When Sufficient Na-24 Activity was Present
           (PROPC)
           Used at Lower Na-24 Activities. A Few Samples with
           Very Low Counting Rates were Measured on Low-Level
           Beta Counters.
COMMENT    In Approximately Half the Experiments the Cumulative
           Yield of Na-24 was Measured Also in One of the
           Remaining Foils. These Cross Sections Agreed to +-15%
           With Those of the Sums of Cumulative Ne-24 Plus
           Independent Na-24.
           Additional External Irradiations of Cu and Ag Targets
           At 3 GeV Using a Continuous Flow System to Collect the
           Ne-24 Produced During the Irradiation Yielded Values
           Which Agreed Within +-10% with Those Obtained from
           Internal Irradiations. Thus No Appreciable Amount of
           Ne-24 Compared to Na-24 was Lost During the Internal
           Irradiations As a Result of Target Heating.
           In General Two Independent Experiments were Performed
           For Determination of the Cross Section Ratios. Four
           Experiments were Made For Ag and U with 1 GeV Protons
           And Three Experiments For Au with 3 GeV Protons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Ratio-Errors Given are the Mean
           Deviations of Several Runs or 10% If the Mean Deviation
           Is Smaller Than this Figure As Stated by the Author.

           Times, the Quantity Known with Least Precision,
           Resulted in Uncertainties of 5 to 10%. No Further
