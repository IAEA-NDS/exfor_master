TITLE      The Measurement of Some (P,N) And (P,2N) Reaction
           Cross Sections at 400 MeV

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACAR)
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOSEP,CHSEP,ACTIV)
           All Targets were Sandwiched Between Three 1 Mil
           Al-Foils on Each Side. The Outer Foils Compensated
           For the Recoiling Na-24 Nuclei from the Monitor Foil,
           The Monitor Foils Served to Measure the Beam Intensity,
           And the Inner Foils Compensated For the Recoiling Na-24
           Nuclei from the Monitor Foil and Served As Catcher
           Foil For any Product Nuclei Recoiling from the Target.
           Thus the Inner Catcher Foils were Dissolved Together
           With the Target Before Chemical Separation.
MONITOR    ((MONIT)13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,CUM,SIG,,,EVAL)
           A Cross Section of 10.5 Mb at 400 MeV was Used.

CORRECTION An Appreciable Background Activity Due to Impurities
           Of the Al-Matrix was Subtracted from the Measured
           Mn-52M and Mn-52G Activities.
