REL-REF    (C,B0057002,R.COLLE+,J,PR/C,9,1819,1974)
           According to Colle Et Al. The Cross Sections Given
           Have to be Multiplied with a Conversion Factor of
           0.962 Due to a Change in the B+ Abundance from 0.893
           To 0.928.
ERR-ANALYS The Probable Error in the Absolute Cross Section
           Measurement, Excluding Uncertainties in the Electron
           Capture Correction, is Estimated to be 3%.
           For the Relative Measurements the Total Energy Spread
           At 5 and 10 MeV is 940 and 530 KeV, Respectively.
           For the Absolute Measurement at 10 MeV the Total
           Width at Half-Maximum is 1.4 MeV.
