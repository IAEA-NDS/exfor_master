FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER)
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           The beam current was measured externally using a
           secondary emission chamber (see G.W.TAUTFEST et al.,
           Rev.Sci.Instr.26,229(1955)) through which the beam
           traversed before hitting the target.
           This chamber was calibrated before each irradiation by
           comparison with an ionization chamber. The sensitivity
           was found to be constant within 2%.
           (ACTIV)
INC-SOURCE  The energy resolution was better than 1%.

DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
           The Counting Efficiency was Determined by Calibration
           With Na-24 Standard Sources.
           (COIN,SCIN,NAICR)
           A Plastic Scintillator was Used. In Addition to the
           Beta-Counting the Most Active Foils were Measured by
           Beta-Gamma-Coincidence Counting.
SAMPLE     Mostly Two Al-Foils, Each 10 Mg/Cm**2 +-0.5%
           Thick, Determined by Absorption Measurement and
           Weighing, Purity 99.99%.  The Recoil Loss of About 1 to
           3% in the Second Foil Used For Na-24 Determination was
           Compensated by the Recoil from the Front Foil.
COMMENT    The Cross Section Given is the Average of Seven
           Independent Determinations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Error Given Depends Mainly on an
           Uncertainty of 3% in the Absolute Beam Calibration and
           Of 2.9% Mainly Resulting from the Calibration of the
           Na-24 Standard. The Statistical Error was Less Than 1%.
ADD-RES    From Analyzing the Decay of the Activated Al-Foils
           An Estimate of 1 Mb For the Al-27(P,3N+3P)Na-22
           Reaction was Obtained.
