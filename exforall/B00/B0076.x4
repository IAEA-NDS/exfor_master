           Irradiations were performed with the internal scattered
           beam with 180 degree focusing in the cyclotron
           magnetic field resulting in a better energy resolution.
           protons initially monochromatic at 100 MeV have a
           dispersion of 4 MeV at 20 MeV.

           The Abundance is not Specified, But Since the Electron
           Capture Branch was Unknown in 1951 the Abundance
           Used was Obviously 1.0. Therefore the Values have to
           Be Multiplied by a Factor of 1.10 Corresponding to an
           Abundance of 0.9055 For B+ (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER
           OF KACHAPAG).

COMMENT    Cross Sections Below 20 MeV are Probably Due to
           Contamination.
CORRECTION The Counting Rates were Corrected For Background, Dead
           Time Losses, Decay Since Zero Time, and Neutron Induced
           Activity,Which was Experimentally Shown to be in the
           Order of 2%. Further Corrections were Applied For
           Absorption and Scattering of the Beta-Rays Counted.
           The Loss of Protons by Nuclear Absorption in the
           Absorber/Target Assembly, Which Amounts to 10%,
           Was Corrected, While the Loss Due to Multiple Coulomb
           Scattering Could be Made Negligible by Using Brass
           Absorbers of a Diameter Greater Than the Target Foils.
           A Loss of Nuclei from the Target Foils Due to Recoil
           Or Evaporation During the Bombardment was Assumed to
           Be Negligible.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors of the Cross Sections were Assumed to be
           Within 25%. They are Mainly Due to Uncertainties in
           The Corrections of the Beta-Ray Counting For Absorption
           And Scattering (ABOUT  20%), in the Correction For
           Proton Losses by Absorption in the Absorber/Target
           Assembly (<10%), and in the Monitor Reaction (<10%).

METHOD     (INTB,STTA,EDEG,MOSEP)
           the energy at each target foil was calculated from
           the average radius and magnetic field for the scattered
           protons together with range-energy curves given
           by W.A.Aron et al., UCRL-121.

CORRECTION The counting rates were corrected for background, dead
           time losses, decay since zero time, and neutron induced
           activity,which was experimentally shown to be in the
           order of 2%. Further corrections were applied for
           absorption and scattering of the beta-rays counted.
           The loss of protons by nuclear absorption in the
           absorber/target assembly, which amounts to 10%,
           was corrected, while the loss due to multiple coulomb
           scattering could be made negligible by using brass
           absorbers of a diameter greater than the target foils.
           a loss of nuclei from the target foils due to recoil
           or evaporation during the bombardment was assumed to
           be negligible.
           The data for the present reaction were cross-checked
           by measuring the ratio of Na-24/C-11 via coincidence
           measurements. Na-24 was measured via gamma-gamma
           coincidence, C-11 was measured via beta-gamma
           coincidence using a beta-crystal and a NAI-detector.
           When corrections of a few per cent were made for the
           gamma-sensitivity of the beta-crystal, the results
           agreed to within 3% with the data obtained by
           beta counting and corrected for absorption and
           scattering.
COMMENT    Cross sections below 25 MeV are probably due to not
           completely corrected neutron induced activity or
           contamination (comment by the compiler of KACHAPAG).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors of the cross sections were assumed
            to be within 15%. They are mainly due to:
           (ERR-1,,10.) Uncertainties in the correction for
            proton losses by absorption in the absorber/target
            assembly (<10%),
           (ERR-2,,10.) Monitor reaction (<10%).
           The uncertainties due to the corrections of the
           beta-ray counting for absorption and scattering has
           probably been omitted due to the good agreement between
           the beta counting and the coincidence measurements, see
           under correction.

           According to the Half-Life of 32.5 Min Measured by the
           Authors the Cross Sections Given are Valid For Cl-34-M.
           Cl-34-G (1.5 SEC) Was Unknown When this Work was
           Published. The Beta Branches Given by L.Ruby Et Al.,
           Phys.Rev.83,698(1951) And Cited by the Authors are
           Similar to Those Resulting For Cl-34-M in Equilibrium
           With Cl-34-G Using More Recent Decay Data, Provided
           That All Directly Formed Cl-34-G had Decayed Completely
           Before Starting the Measurement. The Authors Assume One

COMMENT    According to the Authors Interfering Activities of
           P-32 and Si-31 were Eliminated by Counting the Samples
           Through Thick Absorbers.
CORRECTION The Counting Rates were Corrected For Background, Dead
           Time Losses, Decay Since Zero Time, and Neutron Induced
           Activity,Which was Experimentally Shown to be in the
           Order of 2%. Further Corrections were Applied For
           Absorption and Scattering of the Beta-Rays Counted.
           The Loss of Protons by Nuclear Absorption in the
           Absorber/Target Assembly, Which Amounts to 10%,
           Was Corrected, While the Loss Due to Multiple Coulomb
           Scattering Could be Made Negligible by Using Brass
           Absorbers of a Diameter Greater Than the Target Foils.
           Since a Recoil Loss of Nuclei from the Target Foils is
           Assumed to be Negligible Due to the Small Momentum
           Transfer, There will be an Error of a Few Per Cent Due
           To Recoil Losses from the Monitor Foil. A Loss of Cl-34
           By Evaporation During the Irradiation was
           Experimentally Shown to Amount to 15%. This Correction
           Has Been Included. The Energy Dispersion of the
           Scattered Beam of 4 MeV at 20 MeV will Lower the Peak
           By About 15%. 'It is Unclear Whether this Correction
           Has Been Included'(COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG)
ERR-ANALYS The Authors Assume an Error of 25% For the Cross
           Sections Due to Large Corrections to the Beta Counts
           For Using Thick Samples and Thick Absorbers.

COMMENT    Incident Proton Energies were 100 and 60 MeV. Lower
           Energies were Achieved by Adding Absorber Foils.
           A Contribution from B-10(P,GAMMA)B-11 Should be
           Negligible.
CORRECTION The Counting Rates were Corrected For Background, Dead
           Time Losses, Decay Since Zero Time, and Neutron Induced
           Activity,Which was Experimentally Shown to be in the

           Whether this Correction has Been Included' -Comment by
           The Compiler of Kachapag.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors of the Cross Sections were Assumed to be
           Within 15%. They are Smaller Than For the Other
           Reactions, Since the Corrections of the Beta-Ray
           Counting For Absorption and Scattering are
           Approximately Equal Measuring the Same Nuclide For the
           Reaction and For the Monitor and Due to Equal Thickness
           For Target and Monitor Samples Resulting in a
           Cancellation of the Uncertainties of these Corrections.
           Thus the Errors are Mainly Due to the Uncertainties in
           The Correction For Proton Losses by Absorption in the
           Absorber/Target Assembly (<10%), and in the Monitor
           Reaction (<10%). Cross Sections Below 10 MeV are More
           Uncertain Due to the Energy Straggling.
