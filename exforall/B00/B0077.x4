FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK)
METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,BCINT,EDEG)
           The Incident Proton Energy was 32 MeV.
           The Range-Energy Relation in Polystyrene was Computed
           By the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory.
           The Correctness was Checked Experimentally by
           Substitution of the Polystyrene by Al-Absorbers Giving
           A Consistent Set of Data.
SAMPLE     Stacks of 0.254 mm Polystyrene Foils with 25 Mg/Cm**2
           Were Used from 32 to 21 MeV, and 0.127 and 0.063 mm
           From 21 to 16 MeV. All Foils were Weighed and
           Calibrated For Uniformity.
CORRECTION C-11 Produced by Secondary Neutrons Via the (N,2N)
           Reaction is Negligible As Experimentally Found.
           Due to the Small Beam Diameter (1/4 INCH) Relative to
           Foil Diameter (1 INCH) No Scattering Loss is Expected.
           No Nuclear Absorption Correction has Been Applied
           Because of the Comparatively Small Thickness of
           Absorbers.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Error Given For the Absolute Cross
           Section at 32 MeV Includes Uncertainties Due to Beam
           Integration and Counting Statistics, But not the
           Probable Error in Beta-Standard Calibration (7.5%).
           The Energy of the Primary Beam was 32.0+-0.1 MeV, the
           Accuracy at 19 MeV is Estimated to be +-0.15 MeV.
FLAG       (1.) Values Measured Only Relatively by Panofsky and
           Phillips and Normalized by Aamodt Using the Improved
           Absolute Measurement at 32 MeV. The Data of Panofsky
           And Those of Aamodt Overlap For About 2.5 MeV in a
           Region, Where a Bend Permits Accurate Activity
           And Energy Normalization.  The Fitting
           Of the Two Curves Does not Permit a Shift of
           More Than +-0.15 MeV, Which Introduces an Uncertainty
           Of Only 2 Mb at the Full Energy.
           (2.) Values Measured Relatively by Aamodt and
           Normalized to the Absolute Cross Section at 32 MeV.
           (3.)Absolute Value, Used For Normalization. 34 Separate
           Runs were Made For this Purpose at 32 MeV Full Beam
           Energy. Three Different Target-Faraday Cup Arrangements
           Were Used to Investigate and Eliminate the Error Due to
           Secondary Electron Emission (ESTIMATED SYSTEMATIC ERROR
           OF 3%).
STATUS     (CURVE).Fig.2 of the Publication
           Except the Cross Section at 32 MeV Which was Given
           Numerically.

           No Information on the Range-Energy Relation
           Used is Given.
           The Energy of Incident 340 MeV Protons was Reduced by
           Interposing Cu-Absorbers Just Before the Target Foils.
           The Statistical Straggling in Range of Protons
           Initially Nearly Monochromatic Produces an Energy
           Spread Which is About 5% at 100 MeV. Therefore
           Absolute Measurements with the High Energy Proton Beam
           Were not Extended Below 93 MeV.
SAMPLE     Polystyrene Foils, Thickness 0.127 mm
CORRECTION About 2% of the C-11 Activity May be Produced
           By Secondary Neutrons Via the (N,2N) Reaction As
           Measured by Foils Placed Beyond the End of the Proton
           Range.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Probable Errors of the Mean Value Given
           Are Due Mainly to Counting Statistics and do not
           Include the Absolute Error of 7.5% Involved in
           Beta-Source Calibration.
           The Uncertainty of the Beam Current Measurement was
           Estimated to be Within 2%. Part of the Cross Sections
           Given are Mean Values Obtained from Several Runs (UP TO
           12).
REL-REF    (C,B0101002,W.E.CRANDALL+,J,PR,101,329,1956)
           Crandall Showed Experimentally That the Arrangement of
           The Absorber Foils Directly in Front of the Target Foil
           Resulted in Secondary Protons and Neutrons Which
           Increased the Cross Sections Measured by Aamodt.
           Using an Arrangement of the Absorbers Far Off from the
           Target in Front of the Beam Collimator and an
           Additional Steering Magnet For Energy Selection
           Crandall Found the Absolute Values 13 Per Cent Lower
           Than Aamodt. From this It Becomes Clear That the Cross
           Section at the Non-Degraded Energy of 340 MeV
           Measured by Aamodt is Smaller When Compared to Values
           At Degraded Beam Energies.
