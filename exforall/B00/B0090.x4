TITLE      Iodine-123 Production For Radiopharmaceuticals
           Excitation Functions of the Te-124(P,2N)I-123 and
           Te-124(P,N)I-124 Reactions and the Effect of Target
           Enrichment on Radionuclidic Purity

METHOD     (EXTB,STTA,EDEG,MOSEP,BCINT)
           The Energy Degradation in the Stack was Calculated
           According to C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R3042(1966).
           Cu-Monitor Foils of 12.57 Mg/Cm**2 were Used.
           The Integrated Beam Charge Determined by Monitoring
           Agreed Within 1% with the Value Obtained with the
           Faraday Cup.
           Typical Irradiations Lasted 200 Sec at 0.5 Microamps.
SAMPLE     Stacks of Self-Supporting Polystyrene Films in Which
           1.05+-0.01 Mg/Cm**2 Enriched Te-124 Powder were
           Uniformly Suspended, Interspersed with Al and Cu Beam
           Degrader Foils. The Te-Concentration in Each Target
           Was Determined at the Conclusion of the Experiment
           By X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry. Separate Sets
           Of Measurements were Performed with Targets Having
           The Following Differing Isotopic Compositions (IN %)
                 1.Te-120 < 0.002, Te-122 < 0.003, Te-123  0.006,
           Te-124 99.87, Te-125  0.095,  Te-126  0.020,  Te-128 <
           0.010, Te-130 < 0.008.  Other Impurities were < 1%.
                 2.Te-120 < 0.02, Te-122 0.49, Te-123 0.11,
           Te-124 91.86, Te-125 3.17, Te-126 1.81, Te-128 1.55,
           Te-130 1.05. Other Impurities were Less Than 1%.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           The Dead-Time Losses were Always Less Than 10%.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The Uncertainty in the Incident Proton Beam
           Energy was Estimated As 1%.
           (DATA-ERR) The Counting Error at the 95.5% Confidence
           Level was Less Than 3%. The Error Resulting
           From the Lack of Uniformity in Te-Thickness in the
           Target was Less Than 2%. Recoil Losses of the
           Product Nuclei were Small and Therefore Negleted.
           Typical Overall Errors were in the Order of 12%
           Taking Into Account Systematical Errors Due to E.G.
           Detector Efficiency and Nuclear Decay Data.
ADD-RES    Production Conditions For J-123 Optimized with Respect
           To Yield and Radionuclidic Purity are Discussed.

           Of Te-124 (SEE UNDER SAMPLE). The Cross Sections are
           Obviously not Corrected For 100% Te-124, Since
           A Comparison with the Second Target of Different Te-124
           Abundance shall be Performed.
           Contributions from Other Te-Isotopes are Certainly
           Negligible Due to Their Small Abundances in the
           Isotopic Composition Used (SEE UNDER SAMPLE).

           Measured with a Target Having 91.86% Abundance
           Of Te-124 (SEE UNDER SAMPLE). The Cross Sections are

           Te-124, Since a Comparison with the Other Target of
           Different Te-124 Content shall be Performed.
           Deviations from the Results with the Higher Enriched
           Target are Probably Due to the Larger Amount of Other
           Te-Isotopes Leading to Competing Reactions Producing
           The Same Residual Nucleus, Especially the Te-125
           Content.
