           Energy Degradation in the Stack was Calculated
           According to C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R3042(1966).The
           Primary Alpha-Beam Energy was 100+-0.5 MeV, the
           Irradiation Time About 2 Hours at 1 Micro-Amp.
SAMPLE     3 Replicate Stacks Consisting of Foils of Natural Zn,
           Thickness 36 Mg/Cm**2 and of Natural Ag, Thickness
           50 Mg/Cm**2, Chemical Purities Higher Than 99.95%.
           Apart from the Target Foils No Other Degrader or
           Catcher Foils were Employed in the Stacks.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
CORRECTION Corrections For the Beam-Intensity Attenuation in the
           Thick Stacks were Calculated Using Experimental Total
           Reaction Cross Sections.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Data Given by the Author in

           Thus Referring to Th  Produced Radioactivity Rather
           Than to a Specific Reaction.  This was done, Since Most
           Of the Activities are Produced Via Several Reactions.

ANALYSIS   The Thick Target Yields, Presented As Curves in the
           Paper, were Obtained by Numerical Integration of the
           Experimental Excitation Functions.
COMMENT    The Results Given were Obtained from Measurements on
           Foils from One Stack Only.
           The Excitation Function Drawn from the Experimental
           Cross Sections Shows a First Maximum of About
           2400 Nci/Muahr Per Mg/Cm**2 at About 17.5 MeV. This
           Maximum not Supported by Experimental Points was
           Assumed from Cross Sections Reported by F.H.Ruddy Et
           Al.,Nucl.Phys.A,127,305(1969).
ERR-ANALYS The Major Source of Error in the Excitation Function
           And the Calculated Thick Target Yield is Due to the
           Small Number of Data Points in the Low Energy Region.
           No Further Details on Errors are Given.
STATUS    1The Cross Sections in Nci/Muahr Per Mg/Cm**2 were
           Obtained As Numerical Values from F.J.Haasbroek.
           The Cross Sections in Mb were Calculated by the
           Compiler by Multiplying these Values with the Factor
           0.1456.

           The Ge-68 Activity was Determined by Measuring the
           Annihilation Radiation of Ga-68 in Equilibrium.
           To Ensure Complete Annihilation of the Positrons the Zn
           Foils were Sandwiched Between 1 mm Thick Co Discs.
           Annihilation Radiation of Other B+ Emitters was
           Corrected For with the Aid of Their Gamma Radiation.
           To Reduce these Corrections Ga-68 was Measured 240
           Days After Bombardment.
ANALYSIS   The Thick Target Yields, Presented As Curves in the
