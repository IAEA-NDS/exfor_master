TITLE      Absolute Cross Section For the C-12(P,PN)C-11 Reaction
           At 50 MeV

METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,SITA,EDEG)
           Stacks of Several Target Foils were Used, Where the
           Outermost Foils Served to Compensate For Recoil Losses,
           The Inner Ones to Evaluate Nonuniformity. Energy
           Degradation was Performed by Means of Cu-Discs of Known
           Thicknesses. Though It is not Explicitly Stated, the
           Compiler Assumes That Only One Data Point was Obtained
           Per Irradiation and not Data For Several Energies from
           One Single Stack (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER).
           Energy Degradation For Copper and Aluminium was
           Calculated According to H.Bichsel, Linear Accelerator
           Group, Dept. Of Physics, Technical Report 2, Univ.Of
           Southern California (1961).

           115,137(1959) And Author'S Own Hydrogen Data were
           Combined Assuming Additivity.
           When Calculating Cross Sections at the
           Reduced Energies, Corrections For the Loss of Protons
           By Nuclear Interactions have Been Made with an Assumed
           Cross Section of 1 Barn For Copper.
           The Faraday Cup was Attached Directly to the End of
           The Beam Pipe Without Using a Foil Window For
           Separation. This Avoided Erroneous Results by Energetic
           Knock on Electrons.

SAMPLE     Stack Consisting of 4 Polyethylene Foils, Thickness
           About 10 Mg/Cm**2, Determined by Weighing Each Single
           Foil and of Cu-Discs For Energy Reduction.
           See Also Under Method.
CORRECTION The Activities Measured were Corrected For a 12+-2%
           Loss of C-11 by Diffusion. No Corrections For the 1.1%
           Abundance of C-13 were Made. The Production of C-11 by
           Secondary Neutrons Via (N,2N) Reaction was Negligible
           As Experimentally Shown. The Correction For N-13
           Produced by C-13(P,N) Reaction was Estimated to be
           Always Less Than 0.1 Mb from the Peak Cross Section of
           The C-13(P,N) Reaction, the Small Natural C-13
           Abundance, and the Faster Decay of N-13 in Respect to
           C-11.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Resulting from a +-0.5 MeV Uncertainty in the

           (ERR-T) Standard Error Which Includes an Estimated
           C-11 Counting Efficiency (1.5), Accuracy of the Current

           Parentheses are % Values Valid For the Cross Section at
           50.5 MeV.

CORRECTION A Substantial Contribution to the Na-24 Production by
           Secondary Neutrons Via the (N,A)-Reaction Could be
           Observed. Therefore the Cross Sections have Been
           Reduced by 0.5+-0.3 Mb to Correct For this Effect.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Standard Error Compounded from the

           Current Integration and a +-1.5 Per Cent Uncertainty in
           The Counting Efficiency.
           The Major Source of Error is the Somewhat Uncertain
           Correction For the (N,ALPHA) Reaction.
