           And I-127

METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,SITA,EDEG)
           The Energy Degradation by Absorbers (WINDOW, AIR,
           MYLAR COVER AND TARGET) Was Calculated According to
           L.C.Northcliffe Et Al.,Nucl.Data,A7,233(1970)
           C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R-3042(1966)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Data Uncertainty -
           The Errors Include Peak Analyses (INCLUSIVELY COUNTING
           STATISTICS) Up to 3%, Absolute Detection Efficiencies
           Of 5 to 10%, Gamma-Ray Abundances of 2 to 5%, Target
           Thicknesses of 2 to 4%, and Current Integration of
           About 1%.
           Cross Sections were Determined by Averaging the Results
           Using Several Gamma-Rays Given Under Decay-Data.
              Energy Uncertainty -
           The Error of the Mean Energy, Due to Energy
           Loss and Straggling in Absorber and Target, Amounted to
           100 KeV.

COMMENT    Cross Sections Above 20.7 MeV Include a Contribution
           Of the 35-Br-81(P,3N)36-Kr-79 Reaction.
FLAG       (1.) This Cross Section has a Contribution from the
           Reaction Br-81(P,3N)Kr-79 with a Threshold Energy of
           20.7 MeV. The Given Cross Sections are Related to
           100% Br-79 Resulting in an Apparent Cross
           Section of Sig(KR-79)=Sig(BR-79(P,N))+N(BR-81)/
           N(BR-79)*Sig(BR-81(P,3N)).
