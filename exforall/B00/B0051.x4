           The Over-All Accuracy Given in the Data-Table is About
           6%.  The Primary Sources of Error Result from Errors in
           The Determination of Target Thickness (3%), Coincidence
           Detector Efficiency (3%), and the Calibration of the
           Beam Integrator(<3%).
COMMENT    Radiative Capture Ti-46(P,G)V-47 was Assumed to be
           Negligible (LESS THAN 10 MB). The Shape of the Curve
           Possibly Reflects Some Sort of Resonance Effect.
