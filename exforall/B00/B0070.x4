           9.3 MeV Protons

SAMPLE     Foils of Natural Copper, Thickness 25.4 Mu
           Corresponding to an Energy Loss of 0.6 MeV at a
           Projectile Energy of 9.6 MeV.
ADD-RES    (TRCS)
           A Total Reaction Cross Section of 910+-25 Mb For
           Natural Copper was Calculated with the (P,Q) Cross
           Sections of 365 and 155 Mb For Cu-63 and Cu-65,
           Respectively As Quoted by Meyer and Hintz, Phys.Rev.
           Letters 5,207,1960. Because these Values Apply at a
           Proton Energy of 9.85 Instead of 9.3 MeV, the Authors
           Estimated a Value of 900+-25 Mb.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The Error of the Mean Energy is Mainly Due to
           The Target Thickness, While the Uncertainty of the
           Proton Energy is About 0.1 MeV
HISTORY    (19770506C)Lapf
           (19961209A) Reaction Lines and Err-Analys are
            Corrected.

           Bombardments, and the Uncertainty in the Calibration
           Of the Beam Integrator (1%).
           Systematic Errors Due to an Improper Setting of the
           Coincidence Setup were Excluded by Variation of the
           Relevant Parameters (GEOMETRY, TIME DELAY BETWEEN THE
           TWO DETECTOR CIRCUITS,ETC.).
CORRECTION Corrections For Random Coincidences have Been Applied.
