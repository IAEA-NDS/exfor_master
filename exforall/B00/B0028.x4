REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,8,375,1973)
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,EDEG,REC)
           Projectile Energies were Calculated According to
           L.C.Northcliffe Et Al., Nucl.Data A7,233(1970)

           500 MeV Kr24+ or 450 MeV Kr23+ Beam. The 500 MeV Kr-84
           Beam Could be Contaminated with 375 MeV Cu-Ions Up to
           3%.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Errors of the Cross Sections Result
           Mainly from the Statistical Uncertainties in the
           Activity Measurement, the Target Thickness, and the
           Beam-Flux Determination.

           The Product Nuclide is Formed Mainly by Two-Charge
           Transfer. For 492 MeV the Contribution of Higher
           Charge Transfer and Subsequent Fast Alpha Decay
           Leading to the Product Nuclide Amounts to 10%.
