DECAY-DATA (27-CO-55,18.HR)
SAMPLE     Oxide of Isotopically Enriched Fe-54. No Further
           Information is Given.
COMMENT    The Cross Section Given was Determined by Comparing
           The Activity of Co-55 with That of Mn-51 Produced by
           The Reaction Fe-54(P,A). Due to the Content of Fe-56
           In the Target, this Measurement was Possible Only
           Below 15 MeV, the Threshold of the Fe-56(P,2N)Co-55
           Reaction. Absolute Cross Sections For Mn-51
           Were Obtained by Bombarding Stacks of Natural Fe-Foils
           And Comparing Mn-51 Activities at Low Energies with
           Co-55 Activities at High Energies Where the Cross
           Sections For Fe-56(P,2N)Co-55 are Known and the
           Contribution from Fe-54(P,G)Co-55 is Negligible.
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(P,2N)27-CO-55,,SIG) This is Secondary Monitor

DECAY-DATA (29-CU-61,3.3HR)
SAMPLE     Metallic Foils of Isotopically Enriched Ni-60
           Containing 1.5% Ni-58, 0.02% Ni-61 and 0.01% Ni-62.
COMMENT    The Cross Sections Given were Determined by Comparing
           The Activity of Cu-61 with That of Ni-57 Obtained
           From Ni-58(P,N+P). Small Corrections For the Reactions
           Ni-61(P,N) And Ni-62(P,2N) Were Applied.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(P,N+P)28-NI-57,,SIG)
           A Minor Contribution of the Reaction Ni-58(P,2N)Cu-57
           With Subsequent Decay to Ni-57 May be Included in the
           Measured Ni-57 Activity. The Threshold Given For this
           Reaction is 20.6 MeV.

SAMPLE     Natural Zinc Foils
COMMENT    At Low Energies Zn-65 is Only Produced by the Reaction
           Given and Subsequent Decay. The Absolute Cross Sections
           Were Obtained by Comparison with Zn-65 Produced at High
           Energy by the Reactions Zn-66(P,N+P) And Zn-66(P,2N)
           With Subsequent Decay, While Zn-64(P,G) Is Negligible.

           Capture of Zn-64 was Subtracted
