TITLE      B-10 and B-11 production cross sections in C-12
           spallation by protons and alpha particles.
           Application to cosmic ray propagation

SAMPLE     Stacks consisting of high purity graphite sheets,
           thickness 1 and/or 0.2 mm, containing less than 5 ppb
           of natural boron. The number and the thickness of the
           sheets used for an experiment depended on the energy
           of the incident particles. Due to the small energy loss
           in the individual foils the stack was obviously not
           used for energy degradation but rather for production
           of several targets per run.
METHOD     (INTB,SITA,ASEP)
           After irradiation one graphite sheet per analysis was
           burnt on a small Au-disk on which most of spallation
           products remained after total combustion. Combustion
           was performed at temperatures below 700 centigrades,
           where escape of volatile boron compounds was checked
           to be small (less than 5% uncertainty in the cross
           sections).
           In all cases B-11/B-10 ratios were measured by means
           of a mass separator. The boron ionization efficiency
           relative to that of Be was strongly increased by
           deposit of about 1 mg of high purity water on the
           combustion residue.
           Data were corrected for isotopic discrimination of the
           mass separator which was determined using a standard
           boric acid sample.
           The natural boron content of the targets was determined
           from blank graphite sheets.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given for the ratios and the data
           are standard errors coming from mass peak ratio
           measurement and from determination of the
           discrimination factor of the spectrometer.  Included
           are the uncertainties of the monitor cross sections.

METHOD    1(MOMIX)
           Absolute B-11 cross sections were determined by means
           of the isotope dilution method using an isotope
           separator for implanting of a defined amount of B-11
           into the irradiated targets. From the B-11/B-10 data
           in these implanted targets and the separately measured
           cross section ratio the absolute B-11 cross section
           was obtained after normalization to the known and
           additionally measured Be-7 formation cross section and
           correction for the natural boron content.
           It was experimentally tested that the differing depth
           distributions for implanted (superficial layer) and
           spallative (all depths) boron lead to equal extraction
           rates within 5%.

COMMENT    In the publication an energy region from 100 to
           160 MeV is given. It is uncertain, whether or not this
           range reflects an energy degradation in the specific
           carbon foil-stack used for the alpha-irradiation
            (comment by the compiler).
