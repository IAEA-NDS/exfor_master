           The Energies in the Foil were Calculated According
           To J.B.Marion Et Al., Nuclear Reaction Analysis, P.14,
           North-Holland, Amsterdam (1968).
           Incident Energies For Protons 16 MeV, For Alpha-
           Particles 24 MeV.
CORRECTION Corrections were Applied For the Summing of Coincident
           Gamma-Ray Pulses in the Detector, Absorption in the
           Sources,and Differing Source-Detector Distances For
           Activated Foils and Standard Sources Used For Cali-
           Bration,Respectively. Dead-Time Losses of the
           Multichannel Analyser were Kept Below 30%.
           Recoil-Losses During the Irradiations were Estimated
           To be Negligible.

           According to Colle Et Al. The Cross Sections Given
           Have to be Multiplied with a Conversion Factor of
           1.192 Which Takes Into Account a Change of the 669.6
           KeV Gamma-Ray Intensity from 10.1 to 8.47%.
