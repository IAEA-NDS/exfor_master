           The Energy Degradation was Calculated According to

SAMPLE     Mixtures of Spectroscopically Pure Cu-Oxide and Sr-
           Nitrate, Enriched to 98.82 and 99.84% Sr-88,
           Respectively. Impurities were Insignificant and did
           Not Influence the Results. The Mixture was Loaded Into
           An Aluminium Tube, Which was Rolled Flat to Make a Thin
           And Uniform Target. The Energy Degradation of the Beam
           By Such a Target was Found to be Within the Reported
           Energy Spread of the Beam (+-2 MEV).
CORRECTION Corrections were Made For Chemical Yield, Aliquot
           Factor, Branching Ratio, Internal Conversion
           Coefficients, and For Decay During and After the
           Irradiation.

ERR-ANALYS The Errors of the Cross Sections are Estimated to be
           16 and 12% For the M-And G-Isomer, Respectively and 20%
           For the Sum.  Due to a Misprint the Values For the
           M-Isomer and the Sum are Probably Changed (COMMENT BY
           THE COMPILER).
           These Values were Obtained by Taking the Square Roots
           Of the Sums of the Squares of the Uncertainties Which
           Include Errors in the Estimation of Photopeak Areas,
           Decay Curve Analysis, Efficiencies of the Detection
           Equipment, Chemical Yields, Pipetting, Weighing, and
           Energy Spread in the Beam. Not Included are Errors
           Connected with the Decay Schemes As Half-Lives, Con-
           Version Coefficients, Branching Ratios and Errors of
           The Monitor Cross Sections.
