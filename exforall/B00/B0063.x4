           Only the Measurements with the Long Counter are
           Reported in this Entry, Because the Data Obtained
           From the Activation Measurements are Superseded by
           Later Measurements, See B0065 (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER
           KACHAPAG).

           Wing Et Al. Suggested a Calibration Error in the
           Results of Jones, Because Their Cu-63(P,N) As Well As
           The Cu-65(P,N) Cross Section are Approximately 20%
           Smaller Than Those of Wing and Other Authors, While the
           Ratio of these Values Agrees.
