TITLE      Nuclear Reactions of Sn-118, Sb-121, and J-127 with
           Argon Ions
AUTHOR     (H.GAUVIN, Y.LE BEYEC, N.T.PORILE)
INSTITUTE  (2FR PAR,1USAPUR)
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,223,103,1974)
METHOD     (EXTB,HEJET,EDEG,BCINT).The Energy was Determined by
           Use of the Energy Loss Tables of Northcliffe, Nuclear
           Data Tables A7,233,70. The Relative Measurement Ofthe
           Beam Intensity was Calibrated with a Faraday Cup.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2FR PAR).Alice Accelerator at Orsay
DETECTOR   (SOLST)
ERR-ANALYS The Overall Uncertainty of the Cross Sections
           Excluding the Uncertainty of the Alpha Branching
           Ratios is Estimated As 20-25 %.  The Uncertainty in
           The Beam Intensity Calibration Amounted to 10-15 %.
COMMENT    The Relative Cross Sections Obtained by the He-Jet
           Technique were Converted to Absolute Values by Adopting
           A Cross Section of 115(+-20) Mb For the Reaction
           Sn-118(AR,5N)Er-153 at a Projectile Energy of 195 MeV.
           This Reference Cross Section was Determined Using
           Conventional Measurement of Recoils in Al Catcher
           Foils. The Number of Er-153 Atoms was Determined Via
           The Alpha-Decay of the Granddaughter Tb-149. Thus a
           Bombarding Energy of 195 MeV was Chosen to Avoid the
           Direct Formation of Either Dy-149 or Tb-149. This is
           Correct For the Reactions Sn-118(AR,2P7N)Dy-149 and
           Sn-118(AR,3P6N)Tb-149, But It May be Doubtful in the
           Cases of Sn-118(AR,A5N)Dy-149 or Sn-118(AR,AP4N)Tb-149
           - Comment by the Compiler-.
           The Figures from Which the Cross Sections were Taken
           Give the Sum of the Projectile Energy and of the
           Difference Between the Q-Values of the Reaction in
           Question and the Corresponding Reaction with Sn-118
           As Target Nuclide. This Difference, not Given in the
           Publication was Obtained from Landolt-Boernstein, New
           Series, Group1,Vol.5a(1973).
           Due to the Lack of the Reaction and Decay Data the
           Cross Sections For the Reactions (AR,11N) And (AR,P11N)
           Given in the Figures Could not be Entered.

COMMENT    -By Kachapag -
           The Energy Values Obtained from the Figure were Shifted
           For +1.2 MeV to Correct For the Differences in the
           Q-Values Between the Reactions with Sn-118 and J-127.
           - By CAJAD - Tm-153 Production Due to Decay of Yb-152
           Is not Excluded.
