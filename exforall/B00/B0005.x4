           Energy-Loss Corrections were Applied to Determine the
           Energy Halfway Through the Targets According to
           C.F. Williamson Et Al., Cea-R3042 (1966).  To Reduce
           Background, in Case of Gamma-Measurements the Targets
           Were Transferred by Means of a Pneumatic Shuttle
           Between Irradiation Position and a Low Background
           Counting Area Within About 0.3 Sec.  For Proton
           Measurements, the Si-Detector was Pulled Back 2.3 Cm
           During the Irradiation Periods. Four Successive
           Spectra were Recorded in Multi-Spectrum Scaling Mode.
COMMENT    The C.M.-Projectile Energy Given by the Authors was
           Converted Into Energy in the Laboratory System by the
           Compiler of Kachapag.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The Statistical Error, Which was Calculated
           From the Deviations Between Several Measurements, is
           Given in the Data-Section.  The Additional Error Due to
           The Uncertainties in the Target Thickness  and  the
           Counter Efficiency Amounts to 14% of the Absolute Cross
           Sections.
           The Loss of Activity Due to Recoils Leaving the Target
           Was Estimated to Amount to Less Than 1%.

           The Branching Ratio was Deduced from a Theoretically
           Calculated Beta-Branching For Si-25 and the Known
           Proton Branching Ratio of Al-25 to Mg-24.

           Given in the Data Section.
           The Additional Error Due to the Uncertainties in the
           Target Thickness, the Counter Efficiency and the Recoil
           Correction Amounts to 33% of the Absolute  Cross

CORRECTION Due to the Thin Target a Large Fraction (80-92 %
           OF RECOILS COULD ESCAPE.  APPROPRIATE CORRECTIONS  WERE
           APPLIED.
