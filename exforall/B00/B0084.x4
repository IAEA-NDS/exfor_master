           To C.Williamson Et Al., Cea-2189(1962).
           The Beam Current was Determined by Means of a Faraday
           Cup, Calorimetrically and by Means of a Monitor
           Reaction.

           Al-Foils of 3.02 Mg/Cm**2 For Beam Monitoring and the
           Determination of Recoils. Purity of the Mo-Foils
           Higher Than 99%, Impurity 150 Ppm of Tungsten
           Found by Activation Analysis. No Impurities of Elements
           With Atomic Numbers Higher Than 22 Could be Detected
