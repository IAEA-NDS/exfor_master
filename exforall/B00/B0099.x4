TITLE      Excitation Functions For the Mg-24(D,A)Na-22,

           It was Experimentally Checked That the Deuteron Beam
           Was Free of H2+ Ions and That the Beam Intensity
           Measurement was not Influenced by Secondary Electrons.
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV,STTA,BCINT)
DETECTOR   (NAICR).Well-Type Crystal Used For Relative
           Measurements.
           (COIN,PROPC,NAICR).4Pi-Geometry.
           Used For Absolute Counting of the Irradiated Foils.
           The Electronic Drift in the Counting System Showed a
           Maximum Variation in the Gain of +-1% of the Mean Value
           Over a Period of Two Weeks.
ERR-ANALYS The Uncertainty of the Beam Energy, Determined Via
           Elastic Scattering from a Gold Foil, was +-0.1 MeV.
           Energy-Fluctuations During Bombardments were Estimated
           To be Less Than 0.2 MeV from Effective Energy Spreads
           At Several Deuteron Energies. Contributions from
           Secondary Electrons in the Faraday Cup were Found to be
           Negligible.
           The Accuracy of the 4Pi-Beta/Gamma Counting was Between
           0.5 and 1%.
           No Further Details Nor Total Error Values are Quoted.
CORRECTION Recoil Losses were Corrected For by Measuring the
           Activities of the Recoils in Suitable Adjacent Catcher
           Or Degrader Foils. These Foils were Chosen in Such a
           Way That Only Activities Dissimilar to the Respective
           Recoils from the Targets Could be Produced.
HISTORY    (19790306C)Lakw
           (20011008A) Lower Case. Method is Corrected. A Little
           Correction For Data Section has Been Made Too.

           At Energies Above 10 MeV the Reaction Mg-25(D,A+N)Na-22
           Can Contribute But is Suggested to be Less Important
           Due to the Small Abundance of Mg-25.

           The Incident Deuteron Energy was 16.2+-0.1 MeV. The
           Energy Degradation in the Stack was Calculated
           According to C.F.Williamson Et Al.,Cea-R3402(1966)
SAMPLE     Three Stacks Consisting of Foils of Natural Mg,
           Thickness Varying from 0.3 to 2.7 Mg/Cm**2, Produced
           From Spectrographically Pure Mg Rods by Rolling and
           Annealing Alternately, and of Al-Catcher and Degrader
           Foils of 3.416 Mg/Cm**2 Thickness and 99.997% Purity.
           Overlapping of Cross Sections was Avoided by Staggering
           The Target Foils with Respect to One Another in the
           Different Stacks.
COMMENT    Na-22 Counting was Started One Month After Bombardment.
           Na-22 Activity Originating from Na-23 Contamination
           Was Negligible. From the Three Stacks Irradiated
           20 Mg-Foils were Used For Absolute Counting.

FLAG       (1.) Mg-25(D,HE-3)Na-24 (THRESHOLD 7.09 MEV) And
           Mg-24(D,2P)Na-24 (THRESHOLD 7.54 MEV) Contribute at
           Deuteron Energies Higher Than About 10 MeV. The Given
           Cross Sections are Related to 100% Mg-25.
           Consequently this Value May be Affected by Unknown
           Portions of the Above Given Reactions.
           (2.) This Value Tabulated in the Second Reference May
           Be a Misprint. The Multiplication of the Original Value
           With the Given Factor of 0.936 would Result in 112 Mb
