TITLE      A Study of I-127(P,XN) And I-127(P,PXN) Reactions
           With Special Emphasis on Production of Xe-123

METHOD     (INTB,SITA,MOMIX)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           The Total Resolution of the Detector System at 1.33 MeV
           Was 3 KeV (FWHM).
           The Activity was Followed For a Period of at Least
           One Half-Life
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimated Total Errors Which are the Square
           Root of the Sum of the Squares of the Individual
           Errors. Included are All Errors Associated with
           Determination of Full-Energy Peak Areas, Decay Curve
           Analysis and Monitor Cross Sections. Not Included are
           Relatively Small Errors Arising from Uncertainties in
           The Decay Data (GAMMA-RAY BRANCHES AND HALF-LIVES),
           Counter Efficiency, and Irradiation Times.
