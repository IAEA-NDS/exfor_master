TITLE      Excitation Functions and Thick Target Yields For
           Radioisotopes Induced in Natural Mg, Co, Ni and Ta
           By Medium Energy Protons

           Used For a Preliminary Bombardment of a Single Stack
           Containing Foils of Mg, Co, Ni and Ta with 100 MeV
           Protons.
           (ISOCY,2BLGLVN)
           Used For Three Bombardments of Stacks Containing Foils
           Of Mg, Co, Ni and Ta with 85 MeV Protons and For
           Bombarding Thick Targets of Mg and Co.
CORRECTION As Experimentally Shown Recoil Losses Where Less Than
           0.3%. No Corrections were Therefore Made For this
           Effect. Corrections For the Attenuation of the Proton
           Beam Intensity were Calculated by Making Use of
           Experimentally Determined Total Cross Sections.
ERR-ANALYS The Overall Uncertainties in the Cross Sections are
           Estimated to be Between 6 and 9 %. They are Based on
           Estimated Systematic Errors, Reproducibility of the
           Results and Uncertainties in the Various Parameters
           Used For the Calculations.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Data Given by the Author in

           Thus Referring to the Produced Radioactivity Rather
           Than to a Specific Reaction.  This was done, Since Most
           Of the Activities are Produced Via Several Reactions.

SAMPLE    1Three Stacks Each Consisting of Foils of the Following
           Natural Elements For Which Thicknesses in Mg/Cm**2 and
           Chemical Purities are Given in Parentheses
           Mg (130 TO 260, BETTER THAN 99.9%), Co (220, 99.99%),
           Ni (220, 99.99%), Ta (250, 99.95%). The Sequence of the
           Four Elements was Changed in Replicate Stacks So As to
           Spread the Cross Sections More Evenly Over the Energy
           Range Involved. Apart from the Target Foils No Other
           Degrader or Catcher Foils were Employed in the Stacks.
