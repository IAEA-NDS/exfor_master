TITLE       (P,PN) And (P,AN) Excitation Functions.

           Information About the Monitor Reaction is Insufficient.
           Based on Similar Publications, E.G. Mccormick and
           Cohen,Phys.Rev.96,722(1954), the Compiler of Kachapag
           Regards the Coded Information As Very Likely.
ANALYSIS   Excitation Functions from Runs with Relative
           Measurements were Normalized in the 18 - 22 MeV Region
           To Such Runs Where Absolute Measurements were
           Performed. Absolute Beta Counting was Carried Out
           With Thin Foils Mounted on Cellophane Below a Thin-
           Window Geiger Counter. Small Corrections were Made
           For Beta-Absorption According to B.L.Cohen,Phys.Rev.81,
           184(1951). For Checking a Few Absolute Gamma
           Measurements were Performed by Counting the
           Annihilation Radiation with a Scintillation
           Detector and Comparing with the Annihilation Radiation
           From Zn-63 Produced by Cu-63(P,N).
ERR-ANALYS The Uncertainty Due to the Counting Statistics is not
           Specified Explicitly by the Authors But is Probably
           Small (COMMENT BY THE COMPILER OF KACHAPAG)
           The Probable Error of the Absolute Calibration is About
           25% Including Uncertainties of the Decay Data, Beta
           Absorption Correction, and the Monitor Cross Section.
           The Energy Distribution (FWHM) Of the Incident Pro-
           Tons (23.5 MEV) Was Less Than 0.5 MeV with a Sharp
           High-Energy Cutoff Due to an Absorber in the Cyclotron
           180 Degrees Away from the Target. Thus the Contribution
           From Higher Energy Particles to Cross Sections is
           Limited. In Case of Increasing Excitation Functions the
           Low-Energy Tail is not Effective.
