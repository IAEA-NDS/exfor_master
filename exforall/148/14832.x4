METHOD     (AMS,CHSEP) Foil activation experiments were
           performed using the Flattop critical assembly at the
           National Criticality Experiments Research Center as
           the neutron source, investigating activations by
           neutron spectra created with both the HEU and Pu
           cores. The 10Be/9Be ratio was measured through
           accelerator mass spectrometry and the experiment was
           simulated using MCNP to determine the total neutron
           fluence. Activation products in irradiated foils were
           measured through gamma spectrometry, except for the
           Be foils which were assayed via AMS. Irradiated foils
           were separated and dissolved individually, including
           Al wraps when present, in Aqua Regia, nitric acid, or
           hydrochloric acid, as required.
ANALYSIS   The experiments were simulated using the Monte Carlo
           N-Particle radiation transport code and combined with
           experimental results to determine the total neutron
           fluence, while the STAYSL-PNNL suite and FISPACT-II
           code were used to validate the model and assess the
           systematic uncertainty.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Combined statistical and systematic errors.

CORRECTION The measured values were corrected for Be and Al
           material blanks as well as reagent blanks.
