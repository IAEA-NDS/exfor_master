INSTITUTE  (1USADLS,1USATEX)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USATEX) The TRIGA Mark II nuclear research
           reactor at the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab-
           oratory (NETL) at the University of Texas.
INC-SPECT  The TRIGA Mark II nuclear research reactor at NETL
           thermal neutron flux of ~10**12 n/cm2/s. The flux is
           derived by scaling an MCNP spectra which has been
           tuned by 47 foils and subsequent unfolding with the
           SAND-II package with the amount of 99Mo activity
           created during exposure of the natural molybdenum
           monitoring wire. The flux at 0.025 eV is (4.38+-0.22)
           *10**12 n/cm2/s.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe system.
SAMPLE     A sample of 88Zr was produced at Los Alamos National
           Laboratory Isotope Production Facility through proton
           irradiation of a yttrium target 89Y(p,2n)88Zr and
           was delivered to NETL in 2N HCl solution. As the
           sample was over a year past initial separation, the
           88Y activity exceeded the 88Zr activity. These
           factors motivated a 88Zr/88Y separation. This was
           accomplished by immersing the sample within 0.01 M
           HDEHP in dodecane. The 88Zr residue was dissolved in
           2M nitric acid, transferred dropwise onto Kapton tape,
           and evaporated to dryness by heating. Kapton is a
           polyimide (C41H22N4O11) film with a silicone adhesive
           backing. The dried sample was sealed in two High-
           density polyethylene (HDPE) vials for irradiation
           along with a natural molybdenum flux monitor wire. A
           88Zr sample activity of 5 microCi was chosen to
           maximize the number of target atoms without creating an
            unmanageable dead-time during post-exposure counting.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The simultaneous measurement of 89mZr and
           89Zr requires a high neutron flux as well as prompt
           counting after exposure. Zirconium sample,
           accompanied by a 6mg natural molybdenum flux monitor,
           was irradiated for 10 min. Upon end of irradiation
           the sample was counted in a HPGe with an ORTEC DSPEC
           50 MCA. Measurement began 180 s after end of
           irradiation, at which point the 588 keV 89mZr
           activity was 500 counts/s. Spectra were extracted
           from the ORTEC MCA, corrected for deadtime, and
           background subtracted.

ANALYSIS   The amounts of 89Zr and 89mZr created by the
           88Zr(n,gamma) reaction both depend almost directly on
           flux, initial sample size, and cross section. By
           taking the ratio of the respective signals from these
           products, the uncertainty from these variables is
           minimized and the IYR better isolated. Chi-squared
           minimization was performed with MINUIT.
