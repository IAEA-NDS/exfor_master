INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Thermal column of Argonne heavy-water
           reactor.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A fissionability was measured in a sensitive
           ionization chamber inserted into thermal column of
           Argonne reactor.
SAMPLE     A thin sample was prepared by electroplating of
           platinum foil. The mass of neptunium was determined
           by alpha counting to be 142*10**-6 g.
METHOD     The fission rate of 237Np was compared under
           identical neutron-flux conditions with that of a
           standard thin sample of 239Pu. A fission rate of 6,
           000 fission per minute was observed in neptunium
           sample. Assuming that all fissions are due to 237Np
           and using the known thermal neutron cross section of
           239Pu, the thermal neutron cross section for 237Np
           was determined. This cross section is for fission by
           neutrons with a Maxwellian distribution of energy
           corresponding to a temperature of 293 degree K. The
           thermal nature of neutrons was confirmed by a
           measurement with cadmium shield that reduced counting
           rate by a factor of 100 or more.
