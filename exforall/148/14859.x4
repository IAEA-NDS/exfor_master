FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) ATLAS facility at the Argonne
           National Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,IOCH) The particle identification (PID) was
           performed by analyzing the cyclotron period of
           emitted light charged particles in a uniform magnetic
           field, combined with four sets of dE-E telescopes to
           detect 14C residues. The intensity of the incoming
           beam was monitored using a downstream ionization
           chamber.
SAMPLE     The 15C beam bombarded a target of deuterated
           polyethylene (CD2)n of thickness 363(20) microg/cm2
           or polyethylene (CH2)n of thickness 387(22)
           microg/cm2, which corresponded to the measurement of
           15C(p,d)14C and 15C(d,t)14C, respectively.
METHOD     (EDE) The kinematic reconstruction was achieved
           through high precision position-sensitive silicon
           detector arrays, which provided both position and
           energy information. This approach enabled the
           extraction of differential cross sections for
           transfer reactions populating the ground state (g.s.)
           of 14C, covering a range of center-of-mass angles
            (c.m.) from 15 to 35 degrees.

REACTION   (6-C-14(N,G)6-C-15,,SIG,,,DERIV)
ANALYSIS   The spectroscopic factors (SF) and asymptotic
           normalization coefficient (ANC) of the 15Cg.s. were
           determined from angular distributions using the
           distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory. Two
           consistent SFs were derived from the (p,d) and (d,t)
           reactions, which were subsequently used to deduce the
           14C(n,gamma)15C reaction cross section and the
           corresponding stellar reaction rate.
