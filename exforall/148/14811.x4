FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) Experiment performed at the High Flux
           Isotope Reactor at the Neutron Activation Analysis
           laboratory at HFIR, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The PT-1 irradiation location of the High Flux
           Isotope Reactor. The measured/calculated thermal flux
           was (4.2801+-0.1218) E+14 n/cm2/s, epithermal flux
            (9.441~+-0.0814) E+12 n/cm2/s and epithermal index
           0.022+-0.0007.
SAMPLE     The 237Np capture target consisted of (148.3+-3.2) ng
           of 99.9999+% pure 237Np deposited in a quartz vial,
           which was placed in a graphite capsule
           (93-NP-237,ENR=0.999999)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were measured using a coaxial n-
           type HPGe detector, with 58% relative efficiency. The
           distance between the target and the detector was 20 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The thermal flux in PT-1 location at 100% power
           is typically about 4E+14 n/cm2/s.Activated samples were
           transferred from reactor PT-1 position via decay
           station to measuring position using pneumatic transfer
           system. The measurements were collected over a 72-h
           period with measurement times starting at 1 hr and
           increasing to 4 hr per measurement.
