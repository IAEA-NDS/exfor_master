SAMPLE     A natural iridium sample of K2IrCl6 (iridium salt).
           The iridium salt was mixed with KCl in ratio of
           m(K2IrCl6)/m(KCl) = 0.6798(8) and pressed to a pellet
           with diameter of 7 mm. The KCl is a binding agent
           which helps maintaining pellet integrity. The pellet
           was combined with a nickel foil of the same diameter
           and sealed in an aluminum capsule. In addition, a
           double-sided 193Ir electrodeposit on a 2.5-microm thick
            titanium foil was irradiated together with the iridium
            salt capsule. The 193Ir electrodeposit had a diameter
           of 5 mm and was also combined with a nickel foil.
DETECTOR   (SI) Two Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) to measure
           the X-rays following the de-excitation of the
           isomeric state of 193Ir.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) An irradiation with 6 MeV neutrons for
           10 h. The neutron energy was selected to be below the
           193Ir(n,2n)192Ir reaction threshold of 7.8 MeV. The
           193Ir electrodeposit was placed at 1.6 cm from the
           end of the deuterium gas cell and the pellet of
           iridium salt was attached behind it. After the
           irradiation, the samples were transported to Los
           Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) where the pellet of
           iridium salt was processed in the radiochemical
           facility of LANL's Chemistry Division to purify the
           iridium from osmium and platinum contaminants and
           prepare counting samples. Reaction cross section was
           determined by means of measuring X-rays following
           electron conversion of the isomeric state at 80.2 keV
            (T1/2=10.53 days) in 193Ir.
CORRECTION The X-ray intensity was corrected for the attenuation
           in the samples.

ANALYSIS   The weighted average value of the cross section from
           the three samples produced from the iridium salt.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Authors used only the statistical
           uncertainty as a weighting factor when calculated the
           weighted average and then added the systematic
           uncertainty to obtain the total uncertainty.
