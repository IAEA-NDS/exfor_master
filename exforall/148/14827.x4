INSTITUTE  (2GERPTB)
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Spontaneous fission source of Cf-252.
INC-SPECT  Neutron source strength of 2.3*10**8 s-1. The flux
           density was monitored with by indium foils, using the
           the average result of the two In foils yielding a
           flux of 3.7*10**7 cm-2 s-1.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     Metallic niobium foils of 10 mm diameter and 28
           micrometer thickness.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The activity of thick metallic niobium foils
           after irradiation with 252Cf spontaneous fission
           neutrons was derived by measuring the emitted 16.6
           keV XKalpha-rays with a calibrated Ge detector
           considering self-absorption in the foils. The
           irradiation time was about 40 days and the neutron
           fluence 1.2*10**14 cm-2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty was calculated by quadratic
           summation of individual contributions as 7.0%.
           (ERR-S,,3.5) Count rate of foil 5:3% and standard:0.5%.
           (ERR-1) Activity of standard.
           (ERR-2) Sample detector distance.
           (ERR-3) Self absorption.
           (ERR-4) 93Nbm half life.
           (ERR-5) Indium cross section.
           (ERR-6) Indium activity.
           (ERR-7) Flux determination at Nb foil position.
