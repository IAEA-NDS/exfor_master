TITLE      Preliminary Determination of the Neutron Absorption

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) The Los Alamos homogeneous pile.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) A mica-window Geiger counter.
METHOD     (CHSEP) In the present experiment the previously used
           iodine sample was irradiated simultaneously with two
           normal iodine samples for 12.8 hours in the Los
           Alamos homogeneous pile, just outside the BeO
           reflector. Normal iodine, which is known to consist
           only of stable I127, should give on slow neutron
           irradiation only 25-min. I128. However, the sample
           which also contained some I129 yielded several
           thousand counts per minute of 12.6-hr. I130 after
           irradiation. All three samples were purified
           radio-chemically, mounted as AgI, and counted with a
           mica-window Geiger counter. Absorption of the
           radiations of the 12.5-hr. component in aluminum
           indicated two beta-rays with maximum energies of 0.54
           and 1.02 MeV. This compares favorably with the values
           for I130 reported in the literature of 0.61 and 1.03
           MeV.

ANALYSIS   The first, is based on the fission cross section of
           uranium, the fission yield of the chain of mass 129
            (0.7%), the weight of uranium, the time of
           irradiation, the approximate neutron flux in which
           the uranium slug was irradiated, and the assumptions
           that about 30% of the iodine in the slug was
           extracted and that the chemical yield was also about
           30%. This leads to a value of 7.6*10**15 for the
           number of I129 atoms and to a value of 2.5 barns
            (10**-24 cm2) for the cross section.

ANALYSIS   The other method of estimation is based on an
           approximate measurement of the 8.0-day I131 activity
           which was present at the end of the 123-day
           irradiation in the iodine sample. This assumes that
           the bombardment of the uranium was steady, especially
           near the end. The fission yield of I131 was taken as
           2.5%. This leads to a value of 1.9*10**15 I129 atoms
           and to a value of 10 barns for the cross section.
