TITLE      Evidence Against the Existence of 23-Hour V53

INSTITUTE  (1USAFSU,1USALAS)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) The Los Alamos Water Boiler.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The flux of neutrons greater than 5 MeV, i.e.,
           3.6*10**10 neutrons/cm2 sec.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure, normal chromium, 9.5% 53Cr.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) "Spec. pure" normal chromium was
           irradiated for about 13.4 hours in the fast neutron
           flux of the Los Alamos Water Boiler. Vanadium was
           chemically separated from the chromium and the
           vanadium sample counted in a beta proportional
           counter. This sample had a maximum beta activity of
           approximately 3 cpm which might be attributed to
           23-hour V53. No measurable gamma activity was present.
ANALYSIS   Assuming 5 MeV to be a reasonable value for the
           effective threshold for 53Cr(n,p) reaction and using
           what is considered to be the approximate value of the
           flux of neutrons greater than 5 MeV, an approximate
           limit of the average cross section for this reaction
           was calculated to be approximately 3.4*10**-5 mb.

           Compiler's comment: As the title of the paper already
           suggests, a 23 hr V-53 state is still unknown.
