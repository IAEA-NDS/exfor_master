INSTITUTE  (1USABNL,1USATEM,1USAORL)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORL) The PT-2 pneumatic tube of the High
           Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Neutron Activation
           Analysis laboratory (NAA) of Oak Ridge National
           Laboratory.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The measured thermal and epithermal neutron
           fluxes at the irradiation location are 4.59*10**13
           n/cm2/s and 1.96*10**11 n/cm2/s respectively for 235U,
           and 4.43*10**13 n/cm2/s and 3.24*10**11 n/cm2/s
           respectively for 239Pu. The energy ranges for
           epithermal neutrons are 0.1 eV to 10 keV for 239Pu
           and 1 eV to 10 keV for 235U. The neutron fluxes are
           measured using manganese and gold activation foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 44% relative efficiency, ORTEC p-type
           coaxial HPGe detector with an aluminum end cap.
SAMPLE     The 235U sample consists of 252.72 nanograms of
           natural uranium nitrate in an Inductively Coupled
           Plasma calibration solution. The 239Pu sample
           consists of 301.3 nanogram of National Institute of
           Standards and Technology (NIST) Certified Reference
           Material (CRM-137).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Each sample is irradiated for 30 s, and then
           transported to the detector chamber using the
           pneumatic tube transfer system which introduces a
           20-s delay prior to the gamma-ray measurement. The
           gamma rays are measured with a coaxial HPGe detector.
           Each sample is placed at 33 cm above the detector and
           measured for 30 s.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty in the expected gamma-ray
           yield is evaluated through a quadrature sum of
           uncertainties in the total number of nuclides present
           at the end of irradiation, the absolute efficiency of
           the HPGe, and and the gamma emission intensity.
