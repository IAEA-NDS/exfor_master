DETECTOR   (HPGE)
SAMPLE     The tungsten foils used were 10 mm x 10 mm in area
           and 0.01 mm thick. They were sandwiched between two
           Au monitor foils of the same area and 0.025 mm in
           thickness.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The foil assembly was positioned at a
           distance of 1.2 cm from the end of the neutron
           production targets at 0 degree. Irradiation times
           varied between 2 and 12 h, depending on the neutron
           source reaction and the deuteron energy. Neutron flux
           was obtained from the measured 196Au activity
            (total yield in the photopeak) and the cross-section
           values for the 197Au(n,2n)196Au monitor reaction.
           The Au foils were counted independently from the W
           foils.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty is governed by the 12%
           uncertainty associated with the gamma-ray intensity.
           (ERR-S,0.2,1.5) Counting statistics.
           (ERR-1) Detector efficiency.
           (ERR-2) Half-life.
           (ERR-3,11.2,12.5) Gamma-ray intensity.
           (ERR-4) Coincidence summing.
           (ERR-5,,1.) Self-absorption of gamma-rays.
           (ERR-6,,0.5) Neutron flux fluctuations.
           (ERR-7,,0.2) Irradiation, decay, and counting times.
CORRECTION Additional corrections were applied for the
           coincidence summing, self-absorption of gamma-rays,
           and neutron flux fluctuation. Care was taken to
           minimize these effects such that the correction is
           generally <1%. Self-absorption of the signal x-rays
           was calculated using the attenuation coefficients.
