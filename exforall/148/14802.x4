SAMPLE     The U308 plaque (450 g).
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The boron chamber.
METHOD     First the number of delayed neutrons from the U30s
           plaque, detected by the boron chamber immediately
           after the irradiation, was measured. The number of
           fissions per second from a known amount of uranium in
           a second detection chamber was then determined under
           the same geometrical conditions. The ratio of the
           initial number of delayed neutrons per second to the
           total number of fissions per second produced in the
           plaque was thus found to be 1:60. Measurements with
           and without cadmium and boron around the uranium
           during irradiation showed that under these conditions
           the effect is produced primarily by slow neutrons and
           approximately follows the 1/v law.
