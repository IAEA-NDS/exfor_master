TITLE      Thermal Neutron Cross Section for 125I
AUTHOR     (D.C.Santry,R.D.Werner)
REFERENCE  (R,INDC(SEC)-62,120(2),1977)
INSTITUTE  (1CANCRC)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) NRU reactor.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN,GELI)
METHOD     (INTB) Irradiations in the NRU reactor for about 33
           days gave an integrated flux of 7.3 x 10**20
           neutrons/cm2 with depletion ratios of 2.2 for 125I
           and 1.037 for 131I. Gamma-ray counting rates of the
           iodine samples were measured before and after neutron
           irradiations, using high resolution photon detectors.
           The 35-keV gamma ray of 125I was measured with an
           intrinsic Ge X-ray detector, while the 364-keV gamma
           ray of 131I and 1.33-MeV gamma ray of 60Co were
           measured with a Ge(Li) detector.
ANALYSIS   Calculated cross sections based on these depletion
           ratios are 1030 +- 300 barns for 125I and 85 +- 50
           barns for 131I.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An observed scatter in results of 15 to
           25% was traced to instabilities in the data
           acquisition system.
