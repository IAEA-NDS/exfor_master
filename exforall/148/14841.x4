FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State
           University.
DETECTOR   (LONGC,SI,NAICR) The Neutron Emission Ratio Observer
            (NERO) neutron long counter system and the Beta
           Counting Station (BCS). A stack of two Si PIN
           detectors and an Al degrader on a rotating holder,
           the Summing NaI detector.
METHOD     (TOF) A 35 p nA 82Se beam with an energy of 140 MeV/u
           was impinged on a 352 mg/cm2 beryllium target. After
           fragmentation, cocktail beam consisted almost
           entirely of 61V (24%), 62Cr (19%), 64Mn (51%), and
           65Fe (6%). For Beam particles were identified using
           the E-TOF (time of flight) method, with the energy loss
            taken from a 525-microm thick Si PIN detector located
           at the beginning of the end station, and the time of
           flight calculated from the time difference between an
           I2 scintillator at the image position of the A1900 and
           the PIN detector. The beam was implanted in a
           979-microm thick double-sided silicon strip detector
            (DSSD) as part of the BCS. Neutrons detected by NERO
           and the beta by BCS in the 200 microsec following a
           decay event were considered to be associated with the
           beta decay.
CORRECTION Momentum-corrected particle identification.
