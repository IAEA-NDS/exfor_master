TITLE      Measurements of the 235U fission cross section at 552
            and 644 keV
FACILITY   (VDG) 3-MeV Van de Graaff.
INC-SOURCE 51V(p,n)51Cr reaction. Target was positioned in the
            center of a spherical ionization chamber.
SAMPLE     Uranium layer, 99.8% 235U and 120 micro-g/cm2 thick,
            deposited on the inner sphere of ionization chamber
            using molecular plating.
MONITOR    51Cr activity associated with neutrons from 51V(p,n)
            source reaction used to determine absolute neutron
            flux.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission events were measured by a spherical
            ionization chamber surrounding the source. 0.025 cm.
            thick silver spheres had a diameter of 3 inches
            (inner sphere) 5 inches (outer sphere).
            Alpha activity was counted in the ionization chamber.
            After the end of the run, gamma activity of the target
            was measured with a calibrated Na(Tl) detector.

CORRECTION A total coorection of 3.6% applied for effects of:
           . total absorption of fission fragments,
           . backscattering of neutrons from outer sphere,
           . increase of the flight path in 235U for neutrons
             scattered in the inner sphere,
           . inelastic scattering of neutrons in target and
             counter,
           . backscattering of neutrons from the construction
               materials,
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error, statistical plus systematic.
