TITLE      Neutron capture cross section of 135Xe
SAMPLE     Sample prepared by mass separation and ion
            implantation in high purity Al foils.
METHOD     (BURN) Burnup by activity depletion
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) gamma spectrometer.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data error results from 2 sources
           - error of 1.4% in integrated neutron flux,
           - counting errors involved in measuring relative
             activities of 2 sources before and after one of the
             sources was irradiated with neutrons. The activity of
             each sample was measured with a statistical error of
             1.5% at the 0.9 probability level.
ADD-RES     Half-life determination of the 135Xe sources gave a
             value of 9.20+-0.03 hr.

INC-SPECT  Thermalized neutron spectrum. Neutron temperature -
            318+-5 K.
COMMENT    Calculated value for 2200 m/sec c/s = 2.64e+06 b,
             using spin = 5/8 for 0.084 ev resonance and
                   spectrum factors:  R = 0.0036
                                      S = -1.0 (Story est.)
                                      G = 1.175 (Westcott)
           If spin = 3/8 assumed c/s = 2.69E+06.
