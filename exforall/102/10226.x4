TITLE      Radiative capture of energetic neutrons by 208Pb
FACILITY   (VDG) LASL tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-T) 3H(p,n)3He reaction
SAMPLE     Lead sample consisted of 98.7% isotopically pure 208Pb
            in cylindrical form.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           Time of flight technique used to reduce background and
            to separate gammas due to other sources
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma rays detected with an anti-Compton
            spectrometer consisting of a center NaI(Tl) crystal
            surrounded by a NaI(Tl) annulus.
           Neutron flux measured using counter telescope
            consisting of a NaI(Tl) crystal.
ANALYSIS   (4PI1A) Data obtained from angular distribution at 90
            degrees.
MONITOR    Gamma ray detector efficiency determined as a function
            of energy by utilizing gammas from 11B(p,gamma)12C,
            12C(p,p'gamma)12C, and 89Y(p,gamma)90Zr.
CORRECTION Corrected for background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty in cross section.
           Uncertainty in neutron flux across sample estimated to
            be 5.0%.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author
           Tabulated data received from D. Drake, February 1972.
HISTORY    (19730803C)
           (19821015A) Converted to REACTION formalism
           (20010309A) Updated to new date formats, lower case.
