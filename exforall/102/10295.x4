TITLE      Spherical-Wave Neutron Propagation and Pendelloesung
            Fringe Structure in Silicon
FACILITY   (REAC)
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal neutron spectrum.
SAMPLE     Perfect silicon crystal. Thickness = 0.55524 cm.
METHOD     (DIFFR) Pendelloesung fringe patterns within the Bragg
            reflection were used to determine the coherent
            scattering amplitude.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Slow neutron BF3 detector.
           Incident beam highly collimated (3 min arc). Exit slit
            placed exactly at center of the Bragg reflection band.
ANALYSIS   Intensity data as a function of crystal orientation
            were fitted to the Kato spherical wave theory.
           Assumed neutron charge amplitude = 0.00043E-12.
CORRECTION Corrections for use of finite size slit opening and
            for crystal curvature were applied.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.

           (19830117A) Converted to REACTION formalism
           (20011227A) Updated to new date formats, lower case.
                       Added SF4 to reaction string.
