TITLE      Thermal neutron fission cross section and fission
            resonance integral of 254Es
FACILITY   (REAC,1USASRL) Savannah River Standard Pile.
SAMPLE     5.0E-11 g of 254Es electrodeposited on 1.0-inch
            diameter platinum foil. 250Cf and 252Cf observed to
            be <1.0% of total alpha activity. Target purity
            confirmed by gamma analysis using a Ge(Li) detector
            and alpha pulse height analysis.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Lexan plastic fission track detectors
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Details of error analysis not given.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Tables 1 and 2 of reference.

REACTION   (99-ES-254(N,F),,RI)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Samples irradiated in core of reactor.
INC-SPECT  Cadmium ratio of 33 for 235U fission, neutron fluence
            about 2.0E+13 and an approximately isotropic flux
            distribution.
SAMPLE     Sample enclosed in 3.0e-02 inch cadmium (0.625 eV
            cutoff energy).
MONITOR    (98-CF-249(N,F),,RI)
ANALYSIS   Three measurements weighted by reciprocal of squares
            of the standard deviations of each measurement to
            give the final result.
