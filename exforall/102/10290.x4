TITLE      Sub-threshold neutron induced fission in 238U
INC-SOURCE (EXPLO) Nuclear explosive device Physics-8 shot.
SAMPLE     UO2 sample, 0.9 mg/cm**2 of 238U, vacuum evaporated on
            3.6E-04 cm stainless steel backing with a total of
            3.8 mg of 238U in the neutron beam. Source was stated
            to have 99.9999% 238U, 0.00002% 234U and <0.00005%
            235U.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight with a flight path 244 m long.
           Fission measurement.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two semiconductor detectors. only one signal
            analyzed.
CORRECTION  Correction for 235U impurity in sample.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted uncertainties are standard deviations
            based on statistical uncertainty and estimate of
            reliability of fission fragment counting from film
            record at 25%.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.
            Data taken from reference.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           Average fission width quoted here is an average over
            37.,66.,103.,117.,165.,190.,209., and 237. eV
            resonances and gives an upper limit of 0.13E-06 eV
            to the fission width at 95% confidence level.
