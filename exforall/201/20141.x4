TITLE      -PRECISE 2200 M/S FISSION CROSS-SECTION OF U-235.-
FACILITY   .BELGIAN BR2 HIGH FLUX REACTOR.
           (CHOPS)    SLOW CHOPPER, BURST WIDTH 25 MU-SEC, 184 HZ.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     THE SLOW CHOPPER WAS INSTALLED AT THE
            TANGENTIAL BEAM TUBE T-7 OF THE BR2-REACTOR.
SAMPLE     .FOUR SAMPLES OF EVAPORATED U-F(4) LAYERS
           .ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IN PERCENT,
              U-234   1.0812+-0.0020,   U-235  93.336+-0.010,
              U-236   0.2027+-0.0006,   U-238   5.380+-0.005.
METHOD     (TOF)      TIME OF FLIGHT, FLIGHT PATH = 2003.6+-0.2 MM
DETECTOR   (SOLST)    ONE LARGE AU-SI SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR WAS
            USED FOR THE DETECTION OF BOTH FISSION FRAGMENTS AND
            ALPHA PARTICLES FROM B-10(N,ALPHA) REACTION FROM
            NATURAL BORON SAMPLES USED AS STANDARD.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG)
            = 3834+-5 BARN AT 2200 M/SEC EVALUATED FROM
            LITTERATURE BETWEEN 1960 AND 1967.
