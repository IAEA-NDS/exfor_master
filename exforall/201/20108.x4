TITLE      -REACTOR CROSS-SECTION OF THE REACTION
            K-41(N,ALPHA)CL-38  AND ITS INTERFERENCE IN
            ACTIVATION ANALYSIS.-
FACILITY   (REAC )    JEEP I REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    JEEP I REACTOR, CENTRE OF ISOTOPIC CHANNEL,
           .THERMAL FLUX DENSITY = 2.5E+12 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ/SEC,
           .FAST    FLUX DENSITY = 1.5E+11 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ/SEC.
INC-SPECT  .THE FAST NEUTRON DISTRIBUTION IS ASSUMED TO BE SIMILAR
            TO A PURE FISSION SPECTRUM. THIS SEEMS TO BE TRUE AT
            LEAST FOR ENERGIES ABOVE 4 MEV, WHICH IS ABOUT THE
            EFFECTIVE THRESHOLD OF THE REACTIONS STUDIED.
SAMPLE                ABOUT 300 MILLIG. K(2)-C-O(3).
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION, IRRADIATED DURING 30 MIN.
           (CHSEP)    RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    NAI(TL)-CRYSTAL, MULTICHANNEL ANALYZER.
ANALYSIS   .PEAK AREA CALCULATIONS.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG,,SPA)
              FISSION SPECTRUM AVERAGED
            CROSS-SECTION IS 0.60 MILLIBARN.
COMMENT    .EFFECTIVE THRESHOLD GREATER THAN 4 MEV FOR
            INVESTIGATED REACTION AS WELL AS MONITOR REACTION.
