REACTION   (90-TH-232(N,F),PR,NU)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons with energies from 1.4 to 2.6 MeV
           were produced by the reaction T(p,n)He3 using thin
           adsorbed tritium targets with gold backings.
           (D-D) At 7.45 MeV a deuterium gas-target was used
SAMPLE      * The chamber contained a total amount of 1.3 g of
           Th-232 and was filled with a mixture of argon and 10%
           of CO2 to a pressure of 1 atm. The fissile material
           was painted on ten platinum plates, 4.4 cm in diameter,
           with a coating thickness of 4 mg/cm2. The plates were
           mounted in parallel in the fission chamber with an
           interspace of 5 mm.
            * The measurement at 1.6 MeV was also made with
           another type of fission chamber, which consisted of
           three concentric platinum cylinders with a height of
           5 cm and an interspace of 5 mm. The total deposited
           area was about 350 cm2 and the thickness
           of the coated Th232-layer was 2 mg/cm2.
REL-REF    (R,20072002,H.Conde+,J,NSE,11,397,1961)
COMMENT    .A least square fit to the data from 1.6 to 14.9 MeV
            of incident neutron energy E(n) yields
            nu-bar(E(n)) = 1.849+0.154*E(n)
           .The measurements indicate that the energy dependence
            in the energy region near the fission threshold may be
            non-linear
FLAG       (1.) Corrected data from ref. (see REL-REF), assuming
           the same corrections as in the present investigation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error given is statistical only.
           (ERR-1,,0.5) The error in the nu-bar value due to
           uncertainties in the correction is estimated to be
           less than 0.5%
