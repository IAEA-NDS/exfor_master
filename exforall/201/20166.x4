TITLE        Spin of some low-energy neutron resonances by
             resonance scattering
FACILITY   (SPECC,2BLGMOL)  Crystal spectrometer at BR1-reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)    BR1-reactor, neutron beam from the core.
INC-SPECT   Monochromatic beam obtained from Bragg-reflection on
            Si(111) planes.
METHOD     .Measured total cross-section and scattering
            cross-section with identical experimental conditions.
ANALYSIS   .Deduced ratio of neutron width to total width =
            (elastic scattering cross-section - potential scatt.)/
            (total cross-section) at resonance.
MONITOR    (82-PB-0(N,EL)82-PB-0,,SIG)
             Scattering cross-section of lead, value not given.
DETECTOR   (BF3)
COMMENT     Scattering sample at right angle to neutron beam
            (diam. 2 cm), surrounded by BF(3) counters (length
            50 cm).
CORRECTION .Corrections for self-screening and absorption of
            scattered neutrons in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS .Mainly systematic errors due to eventual sample
            impurities and due to higher order contribution in
            diffracted beam. Therefore an upper limit is given
            for the ratio neutron width to total width.

ANALYSIS   .The statistical weight factor g is obtained from the
            ratio neutron-width to total width and from the known
            resonance parameters (weight-factor)*(neutron width)
            and total width.
