            The population of low lying states of known spin
            depends on the spin of the capturing state.
            The change in population is measured by taking the
            intensity ratio of two low lying gamma-rays with
            suitable chosen initial levels of different spins.

            assuming an E1 or M1 transition. (see REL-REF)

            The population of low lying states of known spin
            depends on the spin of the capturing state.
            The change in population is measured by taking the
            intensity ratio of two low lying gamma-rays with
            suitable chosen initial levels of different spins.
            Primary gamma-rays populating low lying levels of
            known spin give the spin of the capturing state
            assuming an E1 or M1 transition. (see REL-REF, (2)).
