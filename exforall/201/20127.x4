TITLE      -VARIATION OF THE BINARY-TO-TERNARY FISSION RATIO FOR
            92-U-235 IN THE RESONANCE REGION.-
FACILITY   (LINAC)    ELECTRON LINEAR ACCELERATOR OF CBNM.
INC-SOURCE .PHOTO NEUTRONS FROM NATURAL URANIUM TARGET
            MODERATED BY A POLYETHYLENE SHEET.
SAMPLE     .TWO DEPOSITS OF 2 MILLI-G/CM2 BACK-TO-BACK
           .OF 99.5 PER-CENT ENRICHED U-235.
METHOD     (TOF)      TIME OF FLIGHT,FLIGHT PATH = 8 M.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)    LARGE GOLD-SILICON SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS
            (FOUR 6 CM2 DETECTORS), ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BACK-TO-
            BACK TARGET.
           .DETECTION OF LONG RANGE ALPHA (ABSORBER IN) AND OF
            FISSION FRAGMENTS (ABSORBER OUT). THE ABSORBER IS
            20 MICRON THICK ALUMINIUM.
MONITOR    .TERNARY TO BINARY FISSION RATIOS WERE NORMALIZED
            TO THE VALUE AT THE 8.78 EV RESONANCE.
COMMENT    .THE LOWER DETECTION LEVEL FOR TERNARY ALPHA PARTICLES
            WAS ABOUT 10 MEV. AS A CHANGE IN THE RATIOS MAY BE
            EXPECTED DEPENDING ON THE TERNARY-ALPHA DETECTION
            LEVEL, A MEASUREMENT WITH A LEVEL OF ABOUT 15 MEV HAS
            NOW BEEN DONE (SEE STATUS).
STATUS     (SPSDD)    SUPERSEDED BY NUCL.PHYS.,A194(1972)657.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),TER/BIN,SIG/RAT,,RES)
            RATIOS TERNARY/BINARY FISSION AT RESONANCE ENERGY,
            NORMALIZED TO THE VALUE FOR THE 8.78 EV RESONANCE.
PART-DET   (FF,A)     FISSION FRAGMENTS, ALPHA S.
COMMENT    .AVERAGE OF TWO RUNS WITH DIFFERENT DETECTOR GEOMETRIES
            WHICH AGREE WITHIN EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS.
           .TWO GROUPS OF RESONANCES EMERGE, 8.78 AND 12.3 EV WITH
            LOW T/B RATIO AND 19.3 AND 22.1 EV WITH ABOUT 15 PERC.
            HIGHER T/B RATIO.
           .CORRELATION WITH OTHER MEASUREMENTS SHOW,
            AGREEMENT WITH SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS (SPIN VALUES)
            AND FISSION FRAGMENT ANISOTROPY,
            DISAGREEMENT WITH GAMMA-RAY MULTIPLICITY EXPERIMENTS
            (SPIN VALUES) AND
            NO CONTRADICTION WITH EXPERIMENTS ON KINETIC ENERGY
            AND MASS SYMMETRY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS.
           .EARLIER MEASUREMENTS OF THE RATIO DID NOT
            SIGNIFICANTLY SHOW THIS EFFECT PROBABLY DUE TO A TOO
            LOW TERNARY-ALPHA DETECTION LEVEL.
