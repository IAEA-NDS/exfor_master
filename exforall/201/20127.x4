TITLE       Variation of the binary-to-ternary fission ratio for
            U-235 in the resonance region

INSTITUTE  (2ZZZGEL)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)  Electron linear accelerator of CBNM.
INC-SOURCE  Photo neutrons from natural uranium target
            moderated by a polyethylene sheet.
SAMPLE      Two deposits of 2 milli-g/cm2 back-to-back
            of 99.5% enriched U-235.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight,flight path = 8 m.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Large gold-silicon surface barrier detectors
            (four 6 cm2 detectors), on both sides of the back-to-
            back target.
            Detection of long range alpha (absorber in) and of
            fission fragments (absorber out). The absorber is
            20 micron thick aluminium.
MONITOR     Ternary to binary fission ratios were normalized
            to the value at the 8.78 eV resonance.
COMMENT     The lower detection level for ternary alpha particles
            was about 10 MeV. As a change in the ratios may be
            expected depending on the ternary-alpha detection
            level, a measurement with a level of about 15 MeV has
            now been done (see status).

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F)2-HE-4,TER,FY,,RES/REL)
            ratios ternary/binary fission at resonance energy,
           normalized to the value for the 8.78 eV resonance.
PART-DET   (FF,A)     Fission fragments, alpha's.
COMMENT     Average of two runs with different detector geometries
            which agree within experimental errors.
            Two groups of resonances energies, 8.78 and 12.3 eV
            with low ter/bin ratio and 19.3 and 22.1 eV with
            about 15% higher ter/bin ratio.
            Correlation with other measurements show,
            agreement with scattering experiments (spin values)
            and fission fragment anisotropy,
            disagreement with gamma-ray multiplicity experiments
            (spin values) and
            no contradiction with experiments on kinetic energy
            and mass symmetry of fission fragments.
            Earlier measurements of the ratio did not
            significantly show this effect probably due to a too
            low ternary-alpha detection level.
