TITLE       Precise 2200 m/sec fission cross-sections of Pu-239
            and U-235
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) Belgian BR2 high flux reactor.
           (CHOPS,2BLGMOL)    Slow chopper.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    BR2-reactor, the slow chopper was installed
            at the tangential beam tube T-7.
METHOD     (TOF  )    Time of flight, flight path = 2 m.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)    One large Au-Si surface barrier detector was
            used for the detection of fission fragments and alpha-
            particles from B-10. The detection of the alphas and
            fission fragments was made with excellent pulse-height
            resolution in low geometry.
ANALYSIS    Straight line fit through 20 points between 0.005 and
            0.1 eV for 2200 m/sec values and integrals.
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,,SIG) = 3835 +- 5 barn at 2200 m/sec
            Evaporated boron layer.
            The absolute B-10 contents was determined from direct
            weighing in vacuum and correction for chemical and
            isotopic analysis.

SAMPLE      Deposited on gold coated quartz
            disks, U-235 was evaporated as U-F(4).
            Isotopic composition in per-cent,
             U-234   1.0812 +- 0.0020,   U-235   93.336 +- 0.010,
             U-236   0.2027 +- 0.0006,   U-238    5.380 +- 0.005,
            in U235-F(4) samples (U4,U5 NBS-930).
            The amounts of U-235 on the foils were determined
            from precise low-geometry alpha-counting.
            The neutron induced fission rates were checked as a
            relative control.
            Weights of U-samples (weights in micro-g U-235) are
            1597.8 +- 2.8 (sample U4), 3228.0 +- 5.7 (sample U5).
            The determination of the specific activity of U-sample
            (nbs-930) is heavily dependent on the alpha-half-life
            of U-234.
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments.
COMMENT     A final value for the 2200 m/sec fission cross-section
            of 92-U-235 was obtained, making use of a carefully
            redetermined value of the U-234 alpha-half-life of
            (2.446 +- 0.002)*E+5 years at CBNM.
            The thermal fission cross section of U-235 as
            recommended by the IAEA-review (Hanna et al.,Atomic
            Energy Review,VII,4(1963)3.) may be too low by a few
            barns.
           .The Westcott g(F) values for 20.44 deg-C Maxwell-
            distribution is  g(F) = 0.9780 +- 0.0010.

            The 2200 m/s fission cross-sections.
SAMPLE      Deposited on gold coated quartz disks,
            Pu-239 was deposited as Pu-acetate by electrospraying.
            Isotopic composition in per-cent,
             Pu-239   99.979, Pu-240   0.02, Pu-241   0.001,
            in Pu-acetate-samples (TP442-1 and TP442-3).
            The amounts of U-235 and Pu-239 on the foils were
            determined from precise low-geometry alpha-counting.
            The neutron induced fission rates were checked as a
            relative control.
            Weights of Pu-samples (weights in micro-g Pu-239) are
            267.72 +- 0.43 (sample TP442-1) and 1010.40 +- 1.62
            (sample TP442-3).
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments.
COMMENT     The separation between the pile-up tail produced by
            the alpha-particles of Pu-239 and the fission fragment
            pulse-height distribution was very good.
            The Westcott g(F) values for 20.44 deg-C Maxwell-
            distribution is
            g(F)= 1.0540 +- 0.00018(BR2), 1.0566 +- 0.018(Linac).
            For Pu-239, the present results seem to confirm
            completely the recommended values (Hanna et al.,Atomic
            Energy Review,VII,4(1969)3 ).
