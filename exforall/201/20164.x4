TITLE      -HIGH RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS OF GAMMA RAYS PRODUCED
            BY 15 MEV NEUTRONS.-
FACILITY   (VDG  )    AN-400 POSITIVE ION ACCELERATOR AT LUND.
            DEUTERON ENERGY = 400 KEV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    T(D,N)HE4 REACTION.
INC-SPECT  .NEUTRON ENERGY OF 15 MEV. THE NEUTRONS INCIDENT ON THE
            SAMPLE (ANGULAR INTERVAL 20 TO 70 DEG) HAD N-ENERGY
            BETWEEN 14.7 AND 15.5 MEV.
DETECTOR   (GELI )    GE(LI)-DETECTOR (RCA,SJGG-7/70) USED FOR
            GAMMA RADIATION WITH ENERGY LESS THAN 7.5 MEV.
           .DEPLETION DEPTH = 7 MM.
           .THE RESOLUTION OF THE DETECTOR SYSTEM WAS ABOUT 7 KEV
            AT 1 MEV AND ABOUT 20 KEV AT 6 MEV.

             THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR
            THE 4.43 MEV G-LINE FROM C12(N,N G)C12 AT AN INCIDENT
            N-ENERGY OF 14.8 MEV IS GIVEN BY I.L.MORGAN, ANNUAL
            PROGRESS REPORT FOR PERIOD ENDING AUG 1,1964,P.156,
            TEXAS NUCLEAR CORPORATION.
COMMENT    .DISTANCE BETWEEN TARGET AND SAMPLE = ABOUT 10 CM.
            DETECTOR PLACED ABOUT 50 CM FROM THE SAMPLE, ANGLES
            BETWEEN THE DIRECTION OF THE NEUTRONS AND THAT OF THE
            GAMMA RAYS TO THE DETECTOR WERE VARIED 50 TO 110 DEG.
           .NEUTRONS BY (D-T) REACTION AND INCIDENT ON THE SAMPLE,
            SUBTENDED AN ANGLE BETWEEN 20 AND 70 DEG RELATIVE TO
            THE DIRECTION OF THE D-BEAM.
HISTORY    (701124C)
           (740521E)
ERR-ANALYS .THE LOWER LIMITS FOR CROSS SECTION DETERMINATION WERE
            ABOUT 3 MB/SR AT 0.5 MEV, 1 MB/SR AT 1 MEV AND 0.5
            MB/SR AT 3 MEV FOR FE, NI AND CU SAMPLES. FOR NATURAL
            PB AND BI THE CORRESPONDING CROSS SECTION VALUES WERE
            7, 3 AND 1 MB/SR RESPECTIVELY.
           .THE STABILITY OF THE DETECTOR SYSTEM WAS +- 1/2
            CHANNEL(1 CHANNEL = 1.6 KEV), BETTER THAN EARLIER EXP.

ANALYSIS   .SINCE THE CASCADE POPULATION IS THE RESULT OF THE DE-
            EXITATION OF A NUMBER OF LEVELS, THE ANG-DISTRIBUTION
            OF THE G-RADIATION FROM LOW-LYING STATES TENDS TO BE
            ISOTROPIC.
           (4PI1A)    THE TOTAL INELASTIC SCATTERING CROSS
            SECTIONS WERE ESTIMATED BY MULTIPLYING THE MEASURED
            DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION BY 4 PI.
PART-DET   (G    )    GAMMAS.
COMMENT    .ONLY ONE GAMMA RAY LINE (E(G) = 0.920 MEV) FROM
            BI-209(N,2N)BI-208.  LEVELS ARE COMPLICATED.
           .UPPER LIMIT OF BI(N,N ) CROSS SECTION IS GIVEN TO BE
            670 +- 40 MB, BY GRAVES, DAVIS, PHYS.REV.97(1955)1205.
STATUS     .TAKEN FROM TABLE 7, ARK.FYS.39(1969) P.310.

CORRECTION .MEASURED GAMMA YIELDS WERE CORRECTED FOR MULTIPLE
            SCATTERING BY MONTE CARLO CALCULATION.  THE RATIO OF
            THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS SCATTERED NON-ELASTICALLY
            AFTER THE SECOND OR THIRD COLLISION TO THE NUMBER OF
            NEUTRONS SCATTEREN NON-ELASTICALLY AT THE FIRST
            COLLISION VARIES FROM 0.15 TO 0.20.
           .GAMMA INTENSITIES WERE CORRECTED FOR VARIATION OF N-
            FLUX IN THE SAMPLE AND FOR GAMMA-RAY ABSORPTION.
