TITLE       Total cross-sections for 28.4 MeV neutrons
AUTHOR     (G.Deconninck, A.Gonze, P.Macq, J.P.Meulders)
REFERENCE  (J,JPR,22,652,1961)  (in French)
INSTITUTE  (2BLGLVN)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) not specified
SAMPLE     Samples in the form of powder, or in crystal such
           as S, Mn, As, I, P were obtained by compression.
           Liquid elements such as Hg, CCl(4) Br were placed in
           a thin-walled cylinder.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission with good geometry.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE-102 plastic scintillator.
CORRECTION  Corrected for 'inscattering' (see COMMENT) and
           background.
COMMENT    The detector additionally to transmitted neutrons
           received elastically scattered neutrons from the
           target. Counting these neutrons is a measurement error
           that results in a reduction in the calculated total
           cross section.
REL-REF    (M,20172001,G.Deconninck+,J,BCS,44,851,1958) - Method
            of 'inscattering' error calculation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The statistical error is an order of
           magnitude greater than the error due to
            'inscattering', no further details given.
