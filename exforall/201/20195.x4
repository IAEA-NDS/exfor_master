TITLE       Total cross-sections for 28.4 MeV neutrons
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)    Cyclotron
INC-SOURCE (D-T)    Deuteron-tritium
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) not specified
SAMPLE     Samples in the form of powder, or in crystal such
           as S, Mn, As, I, P were obtained by compression.
           Liquid elements such as Hg, CCl(4) Br were placed in
           a thin-walled cylinder.
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission with good geometry.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     NE-102 plastic scintillator.
CORRECTION .Corrected for inscattering and background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The statistical error is an order of
           magnitude greater than the error due to inscattering,
           no further details given.

HISTORY    (19721005C)
           (19820128A) A.P.T. Subents 020 021 022 added and
             ISO-QUANT changed to REACTION codes
           (20170425A) SD:Updated to new date formats,lower case.
           Meaningless zeros were deleted from the values in
           Subents 002-022. REACTION code corrected in Subent 021.
           Free text update in Subent 001, SAMPLE,INC-SPECT were
           added.
