TITLE      - SPIN MEASUREMENT OF THE 2.4 EV RESONANCE OF HF-177 -
FACILITY   (SPECC)    CRYSTAL SPECTROMETER AT BR1-REACTOR.
METHOD     .MEASURED TOTAL CROSS-SECTION AND SCATTERING
            CROSS-SECTION WITH IDENTICAL EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS.
ANALYSIS   .DEDUCED RATIO OF NEUTRON WIDTH TO TOTAL WIDTH =
            (ELASTIC SCATTERING CROSS-SECTION - POTENTIAL SCATT.)/
            (TOTAL CROSS-SECTION) AT RESONANCE.
MONITOR    (82-PB-0(N,EL),,SIG)
             SCATTERING CROSS-SECTION OF LEAD, VALUE
            NOT GIVEN, USED FOR CROSS-SECTION NORMALIZATION.

            THE 2.4 EV RESONANCE AN EXPERIMENT WITH IMPROVED
            CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATED. THE RESONANCE SPIN
            VALUE = 4 HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

ANALYSIS   .THE STATISTICAL WEIGHT FACTOR G IS OBTAINED FROM THE
            RATIO NEUTRON-WIDTH TO TOTAL WIDTH AND FROM THE KNOWN
            RESONANCE PARAMETERS (WEIGHT-FACTOR)*(NEUTRON WIDTH)
            AND TOTAL WIDTH.
