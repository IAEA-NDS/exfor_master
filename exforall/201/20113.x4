TITLE      -PROMPT NU-BAR VALUES OF U-235 AND PU-239 IN SOME
            FAST REACTOR SPECTRA-.
FACILITY   (REAC )    FAST ZERO-POWER REACTOR (FRO) AT STUDSVIK.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    MODERATOR MATERIALS (GRAPHITE AND POLY-
            ETHYLENE) AND A COPPER REFLECTOR.
INC-SPECT  A FAST-REACTOR SPECTRUM. THE ENERGY SPECTRUM IS
            GIVEN IN FIGURE 2 IN MAIN REFERENCE AND WERE CALCULATE
            FROM THE ZERO-DIMENSIONAL PROGRAM SPENG.
METHOD     (COINC)    COINCIDENCES BETWEEN FISSION FRAGMENTS AND
            PROMPT NEUTRONS.
           .THE NEUTRONS WERE EXTRACTED TROUGH A NARROW HOLE FROM
            THE CENTRE OF THE CORE REGION AND ENTERED A 13 METER
            LONG EVACUATED BEAM TUBE THROUGH ALUMINIUM WINDOWS.
            TWO COLLIMATORS OF BORATED PARAFFIN WERE PLACED INSIDE
            THE BEAM TUBE TO GIVE A WELL-DEFINED BEAM WHICH
            ENTERED THE FISSION CHAMBERS (U-235 AND PU-239).
            THESE WERE PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCINTILLATOR
            TANK.
DETECTOR   (STANK)  A LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TANK, 50 CM IN
            DIAMETER AND 50 CM IN LENGTH, CONTAINED ABOUT 100
            LITRES OF A GD-LOADED LIQUID (NE313).
COMMENT    .THE NU-BAR VALUES AVERAGED OVER THE FAST REACTOR
            NEUTRON SPECTRUM WERE CALCULATED WITH THE USE OF
            THE PROGRAM RELAT AND THE GROUP CONSTANTS OF THE
            DIFFERENT ENERGY DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE CALCULATED
            WITH THE PROGRAM GRUSP IN THE MULTI-GROUP STRUCTURE
            CHOSEN.
           .THE NU-BAR VALUE FOR THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252
            WAS USED AS AN INTERMEDIATE STANDARD, NO VALUE GIVEN.

COMMENT    .TO OBTAIN A REASONABLE COUNTING RATE, THE PU-239 RUNS
            WERE MADE WITH A HIGHER REACTOR EFFECT THAN THE U-235
            RUNS. THE FISSION COUNTING RATES IN THE PU-239 AND
            U-235 MEASUREMENTS WERE ABOUT 2.5 AND 10 FISSIONS PER

            SCINTILLATOR CAUSED BY THE REACTOR WAS CHECKED. NO
            TIME CORRELATION OF THE BACKGROUND PULSES COULD BE
