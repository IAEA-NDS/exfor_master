TITLE       Prompt nu-bar values of U-235 and Pu-239 in some
            fast reactor spectra
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDFOA) Fast zero-power reactor(FRO) at Studsvik
           The cylindrical reactor core consisting of uranium
                                          (20% enrichment)
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     The neutron beam from the interior or the
             critical assembly. Moderator materials (graphite and
             polyethylene), a copper reflector.
           .The neutrons were extracted through a narrow hole from
            the centre of the core region and entered a 13 meter
            long evacuated beam tube through aluminium windows.
            Two collimators of borated paraffin were placed inside
            the beam tube to give a well-defined beam which
            entered the fission chambers (U-235 and Pu-239).
            These were placed in the middle of the scintillator
            tank.
SAMPLE     .The fissionable materials were electrodeposited
            onto 3 thin concentric cylinders and housed in
            thin-walled (0.2 mm of aluminium) ionization chamber.
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidences between fission fragments and
                      prompt neutrons.

DETECTOR   (STANK)  A large liquid scintillator tank, 50 cm in

COMMENT    .The nu-bar values averaged over the fast reactor
            neutron spectrum were calculated with the use of
            the program RELAT and the group constants of the
            different energy dependent variables were calculated
            with the program GRUSP in the multi-group structure
            chosen.
CORRECTION .The observed nu values were integral values over the
            actual reactor neutron-energy spectrum.  The
            corrections to the observed integral values are,

           (92-U-235(N,F),PR,NU,,MXW))      Fast reactor spectrum
            averaged over energy interval nu-bar values relative
            to the nu-bar values at thermal energy.
INC-SPECT  A fast-reactor spectrum. The energy spectrum is
            given in fig. 2 in JNE,27,395,1973 and were calculated
            from the zero-dimensional program SPENG.
           The measurements were made with three different reactor
            cores giving median fission energies for 235U (core
            centre) of 50, 170 and 240 keV.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.933) The fission chamber contains
           520 mg of 92-U-235. Isotopic abundances 93.3% U-235
                                                and 6.7% U-238.
DETECTOR   (FISCH).A fission chamber similar to those for U-235
            and Pu-239 contains a Cf-252 source giving about
            50 spontaneous fissions per minute.
PART-DET   (FF,PN)    Fission fragments and prompt neutrons in
            coincidence.
COMMENT    .To obtain a reasonable counting rate, the Pu-239 runs
            were made with a higher reactor effect than the U-235
            runs. The fission counting rates in the Pu-239 and
            U-235 measurements were about 2.5 and 10 fissions per
            minute, respectively.
           .The time distribution of the background pulses in the
            scintillator caused by the reactor was checked. No
            time correlation of the background pulses could be
            observed.
