TITLE        Measurement of the relative differential cross-
             section of tritons emitted in the reaction
             Li-6(n,t)He-4 for neutron energies of 150, 200 and
             250 keV
FACILITY   (VDG,2BLGLIE)    Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (P-T)    Proton-tritium
INC-SPECT  .Incoming spectrum quasi uniform neutron
            spectrum between 100. and 275. keV, originating from
            a p-t reaction, were the protons had an energy of
            1314. keV and the sample was at an angle of 50. +-
            3 degrees.
SAMPLE      Li-6 targets were prepared by evaporation on polished
            zirconium backings. The thickness of the deposits was
            the order of the micron.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Nuclear emulsions. 16 plates of the type
            Ilford-l, 50 microns, 1 inch*1.5 inch.

            to 250 traces/cm**2 from tritons).
