FACILITY   (VDG  )    3 MEV DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR OF THE CBNM.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    LI-F TARGET, BURST WIDTH = 1 NANOSEC,
            REPETITION RATE = 1 MEGA-HZ.
INC-SPECT   36 - 40 KEV ENERGY SPREAD DEPENDING ON TARGET.
SAMPLE     .A SOLID CYLINDER OF 1.2 CM DIAMETER, 2.5 CM
            HEIGHT AND A WEIGHT OF 54.803 G,
           .ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IS
              PU239  98.91 PER-CENT, PU240  1.09 PER-CENT.
           .THE PU-SAMPLE WAS CANNED IN A ZIRCALLOY CONTAINER,
            AN IDENTICAL EMPTY CAN WAS USED TO SUBTRACT THE
            SCATTERING CONTRIBUTION COMING FROM THE CONTAINER.
METHOD     (TOF  )    FLIGHT PATH = 141.0 CM FROM SAMPLE.
           .TARGET-SAMPLE DISTANCE 10 CM, SCATTERED NEUTRONS
            MEASURED AT 10 DIFFERENT ANGLES BETWEEN 25 AND 147
            DEG.
