TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON TOTAL CROSS-SECTION
            OF PU-240.-
FACILITY   (LINAC)    60 MEV ELECTRON LINEAR ACCELERATOR OF CBNM.
INC-SOURCE .PHOTO ELECTRONS FROM A NATURAL URANIUM
            TARGET MODERATED BY A POLYETHYLENE SLAB.
INC-SPECT  .NOMINAL RESOLUTION,
            FROM   20 EV  TO  210 EV  6.  NANOSEC/M,
            FROM  210 EV  TO  310 EV  1.8 NANOSEC/M,
            FROM  310 EV  TO  800 EV  0.9 NANOSEC/M,
            FROM  800 EV  TO 5000 EV  0.9 NANOSEC/M,
SAMPLE     .METALLIC SAMPLE.
           .THREE DISCS OF DIAMETER 7.62+-0.013 CM AND TOTAL
            THICKNESS 0.675+-0.002 G/CM2.
           .PU ALLOYED WITH 1.15 WEIGHT PER-CENT
            ALUMINIUM.
           .ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IN PER-CENT,
            PU-238   0.004 +- 0.002,   PU-239   1.43  +- 0.02 ,
            PU-240  97.92  +- 0.04 ,   PU-241   0.52  +- 0.03 ,
            PU-242   0.12  +- 0.01.
METHOD     (TOF)      TIME OF FLIGHT, FLIGHT PATH = 100 M.
           .TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT.
DETECTOR   .SLAB OF B-10 POWDER (11*11*2 CM) VIEWED BY
            4 NA-I CRYSTALS (4 INCH DIAM. * 3 INCH) AND XP 1040
            PHOTOMULTIPLIERS, HEAVILY SHIELDED AGAINST NEUTRONS
            AND GAMMA S
PART-DET   (N)        NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)    GAMMA AND GAMMA(N)L=0 RESULTED FROM THE
            SHAPE ANALYSIS PROGRAMME OF ATTA AND HARVEY,
            ORNL-3205 (1961).
           .AS ONLY PREDOMINANT RESONANCES COULD BE ANALYSED THEY
            ARE SUPPOSED TO BE S-WAVE RESONANCES.
           .RESONANCES COULD BE ANALYSED UP TO 700 EV, ABOVE THIS
            ENERGY UP TO 5000 EV ONLY RESONANCE ENERGIES ARE GIVEN
CORRECTION .DUE TO B-10 OVERLAP FILTERS THE REACTION RATE DUE TO
            OVERLAP NEUTRONS WAS LESS THAN 1 PER-CENT.
           .RESONANCE PARAMETERS CORRECTED FOR DOPPLER AND
            RESOLUTION BROADENING.
           .THE DOPPLER CONSTANT HAS BEEN CALCULATED FOR AN
            EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE EQUAL TO ROOM TEMPERATURE.
ERR-ANALYS .GAMMA(N) ARE MORE RELIABLE THAN GAMMA BECAUSE THE
            DOPPLER AND RESOLUTION WIDTHS ARE GREATER THAN THE
            NATURAL WIDTHS.
           .THE ERRORS ARE BASED ON AN UNCERTAINTY OF 15 PER-CENT
            IN THE RESOLUTION FUNCTION DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN
            MODERATION TIME AND BURST WIDTH.
COMMENT    .THE TOTAL CROSS-SECTION HAS BEEN EVALUATED BETWEEN
            20 EV TO 800 EV, ABOVE 800 EV ONLY SAMPLE-IN
            MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED.
