INSTITUTE  (1USALRL)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,28,1934,1983)
DETECTOR   (SCIN).The flight path was 10.75 m for each detector
           and pulse shape discrimination was used to reduce the
           gamma-ray background.
FACILITY   (CYGFF,1USALRL)
METHOD     (TOF,PSD).Emitted neutrons were detected using the llnl
           time-of-flight (tof) facility.Where sixteen Ne-213
           scintillator detectors (11.4 cm diameter by 5.1 cm
           long) cover the angular region from 3 to 159 degree.
