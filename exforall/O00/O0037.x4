           300 GeV protons.

DETECTOR   (TRD).Makrofol polycarbonate detectors.
           Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside
           the makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a
            4pi geometry.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,N+3P)11-NA-24,,SIG,,,EXP).For proton flux.

ERR-ANALYS The errors in data-section are due to statistical and
           scanning errors-
            1.Uncertainties in the thickness of
           the target layers (5-10%).
            2.The errors in the integrated proton fluxes.

HISTORY    (19941025C)
           (20080304A) Entry was corrected according A.Konobeev
            remarks-incident energy was changed to GeV.
