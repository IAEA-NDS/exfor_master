FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USANAL)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors. Each detector
           consisted of two 200 mu-m thick Makrofol sheets in
           the form of a sandwich. Heavy reaction fragments were
           stopped inside the Makrofol sheets and could thus
           be detected in a 4Pi geometry.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG) For proton flux.
