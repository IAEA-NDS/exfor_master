TITLE      Excitation of isobaric analogue states in (p,n)
           reactions at 30 and 50 MeV and the isospin dependence
           of the optical model.

ADD-RES    (COMP).Microscopic model.Macroscopic model.
DETECTOR   (SCIN).The neutron detectors were 5 cm long by 11 cm
           diam. Cylinders of NE102 plastic scintillator viewed
           by XP1040 photomultipliers.
FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK NIN).The Rutherford Laboratory proton linear
           accelerator.
METHOD     (TOF)
ANALYSIS   (INTED).For analog state region.
ERR-ANALYS The errors on the cross section values were estimated
           by taking into account the errors on the individual
           points and the uncertainty in the background
           subtraction.
           (ERR-T).An absolute error in the cross section is 10%
            including the uncertainty in the measured efficiency
           (DATA-ERR) The errors on the cross-section values were
            estimated by taking into account the errors on the
            individual points and the uncertainty in the
            background subtraction.
CORRECTION Corrections were applied for:
            * the neutron detection efficiency,
            * the attenuation due to the air along the 10 m flight
           path and due to an aluminium plate used to prevent
           scattered protons being recorded in the detectors;
            * background.
