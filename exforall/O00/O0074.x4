ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY)
SAMPLE     Each target sample with natural abundance,ranging in
           thickness from 8 to 58 mg/cm**2,was guarded by adjacent
           identical foils in order to minimize scattering-in and
           scattering-out nuclides by incident protons.The samples
           with lighter mass nuclei were placed at the upstream
           end of the stack. The total thickness of each stack was
           approximately 0.5 mg/cm**2,therefore,the effects due to
           secondary particles produced in the target stack are
           expected to be negligible at 12 GeV.
