SAMPLE     Iron metal foil of 40 mg/cm**2 thickness was used.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total estimated uncertainties include
           the errors and uncertainties involved in counting,

            Higher uncertainties are estimated for results at

COMMENT    /By authors/ The V-46 cross sections may be considered
           as lower limits for cumulative cross sections,because
           up to 80-90% of the Cr-48 had decayed by the time of

DECAY-DATA (11-NA-24,15.HR,DG,2750.,1.)
SAMPLE     Magnesium metal foil of 22 mg/cm**2 thickness was used.
COMMENT    /By authors/ Cross sections based on total weight of
           magnesium as target weight.
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 2 in. x 2 in. NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal in
           conjunction with a 512-channel pulse-height analyzer.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total estimated uncertainties include
           the errors and uncertainties involved in counting,
           chemical yield determination,beam monitoring and
           saturation factor.
            Higher uncertainties are estimated for results at
            130 MeV, because of low beam current.
