DETECTOR   (GELI) The samples were assayed at Saclay with two
           unshielded Ge(Li) detectors for short-lived activities.
           About 12 hours after the end of the last irradiation,
           the samples were transferred to GSI, where measurement
           with eight shielded Ge(Li) detectors continued for
           several months.
