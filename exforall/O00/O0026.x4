TITLE      Study of the reaction Fe-56(p,n)Co-56 to the
            antianalog state

SAMPLE     The target was 6-mg/cm**2 natural iron.The Fe-54
           component of natural iron cannot produced neutrons
           with energies above those of the IAS group.The Fe-57
           and Fe-58 components can. Spectra taken with an Fe-57
           target indicated no sharp levels near the Co-56 AAS.
           The 0.33% Fe-58 component cannot produced a detectable
           neutron group except possibly for its IAS transition
           which would lie beside the Fe-56 IAS group.
DETECTOR   (SCIN).Two 2.54-cm*20-cm Ne-224 liquid scintillation
           detectors were placed side by side in a earthen-
           shielded bunker for these longer-flight-path
           measurements.The 9-m measurements utilized three
           similar detectors in concrete shields arranged so that
           data for three angles were obtained simultaneously.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACLU).The measurements were made with the
           University of Colorado rotating-beam neutron time-of-
           flight spectrometer.
COMMENT     New system employs neutron detectors at fixed,
           well-shielded positions and varies the angle of
           incidence of the beam upon the target to obtained an
           angular distribution.Initial data were obtained at 9 m
           flight path where Gaussian unfolding procedures were
           necessary to extract the area of the AAS peak at
            1.45 MeV from that of the neighboring 1.72 MeV level.
