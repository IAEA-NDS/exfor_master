SAMPLE     A thin Th target (50 mu-g ThF(4)/cm**2) was used.
           Al backing was irradiated together with Al monitor
                                                       foils
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Surface-barrier detector.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2ZZZCER) The experiments were carried out
           during 1970 and 1971 in the 600-MeV extracted proton
           beam of the CERN synchrocyclotron (ISOLDE-BEAM).
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,CHSEP)
ADD-RES    Alpha-particle spectrum.
