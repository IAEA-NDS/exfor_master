FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) At the research center for nuclear
            Physics, Osaka University.
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties of the peak sums were
           calculated with the use of the error matrix of the
           searched parameters in fitting.  Therefore, these
           uncertainties also contain the ambiguities of the peak
           shape.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SWPC,MWPC) At the focal plane of the spectro-
           graph, protons were detected by a counter array
           consisting of a two-dimensional position sensitive
           proportional counter of 1.5 m length, a pair of
           single wire proportional counters and a plastic
           scintillator.
