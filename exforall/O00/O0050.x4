SAMPLE     The target stacks consisted of 50 um thorium foil,
           sandwiched between two pairs of 50 um aluminium foils.
           The first pair served as recoil catchers and the
           second pair as guard foils. Several Al foils were added
           at different locations in the stack to serve as beam
           monitors.
