COMMENT    /By authors/ The alpha depletions of Tb-149-g have
           been compensated for.
           However, the respective alpha contributions to this
           nucleus and its precursors have not been excluded.
           Therefore, this is uncorrected yield of alpha
           contribution.
           /By compiler/ Authors believed that 4.1 hours activity
           is Tb-149m one. ENSDF-94 believe that this activity is
           Tb-149g one.
