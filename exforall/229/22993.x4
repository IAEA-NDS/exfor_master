PART-DET   (FF,P)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two sets of photovoltaic cells in a compact
            geometry placed at 5 mm on both sides of the Am-243
            targets. Each photovoltaic cell of rectangular shape
            20x40 mm  consists of a monocristalline silicon
            structure covered with a comb-like conducting grid
            -for fission fragments detection.
           The photovoltaic cells have no sensitivity to neutron
            beam and an intrinsic efficiency of 95(+-1)%. Fission
           detectors were placed in front of each Am target in a
           very compact geometry to obtain geometrical efficiency
           of about 70%.
           (TELES,SCIN) A polypropylene (PP) foil ((C3H6)n) placed
           at 45 mm from the 243Am targets and 80 mm from neutron
           source. This foil placed at 0 degree with respect to
           the incident-neutron beam served as a radiator to
           convert quasi-monoenergetic neutrons into protons.
           Recoiling protons emitted from the neutron-proton
           elastic scattering reaction occurring in the PP foil,
           were detected at 74.4 +- 0.2 mm downstream, by silicon
           telescope consisting of an energy-loss detector of
           55 microm positioned in front of a residual-energy
           detector of 700 microm. Several thicknesses (10 to
           50 microm) of the PP foil were used to keep the energy
           loss of the recoiling protons below 15% for all
           incident neutron energies.
           The ensemble PP-telescope formed neutron flux detector.
METHOD     (EDE) Protons recoiling from neutron scattering in
             the PP foil were detected by means of DE-E telescope
             located at 75 mm from the foil.

SAMPLE      Back-to-back deposits of two 243Am targets placed at
            39 mm from the neutron source and at 0 degree with
            respect to the incident neutron beam.
           Targets were prepared at the Lawrence Berkeley National
           Laboratory by electroplating onto a 0.6-mm-thick
           stainless steel backing with a deposit diameter of 6mm;
           the sample thicknesses were 546(+-2) microg/cm2 and
           564 (+-2) microg/cm2.
           (95-AM-243,ENR=0.9996) The isotopic purity of the Am
           targets was 99.96 (+-0.01)%.
           The target characteristics were measured by alpha
           spectrometry - revealed the presence of a very small

ANALYSIS   In principle, the neutron flux on the PP foil is
           obtained by integrating the spectrum of recoil protons
           combined with the n-p elastic cross section and the
           telescope efficiency using Monte Carlo simulations of
           neutrons and protons passing through the experimental
           setup, which takes into account the resolution of the
           charged particle beam, the energy loss of the charged
           particle beam in the deuterium or tritium targets, the
           angular distributions of the neutron beam,the angular
           distribution of the (n,p) elastic scattering cross
           sections, the proton energy loss in the PP foil, the
           energy resolution of the Si telescope. Then the neutron
           spectrum, the mean value of (n,p) elastic scattering
           cross section, the proton detector efficiency as
           function of neutron energy were deduced. (n,p) elastic
           scattering anisotropy was taken into account in the
           calculations of the proton detection efficiencies.
           Kinematic effects and the uncertainties on geometrical
           parameters were taken into account to define precisely
           the value and the uncertainty of fission efficiency.

            20x40 mm  consists of a monocristalline silicon
            structure covered with a comb-like conducting grid
            -for fission fragments detection.
           The photovoltaic cells have no sensitivity to neutron
            beam and an intrinsic efficiency of 95(+-1)%. Fission
           detectors were placed in front of each Am target in a
           very compact geometry to obtain geometrical efficiency
           of about 70%.
           (TELES,SCIN) A polypropylene (PP) foil ((C3H6)n) placed
           at 45 mm from the 243Am targets and 80 mm from neutron
           source. This foil placed at 0 degree with respect to
           the incident-neutron beam served as a radiator to
           convert quasi-monoenergetic neutrons into protons.
           Recoiling protons emitted from the neutron-proton
           elastic scattering reaction occurring in the PP foil,
           were detected at 74.4 +- 0.2 mm downstream, by silicon
           telescope consisting of an energy-loss detector of
           55 microm positioned in front of a residual-energy
           detector of 700 microm. Several thicknesses (10 to

           loss of the recoiling protons below 15% for all
           incident neutron energies.
           The ensemble PP-telescope formed neutron flux detector.
