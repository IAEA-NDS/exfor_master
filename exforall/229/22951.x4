TITLE      .Neutron-neutron final state interaction in the
            H-2(N,P)2N reaction at EN = 17.4-MeV.

SAMPLE     .The target consisted of a 10-mm long steel cylinder
           lined with graphite on the inside and had a diameter
           of 10-mm, which was closed at both ends with nominally
            75-mum-thick kapton foils and filled with deuterium
            gas at a pressure of 20.9-bar. Because of the bulging
            of the foils, their thickness was almost 30% smallest
            at the center and the effective target length was
            14.2-mm.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The neutron beam was produced via
            the H-2(d,N)He-3 reaction with 15-MeV deuterons
            incident on a 42-mm long gas target, which was closed
            with 10 mu-meter thick Havar foils.
INC-SPECT  .At a typical deuteron beam intensity of 500-Na, the
            high-energy neutron flux in the monoenergetic peak
            from the d(d,N)He-3 reaction was 2.9e+6/S/cm**2 at the
            scattering target with an average energy EN=17.36 MeV
            and an energy spread of 170 keV(FWHM)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)   A counter telescope consisting
             of three 150 mm2 Si-surface barrier detectors,
             two delta-E detectors of 220 and 506 mu-meter thick,
             respectively, and 1500 micro-meter thick E-detector.
             The last detector was calibrated from the back with
             alpha-particles from Am-241 source for monitoring
             of its performance during the measurements.
           (COIN,SIBAR,SIBAR) The three detectors were operated
             in a conventional fast-slow coincidence.
ADD-RES    (COMP) MONTE-CARLO simulations based on rigorous three
            body calculations using Cd-bonn and two other high-
            quality potentials for the nucleon-nucleon
            interaction.
