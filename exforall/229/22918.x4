ANALYSIS   .Bi-210-G production identified with the production of
            Po-210
COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross section for the Po-210
           production in the irradiation of a solid Bi-209 target
           in a pure thermal neutron flux has been measured by
           two distinct and direct experimental methods. The two
           methods give comparable results compatible with the
           older measurements, showing that experimental bias are
           small and in particular the evaporation of Po-210 from
           target. The new value measured in this work is by 25%
           smaller than the used data-library values for the Po-
           production.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) In both experiments, the two 1173.24 and 1332.50
            keV gamma-rays accompanying the decay Co-60 nucleus
            were collected with high purity Ge-detectors.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The sources of errors associated with the
                      activation method. The main terms are the
            error on the cross-section of the monitor and the
            errors associated with the determination of the
            activities, errors on the number of atoms in the
            samples and finally, the errors on the half-lives,
            the irradiation and cooling times. The latter errors
            are negligible in comparison to the previous ones.
           (ERR-1).The main error on the flux determination were
            due to the errors on the mass fraction of Co-59 in the
            Al-foil-2% and the measured activities 2%.

SAMPLE     .A very thin Bi-209 target of 1.1 micron in thickness
            obtained by the evaporation onf 1 milligram of pure
            Bi-209, isotopic purity 99.99%, with an uniformity of
            2%, on a thick 0.125-mm Ni-backing were used. A nickel
            ring with 0.125-mm thick and 8-mm in diameter was
            stacked on the deposit in order to collimate the
            alpha emission from the target and thus to define an
            exact emission surface and volume.
CORRECTION .A correction factor of 10+-10% was applied for the
            measured activities and corrected for the particle
            loss with a point-like emission solid angle fraction
            was given.                                   229180020

METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The 803.1 keV gamma-ray has been collected with
           a Ge-detector which has an intrinsic efficiency of 10%
           for the 1173-KeV gamma-ray and an energy resolution of
            2.5-KeV. The total efficiency of the detector has
            been calibrated with Eu-152 and Co-60 standard point-
            like sources placed in front of the Ge-detector at
            approximately 3-cm from the Ge-crystal.
SAMPLE     .A thick 146-mg wire of pure Bi-209 was enclosed in
            a 3 mm in diameter sealed quartz-capillary in order
            to avoid any mass loss of Po. The dimension of the
            wire was 1 mm diameter and 10 mm long which makes the
            gamma self-shielding negligible. The monitor sample
            is AL-0.1%Co alloy (7.58+-0.01) milligram encapsulated
            in an identical capillary
COMMENT    *By authors*. The result of the adjustments with this
           function on the Po-210 data given an activity of
