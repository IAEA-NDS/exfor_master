              analysis using the experimental-weighting function
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)   Geel linear accelerator 'GELINA'
INC-SOURCE  The neutron flux was generated by electron bursts of
             100-MeV average energy, 1-ns width, at a repetition
            rate of 800-Hz and average beam current of 75-muA,
            hitting a mercury-cooled rotary uranium target.
METHOD     (TOF)
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (SCIN).Gamma rays were detected by C(6)D(6)-based
            liquid scintillators.
           (GLASD)  For the total cross section measurement, the
            moderated neutrons, were detected by a 1/4-inch thick
            Li-glass (NE912).
           (BF3) three BF(3) proportional counters were used as
            neutron-flux monitors during the measuring time.
ANALYSIS   .The Maxwell averaged calculations were performed
             using new resonance parameters up to 5-keV.
           .Resonance parameters deduced from the measured total
            Krypton isotopes cross sections
INC-SPECT  .Maxwell energy distribution
MONITOR    (54-XE-131(N,0),,EN)  Resonances at 46.0, 75.6 and
                  114.9 eV were used
MONIT-REF  (,P.Ribon,R,CEA-N-1149,1969) Tech.Rep. N-1149, CEA,1969
SAMPLE      For the capture measurements were used 11.05-g of
             99.3% Kr-82 enriched gas, 17.35-g of 99.5% Kr-84
            enriched gas and 18.03-g of 99.9% Kr-86 enriched gas.
            In addition, three other samples were prepared, one
            filled with N(2) to be used as a dummy sample,
           in order to clearly identify all the structures due to
           the alloy of the container. Another one was filled with
           natural xenon and used for normalization purposes and
           a last one was filled with 25.87-g of natural krypton.
COMMENT    *By authors*.In order to improve the uncertainty on the
           normalization, was performed a dedicated total cross
           section measurement using a natural xenon sample.
           Subsequently the data have been normalized using three
           different resonances of Xe-131. The three obtained
           normalisation factors agreed within 1% and the averaged
           value was then adopted.
