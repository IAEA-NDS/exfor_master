           (J,NSE,107,272,1991)     Method of data analysis using
                              the experimental-weighting function
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL)   Geel linear accelerator 'GELINA'
INC-SOURCE  The neutron flux was generated by electron bursts of
             100-MeV average energy, 1-ns width, at a repetition
            rate of 800-Hz and average beam current of 75-mua,
            hitting a mercury-cooled rotary uranium target.
METHOD     (TOF)
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (SCIN).Gamma rays were detected by C(6)D(6)-based
            liquid scintillators.
           (GLASD)  For the total cross section measurement, the
            moderated neutrons, were detected by a 1/4-inch thick
            Li-glass (NE912).
           (BF3) three BF(3) proportional counters were used as
            neutron-flux monitors during the measuring time.
ANALYSIS   .The Maxwell averaged calculations were performed
             using new resonance parameters up to 5-KeV.
           .Resonance parameters deduced from the measured total
            Krypton isotopes cross sections
INC-SPECT  .Maxwell energy distribution
MONITOR    (54-XE-131(N,0),,EN)  Resonances at 46.0, 75.6 and
                  114.9 eV were used
MONIT-REF  (,P.RIBON,R,CEA-N-1149,1969) Tech.Rep. N-1149, CEA,1969
SAMPLE      For the capture measurements were used 11.05-g of
             99.3% Kr-82 enriched gas, 17.35-g of 99.5% Kr-84
            enriched gas and 18.03-g of 99.9% Kr-86 enriched gas.
            In addition, three other samples were prepared, one
            filled with N(2) to be used as a dummy sample,
           in order to clearly identify all the structures due to
           the alloy of the container. Another one was filled with
           natural xenon and used for normalization purposes and
           a last one was filled with 25.87-g of natural krypton.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.
           The uncertainty reported in table represent quadratic
           sum of the contributions from the statistical errors
           on both the resonance parameters and the average cross
           section as well as a 2% relative error due to the
           uncertainties in the normalization. Also included is an
           error in the energy dependence of the neutron flux
           ranging from 0 at 1-KeV to 6% at 400-KeV with log-e
           interpolation, an estimated 10% error on the average
           capture cross section due to uncertainty in the back-
           ground subtraction and a conservative 5% error on the
           weightingprocedure. The quoted uncertainties for Kr-80
           and Kr-83 represent only the statistical ones.
COMMENT    *By authors*.In order to improve the uncertainty on the
           normalization, was performed a dedicated total cross
           section measurement using a natural xenon sample.
           Subsequently the data have been normalized using three
           different resonances of Xe-131. The three obtained
           normalisation factors agreed within 1% and the averaged
           value was then adopted.
