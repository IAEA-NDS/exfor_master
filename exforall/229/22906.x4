FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) Spectrometer GELINA.
INC-SOURCE  A Cd-filter was used to eliminate the neutrons of
           previous bursts.
SAMPLE     .Two discs of metallic rhodium with thickness of
            3.37*10E-04 at/B and 1.87*10E-03 at/B, were used.
METHOD     (TOF)
            Capture experiments, the flight path was 14.5 m.
            Transmission experiments, the flight path was 50 m.
MONITOR    (45-RH-103(N,0),,EN)  The data have been normalized
               to the well-isolated and saturated Rh-103
               resonance at 1.26-eV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) For the capture measurements-two C(6)d(6)
             liquid scintillators NE230 of 10.0-cm diameter
             and 7.5 cm height, placed at 90-degree with respect
             to the direction of the neutron beam.
           (IOCH) The shape of the neutron spectrum was measured
             with a double frisch-gridded ionization chamber.
             with two back-to-back layers of 43.5 microgram/cm2
             Boron-10 each
           (GLASD) For the transmission measurements -
             The neutrons were detected by 6-mm-thick NE912
             Li-6 glass scintillator.
           (BF3). Two BF3   proportional counters were used to
             monitor the stability of the accelerator and to
             normalise the spectra to the total neutron intensity.
CORRECTION .Corrections for self-shielding in the ionization
            chamber, and for the difference in neutron flux at the
            target positions, and for the ionization chamber were
            carried out. Maximum dead-time correction for the
            capture measurements are 10%.
HISTORY    (20051021C)
           (20051112A) Last corrections have been done.

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)   The resonance parameters for Rh-103 were
            obtained from a simultaneous shape analysis of the
            capture and transmission data using the REFIT-code.
            .The resonance energy and neutron width for each
             resonance were determined in the  simultaneous fit,
             as well as an average radiation width average
             =161.0+-0.2 milli-eV for all resonances,
             independent of the resonance spin.
