FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) Spectrometer GELINA.
INC-SOURCE  A Cd-filter was used to eliminate the neutrons of
           previous bursts.
SAMPLE      Two discs of metallic rhodium with thickness of
            3.37E-04 at/b and 1.87E-03 at/b - for transmission.
            1.87E-03 at/b thick metallic Rh-103 disc -for capture.
METHOD     (TOF)
            Capture experiments, the flight path was 14.5 m.
            Fixed Bi and Na 'black' resonance filters were used to
            reduce gamma background from source and background
            could be monitored using 'black' resonance minima at
            802. eV and 2.85 keV.
           (TRN) Transmission experiments, flight path was 50 m.
            Background was measured at 'black' resonances of
            permanent filters of Cd, Au, Co and Na placed in
            neutron beam.Signal to background ratio 85:1 at 4.9eV,
            115:1 at 130 eV, 30:1 at 2.85 keV.
MONITOR    (45-RH-103(N,0),,EN)  The data have been normalized
               to the well-isolated and saturated Rh-103
               resonance at 1.26-eV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) For the capture measurements-two C(6)D(6)
             liquid scintillators NE230 of 10.0-cm diameter
             and 7.5 cm height, placed at 90-degree with respect
             to the direction of the neutron beam;
           (IOCH) The shape of the neutron spectrum was measured
             with a double Frisch-gridded ionization chamber
             with two back-to-back layers of 43.5 microgram/cm**2
             Boron-10 each.
           (GLASD) For the transmission measurements -
             The neutrons were detected by 6-mm-thick NE912
             Li-6 glass scintillator;
           (BF3)  Two BF3   proportional counters were used to
             monitor the stability of the accelerator and to
             normalize the spectra to the total neutron intensity.
CORRECTION  Corrections for self-shielding in the ionization
            chamber, and for the difference in neutron flux at the
            target positions, and for the ionization chamber were
            carried out. Maximum dead-time correction for the
            capture measurements are 10%. Correction to dead time
           less 1.25% below 2.85 keV for transmission measurement.
            Correction for background.
HISTORY    (20051021C)
           (20051112A) Last corrections have been done.

            corrected MEV into MILLI-EV.BIB information was added.

REACTION  1(45-RH-103(N,0),,EN)
          2(45-RH-103(N,EL),,WID)  S-wave resonance parameters.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)   The resonance parameters for Rh-103 were
            obtained from a simultaneous shape analysis of the
            capture (from 300 eV to 10millieV) and transmission
            (from 300 eV to 0.5 eV) data using the REFIT-code.
             The resonance energy and neutron width for each
             resonance were determined in the  simultaneous fit,
             as well as an average radiation width average
             =161.0+-0.2 milli-eV for all resonances,
             independent of the resonance spin.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified .The uncertainty as reported
                      by authors in table.
COMMENT    Of Authors. Poor value of negative energy resonance are
           due to fact, that the resonance at 1.26 eV dominates
           the cross section below about 1 eV.
