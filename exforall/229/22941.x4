             Institute in Grenoble, MINI-INCA (incineration of
             actinides) set-up.
INC-SPECT   Three irradiation channels could be used .
           -The T4 channel provide pure thermal neutrons with
            an intensity of the order of 2. x 10**13 n/cm2/s .
           -The V4 channel can provide different irradiation
            positions with different neutron flux/energy spectra-
            the thermal neutron proportion varies from 100% to 85%
            and intensities range from 6. x 10**13 n/cm2/s to
            1.5 x 10**15 n/cm2/s.
           -The H9 channel has a neutron flux close to the one
            available in an intermediate position of the V4 one.
            MCNP code was used to calculate neutron flux
            distributions at different irradiation positions -
            see Fig.2 of C,2007NICE.

INC-SOURCE (REAC)
METHOD     (GSPEC)  Gamma- and alpha-spectroscopy bench allows
           (ASPEC) fast characterization of irradiated samples and
             direct access to short-lived isotopes.
           (MASSP)  Precise mass spectrometry (Thermal Ionization
           and Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry)
           analysis can be performed after irradiation in V4.
ANALYSIS    Reaction chain analysis with the help of ROOT MERCS
            analysis code. MERCS was used for fit of nuclear
           parameters on exp. data and to optimize irradiation
           conditions -suitable neutron flux and irradiation time.
           In mass spectrometry analysis the free parameters were:
           Am-241, Am-242m, Cm-242m capture c-s and Am-241
           isomeric branching ration.
           In fission chamber analysis the previously measured
           Am-241 capture and branching ratio were used as input
           parameters - to obtain Am-242 fission c-s.
PART-DET   (A,G,FF)
DETECTOR   (SPEC,SI,HPGE) Lohengrin mass spectrometer,equipped
            with Si- and Ge-detectors (at H9 channel).
            The Si and Ge-detector electronic system is able to
            record in high counting rates up to 80-kHz for Ge-
            detector and up to 20-kHz for Si-detector.
           (FISCH) At V4 channel.Microscopic fission chambers  -
           Triple-Deposit Fission-Chambers (TDFC). Operates
           in current mode to measure on-line the actinide fission
           current with respect to known U-235 fission current.
            Each fis.chamber 2 cm long,8 mm diameter,filled with
            pure argon gas.

            were irradiated for 11 and 24-days in the T4 channel,
            whereas four other sets were irradiated in the
            H9-channel for 1, 5, 11 and 19-days.Cooling time 1 yr.
ANALYSIS   .The obtained values result from the  average over T4
            and H9 channel measurements after correction from
            experimental values.
