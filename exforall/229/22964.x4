METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)   Resolution 1.80 keV at 1332.5 keV g-energy of
               Co-60 and 0.97 keV for 122 keV of Co-57. Relative
               efficiency is 22.6%. Resolution of detector was
               determined using standard radionuclides of Cd-109,
               Co-57, Cr-51, Te-123m, Sn-113, Sr-85, Cs-137,
               Co-60 and Y-88
INC-SOURCE (AM-BE) Three 592 GBq 241Am-Be isotopic neutron source
               immersed in paraffin moderator shielded with lead
INC-SPECT   Alpha-beryllium source was immersed in paraffin.
            Thermal neutron flux was (1.5+-0.2)E+4 and
            epithermal neutron flux was (1.4+-0.1)E+3 n/cm2/sec.
            Each irradiations were performed with and without
            cadmium shield

             the excited Eu-153 obtained via B- decay of Sm-153
SAMPLE      Manganese Mn-O2 and Samarium Sm2-O3 oxide powders were
            diluted with the finely grained Al2-O3 powder by
            99.0 - 96.6%. Each sample was filled in polystyrene
            cylindrical tube (height/diam = aprx 2, walls 1 mm
            thick, internal diameter 5.0 mm) and irradiated with
            and without cylindrical cadmium shield case
