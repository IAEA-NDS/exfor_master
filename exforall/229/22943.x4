            were provided from 3.2 MV Pelletron Accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 Reaction.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Repeating three runs on H2O, Au and blank
                   samples cyclically.
           (TOF) Incident neutron energy spectrum was measured
                 by Time-of-flight technuque.

            set 34 cm away from Li-7 target at angle 14 (10-80keV)
            and 9.6 (531 keV) degree with respect  to proton beam
            direction.

SAMPLE     .H2 O enriched in H2 to 99.99%, of 90 mm diameter,
            20 mm thickness, contained in acrylic conteiner of
            internal diameter 90 mm and thickness 0.5 mm.
           .Au sample of 90 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness.
PART-DET   (G) Prompt gamma-ray from capture in H-3 ground state.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Gamma-ray peak intensities in net spectrum were
            analyzed by stripping method, using the responce
            function of NaI(Tl) spectrometers.
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for multiple scattering and
            shielding of incident neutrons in sample, for gamma-
            ray absorbtion by sample, for finite size of sample.
             Correction factors are presented in MISC-COL.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Correction factor for multiple scattering
                    in Au sample.
           (MISC2) Correction factor for multiple scattering
                    in H2O sample.
           (MISC3) Correction factor for shielding in Au sample.
           (MISC4) Correction factor for shielding in H2O sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty is the result of combined
                   uncertaities:
           (ERR-1) Gamma-ray yield statistics (2-8%), maximal,
           (ERR-2) Response function of NaI(Tl) spectrometer,
           (ERR-3) Absolute cross section of Au,
           (ERR-4) Correction factor.
ADD-RES    (COMP)  Comparison exp.results with calculated ones.
           (RRATE) Reaction rate was obtained with uncertainty
                 about 8% via formula as dependence of temperature
                 and Avogadro's number.
