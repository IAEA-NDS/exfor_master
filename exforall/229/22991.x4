            distances 5.45m and 9.79m from Li target and beam
            current 5.microA. Average ratio of peak fluence

ANALYSIS    Photon rate was determined from integral count rate in
            full-energy peak.The shape of c-s was approximated by
            Gaussian distribution which is continuously matched to
            exponential distribution on high-energy side.Prior
            information for parametrisation was taken from TALYS
            code results.
CORRECTION  Photon rate was corrected for ambient background,
            detection efficiency, dead-time losses.
            To determine the correction factor for the effect of
            continuum neutrons, a deconvolution procedure has to
            be used.
            For En= 29.0, 33.5, 35.2, 38.0, 42.0 MeV correction
            factor for influence of the continuum neutrons :
