          2(TOF) Relative spectral fluence was measured by BC501
            detector and TOF method at beam currents 20-50 nA.
            Normalization of relative spectral fluence was

            distances 5.45m and 9.79m from Li target and beam
            current 5.microA. Average ratio of peak fluence

ANALYSIS    Photon rate was determined from integral count rate in
            full-energy peak.The shape of c-s was approximated by
            Gaussian distribution which is continuously matched to
            exponential distribution on high-energy side.Prior
            information for parametrisation was taken from TALYS
            code results.
CORRECTION  Photon rate was corrected for ambient background,
            detection efficiency, dead-time losses.
            To determine the correction factor for the effect of
            continuum neutrons, a deconvolution procedure has to
            be used.
            For En= 29.0, 33.5, 35.2, 38.0, 42.0 MeV correction
            factor for influence of the continuum neutrons :
