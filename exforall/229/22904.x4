METHOD     (TOF)
           (EDE) For identifiing light charged particles
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,CSICR)  MEDLEY set-up
            the light charged particles, produced in the reaction
            target, were detected by means of eight three-detector
            telescopes, each composed of two silicon detectors and
            a CsI(Tl)-crystal. The silicon detectors are thin for
            the delta-E1 detectors of 50-60 micro-meters and more
            thick for the delta-E2 400-500 micro-meters.
           .The material of E-detectors is CsI(Tl) scintillator
            crystal, 5.0 cm long, consisting of a cylindrical and
            a conical part.
           .An Am-241 alpha-source, introduced in the center of
            the MEDLEY chamber, was used to obtain data for the
            energy calibration of the delta-E detectors.
