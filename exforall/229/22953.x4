FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2 MV PELLETRON accelerator of the
            Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction. ......   energy is in
            the range 10 - 80 keV. Metallic layers of natural Li,
            evaporated onto copper disk,   thickness 0.4 mm
            cooled by water. Average beam current of 5 microA
            at repetition rate 2 MHz.
INC-SPECT   Low-energy neutrons
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Four 6-Li Glass Detectors of 50 mm diameter and
           10 mm thickness.Energy resolution 20%, defined by
           measured energy pectrum of scattered neutron by gold
           sample.Time resolution 1.5 nsec (FWHM) obtained from
           TOF spectrum using gamma-ray from LI-7(p,g)Be-8
           reaction.Detectors were surrounded by neutron shield
           composed of boron-doped polyethylene blocks with
           tapered collimator.Detector was set at 90deg. to
           proton beam direction.
           Li-6-glass detector of 5mm diameter and 5mm thickness
            for monitoring of incident neutron energy spectrum.
            Placed at 0deg. to proton beam direction,30cm downward
            from neutron production target.
SAMPLE      Os-186 metallic powder of 0.34g weight and 99.55%
            enrichment in Os-186. Gold sample of 0.19 g weight.
            Sample was placed 2cm downward from Li-7 neutron
            production target. Os,Au,C samples were wrapped by
            aramid sheet of 4 microm thickness.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron production target - sample distance =2cm.
            25/20 cm distance from sample to detectors.
            TOF spectrums were measured 1)without sample,
            2) with and without adding 0.4mm thick copper disk on
            existing copper backing (0.4mm),
            3) for water and air cooling for copper backing.
           (SITA) Measurement was carried out cyclically by
             changing four samples of Os-186, Au, C and blank
             position.
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) Constant background subtracted from TOF
             spectrum for Os,C and blank samples were obtained.
             TOF spectrum for blank sample was subtracted from
             that for Os and C to obtain net TOF spectrum, which
             was used to define neutron energy spectrum for
             osmium and carbon.
