METHOD     (EXTB)Irradiation time - 8.8 days.Average currents of
            primary protons were 5.38 microA for the former and
            6.45 microA for the latter irradiation.
            Fluctuation of proton current was monitored to correct
            the beam fluctuation during irradiation.
           (RCHEM) After irradiation of targets the Be-7
            was separated from target materials and spallation
            products.Chemical recovery of Be-7 was determined
            by atomic absorption spectrometry.Typical chemical
            yield was near 70%.
           (GSPEC) After RCHEM the gamma-ray spectrometry was
            performed for Be-7.
           (MASSP)  Accelerator mass spectrometry for Be-10
                 carried out after gamma-ray counting for Be-7.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity Ge detectors,coupled with
            4 K-channel pulse height analyser.
            Detector efficiency was calibrated by standard source
            containing Cd-109,Co-57,Ce-139,Hg-203,Sn-113,Sr-85,
            Cs-137,Y-88,Co-60.
           (IOCH) Gas ionization chamber for deltaE-E detection
            of Be-10.
            BT97 standard,obtained by diluting calibrated ICN
            standard with non-radioactive beryllium reagent, was
            used for Be-10 AMS. ICN standard was calibrated by
            beta-activity of Be-10.Ratio of number of Be-10 to
            Be-9 in BT97 standard 3.432E-11 was calculated using
            Be-10 half life 1.500E+6 year.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Primary 500-MeV protons bombarded on 4 tungsten
                  blocks (of total thickness 11.68 cm) in target
            assembly. Generated secondary neutrons passed through
            10-cm stainless-steel block, collimated into 20x15
            cm**2 beam by iron beam guide.
INC-SPECT  .Broad neutron spectrum wasa calculated by MARS14
            Monte-Carlo code. Neutron spectrum shape is almost
            flat from 10 to 470 MeV neutron energy. Experimental
            confirmation of spectrum shape was performed by Al,
            In, Au, Bi activation detectors and was reported
            previously in references 2, 3. EN-MAX is the maximum
            end-point energy of neutron spectrum.

SAMPLE     .Each sample was wrapped with a guard foil of  same
            material to compensate for recoil losses and gains
            of Be-7 and Be-10. Samples were individually sealed
            in polyethylene bags.
