COMMENT    From the article: In this work only neutron widths up
           to a neutron energy of 80 keV were obtained. For the
           additional resonances, which were observed only in our
           capture data, not enough information is available to
           assign a spin and parity. Therefore, our data do not
           provide sufficient information to improve existing
           neutron strength functions and level densities. A
           detailed  discussion on these parameters is given by
           Horen et al. (see REL-REF)

INC-SPECT  .White initial neutron source, beam diameter 75 mm at
            58.576 m from the neutron source.
           .For CAPTURE: 10B overlap filter (0.0416 at/b 10B),
            kept permanently in the neutron beam;
           .For TRANSMISSION: 10B overlap filter (0.0129 at/b),
            115.2 mm thick natural S black filter resonance
            filter kept permanently in the neutr on beam;
            The S filter provided the background at 102.71 keV.
            Other background points were determined with the Na,
            Bi and Co black filters at 2.85 keV, 800 eV and
            132 eV respectively.
           -The background was deduced from a fit of the
            background points with a function like
                      BKG=a+b*TOF**c
            with a, b and c free parameters and TOF the neutron
            time-of-flight
           -The total energy detection principle in combination
            with the pulse height weighting technique was applied.
            The weighting function was obtained by Monte Carlo
            simulations validated by experiment, see REF 2.

            The transmission factor is obtained from dead time

CORRECTION . CAPTURE
            Corrections were made for:
           * Dead time
           * Background
              flux: based on S, Na, Bi, Co, black resonances
              capture: fitted in the region between well separated
              resonances.
           . TRANSMISSION
            Corrections were made for:
           * Dead time
           * Background based on S, Na, Bi, Co black resonances
             (see INC-SPECT))
           .Allows correction for time dependent background, for
            sensitivity to prompt neutrons scattered by the sample
            (neutron sensitivity),for Doppler and resolution broa-
            dening, for multiple scattering and self-shielding.
ERR-ANALYS .ERR-T. Total uncertainties were deduced by propagating
                 correlated and uncorrelated partial uncertainties
            using AGS. Details in Subents 002 - 007.
            Partial uncertainties considered were due to:
            * counting statistics
            * background correction
             Systematic uncertainties estimated to be within 2.5%

ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)  Data analysis performed with the AGS package
                   (C. Bastian). The capture yield is obtained
            from dead time and background corrected response of
            SCIN and IOCH. A sample dependend weigthing function
            is applied. Resonance shape analysis carried out
            with the code REFIT from capture data only
           .For new resonance only the resonance area K is given.
            Above 80 keV the neutron width was taken from Horen
            (see REL-REF, san 001) and the radiation width has
            been fitted. The external levels of PB-206 from
             ENDF/B-VI.8 have been used.

            is applied. Resonance shape analysis carried out
            with the code REFIT from capture and transmiss.data
           .The neutron and radiation width were deduced with
            simultaneous fit of both the capture and transmission
            data up 80 keV neutron energy. The spin assignment
            (g and J) and angular momentum (L) were taken from
            ENDF/B-VI. The g factor was verified by fitting of
            of the thick and thin sample transmission factors.
           .For new resonance only the resonance area K is given.
