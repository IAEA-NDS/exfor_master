SAMPLE      BE-O powder pellets, Be-10/Be-9isotope ratios are
            given on Figs.1 before and after irradiation for two
            samples.
ANALYSIS   Combining the background-corrected isotope ratios of
           the two samples with their corresponding neutron
           fluence, results in a cross-section value (averaged
           for 25 keV) of (9.2+-0.5) and (9.8+-0.8) microbarn,
           respectively.

                  11 microbarn

SAMPLE     C-13-enriched material,amorphous graphite powder,
           stable isotope ratios C-14/C-13 = (9.5+-0.5)*10**-15
           for unirradiated graphite. The irradiated material was
           directly pressed into sputter sample holders. Most of
           the samples showed C-13/C-12 values around 70;
           contamination with natural carbon would directly be
           reflected in a lower C-13/C-12 value.
ADD-RES    Additional measurements at higher neutron energies are
           in progress.
