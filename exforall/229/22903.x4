INC-SOURCE1(P-LI7) At the LLN facilitya 5-mm thick natural lithium
             target, (92.5% of 7Li and 7.5% of 6Li) was bombarded
             by protons with beam current of about 10 mA.
          2(P-LI7)  In the TSL experiments, 4-15mm thick lithium
                    targets (enriched to 99.98% in 7Li) were
            exposed to proton bombardment with a beam current
            from 1 to 10 mA.
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons with peak energies of
            32.8, 45.3 and 59.9-MeV were produced by the 7Li(P,N)
            reaction. The detector was so positioned that the
            reference target was at a distance of 10.2 m from the
            neutron production target. At this position the beam
            diameter FWHM was about 10 cm with an average fluence
            rate of peak neutrons. The present measurements were
            performed with the following neutron peak energies:
            32.8, 45.4, 59.9MeV at LLN, and 34.7, 46.3, 65.4,
            96.0, 133.6 and 173.9 MeV at TSL.
METHOD     (TOF,PHD)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Fission fragments were detected with a multi-
            section frisch-gridded ionization chamber-mfgic.
            The MFGIC is a stack of seven twin ionization chambers
            with Frisch grids. It is housed in a thin-walled
            cylindrical detector shell of 200 mm diameter and 520
            mm length. The anode and cathode are 50 mum thick
            duralumin foils sandwiched between two rings with
            inner and outer diameters of 140 and 170 mm, resp.
            The gas mixture is composed of 90% argon and 10%
            methane. The detector was located with sub-actinide
            targets under study plus a natural uranium target as a
            reference target.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments were detected.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            Neutron fluence measurements were based on the
            U-238(N,F) standard.
SAMPLE     .Sub-actinide targets plus a natural uranium target,
            deposited in the form of uf(4) as a reference target.
            The fissile materials were deposited, by thermal
            vacuum evaporation, on each side of cathode foils
            stretched between the supporting rings. The diameter
            of each target was 80-mm. The total fissile mass of
            the reference target was measured by alpha-counting,
            while the masses of the sub-actinide targets, pure
            metals, were determined by weighting. The total masses
            of fissile deposits for the backward/forward target
            faces are indicated.
CORRECTION .Correction for the isotopic composition of the
            target, correction for the target position along the
            neutron beam axis was made.
            The efficiency of the fission fragment detection was
            obtained as the product of two correction factors
            allowing for fission fragment absorption in the target
            and the loss of events due to pulse-height threshold.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).For all targets, the uncertainty in the mass
            was not larger than 2%.
           (ERR-S) The cross section uncertainties are one
            standard deviation.
