FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR CSN) IPN Orsay Tandem facility
INC-SOURCE .He-3 beam of 24 MeV bombarding energy and current of
            20 particle nA.
SAMPLE     .150 microgram/cm**2 of Thorium Th-232 deposited on
            40 microgram/cm**2 carbon backing, prepared at CSNSM
            Orsay mass separator.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (COINC)
PART-DET   (LCP,G)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Four E-deltaE telescopes, each made of
            two fully depleted silicon detectors of 300 and 5000
            micrometer thickness. Energy Resolution for 20 MeV
            protons about 70 keV.
           (COIN,SCIN,GE) Four C6D6 scintillators and two hight
             energy resolution germanium detectors. Other four
             scintillators arranged to detect gamma coincidences
             with LCP in telescopes and also for gamma-decay of
             Pa-234 excited state.
ANALYSIS   . N,GAMMA capture cross section of Pa-233 in neutron
            energy from 0 to 1 MeV was deduced via the product
            of measured gamma emission probability Pgam of
            excited Pa-234 which was measured between 5.2 and 6.2
            MeV excitation energy using transfer reaction
            Th-232(He-3,p)Pa-234exc, see table under this keyword,
            Table 2 of main reference.
            It is assumed that population of states in Pa-234exc
            is the same for both Th-232(He-3,p) and Pa-233(n,g)
            reactions. MCNP 4C2 transport code was used for this
            process simulations.
