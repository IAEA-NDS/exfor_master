DETECTOR   (HPGE) A single hpge-detector with a fixed measuring
            position 76-mm in front of the detector was used for
            counting the activity of the gold foils. The detector
            was shielded by 10-cm of lead and 5-mm of copper.
           (TELES,HPGE,HPGE)  The lower activities of the hafnium
            samples were measured with a gamma-detection system
            consisting of two HPGE Clover detector, each Clover
            detector consists of four independent HPGE N-type
            crystal in a common cryostat. The total crystal
            volume of the detector system is about 1000 cm-cube.
            The two Clover  detectors are placed face to face
            in a close geometry and from nearly a 4-pi array
            by touching the 5.2 mm thick sample holder.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  30 micro-m thick layers of metallic Li or
                     Li-F on a water-cooled Cu-backing.
           .Proton beam energy adjusted so to be 30 keV above
            the Li-7(P,N)Be-7 reaction threshold.
SAMPLE     .For the Hf-174 activations, thin samples Hf-3 to Hf-5
            of natural isotopic abundance (see table below) were
            cut from metal foils of whereas the Hf-182 activations
            were carried out with samples Hf-1 and Hf-2, which
            were prepared from the original Helmer-2 sample prepa-
            red by neutron irradiation (see REL-REF).

COMMENT    *By authors*.The samples were activated in a series of
            irradiations.
ADD-RES    (THEO)
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for extended sample geometry,
            for neutron self-absorption. The correction for the
            surviving fraction of the preceding activation was
            made only for the calculation of the Hf-181 activity.
STATUS      .Data are taken from tables  of  reference
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT1-ERR).The monitor uncertainty
           (ERR-1).The error in absorption effects is 2%.
           (ERR-2).The error in gamma-efficiency is 2%.
           (ERR-3).The error in integrated neutron flux is 2%.
           (ERR-4) Error in decay intensity for Au-198 is 0.1%.

CORRECTION  Maxwellian average cross section have to be corrected
            by a temperature-dependent stellar enhancement factor.
            At thermal energy of 30-KeV this correction are

ANALYSIS    The values were calculated with the normalized non-
            smoker data ( using jeff-3.0/a for Hf-182 gives very
            similar values).

            by a temperature-dependent stellar enhancement factor.
            At thermal energy of 30-KeV this correction are
