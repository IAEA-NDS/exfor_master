           .The half-life was determined as an average of four
            values to be 15.5 +- 0.1 sec.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for sum-coincidence loss,
            pile-up and self-absorption.
ADD-RES    (DECAY)   Decay constants are obtained in this work

REACTION   (43-TC-99(N,G)43-TC-100,,SIG)
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNYOK) THE TRIGA MARK II reactor at Rikkyo
                          University.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  .Neutron spectrum is similar to maxwellian. Thermal
            neutron flux at the irradiation position is 5.0E+11
            n/cm2/s and an epithermal index in the Westcott con-
            vention is 0.033.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 2 min. irradiations were per-
            formed with and without cadmium shielding, cooling
            time from end of irradiation to start of activity
            measurement was typically 40 min.
           (SITA)  Samples and monitor irradiated separately
ANALYSIS   .Data obtained by Ru-100 excited states activity
            measurement for gamma-rays 540 and 590 keV using
            their abundances detrmined in the SUBENR 22933002
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  The activities were measured with a HPGE detec-
            tor, having a relative efficiency of 90 percent and a
            resolution of 2.1 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV. The distance
            from the centre of the sample to the front end of the
            detector was 100 mm.

SAMPLE     .Four samples of Tc-99 were of ammonium pertechnetate.
            The specific activity was aprx 390 kBq. Number of
            Tc-99 atom were determined by B- counting.
