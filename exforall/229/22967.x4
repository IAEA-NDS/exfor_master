FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNKTO)   Reactor KURRI of Kyoto university
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Irradiation of the target was performed in a
             hydraulic conveyor tube at the Kyoto University
             reactor KUR for 10 hours
SAMPLE      A standardized Am-243 solution, equivalent to 3.7E+4
            Bq was dropped into a high-purity quartz tube. After
            drying up of the solution, the quartz tube was sealed
            under evacuation. The monitor wires Co/AL (0.46+-
            0.01 wt%,1.6939+-0.0002 mg weight) and Au/AL (0.112+-
            0.001 wt%,0.4967+-0.0002 mg weight) and Am243 tube
            were wrapped with a thin high-purity aluminium foil,
            and housed in an inner Al capsule which was in turn
            housed in an outer irradiation capsule

ANALYSIS   .Gamma-rays from Cobalt monitor was measured after 16
            days from the irradiation
           (DECAY) .Irradiated Am-243 sample was cooled for one
                  month after irradiation in order that Am-244-m
                  and Am-244-g were decayed into Cm-244, then
                  dissolved with 3M H-N-O3. Reaction rate was
                  measured from Cm-244 alpha activity
CORRECTION .Cm-244 nuclei number corrected for the decrease
            during the cooling
