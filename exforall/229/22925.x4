            255 alpha-alpha and 37 alpha-triton coincidences.
            In the decay of Be-8 from g.s. of half-life 0.07 fs,
            Q-value=0.092 MeV lead to narrow angular correlation
            between the two alpha's. Simulating the kinematics has
            yielded maximum opening angle 8deg at average kinetic
            energy of Be-8. Since the smallest angle for detection
           of an alpha pair in neighboring  detectors is 16deg, so
           in the Cf experiment only the decay from excited states
           of Be-8 can contribute to the observed enhancement at
           angles <60deg. Thus, the measured pseudo alpha-alpha QF
           has to be attributed to the sequential decay of short-
           lived 2+ first excited state in Be-8 at E*=3.04 MeV
            (T1/2=3.E-22 s; Q=3.13 MeV). Simulation calculations
           have yielded a significantly broader distribution of
           opening angles which matches with high probability the
           angular range covered by the setup. Similar observation
           holds for the decay of Li-7* from the 2nd excited state
           at E*=4.63 MeV (T1/2=4.9E-21 s; Q=2.16 MeV).
           Contributions from higher-lying states than quoted
           can be safely ruled out for Be-8, while for Li-7 3rd
           excited state at E*=6.68 MeV may be responsible for an
           estimated 10% of the total alpha-triton decay observed.
FLAG       (1.) Sequential QF with intermediate Li-7 state
                resulting in pair alpha-triton.
           (2.) Sequential QF with intermediate Be-8 state
                resulting in pair alpha-alpha.
ANALYSIS    Yields were determined for full energy distribution by
            extrapolating the angular distribution from data at
            opening angles >60deg to the full angular range.
            Yield of Be-8 formed in g.s. had determined indirectly
            using measured E-rest spectrum and data of REL-REFs;
            average alpha energy was assumed to be 10.MeV with
            FWHM 10.MeV in fitting routine.
