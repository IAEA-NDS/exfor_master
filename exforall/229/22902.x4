           (SITA)  Single target irradiation. Each irradiation was
                   accompanied by a measurement with an empty gas
             cell in order to compensate the low-energy neutrons
             generated in the materials of the target
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)  For determiation of the individual reaction
                    channel that specifies cross section
CORRECTION .Correction in general -
           .For dead-time effects;
            for variation of the neutron fluence;
            for fission fragment losses at the flux monitoring;
            for the zero extrapolation of the fission events;
            for neutron scattering in the gas target, fission
            chamber and support structures
           .Correction for the missing 511-keV radiation due to
            the annihilation in flight is 1.1%;
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total error equal to the quadratic sum of its
                    constituents -
           (MONIT-ERR)  Error of the U-238 reference cross section
           (ERR-1)  Error due to the fission deposit mass
           (ERR-2)  Max error due to the correction of the
             break-up neutrons with U-238. Min error = 0
           (ERR-3)  Max error due to the U-238 fragment counting
                    statistics
