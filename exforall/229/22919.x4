METHOD     (SLODT) Lead slowing-down assembly CIRENE consists of
            the lead cube(L=1.2m) composed of 36 elementary cubes
            40x40x30 cm3 of 542 kg weight. Rectangular channel
           (GSPEC) Gamma-ray Spectroscopy was performed after two
             different irradiation duration times.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 90% HPGe coaxial detector was used with
            classical spectroscopic chain composed of
            pre-amplifier, amplifier and multichannel analyzer.
            A shielding of 10cm thick lead (to reduce background
            due g-rays coming from concrete) surrounding 1cm
            copper(to stop x-rays generated in lead shielding).
           (HE3SP) Small He-3 detector for relative flux
                   monitoring.
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) 12 MeV deuterons impinging beryllium target of
            1 mm thickness at centre of lead cube on aluminum
            support, liquid cooling system.
INC-SPECT   For thermal energy region - Maxwell energy distr.
            For resonance energy region - energy area near the
            single strong low-energy resonance. Second Energy
