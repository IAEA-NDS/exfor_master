FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) Geel linear accelerator GELINA.
INC-SOURCE Neutron burst with full width at half maximum less 1ns.
INC-SPECT   Pulse white neutron spectrum from GELINA.
SAMPLE     For transmission setup - the sample of 4.51E-2 at/barn
           thickness was placed at half distance between neutron
           detector and neutron source in computer driven sample
           changer.
           For capture measurement - two discs of metallic rhodium
           with thickness 3.37E-04 at/B and 1.877E-03 at/B were
           used.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) For the transmission measurements -
            The neutrons were detected by 6mm thick NE912 Li-glass
            scintillator.
           (BF3) BF3 proportional counters were used to monitor
              the changes in integral neutron flux from GELINA.
           (SCIN) For the capture measurements- two C6D6 detectors
           NE230 of 10cm diameter, 7.5cm height, placed at 125deg
           with respect to neutron beam direction.
           (IOCH) Neutron flux was permanently monitored by B-10
           double Frisch-gridded ionization chamber, placed at
           about 1m upstream sample.
METHOD     (TOF)
            Capture experiments, the flight path was 28.8 m, 800Hz
             repetition rate.
            Transmission experiments, the flight path was 50 m,
            400 Hz operation frequency.
           (TRN) Transmission factor was determined by number of
           counts, corrected for dead time of acquisition system.
            Background was deduced from measurement with "black
            resonance" filters.
            In URR 6 keV -96 keV the transmission factor was
            averaged in energy bins deltaE/E <30%.
            Average total cross-section was obtained from average
            transmission factor after correction for effect of
            resonance structure.
           For capture measurements - the total energy principle
           with the weighting function technique was used.
           Additional measurements with open beam configurations
           were done for background determination.
           Weighting functions were determined by MCNP simulations
           for each sample, including detailed description of
           experimental setup.
           In URR the capture yield was averaged in energy bins
           with deltaE/E <30%.

CORRECTION  Number of counts of detectors was corrected for dead
            time of acquisition system.
            For transmission measurements:
            Correction factor for effect of resonance structures
            was calculated with SEHS code.For thick samples the
            correction factor may be reaching about 18% at 5 keV.
            For capture measurements:
            Normalization constant was determined in resolved
           resonance region 100eV - 300eV using resonance analysis
           code REFIT and resonance parameters from third REL-REF.
           Average capture cross-section was corrected for effect
           of multiple scattering and self-shielding using
           iteratively code SESH.For thin sample correction less
           0.5%.

ASSUMED    (ASSUM,45-RH-103(N,G),,WID,,AV) Average gamma width for
            s-wave and d-wave (l=0 and 2) was assumed constant
            of value 165.meV, based on values from resolved
            resonance region, defined in REL-REF
             A.Brusegan+,C,2004SANTA,1,953,2004.
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) Average partial cross-sections in URR were
           expressed in terms of transmission coefficients by
           applying Hauser-Feshbach theory with width fluctuation
           correction factor -similar in 4th REL-REF.
           Isospin dependent coupled-channel optical model
           potential containing a dispersive term with nonlocal
           contribution was derived from fits to the entire
           neutron and proton scattering data set by methodology
           of 5th and 6th REL-REFs.
           Customary coupled-channels calculations were performed
           by coupling first 6 states of ground state up to
           1.41MeV excitation energy. Link to derived DCCOM was
           used to determine energy dependence of potential
           scattering radius and of neutron strength functions,
           which was of order of few percent on range of 6-96 keV.
           Average resonance parameters were resulted from present
           fit.
