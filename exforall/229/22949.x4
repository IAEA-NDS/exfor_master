            The calculated angular resolution function is on Fig.4
            of NIM/A,568,723,2006.
           The response function was calculated by the Monte Carlo
            code SRIM-2003 (http://www.srim.org/) combined with
            the pre- and post-processing code of authors.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The pencil-beam neutron source. A deuteron beam
             is accelerated up to 350 keV and bombards a rotating
             target of 3.7E+13 Bq tritium. A maximum neutron yield
             of 4.E+12 n/s is available with a beam current of 20
             milli-Ampere.
            Distance tritium target - sample - 440cm.
INC-SPECT    Mean neutron energy calculated according to reaction
             kinematics is 14.2 MeV, spread of neutron energy is
             130 keV calculated with MCNP-4C2 code. Beam solid
             angle divergence is 2.5E-5 sterad.
             The maximum neutron flux at the outlet of the beam
             is 1.E+6 neutrons/sec/cm**2 and the background
             neutron flux outside the beam is lower than
             5.E+2 neutrons/sec/cm**2
             Non-uniformity of the neutron flux at a sample was
             estimated at less than 0.1%.
CORRECTION   Corrections were made for energy loss in a sample.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)    For flux monitoring
             The neutron fluence was determined by the Al foil
            activation method and the flux monitoring of a 238U
            fission chamber. For a standard cross-section,
            122.0 mb for the 27Al(n,alpha) reaction evaluated in
            the JENDL-3.3  was used.

SAMPLE      Metal circular foil of Al-27, thickness 50 micro-m,
            2.17 cm in diameter
METHOD       In the present study, authors attempted to use the
            anticoincidence spectrum of the dE detector to
            construct the low energy part of DDXc ( < 2.5 MeV).
COMMENT     Of authors in NIM/A,568,723,2006, page 730:
            The minimum measurable energy was around 0.9MeV.
            Since the energy of alpha-particles emitted from a
            medium-heavy nuclide is limited to above 2MeV due to
            the potential barrier, the obtained DDX includes all
            the components of the emission energy.
            Measurement at each angle -8 hr,, total 4 days.

           (A,10634001,S.M.Grimes+,J,NSE,62,187,1977)
            The detection energy cutoff of the previous methods
           is probably to have caused the difference between the
           present and the previous measurements in the lower
           energy region.
            ENDF/B-VI agrees well with the present result although
            there is a slight difference in the detailed
            distribution.
            The difference between JENDL-3.3 and the present
            result is rather large.

SAMPLE      Metal circular foil of aluminum , thickness 50
            micrometers, 2.17 cm in diameter
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)  A total cross section was obtained by fitting
            ADX with Legendre polynomial series and integrating
            it over angle.

            Rather small, perhaps because of its higher detection

            Small but, within its uncertainties, agrees with
            the present result.

           respectively, which are a bit smaller than the value

METHOD      The measurements at scattering angles of 20, 31, 40

            needed a day .

            reaction was used for the standard cross section.

            The obtained ADX agreed well with the evaluated ADX
            in ENDF/B-VI, but slightly differed from JENDL-3.3.
