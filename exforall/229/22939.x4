FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) The Karlsruhe 3.7-MV Van de Graaff
            accelerator operated in DC mode with current of about
            100 microA (for Li targets) or up to 150 microA for
            LiF targets.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced via the Li-7(P,N)Be-7
            source by bombarding a 30-mum thick layers of metallic
            Li or crystalline LiF on a water-cooled Cu-backings
            with protons of 1912 keV. Neutrons were emitted into
            forward cone of 120 deg opening angle.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Several independent activations were carried
            out for each isotope with modified exp. parameters.
           (STTA) Samples were irradiated in close contact with
            the Li target.

            HL error 0.00021 day, intensity 0.9558+-0.0012.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) At irradiation the neutron flux was recorded
           in intervals of 60 or 90sec using a Li-6 glass detector
           91 cm downstream of Li target.

           Each consists of four independent HPGe n-type crystals
           in a common cryostat. The two clovers were placed face
           to face,in contact with a 5.2-mm-thick sample holder,
           corresponding nearly to a 4-pi geometry.Whole assembly

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The small gamma activity of Ba-133g was
           measured with a system of two HPGe clover detectors.
           Each consists of four independent HPGe n-type crystals
           in a common cryostat. The two clovers were placed face
           to face,in contact with a 5.2-mm-thick sample holder,
           corresponding nearly to a 4-pi geometry.Whole assembly
           was shielded against room background with 10 cm of lead
           and a 5-mm-thick layer of copper.The efficiency
           calibration of the clover system was carried out with
           a set of weak reference sources.

          2(66-DY-156(N,G)66-DY-157,,SIG,,MXW,DERIV)
             Derived by JEFF-3.0A .
CORRECTION  Correction for the cutoff at 106 keV and small
            deviations from the shape of ideal Maxwellian spectrum
            by the energy-dependent c-s from data libraries
            to obtain true Maxwellian average c-s at 25 keV.
ANALYSIS    Extrapolation of MACS to lower and higher values of kT
            was determined with the evaluated energy-dependent c-s
            from JEFF-3.0A, JEFF-3.1, JENDL-3.3, ENDF-B/VII.0
            taking into account contribution of RRR, using HF
            calculation in URR by codes CASTHY, GNASH .
            Evaluated c-s were folded with experimental neutron
            spectrum and the ratio of measured c-s to average c-s
            was calculated - Fnorm:
             JEFF-3.0A        1.069
             ENDF-B/VII.0     1.059
           MACS were calculated as:
            <SIG>kT = <SIG>kT-RRR + Fnorm * <SIG>kT-URR .

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty of contribution of RRR.
            Uncertainty of evaluated c-s was not provided,
            assumed as 0.
           (ERR-T) Quoted total uncertainty includes ERR-1
            and uncertainty of Fnorm.
