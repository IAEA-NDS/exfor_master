REL-REF    (I,,K.Wisshak+,J,NIM/A,292,595,1990)  Description of
                       the 4piBaF2  detector
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)  3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Metallic Li target bombarded by a pulsed
                   proton beam, pulse rate 250 kHz, pulse width
              less than 1 nanosec, average beam current 2.0 mu-A
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path is 79 cm
           (GSPEC)
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
INC-SPECT  .Proton beam energy adjusted so to be 30 and 100 KeV
            above the 7-Li(p,n)7-Be reaction threshold 1.881 MeV.
            In this way, continuous neutron spectra in the proper
            energy range for S-process studies were obtained,
            ranging from 3 to 100 and from 3 to 225 keV.
SAMPLE     .The samples were prepared from isotopically enriched
            oxide powder-Lu2-O3 and Hf-O2 canned in the aluminium
            boxes.  Samples were heated to 1200 degree K for
            15-min to eliminate any water contaminations. During
            the final heating the pellets shrank slightly.
            Immediately after cooling, the actual samples were
            prepared by canning the pellets into air tight
            aluminium cylinders with 0.2-mm thick walls.
           .Apart from the two lutetium or five hafnium samples, a
            gold sample in an identical can was used for measuring
            the neutron flux, and an empty can served for
            determining the sample-independent background.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The CASINO/GEANT version of the MONTE CARLO code
            were used for simulations of experimental setup.

DETECTOR   (D4PI). The Karlsruhe 4pi-Barium-Fluoride detector via
                   the prompt gamma-rays consisting of 42 hexa-
            and penta-gonal crystals forming a spherical shell
            of Ba-F2 with 10 cm inner radius and 15 cm thickness
            The energy resolution of the individual crystals were
            normalized by means of actual spectra and equal to
            7.% at 2.5MeV gamma energy, time resolution 500 ps

COMMENT    *By authors*.The experimental cross sections were
            converted into absolute values using the gold cross
            section from literature. The final results for the
            stellar cross sections at kt=30-KeV are summarized in
            table1.
