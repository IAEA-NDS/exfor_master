CORRECTION  It was concluded, that in the energy range of this
            measurements there is no contribution from
            74-Ge(n,np + pn + d) reactions.
            73Ge(n,p)73Ga cross-section could be contaminated by
            76Ge(n,alpha)73Zn followed by Beta- decay to 73Ga, was
            negligible in energy range, since 76Ge is the less
            abundant isotope in natural Ge and 72Ge(n,alpha) and
            74Ge(n,alpha) reaction cross-sections are less 3 and
            1 mb, respectively. (n,alpha) cross-section decreases
            with increasing neutron number of Ge isotopes, so for
            76Ge, it is expected to be much less than 1 mb and
            does not influence the 73Ge(n,p)73Ga yield.

CRITIQUE     See FLAG
FLAG       (1.) Prof.R.Vlastou: at higher energies it grows
           rapidly to about 20% due to the parasitic neutrons of
           the beam. So the values given in EXFOR at 11.1
           and 11.4 MeV should not be trusted.
STATUS     (PRELM) Data are preliminary. New experiment in process

CORRECTION To estimate the neutron background contribution to the
           activation of Ge-75 via Ge-74(n,gamma)Ge-75 reaction
           and to made appropriate corrections, an irradiation was
           performed just below the (n,2n) reaction threshold,
           where the product radioactivity was expected to derive
           only from the disturbing (n,gamma) reaction.
