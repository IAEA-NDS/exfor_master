TITLE      Total reaction cross section for protons on He-3
           and He-4 between 18 and 48 MeV.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMIN) The 50 MeV cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Five Ne-102 plastic scintillators were used.
           (CSICR) One CsI(Na) scintillator was used.
SAMPLE     The gas target cells have walls formed by a thick brass
           cylinder and each cell has a beam entrance and a beam
           exit foil soldered in place and composed of Ni. The
           entrance foils are 0.02 mm thick and the exit foils,
           having a large area than the entrance foils, are 0.07
           mm thick. Two cells of different lengths were used
           during the experiments. One cell of length t=3.10 cm
           was operated at a pressure of about 35 atm, and the
           other of length t=5.16 cm was operated at a pressure of
           about 20 atm.
METHOD     (EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Standard deviation
