REACTION   (1-H-2(D,N)2-HE-3,,DA)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) A proton recoil telescope were aligned on
           the beam axis at the entrance and exit ports,
           respectively, of a vacuum chamber of 90 cm diameter
           fitted between the 40 cm pole faces of a large magnet.
           Recoil protons were detected at 0+-7 degr. by means of
           three Si surface barrier detectors.
SAMPLE     A target consisted basically of a 75 mm long brass
           cylinder filled with deuterium gas to a pressure of
           about 2 bar and closed with 30 mu-m thick quartz
           windows.

REACTION   (1-H-2(D,N)2-HE-3,,DA)
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) A detector telescope was mounted in a
           small scattering chamber approximately 250 cm from the
           gas target where it was used routinely as a flux
           monitor. Three Si surface barrier detectors positioned
           at 30 degr. to the neutron beam were operated in
           coincidence to identify the protons recoiling from a
           polyethylene foil of 40 mg/cm2 thickness and 10 mm
           diameter into a solid angle of 6*10**(-4) sr.
SAMPLE     The high-pressure, LN2 cooled gas target was used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)  Multiple scattering of the beam in the
           entrance foil and target gas which alters the average
           reaction angle, and also the loss of neutrons due to
           interactions in the beam stopper and other material.
