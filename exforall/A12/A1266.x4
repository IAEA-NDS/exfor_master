TITLE      The capture of protons by deuterons
SAMPLE     Ice and gas targets
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two sodium iodide scintillation counters
           were used to detect the gamma rays, one 2.5 in.
           in diameter by 3.5 in. long on a Dumont 6363
           photomultiplier and the other 2.75 in. in diameter
           by 4.5 in. long on a Dumont K1213 photomultiplier.
           The counters with magnetic shields and 4 inches of
           lead shielding could be rotated to +-135 degr. on
           either side of the incident beam. Both ice targets
           of measured thickness and gas targets were used.
