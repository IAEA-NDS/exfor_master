SAMPLE     Ice and gas targets
           A thin calcium fluoride target was used for measuring
           the scintillation counter efficiency.
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two sodium iodide scintillation counters were
           used to detect the gamma rays, one 2.5 in. in
           diameter by 3.5 in. long on a Dumont 6363
           photomultiplier and the other 2.75 in. in diameter by
           4.5 in. long on a Dumont K1213 photomultiplier. The
           counters with magnetic shields and 4 inches of lead
           shielding could be rotated to +-135 degr. on either
           side of the incident beam. Both ice targets of
           measured thickness and gas targets were used.

REACTION   (1-H-2(P,G)2-HE-3,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error is combination of statistical
           errors and estimated errors, the largest being due to
           uncertainty in the neutron effect subtraction and in
           the counter solid angle.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in target thickness
