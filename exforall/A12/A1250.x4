SAMPLE     Gas Target
FACILITY   Accelerating Tube
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two Si Detectors (ACTIVE AREA=500 MM**2,
           THICKNESS=2000MICROM).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) An Overall Error Due to the Uncertainty in
           The Calorimeter Measurement (+-2.5%) And Pressure
           Measurement (+-2.8%) And Due to the Absolute Cross
           Section Normalization.
           (DATA-ERR1) Uncertainty Includes Statistical Error and
           Error in Effective Beam Energy.
