SAMPLE     The cells were filled with high-purity gases (3He
           nominally 99.9%) isotopically and chemically pure,
           4He nominally 99.998% chemically pure.
DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR) The cells were counted with a large Ge(Li)
           detector whose nominal efficiency at 1333 keV was 22%
           that of a 7.6 cm diam. by 7.6 cm deep NaI(Tl) detector
           at 25 cm, and whose resolution was 1.3 keV at 478 keV.
