TITLE      Complete set first-order polarization observables in
           nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering near 20 MeV
           deuteron energy
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTSU) 12 UD Pelletron tandem accelerator
SAMPLE     Target material was hydrogen or deuterium gas
           in the small gas cell with a 2.5 mu-m thick Havar
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (TELES) Thin silicon surface-barrier. Scattered
           particles were detected by four counter telescopes
           composed of a thin silicon surface-barrier detector
           and a thick one, installed so that there were two on
           the left turntable and two on the right turntable.
           Particle indentifiers were used if we had a need to
           separate the particles.

           (19990315U)CNPD: corrected 4-dig. year and lower cases.

ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR) Digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR) Digitizing error
           (ERR-T) Total error. The differential cross section
           was measured independently of the analyzing-power
           measurements. Estimated typical errors and their
           sources considered were as follows: 0.47% for counting
           statistics, 0.06% for angle setting, 0.12% for current
           integration, 0.50% for the g factor, and 0.23% for the
           number of scattering centers in the target gas.
