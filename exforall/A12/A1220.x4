TITLE      Tritium break-up contribution to the neutron source
           reaction 3H(p,n) from 9 to 14 MeV
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL)
SAMPLE     A cylindrical gas cell of length 3 cm and volume
           0.5 cm3, pressurized to 1.5 atm of tritium. the tritium
           was absorbed in a uranium furnace and was expelled
           into a cell by heating
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Ne-218 liquid,which thickness was on 5.08 cm and
           diameter 8.89 cm and was surrounded by a 5 t shield of
           paraggin,lithium carbonate, copper and lead
