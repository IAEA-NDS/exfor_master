FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP)
SAMPLE     T-Ti target, which was of 0.45, 1.51 and 1.96 mg/cm2
           thickness for deuteron energies of 1, 1.5 and 2 MeV
           respectively
MONITOR    (1-H-3(D,EL)1-H-3,,DA,,RTH)
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SIBAR) Proton recoil. The neutron angular
           distribution was measured with a proton recoil
           telescope counter. In this counter protons are
           scattered out of a polyethylene foil 43 mg/cm3
           thick and detected by a CsI crystal a transmission
           Au-Si surface barrier detector 300 um thick is
           inserted between foil and crystal. To reduce the
           background the pulse height spectrum of the CsI
           crystal is gated by the coincidence pulse of two
           counters. In this was the background counting rate
           measured without the polythene foil was only about 3%
           of the counting rate obtained with the foil in
           position. At a deuteron energy of 1 MeV the neutrons
           were monitored by the associated alpha particle
           method, and at deuteron of 1.5 and 2 MeV by two Au-Si
           surface barrier detectors. The monitors were mounted
           12 cm from the target at an angle of 140 degr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in geometry
           (ERR-S) Statistical error in telescope counts
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty due to choice of limits for
                   proton pesk
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in total n-p scattering cr.section
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in anisotropy of n-p scattering
           (ERR-5) Total monitor accuracy
           (ERR-6) Uncertainty due to flux attenuation and
           scattering in the target holder
