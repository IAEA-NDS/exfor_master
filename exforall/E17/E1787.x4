MISC-COL   (MISC) Primary proton energy
INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is less than 0.1 micro-Ampere.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element. Chemical
             purities are 99.999%, 99.98% and 99.99% for Al, Ni
             and Au samples respectively.
           - Physical-form of target: Sample table was cooled by
             liquid nitrogen to keep the temperature of the
             sample stacks below 223K, so as not to release the
             produced He in the stacks during the proton
             irradiation
           - Target-thickness: Sample sizes are 12x9x0.095 mm**3,
             12x9x0.119 mm**3, 12x9x0.051 mm**3 for Al, Ni and Au
             samples, respectively.

METHOD     (SITA)
           (HE-AC) Alpha particles emitted from sample are
                   stopped in Au catchers.
           (MASSP) Released gas from solid-sample in furnace is
                   analyzed by quadrupole-type mass spectrometer.
