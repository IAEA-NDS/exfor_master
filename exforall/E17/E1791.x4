SAMPLE     - Target is natural.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid. Carbon plate
           - Target-thickness is 370 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing is unknown.
METHOD     (EDE) to particle identification
           (TOF) to particle identification
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNIPC) 22Ne primary beam that was accelerated
                           to about 110 AMeV by the RIKEN Ring
                           Cyclotron (RRC).
           (PRJFS,2JPNIPC) Secondary 12,16C beams were produced
                           via the projectile fragmentation.
ANALYSIS   In order to obtain the reaction cross section of 16C,
           the number of the inelastically scattered 16C were
           subtracted from the total number of 16C.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillators are used for a TOF
                  measurement
           (SI) Three silicon detectors (150 micro-meter * 3)
                were used to measure the energy loss (Delta E)
           (NAICR) The total energy (E) was measured by a NAI(Tl)
                   detector (energy resolution of 0.7% in FWHM
                   for 110 AMeV 22Ne) [T.Suda, et al., RIKEN
                   Accel. Prog. Rep. 35(2002)42.]
           (PPAC) Used to monitor beam size and transmission
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
