INC-SOURCE (POLIS)An atomic-beam-type polarized ion source with
                  an ECR ionizer.
                  The statistical error of the polarization was
                  (typically) 0.015
SAMPLE     Target is natural.
           Chemical-form of target is element.
           Physical-form of target is liquid.
           Target-thickness: The diameter of target cell is
           2.00cm and the density of target is 0.1265+-0.0015
           g/cm3.
           Backing is AL.
           Backing-thickness: The thickness of the cell wall
           which is penetrated by the beam is 0.2mm.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNOSA)an AVF cyclotron and a ring cyclotron
           Research Center for Nuclear Physics
DETECTOR   Monitor Reaction: During the measurements, the beam
           polarization was continuously monitored by two sets of
           beam line polarimeters. These polarimeters measured
           protons scattered at 17deg from a (CH2)n target in
           coincidence with the recoil protons by four detector,
           which measure the vertical and horizontal components
           of the beam polarization.

ERR-ANALYS (+ERR-T)The error bars of Ay contain the statistical
                   errors. An overall normalization uncertainty
                   of about 2.5% has to be added to the errors of
