MONITOR    Elastic scattering measured by silicon surface barrier
           detector at 45deg in target chamber are used for
           evaporation residue cross section normalization.
PART-DET   (A)
SAMPLE     Target enrichment is 98%.
           Chemical-form of target is element.

DETECTOR   Detector resolution is 75KEV.(FWHM typical value)
           Calibration: The energy calibration of the DPSD was
           made using known alpha lines from 214Ra(7.137MeV),
           215Ra(8.700MeV), and 216Th(7.921MeV) which were
           produced in the present reaction.
           Monitor Reaction: A silicon surface barrier detector
           to monitor the elastic scattering was set at the 45deg
           direction in the target chamber in order to normalize
           the evaporation residue cross sections.

DETECTOR   Detector resolution is 75KEV.(FWHM typical value)
           Calibration: The energy calibration of the DPSD was
           made using known alpha lines from 214Ra(7.137MeV),
           215Ra(8.700MeV), and 216Th(7.921MeV) which were
           produced in the present reaction.
           Monitor Reaction: A silicon surface barrier detector
           to monitor the elastic scattering was set at the 45deg
           direction in the target chamber in order to normalize
           the evaporation residue cross sections.
