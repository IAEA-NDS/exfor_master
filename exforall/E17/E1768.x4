DETECTOR   Solid angle: The acceptance angle of first solid-state
           detector was +-6.5deg
           Efficiency: The detection efficiency of the
           polarimeter was 9.7e-6.
           (SOLST)Two silicon solid-state detectors (HAMAMATSU
                  S5377-03 and HAMAMATSU S4276-02) which act as
                  polarimeter using p-28Si elastic scattering.
                  The measrued analyzing power Ay for 3-MeV
                  polarized protons from the accelerator was
