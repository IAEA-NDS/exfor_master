INC-SOURCE - Beam intensity: <140 pnA. Error was estimated to be
             less than 15%.
           - Ion source: 48Ca ions were produced at the 18 GHz
             ECR ion source [T.Nakagawa et al., Nucl. Instrum.
             Methods A396(1997)9], where the 64% enriched 48Ca
             oxide powder was used [S.M.Lukyanov et al., Nucl.
             Instrum. Methods B47(1990)102)].
SAMPLE     - Target is natural.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 336 mg/cm**2. The target
             thickness was chosen to maximize secondary beam
             intensities based on a semi-empirical yield
             estimation by the INTENSITY code [J.A.Winger et al.,
             Nucl. Instrum. Methods B70(1992)380].
           - Backing is unknown.
METHOD     (BCINT,TOF,EDE)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNIPC) Newly developed linear accelerator as
                           an injector to the RRC
           (CYCLO,2JPNIPC) RIKEN Ring Cyclotron (RRC)
DETECTOR   Efficiency: The detection efficiency for a Z<=7
           fragment was achieved to be over 95%.
           (MAGSP) RIPS spectrometer (momentum acceptance is 6%
                   and solid angle is 5 msr.
           (SI) Used as Delta E counter
           (SCIN) To make TOF signal of fragments
           (PPAC) To determine positions of fragments
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
