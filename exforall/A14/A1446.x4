TITLE      Levels at 4.63 MeV and 5.6 MeV in 7Li studied in (d,p)
           reactions
FACILITY   (VDG)
SAMPLE     The target consisted of Li2SO4, enriched to 95% in 6Li
           and evaporated in vacuo onto thin carbon foils. Target
           thicknesses were roughly estimated to be between 10 and
           50 microg/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SOLST) The spectrometer was equipped with an
           Ortec surface barrier detector with an activ area
           450mm**2 as a monitor a surface barrier detector was
           placed at an angle of 135 degr.

ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR) Digitizing error
           (DATA-ERR) From graphic bars and the digitizing
COMMENT    An estimated of the differential cross section was made
           by comparison with the 7Li(d,p0)8Li (gr.st.), for
           which the dif.cross section is determined by sellshop.
