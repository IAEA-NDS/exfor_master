SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.95) The target consisted of Li2SO4,
           enriched to 95% in 6Li and evaporated in vacuo onto
           thin carbon foils. Target thicknesses were roughly
           estimated to be between 10 and 50 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SIBAR) The spectrometer was equipped with an
           ORTEC surface barrier detector with an active area
           450 mm2. As a monitor a surface barrier detector was
           placed at an angle of 135 degr.

MONITOR    (3-LI-7(D,P)3-LI-8,PAR,DA)
ANALYSIS   An estimate of the differential cross section was
           made by comparison with the 7Li(d,p)8Li(0) reaction,
           for which the differential cross section is
           determined by Sellshop at the same deuteron energy
           and at one of the same angles (30 degr.). From that
           value and the mass ratio 5: 95 for the 7Li : 6Li
           abundance, one obtains a differential cross section
           of 0.6 +- 0.3 mb/sr at an angle of 36. degr. in the
           center of mass system.
