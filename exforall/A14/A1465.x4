SAMPLE     The Targets of Li-7 were Prepared by Vacuum Evaporation
           99.9% Enriched Li-7 Metal on to 500 Microg/Cm2 Thick
           Nickel Backing.The Lithium Deposit was Around
           30 Microg/Cm2 and It  was Allowed to Remain in the
           Atmosphere For Sufficient Time After Evaporation to
           Form the Stable Hydroxide
FACILITY   (VDGT,2FR SAC)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Three Solid-State Detectors Mounted on a
           Rotatable Top Lid.
