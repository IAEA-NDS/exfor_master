TITLE      Symmetry Studies of the Sequential Reaction
           Li-7(D,ALPHAN)He-4
AUTHOR     (J.C.P.HEGGIE,P.W.MARTIN)
INSTITUTE  (1CANUBC)
REFERENCE  (J,PL/B,43,289,197302)
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     Lif(99.9%LI-7) Target Evaporated onto a Thin Carbon
           Foil with a Beam (0.3MKGA)
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Charged Particle Reaction Products were Detec-
           Ted with a Surface-Barrier Detector While a Scintilla-
           Tor of Ne218 Coupled to a Phillips Xp1040 Photomultip-
           Lier Served As a Detector For Fast Neutrons
COMMENT    The Angular Correlation of the Neutrons with Respect to
           The He5 Recoil Axis was Measured For Each of Three
           Positions of the Alpha1 Detector at Laboratory Angles
           Of 65, 100 and 120 Degrees.
