TITLE      Low-energy cross sections for 7Li(p,alpha)4He and
           6Li(p,alpha)3He.

INC-SPECT  Negative ion beams of 6Li and 7Li were obtained from
           the exchange canal of a negative helium ion source.
           Hydrogen gas was used in the duoplasmatron source to
           provide the ionizing beam.
SAMPLE     CH4. At a target pressure of 3.0 Torr, the gas
           consumption was about 251 of CH4, per hour (at STP),
           with over 98% of this flowing through the Roots pump.
           Lithium beams and a CH4 gas target at equivalent
           proton energies
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   Three movable counters and a fixed counter at 90 degr.
           were used in the experiment.
           Foils of thickness 0.9 and 3.4 mg/cm2 were used in the
           forward counter and 0.22 and 1.4 mg/cm2 in the backward
           counter, for 6Li and 7Li, respectively.

COMMENT     After comparison with the A1513.005 data set
            (Ep=300 keV) and F0012.002 data sets (Ep=324 keV),
            the compiler believe '6Li(p,a)3He' in the Fig.4
            caption is correct (i.e., REACTION SF7=A) but 'the
            angle of the 3He in the c.m. angle' should read 'the
            angle of the alpha in the c.m. angle' in the same
            caption.
