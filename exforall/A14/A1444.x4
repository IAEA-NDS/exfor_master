TITLE      The nuclear reaction 4He(a,p)7Li and its inverse.
           ii. Reaction 7li(p,a)4He
FACILITY   (VDG)
SAMPLE     Thin targets of lithium fluoride were prepared by
           evaporation on to 0.005 mm thick aluminium backings
METHOD     (PHD)
DETECTOR   (CSICR) Crystal by a 2.5 mm thick
COMMENT    The cross section for the 7Li(p,a)4He reaction was
           calculated from our absolute measurements (account was
           taken of the fact that in the lithium reaction two
           alpha-particles are emitted per disintegration)
