TITLE      The cross section for the reaction B-10(p,alpha)Be-7 at
           proton energies below 200 keV.

FACILITY   (CCW,2UK BIR) Protons extracted from a radio-
           frequency ion source were accelerated in a vertical
           two-stage vacuum tube.
SAMPLE     The B-10 targets were prepared by electromagnetic
           deposition of the isotope on copper. Two thin targets
           of 90 ug/cm2 and 120 ug/cm2 (accurate to 10%) and
           one thick target,400 mug/cm**2, were used. The
           thickness of this last target was determined by
           weighing the backing foil before and after deposition.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The alpha particles were detected by a zinc
           sulphide screen and photomultiplier.
METHOD     (BCINT) Target currents were always measured with the
           target at a sufficiently large positive potential to
           retain secondary electrons.

COMMENT    - By authors.  Relative value of the cross section at
           lower energies were obtained using a thick target and
           the analyser for proton energies down to 120 KeV. For
           energies below 120-KeV a simple target chamber
           employing range discrimination, and with a much larger
           solid angle than the analyser was used. The alpha
           particles were detected by a zinc sulphide screen and
           photomultiplier. These observations were fitted to the
           absolute determinations at 180 and 205 KeV.
ADD-RES    The data are presented as Gamov plot too.
