SAMPLE     The B-10 targets were prepared by electromagnetic
           deposition of the isotope on copper.  Two thin targets
           of 90 mug/cm**2 and 120 mug/cm**2 (accurate to 10%) and
           one thick target,400 mug/cm**2, were used.  The
           thickness of this last target was determined by
           weighing the backing foil before and after  deposition.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The alpha particles were detected by a zinc
           sulphide screen and photomultiplier.
FACILITY   (CCW) Protons extracted from a radio-frequency ion
           source were accelerated in a vertical two-stage vacuum
           tube.
METHOD     (BCINT) Target currents were always measured with the
           target at a sufficiently large positive potential to
           retain secondary electrons.

COMMENT    - By authors.  Relative value of the cross section at
           lower energies were obtained using a thick target and
           the analyser for proton energies down to 120 KeV. For
           energies below 120-KeV a simple target chamber
           employing range discrimination, and with a much larger
           solid angle than the analyser was used. The alpha
           particles were detected by a zinc sulphide screen and
           photomultiplier. These observations were fitted to the
           absolute determinations at 180 and 205 KeV.
