SAMPLE     A target, which was either a polyethylene foil C-H/2 or
            C-D/2 or a static gas cell filled with deuterium-
           depleted hydrogen or with deuterium.
COMMENT    - By authors. All measurements were carried out in
           inverse kinematics - an intense Ne-19 beam bombarded
           a target.
DETECTOR   (TRD) The solid state nuclear track detector (ssntd).
           The delayed alpha-particles were detected.
           (SCIN) The solenoid and telescope (STAR) method.
           Beam particles and Na-20 nuclei were stopped in Ta foil
           behind the target: positrons from Na-20 were separated
           from Ne-19 positrons and detected in a stack of plastic
           scintillator.

DECAY-DATA (11-NA-20,446.MSEC,B+,11200.,,A,,0.2) In 20% of the
           cases, the positron emission is followed by
           alpha-emission.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error that arises in these measurements
           has two components:  the first is associated with
           statistics and normalization, and is by far dominated
           by  statistics - typically 40%, the normalization error
           being typically 10%.
           (+ERR-5) The second component is systematic and has two
           origins:
           1.  In all three measurements, the upper resonant
           state, 3.07 MeV, was covered only partly, due to its 35
           KeV width,
           2.  The 1.5 microbarn value was included as a negative
           contribution to the systematic error in the star-H/2
           measurement.
           (-ERR-5) See above.

COMMENT    - By authors. For the (D,N) reaction, the incident
           energy and target thickness were varied in order to
           obtain the cross section between 0.6 and 1.8 MeV in
           C.M. System.
