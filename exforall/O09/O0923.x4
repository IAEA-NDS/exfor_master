SAMPLE     Two U-238 targets of 15 mg/cm**2 were installed in a
           gas cell.
ADD-RES    (COMP). With predictions of different models.
           A partial level scheme is presented for Cu-73 and
           additional levels for Cu-71.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGLVN) An ion-guide laser ion source has been
           developed at the Leuven Isotope Separator on-line.
METHOD     (ASEP)
           (EXTB) The 30 MeV proton beam was pulsed and an
           averaged intensity between 3 and 6 microampere was used
