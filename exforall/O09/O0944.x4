SAMPLE     For the primary production target and the secondary
           reaction target, 4 g/cm**2 of beryllium and 4 g/cm**2
           of aluminum, were used.
           To obtain comparable results by the two methods, an
           aluminum primary target of 1 g/cm**2 was used for this
           test instead of beryllium.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The intranuclear-cascade plus evaporation model.
           The statistical abrasion-ablation model.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Two-stage magnetic spectrometer.
           (SCIN). Two scintillation detectors.
           (IOCH)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) The SIS accelerator of GSI.
           (FRS,2GERGSI)  The fragment separator FRS at GSI.
METHOD     (TOF) The isotope identification in the second stage
           of the FRS was performed by the Delta-E+
           time-of-flight+ magnetic rigidity method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is given by authors in data
           table without any analysis.
CORRECTION To derive the cross section, the number of ions
           identified was corrected in each case for the
           transmission of the FRS, for the data acquisition dead
           time and for losses due to nuclear reactions in the
           different layers of matter in the beam line. The
           latter correction, was found to be about 35% for the
           beryllium production target, 20% for the aluminum
           reaction target and 7% for the materials at the final
           focus.
STATUS     (TABLE)
COMMENT    -By authors. The measurement of the neutron removal
           from radioactive secondary beams, which are themselves
           produced via projectile fragmentation in a production
           target located at the entrance of the FRS, serving as a
           neutron-loss spectrometer.
           In the first part of the measurement, the complete
           spectrometer is tuned to transmit the Fe-52 nuclei
           which did not undegro nuclear reactions in the
           intermediate target. From the counting rate of these
           Fe-52 nuclei and the beam intensity measured before the
           primary target, the cross section for the production of
           the Fe-52 secondary beam from the Ni-58 primary beam is
           determined.
           For the second part of the measurement, the setting of
           the first dipole stage of the spectrometer is conserved
           whereas the second stage is tuned to Fe-51 produced
           from Fe-52 in the secondary reaction target.
           The projectile energies refer to middle of the target.
