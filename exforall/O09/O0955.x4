HISTORY    (20020417C)
           (20030512U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     The Pb, Cu and Al-targets located behind the
           fragment recoil separator.  The ions U-238 were
           particly stripped by a thin copper foil thickness 205
           mg/cm**2 placed at the target position of the fragment
           separator.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Two four stage multiple sampling ionization
           chambers, located before and after the target-
            MUSIC1 and  MUSIC2 were used to identify the nuclear
           charge.  With  MUSIC1 the primary U-ions were counted.
           The MUSIC2 was used either in a standard mode in order
           to measure the attenuation of the primary beam or to
           enumerate fission in events from the detection of a
           pair of ionizing fragments.
           (SCIN) Two large plastic scintillation detectors
           located behind the chamber and divided by a narrow
           horizontal slit in order to let the beam through.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) Heavy-ion synchrotron.
           (FRS,2GERGSI) Fragment separator.
METHOD     (TOF) Fission fragments are emitted back-to-back
           isotropically in the projectile frame. The transfer of
           momentum between the target nucleus and the uranium
           projectile can be neglected and the fission kinematics
           is assumed to be same as far an in-flight decay taking
           place in the target.

COMMENT    - By authors.  Fission events were sorted by different
           methods-
           counting the events for which two fragments of
           intermediate z were detected in music2.
           Measuring the energy loss of the two fragments.
           The spectrum of the energy loss for the first fragment
           of a pair was analyzed.
           Target-out contributions were subtracted with the three
           methods. It reduces the accuracy of the measurement.
           Together with the uncertainty due to the estimated of
           unresolved pairs of fragments,the precision ranges from
            7% to 10% according to the target.
