TITLE      Excitation functions of Rb-85(P,xN)Sr-85-m, 85-g, 82,
           81 reactions up 100 MeV-integral tests of cross section
           data, comparison of production routes of Sr-83 and

HISTORY    (20020520C)
           (20030512U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     85-Rb-Cl powder, isotopic abundance of Rb-85 is 99.4%,
           was used. A thin copper foil, 25-mum,was used as the
           backing. The diameter of this foil depended on the
           requirement of the irradiation facility, 13-20 mm.
           A suspension of very fine rubidium chloride in water-
           free toluene was obtained by mixing and stirring.
           To avoid contamination, the surface of each sample was
           covered with a 10-mum thick Al-foil.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).From the measured cross section data the yield
           for production of Sr-83 could be calculated. This
           integral yield was verified by irradiation of thick
           targets. The estimated total error in the thick target
           yield determination was about 10%.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) Compact cyclotron CV 28  at 12, 16, 20
           and 21-MeV
           (SYNCY,2GERJUL) The injector of the cooler synchrotron
           at 45-MeV.
           (CYCLO,2SWTPSI) At 45 and 71-MeV.
           (CYCLO,3SAFNAC) The separated sector cyclotron at 66
           and 100-MeV.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (CHSEP) The chemical separation was performed via high-
           performance liquid chromatography.
           (GSPEC) As an independent check on Sr-82, X-Ray
           spectrometry was also applied.  This counting technique
           has been many features similar to those of gamma-ray
           spectrometry.  A low energy high purity germanium
           detector was used.
           The time of irradiation was 30 min for short-lived
           products and several hours for longer - lived products.
           (BCINT) The beam current used was 70-100 Na.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy scale error was estimated to be
           +-0.2 MeV at the primary proton beam,increasing up to
           +-1.0 MeV along the energy degradation in the stack due
           to the error propagation.
           (ERR-T).The total uncertainty in the measured cross
           section was obtained by taking the square root of the
           sum of the squares of all the individual uncertainties.
           The individual uncertainties considered in particular
           were-target thickness-2%, target inhomogeneti-5%,
           detector efficiency-5%, counting statistic and peak
           area analysis-2-7%, beam current-8-11%, chemical
           yield-3%.  The total uncertaintires in the cross
           sections were up to 15%.

STATUS     (DEP,O0961004)
COMMENT    -By authors. In determining the optimum energy range
           for the production of Sr-83 the main considerations
           were the yield of Sr-83 and the level of the long-lived
           impurities Sr-85-g and Sr-82. The latter two
           radioisotopes would disturb imaging.  Since Sr-85-g
           emits a strong gamma-ray of 514-KeV and Sr-82 is in
           equlibrium with the 1.3 min Rb-82-g which is a pure
           beta+ emitter, large amounts of the two radioisotopes
           would give an unnecessarily high background.
           Furthermore the two impurities would also cause extra
           radiation dose.
           -By authors: isotopic impurity Sr-85-g at 35-30-MeV
           is 0.14%, at 40-35-MeV is 0.20%.
           Isotopic impurity Sr-82 at 40-35-MeV is 0.34%.
