TITLE      Excitation functions of Rb-85(P,xN)Sr-85-m, 85-g, 82,
           81 reactions up 100 MeV-integral tests of cross section
           data, comparison of production routes of Sr-83 and
           thick target yield of Sr-82.

           (20080210D) Deleted. It is duplicated with D4127.
SAMPLE     85-Rb-Cl powder, isotopic abundance of Rb-85 is 99.4%,
           was used. A thin copper foil, 25-mum,was used as the
           backing. The diameter of this foil depended on the
           requirement of the irradiation facility, 13-20 mm.
           A suspension of very fine rubidium chloride in water-
           free toluene was obtained by mixing and stirring.
           To avoid contamination, the surface of each sample was
           covered with a 10-mum thick Al-foil.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).From the measured cross section data the yield
           for production of Sr-83 could be calculated. This
           integral yield was verified by irradiation of thick
           targets. The estimated total error in the thick target
           yield determination was about 10%.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) Compact cyclotron CV 28  at 12, 16, 20
           and 21-MeV
           (SYNCY,2GERJUL) The injector of the cooler synchrotron
           at 45-MeV.
           (CYCLO,2SWTPSI) At 45 and 71-MeV.
           (CYCLO,3SAFNAC) The separated sector cyclotron at 66
           and 100-MeV.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (CHSEP) The chemical separation was performed via high-
           performance liquid chromatography.
           (GSPEC) As an independent check on Sr-82, X-Ray
           spectrometry was also applied.  This counting technique
           has been many features similar to those of gamma-ray
           spectrometry.  A low energy high purity germanium
           detector was used.
           The time of irradiation was 30 min for short-lived
           products and several hours for longer - lived products.
           (BCINT) The beam current used was 70-100 Na.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 145-cm**3 detector
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The peak area analysis was made using the soft-
           ware gamma vision 5.0.
