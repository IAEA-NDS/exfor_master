ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error limits quoted on the independent isomeric
           ratios at different angles are essentially the
           precisions from five sets of measurements.  Other
           sources of error in each single measurement include
           counting statistics-5%, least-squares fitting, detector
           efficiencies besides negligible errors in decay-scheme
           data.  Error in a single measurement was estimated to
           be around 10%.  The results were checked for any
           inconsistencies from activity correlations as  follows.
            "ANG-RSL" . The width of catcher foil.
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Average value of fragment initial spin.
           (MISC2) Normalized activity per unit solid angle for
           iodine-132 fragments.
           (MISC3) Normalized activity per unit solid angle for
           tellurium-132 fragments.
           (MISC1-ERR) An analysis is not given.

COMMENT    - By authors. The observed 132-I/132-Te ratio of
           0.44 +/- 0.05 is in reasonable agreement with the
           expected from charge distribution systematics (0.42) in
           the present fissioning system.
