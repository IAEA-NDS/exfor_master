SAMPLE     Electrodeposited U targets, 150 mug/cm**2 thick, on
           Al-backing foils were used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 60-cm**3 high purity Ge detector. Resolution
           of the detector system was 2.0 keV at 1332 keV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC) The 88-inch variable energy cyclotron.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) Typical integral beam current was 2-3 muA/Hr

STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl. I from PR/C,46,1445,1992
ADD-RES    (COMP) The collective mode model.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty is alpha beam energy.
HISTORY    (20030916C)
           (20080610A) Correction in sub 002 was made
            according Nicolas remarks.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) Error limits quoted on the independent
           isomeric ratios at different angles are essentially the
           precisions from five sets of measurements.
           Other sources of error in each single measurement
           include:
           (ERR-S) uncertainty in counting statistics-5%,
            * least-squares fitting, detector efficiencies besides
           negligible errors in decay-scheme data.
           (DATA-ERR2) Error in a single measurement was estimated
            to be around 10%.
           (MISC1-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
           (MISC2-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
           (MISC3-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Average value of fragment initial spin.
           (MISC2) Normalized activity per unit solid angle for
           Iodine-132 deduced from individual gamma lines
           (MISC3) Normalized activity per unit solid angle for

COMMENT    *By authors. The observed 132-I/132-Te ratio of
           0.44 +/- 0.05 is in reasonable agreement with the
           expected from charge distribution systematics (0.42) in
           the present fissioning system.
