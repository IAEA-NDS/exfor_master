DETECTOR   (SCIN). Ne213 scintillators having the size of 12.7-cm
           in diameter and 12.7 cm in thickness were used as
           neutron detectors.   Ne102a scintillators of
           17*17*1-cm**3 were used as veto counters.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNLEP)
METHOD     (TOF) The time-of-flight technique with a pair of
           scintillators.
