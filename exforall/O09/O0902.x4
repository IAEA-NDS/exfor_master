TITLE      Profiling of titanium implanted into iron and nickel
           with the reaction Ti-48(p,gamma)V-49.

SAMPLE     A Ti target of natural composition was used for
           determination the thick target yield.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 5*5 in. Na-I detector was used for measuring
           the gamma-ray yield.
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERFRK) The 2.5-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator of
           the Institut of Kernphysik.

COMMENT    -By authors. The profiling technique to large number of
           samples was applied. There were implanted with Ti-48
           ions at 50-KeV ion implanter whose mass resolution
           allowed the separation of the Ti isotopes. A uniformly
           area of 6 mm diameter was obtained by sweeping the ion
           beam electrostatically over the sample. Polycrystalline
           foils of Fe and Ni with a purity of 99.99% were used as
           host materials.

COMMENT    -By authors. Primary gamma radiation of the energy
            E(G)=7.963 MeV is measured with a NaI detector.
           Investigated energy region is the region of analog
           resonance.
HISTORY    (20170418A) SD: SF3=G -> X, SF4=V-49 -> G-0,
           SF6=TTY -> PY, SF8=REL -> TT/REL, SF5=PAR  added in
           REACTION code.  E-MIN, E-MAX were added.
