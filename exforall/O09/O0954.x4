DETECTOR   (D4PI) The 4pi-neutron detector, ORION, consists of
           five sectors filled with gadolinium-loaded liquid
           scintillator representing a total volume of 4 meter**3.
           (SCIN) 1. The light created within ORION is collected
           by means of 30 phototube.
           2.  A 1-mm thick plastic scintillator for a 9-mm thick
           C-target and 95-MeV*a C-13 beam, positioned 57-cm
           upstream of the target in ORION's reaction chamber.
           This detector allowed for a full identification of the
           traversing particles by providing an energy-loss
           information and the stop signal of a time-of-flight
           measurement with respect to the cyclotron radio
           frequency.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2ZZZCER) CERN-PS Accelerator.
COMMENT    -By authors. Thanks to the time difference in the
           prompt signal issued by ORION, a partial correction
           could be applied to the affected distributions, the
           associated uncertainty translating into larger error
           bars for the corresponding data. The mean values given
           in the following are corrected assuming a constant
           efficiency equal to that found for the Cf-neutrons,
           although high-energy neutrons may be produced in the
           reactions. However, this approximation appears quite
           justified in view of the large target thicknesses and
           the moderate energy of the impinging light particles,
           both factors leading to a soft energy spectrum of the
           leaking neutrons. It must be emphasized that this
           assumption was also employed in all previous moderator
           measurements of mean multiplicities.
