TITLE      Production of Be-7, Be-9 and Be-10 in the spallation
           of C-13 by protons of 150 and 600 MeV.

HISTORY    (20011031C)
           (20030503U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Solid samples of pyrolitic carbon, enriched to 90%
           C-13.  Targets consisting of several small pieces,
           approx.  200 mg.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Cascade-evaporation model.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR) At 150 MeV.
           (SYNCY,2ZZZCER) At 600 MeV.
METHOD     (INTB)
           (ACTIV) Integrated fluxes of 5.E+18 protons
CORRECTION Corrections for the small fraction of C-12 in the
           enriched targets are included in the values given for
           C-13.
STATUS     (TABLE) In compiled paper.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors given for the ratios include random
           fluctuations, as calculated by the reproducibility of
           different measurements plus an uncertainty due to the
           discrimination factor of the mass spectrometer. The
           errors on the absolute cross section of Be-9 and Be-10
           include the uncertainty in the measured Be-7 cross
           sections.
