SAMPLE     Thorium samples were prepared using Th-O/2 on 0.0508 mm
           thick aluminum discs. The thickness of thorium was
           1.5 mg/cm**2 thick, on the average.  The thicknesses
           were found to be uniform within 3% by measuring alpha
           activities from five 3-mm spots in each foil.  A stack
           of seven targets at a time, separated with pieces of
           aluminum foil was placed into a sample holder.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV)
           (EDEG) The proton energy at each foil was calculated
           from the range-energy relationships in aluminum and
           target materials.

COMMENT    -By authors. Two irradiations, lasting 11 and 200
           minutes, were carried out and total proton charges of
           1.5 and 108.1 millicoulomb were collected,
           respectively.
           -By authors. The values are the weigted means
           calculated from 2 to 5 separate activity measurements
           of each foil, run after different decay periods in
           order to be sure of the correct half-life.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error limits given 1-sigma are the weigted
           standard deviations of the means or the pooled standard
           deviations, whichever is bigger.  The error of the
           activities include uncertainties in absolute detector
           efficiences and gamma intensities, as well as in peak
           areas calculated by the analysis program.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table 3.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)

STATUS     (TABLE) From table 3.
