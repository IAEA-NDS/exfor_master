SAMPLE     Thorium samples were prepared using Th-O/2 on 0.0508 mm
           thick aluminum discs. The thickness of thorium was
           1.5 mg/cm**2 thick, on the average.  The thicknesses
           were found to be uniform within 3% by measuring alpha
           activities from five 3-mm spots in each foil.  A stack
           of seven targets at a time, separated with pieces of
           aluminum foil was placed into a sample holder.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV)
           (EDEG) The proton energy at each foil was calculated
           from the range-energy relationships in aluminum and
           target materials.

COMMENT    -By authors. Two irradiations, lasting 11 and 200
           minutes, were carried out and total proton charges of
           1.5 and 108.1 milliCoulomb were collected,
           respectively.
           -By authors. The values are the weighted means
           calculated from 2 to 5 separate activity measurements
           of each foil, run after different decay periods in
           order to be sure of the correct half-life.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error limits given 1-sigma are the
           weighted standard deviations of the means or the pooled
           standard deviations, whichever is bigger.  The error
           of the activities include uncertainties in absolute
           detector efficiencies and gamma intensities, as well as
           in peak areas calculated by the analysis program.
           (EN-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table 3.
