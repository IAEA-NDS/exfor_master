DETECTOR   The number of helium atoms produced by proton
           irradiation in the samples were measured by the helium
           atoms measurements system. See rel-ref
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNKYU)
           (SPECM,2JPNKYU)
METHOD     (SITA) Each target was assembled together front and
           back gold catcher foils.  The gold foils had a size of
           12*9*0.051 mm**3 and a nominal chemical purity of
           99.999%
           (BCINT) The current of a proton beam was less than 0.1-
           micro-ampere to keep the sample temperature low enough.
           (HE-AC).A helium accumulation method was used.
