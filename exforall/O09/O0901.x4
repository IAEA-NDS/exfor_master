TITLE      Absolute thick-target gamma-ray yields for elemental
           analysis by 7 and 9 MeV protons
AUTHOR     (J.Raisanen, T.Witting, J.Keinonen)
INSTITUTE  (2SF HLS)
REFERENCE  (J,NIM/B,28,199,1987)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2SF HLS).5-megavolts tandem accelerator.
SAMPLE     Most of the targets were 1 mm thick, 1*1 cm**2 metallic
           plates. In addition to the targets available in
           elemental form, powdered chemical compound target were
           used.  Only these are listed in Subentries.  The
           samples were 1 mm thick pellets, 6 mm in diameter.
METHOD     (BCINT).
           (GSPEC)
           (EXTB) The proton beam current was adjusted to keep the
           gamma-count rate constant and the dead time correction
           below 1%.  It varied from 0.1 to 20 nano-Ampere
           depending on the target.
DETECTOR   (GELI). A shielded 80 cm**3 Ge(Li) gamma-ray detector.
           The Ge-Li detector was shielded from neutrons by a 10cm
           thick paraffin absorber containing a small amount of
           boron added to capture the thermalized neutrons.
           In order to minimize possible angular distribution
           effects on the gamma-ray yields, the detector was
           located at an angle of 55 degrees relative to the beam.
           (BF3). Neutrons were detected by a B-F3 counter located
           30 cm from the target.
ADD-RES    (COMP).Proton induced gamma-ray emission analysis.
           (G-SPC)
ERR-ANALYS The experimental uncertainties in the absolute
           gamma-ray yield values are expected to be below 10%.
           They include the uncertainty-
           (ERR-1).In the stopping power.(2%).
           (ERR-2).In the gamma-ray intensities.(2-5%).
           (ERR-3).In the absolute efficiency.(5%).

COMMENT    - By compiler. Some gamma quanta are absent in ENSDF.
