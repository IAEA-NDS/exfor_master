COMMENT    - By authors. The measurements were taken in stuttgart.
PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectra were measured by using four large
           volume detectors
SAMPLE     In the set of measurements the target used was placed
           at 90 degree to the beam axis.  It was produced by
           evaporating Nb/2-O/5 on a 0.4-mm thick tantalum
           backing, which was cooled with water during the whole
           experiment.  It should be noted that the use of the
           Nb/2-O/5 target requires corrections for yield
           contribution from the O-17(P,P'g)O-17 reaction.
           The thickness of Nb in the Nb/2-O/5 target was found to
           be 125+-5 mug/cm**2.
           By considering the target stoichiometry one obtains a
           target total thickness of 180+-6 mug/ cm**2, which
           corresponds to a target thickness delta-e of 20 and 12
           KeV at a beam energy of 1.5-3-MeV, respectively.
           All targets used in the present work were also checked
           at the end of all measurements. No significant
           deterioration effects were found.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) Total cross sections determined from the
           corrected angular distributions measured at stuttgart
           with the 180 mug/cm**2 thick Nb/2-O/5 target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is reported by authors.

PART-DET   (G)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectra were taken by means of one
           detector of 80% relative efficiency that was placed
           either at 55 or 90 degree to the beam axis.
SAMPLE     In the set two different Nb targets positioned at 45
           degree to the beam axis were used, namely, Nb/2-O/5 and
           a metallic Nb.  The latter target was made by electron
           gun evaporation of metallis neobium of extreme high
           purity.   The fluorine level in the metal was less than
           1%%.  The energy region covered by the measurements
           using the metallic Nb was from 1.4 to 4.9 MeV.  Both
           targets were on 0.4-mm thick Ta backings, which were
           cooled with air during the measurements. It was found
           that the thickness of Nb in the Nb/2-O/5 target was
           106+-6  mug/cm**2.  The target had a total thickness of
           151+-7 mug/cm**2.  For the metallic target the analysis
           yielded a thickness of 371+-18 mug/cm**2, which
           corresponds to lost energy =31 and 20-KeV at proton
           beam energies of 1.5 and 3-MeV, respectively.
           All targets used in the present work were also checked
           at the end of all measurements. No significant
           deterioration effects were found.
CORRECTION In the case of the Nb/2-O/5 targets corrections for
           yield contributions from the O-17(P,P'g)O-17 reaction
           were necessary. The required corrections were performed
           with additional yield measurements carried out with a
           W-O/3 target, the thickness of W was found to be 153+-5
           mug/cm**2
COMMENT    -By authors.  The measurements were carried out with
           metallic Nb in order to avoid any uncertainties arising
           from the intruding O-17(P,P'g)O-17 reaction.  After
           calculation of the effective bombarding energy, the
           yield data were transformed to cross sections by
           normalization to the Nb/2-O/5 angular distribution
           data.  There were found to coincide within 5% with
           those determined from the angular distribution data
           obtained with the Nb/2-O/5 target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The cross sections values having an error of
           less than 5% are the means of at least two independent
           measurements.
