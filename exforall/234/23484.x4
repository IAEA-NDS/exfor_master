TITLE        The gamma energy of the isomeric transition of
            chlorine-38m

INSTITUTE  (2GERMUN,2GERSFN)
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERSFN) FRN reactor .
            Multichannel analyzer ND812 .
INC-SPECT   Neutron flux 1.7E+12 n/(cm2*sec)
SAMPLE      NaCl, LiCl, KCl, among them 5 mg high pure,
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) diode to measure gamma rays energy.
            Calibration standards Na-22, Cs-137, Mn-54 .
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 2 sec, sample moving by
           rabbit system within 40 sec ; measuring time was varied
           in the range of 0.50 to 1 sec for different series.

DECAY-DATA (17-CL-38-M,0.77SEC,DG,671.33)
           0.77+-0.03 sec measured .
ANALYSIS    90 values obtained by 15 series of 6 measurements
           resulted in the Cl-38-M energy to be
           671.33+-0.2 keV (standard deviation) .
            Cross section value is rough estimation.

COMMENT    Of compiler. Incident neutron energy is not mentioned i
           the article, supposed by compiler as thermal ( same as
           in 11565.002 - data used for comparison).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
           article.
