FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNTIT) 3-MV Pelletron accelerator.
           - pulsed proton beam with 1.5 ns pulse width and 4 MHz
           repetition rate.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 1.9-MeV incident proton beam.
           The incident neutron spectrum was determined from the
           TOF spectrum of the blank sample run measured with the
           6Li-glass detector.
METHOD     (TOF) The flight path length from the neutron source
           to the sample was 12 cm.
           (PHWT)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) An anti-Compton shielded NaI(Tl) spectrometer
           placed at a detection angle of 125 degree with
           respect to the proton beam for gamma-rays spectrometry.
           (SCIN) The number of the incident neutrons were
           monitored with a 6Li glass scintillation detector
           located at a flight length of 30 cm.

CORRECTION Corrections for neutron self-shielding and multiple
           scattering in the samples and carbon container were
           made by calculating the correction factors using the
           Monte Carlo method
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties include:
           - statistical uncertainties;
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) uncertainty of estimation of
           discriminated counts;
           (ERR-2,,1.) uncertainties from correction for neutron
           self-shielding and multiple scattering, impurities in
           the samples and the detector response functions;
           (MONIT-ERR) The uncertainty of the 197Au(n,g)198Au
           cross section was 3%.
