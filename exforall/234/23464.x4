           Cs isotopes produced by fission of a nano-structured
           UCx target induced by 1.4-GeV proton beam.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The beam extraction starts 6 ms after the
           propon pulse.
           The Pn value determined as a ratio between the
           population of known states in the grand daughter nuclei
           taking into account the emission probability from the
           daughter.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 3 fast responding plastic scintillator
           detectors for beta-particles detaction.
           3 small-volume conic LaBr3(Ce) detectors to perform
           lifetime measurements of specific nuclear states.
