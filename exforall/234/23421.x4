FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)
           (CHOPF,2FR ILL) At IN4 -two choppers :
            - pyrolytic graphite double curvature focusing
            monochromator,
            - fast Fermi chopper.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP)
           Two state-of-the-art time-of-flight spectrometers:
            IN4 and IN5.
            IN4 :
            Crystal neutron time-of-flight spectrometer,
            vacuum 3 m flight-path box covered with
            a large multi-bank 3He-filled tube detector up to
            120deg scattering angle;
            neutron wavelength 1.1 Angstrom corresponding to a
            kinetic energy Ei = 67.6 meV;
            the energy resolution on the elastic line is
           determined from a measurement on a Vanadium incoherent
           scatterer reference sample as 1.57 meV (half-width).
           the accessible dynamic range measured expands up to the
           energy transfer w = 100 meV and the momentum transfer
           q = 10 1/Angstrom;
           additional measurements with 2.2 Angstrom incident
           neutron wavelength were acquired (Ei = 16.9 meV,
           resolution = 0.28 meV HW).
            IN5:
           direct geometry multichopper neutron time-of-flight
           spectrometer,
           the incident cold neutron beam from a high-intensity
           guide is pulsed and monochromatised through three
           counter rotating chopper pairs;
           30m2 cylindrical 3He-filled position sensitive detector
           mounted 4m away from the sample inside a vacuum
           time-of-flight chamber;
           Incident neutron wavelength 2.5 and 10 Angstrom;
           the energy resolution for 2 Angstrom ( Ei=20 meV
           incident energy) 0.26 meV (half-width),
           dynamic range extends up to the energy transfer 160 meV
           and the momentum transfer q = 5.6 1/Angstrom.
METHOD     (TOF) The TOF spectra measured at various angles
           to obtain the scattering function S(q,w) - dynamic
           structure factor.
           The LAMP software was used to read the IN4 and IN5
           data-sets for the vanadium reference, the empty and
           the water filled sample cell.
SAMPLE     The micropore high-purity water samples were inserted
           in an aluminum flat container with thickness 0.05 and
           0.25mm for light and heavy water, respectively, with
           an indium wire sealing.
           The light water sample scattering was measured at
           T = 285, 290, 294, 301, 311, 323 K.
           The heavy water sample scattering was measured
           at T = 295 and 325 K.
ANALYSIS   The data were normalized to the counting time,
           calibrated on the V reference response, corrected for
           the detector energy-dependent efficiency, for the
           sample flat cell tilted geometry, finally converted
           from the radial angle and time space into the momentum
           and energy space representation to obtain the dynamic
           structure factor S(q,w).
           In the temperature range the dynamic structure factor
           was found not to vary more than by a few per cent, so
           all acquisitions were merged to improve the statistical
           accuracy.The effective temperature is T = 307 +- 14 K
           and T = 310 +- 17 K for light and heavy water,
           respectively.
           MD (molecular dynamics) simulations were performed
           by NAMD 2.7 program with CHARMM27 force field .
           H-O-H angle of 104.52deg and O-H distance 0.957Angstrom
           were used.
           The thermal scattering C-S was derived by integration -
           see formula (8).
