SAMPLE     BE-7 SAMPLE WAS PREPARED FROM 0.1 MICRO-G/MICRO-L
           SOLUTION OF BE-7CL IN DILLUTED HCL. SOLUTION WAS DROP-
           DEPOSITED ONTO A 4 MICRO-M THICK POLICARBON FOIL.
           SAMPLE WAS COVERED BY A VERY THIN POLYVINYL CLORIDE
           FILM IN ORDER TO PREVENT ACTIVITY LOSSES. TOTAL NUMBER
           OF BE-7 ATOMS WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE INTENSITY
           OF 477.6 KEV GAMMA RAYS.

METHOD     DIRECTLY MEASUREMENT OF PROTONS FROM BE-7(N,P) REACTION
DETECTOR   (TELES) TWO SILICON DETECTORS
ERR-ANALYS GIVEN ERROR (STANDARD DEVIATION) WAS DUE TO A
           STATISTICAL ERROR (1%) AND SEVERAL SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
           AMONG WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE UNCERTAINTY IN THE
           NUMBER OF BE-7 ATOMS (5%),UNCERTAINTY IN THE NUMBER OF
           LI-6 ATOMS (5%),UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF MEASURING
           GEOMETRY AND POSSIBLE VARIATION OF NEUTRON FLUX (5%).

           FILTER OF PURE METALLIC SCANDIUM INSERTED INTO THE LEAD
           COLLIMATOR.
COMMENT    AUTHOR'S COMMENT
           THE PROTON SPECTRUM HAD VERY LOW STATISTICS AND IT WAS
           ALMOST STRUCTURE-LESS. THEREFORE ONLY AN UPPER LIMIT OF
           TOTAL REACTION CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED.
