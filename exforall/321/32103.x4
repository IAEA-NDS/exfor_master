SAMPLE     Be-7 sample was prepared from 0.1 micro-g/micro-l
           solution of Be-7Cl in diluted HCl. Solution was drop-
           deposited onto a 4 micro-m thick policarbon foil.
           Sample was covered by a very thin polyvinyl cloride
           film in order to prevent activity losses. Total number
           of Be-7 atoms was determined by measuring the intensity
           of 477.6 keV gamma rays.

INC-SPECT  2 keV neutron beam was obtained using the 600 mm long
           filter of pure metallic scandium inserted into the lead
           collimator.
           The flux of neutrons with 2 keV mean energy and energy
           spread of about 900 eV was (2.4 +- 0.4) x 10**6 /cm2/s
COMMENT    Author's comment
           the proton spectrum had very low statistics and it was
           almost structure-less. Therefore only an upper limit of
           total reaction cross section was determined.
