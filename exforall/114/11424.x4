FACILITY   (SPECC,1USABNL) Crystal spectrometer.
SAMPLE     Two thin Eu203 foils, whose thicknesses were
           approximately 0.009 and 0.016 g/cm2, were used in the
           measurements.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,BF3)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The activity after irradiation was counted by
           a conventional end-window Geiger Mueller counter. The
           relative neutron flux at each energy was determined
           by correcting the spectrum measured with the
           spectrometer counter for the calculated BF3 counter
           efficiency.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay of the induced activity was
           followed as a function of time and the activity at
           the end of the irradiation was calculated on the
           assumption that only a 9.3-hour activity was present.
