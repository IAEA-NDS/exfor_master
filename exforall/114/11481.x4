TITLE      P-31(n,p)Si-31 and Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24 cross sections.
FACILITY   (VDG,1USALAS)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) - Neutron fluxes were measured by
           observing the fission disintegration rate in the U238
           foil and using the known fission cross section for U238
MONIT-REF  (12316011,R.K.Smith+,J,BAP,2,196(K4),1957) - ref. was
                  taken from Allen+,J,PR,107,1363,1957
REL-REF    (M,11571001,L.Allen+,J,PR,107,1363,1957) - Details of
           source and sample arrangement as well as neutron energy
           and flux determinations are given by Allen et al.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) two insertion-type, methane-flow proportional
                   counters
ANALYSIS   The beta activity of identical 0.020 cm thick foils of
           U238 was used as a standard for the counting systems
           throughout the experiment. Sensitivities of the two
           systems for standard foil and sample activities were
           determined so that counting results could be normalized

SAMPLE     A semicircular "2S" aluminum strip of radius 6.65 cm
           was centered about the gas target so that the midpoint
           of the strip was in the forward direction.
           Six adjacent samples, 1.06 cm diam. and 0.165 cm thick,
           at angles up to 50. degr. were used.

SAMPLE     The phosphorus samples, 0.130 g disks and 1.07 cm in
           diam., were punched from a sheet of polyethylene-
           phosphorus mixture (29.5 wt. % (CH2)n, 70.5 wt. % P,
           0.094 cm thick) prepared by the plastics group of
           this laboratory.
           Samples of phosphorus along with sulfur were fastened
           to the outside of an ionization chamber containing a
           U238 fission foil
