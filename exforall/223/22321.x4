FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDUPP) The Gustaf Werner Cyclotron at the
            the Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The targets were 200 - 400 mg/cm2 thick discs
            of enriched Li-7.
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons produced in the 7Li(p,n)
            reaction at zero degrees. About half of the neutrons
            have the quoted energy, with a spread of less than
            2 MeV FWHM, and the rest of the neutrons form a tail
            extending from the maximum energy and down to zero,
            with a virtually flat spectrum shape. The intensity
            was about 1.E+05 - 1.E+06 maximum-energy neutrons per
            second over the entire detector area, corresponding
            to a solid angle of 60 micro-sr.
METHOD     (ABSFY)
           (TOF) The neutron energies were determined by time-of-
            flight techniques. The total time resolution was about
            4 - 5 ns, with a flight path of about 12 m.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Thin-film breakdown counters, which are not
            sensitive to background from spallation reactions,
            were used. The detectors and samples were mounted in
            two nonvacuum fission chambers. The first contained
            Bi-209 and U-238 samples, mounted with 0.3 mm thick
            and 70 mm diameter silicon detectors in close
            geometry. The second chamber contained samples of
            Pb-208, Bi-209 and U-238, mounted together with three
            mosaic detectors, each consisting of 26 sandwiches
            with an area of 1 cm2. The time resolution of each
            detector was about 300 ps, and about 2 ns for a total
            mosaic detector.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments were detected.
SAMPLE     .The large area samples, with a diameter of 70 mm, were
            prepared by vacuum evaporation onto 0.2 mm stainless
            steel backings, using planetary rotation during evapo-
            ration to obtain a good homogeneity. The sample thick-
            ness was about 1.6 mg/cm2 for Bi-209 and 0.1 mg/cm2
            for U-238. The accuracy of the sample thickness was
            about 2%, and the inhomogeneity of the samples
            was less than 2%.
           .The small area samples for the mosaic detectors had
            thicknesses of about 2.4, 4 and 1.2 mg/cm2 for Pb-208,
            Bi-209 and U-238, respectively. The weights of the
            samples were determined to within 2%. The
            Pb-208 sample had an isotopic purity of 98.7%,
            with an admixture of 1% Pb-207 and 0.3% Pb-206.
            The relative abundances of uranium or thorium
            atoms in the Pb and Bi samples were less than 5 ppm.
           .The detectors were calibrated using a mixture of
            natural uranium and several picograms of Cf-252.
CORRECTION .Corrections for anisotropy of fission and linear
            momentum transfer from the incident particle to the
            fissioning nucleus were included when the fission
            cross sections were computed. Some correction factors
            were estimated using proton-induced fission data.
           .The cross sections for neutrons in the full-energy
            peak were obtained by a time-of-flight neutron
            spectrum decomposition procedure. This technique was
            not used at 135 MeV, where instead an interpolation
            from the measurements at the other energies was used.
