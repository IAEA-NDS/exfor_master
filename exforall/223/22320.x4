INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons produced in the 7Li(p,n)
            reaction at zero degrees. About half of the neutrons
            have the quoted energy, with a spread of less than
            2 MeV FWHM, and the rest of the neutrons form a tail
            extending from the maximum energy and down to zero,
            with a virtually flat spectrum shape. The intensity
            was about 100 000 maximum-energy neutrons per second
            over the entire detector area. Time-of-flight
            techniques allowed separation of maximum-energy and
            tail neutron events for the 160 MeV data.
METHOD     (ABSFY,TOF)
DETECTOR   (TRD) Thin film breakdown counters were placed close
            to the fissile targets in the neutron beam.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments were detected.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
            180 degree n-p scattering (i.e. the H(n,p) reaction
            at zero degrees) was measured simultaneously for the
            160 MeV data, using the magnetic spectrometer lisa.
MONIT-REF  (22277002,T.E.O.Ericson+,J,PRL,75,1046,1995)
SAMPLE     .The samples were prepared by vacuum evaporation onto
            a 0.2 mm stainless steel backing using planetary
            rotation during evaporation to obtain a good homo-
            geneity. The samples were 80 mm in diameter, and had
            thicknesses of 1.6 and 0.1 mg per cm2 for Bi-209 and
            U-238, respectively. The accuracy of the sample
            thickness was about 2%, and the inhomogeneity
            of the samples was less than 2%. It was found
            that the relative abundance of heavy fissile
            admixtures (like uranium) in the bismuth sample was
            less than 5 ppm.
CORRECTION .Corrections for anisotropy of fission and linear
            momentum transfer from the incident particle to the
            fissioning nucleus were included when the fission
            cross sections were computed. Some correction factors
            were estimated using proton-induced fission data.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
           (ERR-1) The uncertainties are due to neutron
                   fluxes (about 8%),
           (ERR-2) detector calibration (3%),
           (ERR-3,1.,2.) target thickness (1-2%),
           (ERR-S,3.,5.) counting statistics (3-5%)
            and an uncertainty of the relation of
            fission events induced by neutrons from the high
            energy peak in contrast to the low-energy tail of the
            neutron spectrum. The uncertainty is much larger for
            the 135 MeV data because no monitor was available,
            and hence the fluxes are less accurate.
STATUS     (PRELM) Data are preliminary.
