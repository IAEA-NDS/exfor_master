            The experimental ratios were converted into absolute
            cross sections by means of the gold cross section of
            Macklin (priv.comm.), after normalization by a factor
            of 0.989 to the absolute value of Ratynski et. al.
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path is not given
FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)  3.75 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
             pulse width is apprx. 1 ns, repetition rate 250 kHz,
             average beam current 1.5-2 microAmperes
DETECTOR   (D4PI,SCIN) Karlsruhe 4Pi barium fluoride detector for
             detection of capture gamma-rays. Detector consists
             of 42 hexagonal and pentagonal crystals forming a
             spherical shell of Ba-F2 with 10 cm inner radius
             and 15 cm thickness. Resolution of energy is 7%
             at 2.5 MeV, time resolution 500 picosec, peak effi-
             ciency 90% at 1 MeV, capture events registration
             probability is 95%.
ANALYSIS   .Special data-processing system was devised - the so-
            called adc-system - which allows to increase the ac-
            curacy of the measurements
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Water-cooled metallic Li target of about
                   0.5 mg/cm2 thickness on 0.2 mm thick copper
                   backing.
INC-SPECT  .Proton  energy is 30 and 100 keV above the reaction
            threshold 1.881 MeV giving continuous neutron energy
            distribution in energy ranges 3-100 and 3-200 keV
SAMPLE     .Common samples - all cylindrical with 15 mm diameter
           -two metallic gold samples of 0.26 and 0.4 mm thick-
            ness, (1.5067E-03 and 2.2474E-03 atoms/b), 870.8 and
            1.2989 gram mass canned in C-H2 polyethylene foils
            5.4 and 7.2 mg weight
           -graphite sample 4.0 mm (34.320E-03 atoms/b)thickness,
            1.2096 g mass -
            were present in all measurements' runs
CORRECTION .Corrections were made on isotopic composition of the
            samples, number of unobserved events, multiple scat-
            tering and self-shielding, scattering on samples'
            impurities

ANALYSIS   .Maxwellian-averaged cross-sections were calculated
            for energy interval 0-700 keV by dividing it into
            three parts according cross-section's sources.
            Cross sect. for 0-3 keV was calculated with the help
            of statistical theory adjusted to present measurements
            Cross sect. for 3-225 keV is taken from present data.
            Cross sect. - for 225-700 keV was taken from Joint
            Evaluated File - JEF.
