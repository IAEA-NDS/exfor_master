ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties are quoted
            assuming that they are inversely proportional to the
            fraction of neutrons interacting in the sample, A=1-T,
            where T is transmission. Compared to that effect,
            statistical uncertainties can be neglected.
            The oxygen cross section was adopted from the JEF
