METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path is 11 m
ANALYSIS    PUlse-height analysis providing discrimination of
            fission events from background pulses
DETECTOR   (FISCH) .Fission chamber
           (SCIN)  .NE123 liquid scintillator for measuring tof
                    spectra and relative neutron fluence

                    measurements
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) .3 mm thicK Li-7 target struck by protons at
                    500 ns intervals, pulse width is 2+-1 ns
CORRECTION .Corrections were made for fission fragments self-
            absorption - 0.957, for fission events lost below
            pulse-height threshold - 0.978, for neutron scatt.
            in the fission-chamber structural components - 1.016.

SAMPLE     .Sample placed in fission chamber contains eleven
            plates having 86-mm diameter. Five of these are
            platinum and bare painted deposits of U-238 on both
            sides. Six remaining are of tantalum and serve
            as the ion chamber's collectors.
           .Interelectrode spacing is 5 mm. U-238 deposits cover
            a circular area 76 mm in diameter and has 436 mg/cm**2
            thickness
STATUS     (SPSDD,23078002) In 23078002- data re-analyzed.
