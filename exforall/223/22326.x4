TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF
            TC-99.

           (2JPNJAE) H.H., S.N.
           (2JPNYOK) RIKKYO UNIVERSITY, EXPERIMENTAL SITE.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNYOK) THE RIKKYO UNIVERSITY REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRONS FROM REACTOR. IRRADIATIONS WERE PER-
            FORMED BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT CD SHIELDS.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
            THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS MEASURED USING THE CD-RATI
            METHOD.
           .CO/AL AND AU/AL ALLOYS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE
            NEUTRON FLUX AND THE WESTCOTT EPITHERMAL INDEX. THE
            NEUTRON FLUX WAS FOUND TO BE 4.62E+11 +/- 0.08E+11
            NEUTRONS/CM2/SEC, AND THE EPITHERMAL INDEX 0.033.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAY ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED
            WITH A HPGE DETECTOR OF 90 PERCENT EFFICIENCY COMBINE
            WITH FAST ELECTRONICS.
PART-DET   (DG)    540 AND 591 KEV GAMMA-RAYS FROM TC-100.
SAMPLE     .THE FOUR TARGETS EACH CONTAINED ABOUT 370 KBQ OF
            TC-99. THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OF THE TC-99 WAS TARGET
            SOLUTION WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE SPECIFIC
            BETA-ACTIVITY BY THE LIQUID SCINTILLATION COUNTING
            METHOD, AND WAS FOUND TO BE 461 KBQ/G.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS.
