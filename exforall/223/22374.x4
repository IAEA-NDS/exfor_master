ANALYSIS   .Maxwellian-averaged cross-sections were calculated
            for energy interval 0-700 keV by dividing it into
            three parts according cross-section's sources.
            * Cross sect. for 0-3 keV were determined in two
            different ways. Statistical model calculations were
            performed and the parameters were adjusted so that
            the calculated cross sections fitted the data of the
            present experiment at energies above 3 keV and the
            data that were calculated from resonance parameters
            (see REL-REF) at low energies. In the second
            calculation the cross sections of the joint evaluated
            file (JEF, see REL-REF) which were averaged in the
            energy range from 0 to 10 keV in 0.5 keV wide bins.
            These data were normalized to the present experiment
            in the overlap region from 3 to 10 keV. The final
            data are the averages of the two calculations.
            * Cross sect. for 3-225 keV is taken from present data
            The chosen energy bins are fine enough to neglect the
            correlated systematic uncertainties that may result
            from a coarse energy grid.
            * The energy interval from 225 to 700 keV, which
            contributes only very little to the Maxwellian average
            at typical s-process temperatures, was covered by
            again normalizing the JEF data to the present
            experiment in the energy interval from 100 to 200 keV.

            for energy interval 0-700 keV by dividing it into
            three parts according cross-section's sources.
            * Cross sect. for 0-3 keV were determined in two
            different ways. Statistical model calculations were
            performed and the parameters were adjusted so that
            the calculated cross sections fitted the data of the
            present experiment at energies above 3 keV and the
            data that were calculated from resonance parameters
            (see REL-REF) at low energies. In the second
            calculation the cross sections of the joint evaluated
            file (JEF, see REL-REF) which were averaged in the
            energy range from 0 to 10 keV in 0.5 keV wide bins.
            These data were normalized to the present experiment
            in the overlap region from 3 to 10 keV. The final
            data are the averages of the two calculations.
            * Cross sect. for 3-225 keV is taken from present data
            The chosen energy bins are fine enough to neglect the
            correlated systematic uncertainties that may result
            from a coarse energy grid.
            * The energy interval from 225 to 700 keV, which
            contributes only very little to the Maxwellian average
            at typical s-process temperatures, was covered by
            again normalizing the JEF data to the present
            experiment in the energy interval from 100 to 200 keV.

            different ways. Statistical model calculations were
            performed and the parameters were adjusted so that
            the calculated cross sections fitted the data of the
            present experiment at energies above 3 keV and the
            data that were calculated from resonance parameters
            (see REL-REF) at low energies. In the second
            calculation the cross sections of the joint evaluated
            file (JEF, see REL-REF) which were averaged in the
            energy range from 0 to 10 keV in 0.5 keV wide bins.
            These data were normalized to the present experiment
            in the overlap region from 3 to 10 keV. The final
            data are the averages of the two calculations.
            * Cross sect. for 3-225 keV is taken from present data
            The chosen energy bins are fine enough to neglect the
            correlated systematic uncertainties that may result
            from a coarse energy grid.
            * The energy interval from 225 to 700 keV, which
            contributes only very little to the Maxwellian average
            at typical s-process temperatures, was covered by
            again normalizing the JEF data to the present
            experiment in the energy interval from 100 to 200 keV.
