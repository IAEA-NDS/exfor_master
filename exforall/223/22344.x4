INC-SOURCE (THCOL).Thermal deuterium column of 1.4 m in length
INC-SPECT  .Neutron spectrum was measured by TOF technique and
            may be well approximated by a Maxwellian one with
            temperature 353 deg Kelvin (60 deg Celsius).
            cadmium ratio is more than 5000
SAMPLE     .Americium solution was purified by anion-exchange
            method and then electrolysed on a stainless steel disk
            28 mm in diameter and 0.2 mm thickness, radioactive
            area being 20 mm in diam. After electrodeposition
            the sample was sintered with a gas burner to fix
            the americium layer on the disk by making americium
            oxide. Isotopic composition of Am-241 was estimated
            as being better than 99.9%. The number of Am-241
            atoms is (1.734+-0.020) x 10**16
            .highly enriched U-235 sample was prepared by the
            electrodeposition method. Number of U-235 atoms was
            determined to be (3.286+-0.036) x 10**17.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Back-to-back type fission chamber with Am-241
                   and U-235 deposits consisting of two identical
            parallel-plate ionization chambers made of aluminium
            and filled to 1 atm by 97% argon and 3% N2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total error consisting of standard U-235 Cs
                    error and errors given below
           (ERR-S,0.04,0.4)  statistical error
           (ERR-1)  error of assigning to Am-241 of the number
                    of fission counts
           (ERR-2)  error of assigning to U-235  of the number
                    of fission counts
           (ERR-3)  error Am-241 g-factor
           (ERR-4)  error U-235  g-factor
           (ERR-5)  error of Am-241 atoms in the sample
           (ERR-6)  error of U-235  atoms in the sample
           (ERR-7)  error of assigned setting positions of Am-241
                    and U-235 layers in the fission chamber
