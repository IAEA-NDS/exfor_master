MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (THCOL).THERMAL DEUTERIUM COLUMN OF 1.4 M IN LENGTH
INC-SPECT  .NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY TOF TECHNIQUE AND
            MAY BE WELL APPROXIMATED BY A Maxwellian ONE WITH
            TEMPERATURE 353 DEG KELVIN (60 DEG CELSIUM).
            CADMIUM RATIO IS MORE THAN 5000
SAMPLE     .AMERITIUM SOLUTION WAS PURIFIED BY ANION-EXCHANGE
            METHOD AND THEN ELECTROLYSED ON A STAINLESS STEEL
            DISK 28 MM IN DIAMETER AND 0.2 MM THICKNESS, RADIO-
            ACTIVE AREA BEING 20 MM. AFTER ELECTRODEPOSITION
            THE SAMPLE WAS SINTERED WITH A GAS BURNER TO FIX
            THE AMERITIUM LAYER ON THE DISK BY MAKING AERITIUM
            OXIDE. ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF AM-241 WAS ESTIMATED
            AS BEING BETTER THAN 99.9 PC. THE NUMBER OF AM-241
            ATOMS IS (1.734+-0.020)E+16'
            .HIGHLY ENRICHED U-235 SAMPLE WAS PREPARED BY THE
            ELECTRODEPOSITION METHOD. NUMBER OF U-235 ATOMS WAS
            DETERMINED TO BE (3.286+-0.036)E+17.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) BACK-TO-BACK TYPE FISSION CHAMBER WITH AM-241
                   AND U-235 DEPOSITS CONSISTING OF TWO IDENTICAL
            PARALLEL-PLATE IONIZATION CHAMBERS MADE OF ALUMINIUM
            AND FILLED TO 1 ATM BY 97 PC ARGON AND 3 PC N2.
