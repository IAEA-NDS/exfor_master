TITLE      -Measurement of the Cross Section For
            Rh-103(N,N')Rh-103M in the Energy Range 6-12 MeV.

INSTITUTE  (2AUSIRK) M.M.M.,H.V.
           (2GERPTB) W.M.,D.S.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERPTB) The Variable Energy Compact
            Cyclotron Cv-28 at Ptb Braunschweig, Germany.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
INC-SPECT  .Monoenergetic Neutrons from the D(D,N) Reaction.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation Where the K Shell X-Rays of
            Rh-103M were Measured.
DETECTOR   (SILI) Si(LI) X-Ray Detector, Area 200 Mm2, be
            Window Thickness 0.05 mm. The Detector Efficiency
            Was Calibrated by X-Ray Point Sources of Cd-109
            And Nb-93M.
PART-DET   (G) Gamma Rays from Decay of a Metastable State.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The Rh Sample was
            Located at the Entrance of a Fission Chamber
            During the Activation. Induced Fission of U-238
            Inside the Fission Chamber was Used to Monitor
            The Neutron Fluence.
SAMPLE     .Discs of Rh-103, Diameter 10 mm, Thickness 0.125
            Mm, Purity 99.99 Percent.
CORRECTION .Correction For the Variation of Efficiency For an
            Extended Source and For Self-Absorption in the
            Samples. Corrections For Horizontal Extrapolation
            From the Bias Level to the Zero Pulse Height was
            Applied For the Recorded Fission Fragments.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The Main Sources of Uncertainty
            Comes from Counting Statistics, the Reference
            Cross Section, Emission Probability For Kx-Rays,
            And Corrections For Break-Up Neutrons and Fission
            Fragments.
STATUS     .Data Taken from Main Reference.
