FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) THE ILL HIGH-FLUX REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRONS. THE SAMPLE WAS IRRADIATED WITH A
            THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX OF 5E+8 NEUTRONS/CM2/SEC.
METHOD     .PROTONS WERE MEASURED DIRECTLY WITH SI SURFACE BARRIER
            DETECTORS.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) IN A FIRST CASE, A SINGLE SI SURFACE BARRIER
            DETECTORS, THICKNESSES 100 MICRONS, ACTIVE AREA 450
            MM2, RESOLUTION 20 KEV FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS, WAS USED.
            IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT, A TWO-DETECTOR TELESCOPE WAS
            USED, CONSISTING OF A FULLY DEPLETED DELTA-E DETECTOR,
            THICKNESS 15.6 MICRONS, ACTIVE AREA 200 MM2,
            RESOLUTION 20 KEV FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS, AND A STOP
            DETECTOR, 100 MICRONS THICK, ACTIVE AREA 450 MM2,
            RESOLUTION 20 KEV FOR 5.5 MEV ALPHAS.
