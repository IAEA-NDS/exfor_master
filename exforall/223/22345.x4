FACILITY   (VDG) Supposed proton Van-de-Graaff, protons energies
               were adjusted to 1.955, 2.13 and 2.48 MeV in order
               to produce neutrons in energy ranges from 10 keV
               to 600 keV. Experiment was carried out at the RLNR-
               research lab. for nuclear reactors
METHOD     (TOF)   .Time-of-flight method was used for neutron
                    energy determination
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  .Li-6 glass scintillation detector for neutron
                    beam monitoring
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) .Neutrons were produced in the energy ranges
                   10-75, 30-250 and 450-600 KeV. 1.5 ns pulsed
                   neutron beam was used
