            TRANSMUTATION AND NUCLEOSYNTHESIS.
AUTHOR     (M.IGASHIRA,K.MASUDA,Y.NAGAI,H.KITAZAWA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNTIT)
FACILITY   (VDG) THE 3-MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR OF THE RESEARCH
            LABORATORY FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS AT THE TOKYO
            INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
INC-SPECT  .MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS PRODUCED IN THE LI-7(P,N)
            REACTION.
METHOD     (GSPEC) CAPTURE GAMMA RAYS WERE DETECTED AT 125
            DEGREES WITH A NAI(TL) CRYSTAL DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE MAIN DETECTOR IS 15.2 CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 20.3 CM LONG. IT IS SURROUNDED BY A HOLLOW
            ANTICOMPTON SHIELD, 33.0 CM IN DIAMETER AND 35.6
            CM LONG.
           (SCIN) RELATIVE MONITORING WAS ACHIEVED USING A
            LI-6 GLASS SCINTILLATION COUNTER.
PART-DET   (G    )
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE DISKS WITH A DIAMETER OF 9 OR 2
            CM, WITH THICKNESSES OF 0.2 TO 3.0 CM. THESE WERE
            LOCATED 15.6 OR 11.8 CM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE
            AT AN ANGLE OF ZERO DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE
            INCOMING PROTON BEAM.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING
            OF NEUTRONS AND GAMMA ABSORPTION IN THE SAMPLE,
            AND FOR THE DEPENDENCE OF THE GAMMA-RAY DETECTION
            EFFICIENCY ON THE GAMMA-RAY SOURCE POSITION IN
            THE SAMPLE.
