TITLE      -Measurement of the Co-59(N,alpha)Mn-56,
            Co-59(N,P)Fe-59 and Co-59(N,2N)Co-58m+g cross
            sections.
AUTHOR     (W.Mannhart,D.Schmidt,X.Haihong)
INSTITUTE  (2GERPTB)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERPTB) The compact cyclotron CV-28 at PTB,
            Braunschweig, Germany.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuterium gas cell was 3 cm long
            with a gas pressure of 0.2 MPa.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron energy was determined by time-of-flight
            measurements. The mean neutron energy was obtained to
            within +- 20 keV and the energy resolution varied
            between 134 keV at 8.1 MeV and 106 keV at 14.3 MeV.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The cobalt samples were attached to the
            entrance window of a low-mass fission chamber
            and were irradiated at zero degrees at a distance
            of 6 cm from the gas target. The activity of the
            irradiated samples was measured with a hpge
            detector.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 300 cm3 hpge detector was used.
PART-DET   (G)
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)  With data from ENDF/B.
SAMPLE     .Metallic cobalt samples, 1 mm thick and 10 mm in
            diameter.
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for the sample geometry,
            photon attenuation and losses due to coincidence
            summing.
            For "gas-out" effect and breakup neutrons.

           Subent 002 SF4: CO-58-G, -> CO-58, according to
           authors' comment on page 285 in C,94GATLIN,,285,1994:
           Co-58 activity was measured after the complete decay
           of the isomeric state Co-58m ( 9.15 h), which entirely
           decays to the ground state.
