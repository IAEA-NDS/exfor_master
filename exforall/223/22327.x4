TITLE      -Measurement of the Co-59(N,alpha)Mn-56,

INSTITUTE  (2GERPTB)
FACILITY   (CYCLO) The compact cyclotron cv-28 at ptb,
            braunschweig, germany.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuterium gas cell was 3 cm long
            with a gas pressure of 0.2 mpa.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron energy was determined by time-of-flight
            measurements. The mean neutron energy was obtained to
            within +- 20 KeV and the energy resolution varied
            between 134 KeV at 8.1 MeV and 106 KeV at 14.3 MeV.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The cobalt samples were attached to the
            entrance window of a low-mass fission chamber
            and were irradiated at zero degrees at a distance
            of 6 cm from the gas target. The activity of the
            irradiated samples was measured with a hpge
            detector.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 300 cm3 hpge detector was used.
PART-DET   (G)
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)  With data from ENDF/B.
SAMPLE     .Metallic cobalt samples, 1 mm thick and 10 mm in
            diameter.
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for the sample geometry,
            photon attenuation and losses due to coincidence
            summing.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors not specified
STATUS     .Taken from main reference.
