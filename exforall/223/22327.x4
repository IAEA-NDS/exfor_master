INSTITUTE  (2GERPTB)
FACILITY   (CYCLO) THE COMPACT CYCLOTRON CV-28 AT PTB,
            BRAUNSCHWEIG, GERMANY.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) THE DEUTERIUM GAS CELL WAS 3 CM LONG
            WITH A GAS PRESSURE OF 0.2 MPA.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            MEASUREMENTS. THE MEAN NEUTRON ENERGY WAS OBTAINED TO
            WITHIN +- 20 KEV AND THE ENERGY RESOLUTION VARIED
            BETWEEN 134 KEV AT 8.1 MEV AND 106 KEV AT 14.3 MEV.
METHOD     (GSPEC) THE COBALT SAMPLES WERE ATTACHED TO THE
            ENTRANCE WINDOW OF A LOW-MASS FISSION CHAMBER
            AND WERE IRRADIATED AT ZERO DEGREES AT A DISTANCE
            OF 6 CM FROM THE GAS TARGET. THE ACTIVITY OF THE
            IRRADIATED SAMPLES WAS MEASURED WITH A HPGE
            DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 300 CM3 HPGE DETECTOR WAS USED.
PART-DET   (G    )
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)  WITH DATA FROM ENDF/B.
SAMPLE     .METALLIC COBALT SAMPLES, 1 MM THICK AND 10 MM IN
            DIAMETER.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR THE SAMPLE GEOMETRY,
            PHOTON ATTENUATION AND LOSSES DUE TO COINCIDENCE
            SUMMING.
