INC-SOURCE (P-D  ) POLARIZED NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING
            A LIQUID DEUTERIUM TARGET WITH POLARIZED PROTONS. THE
            TWO FINAL-STATE PROTONS ARE LEFT IN A QUASI-BOUND 1S0-
            STATE. THE PROTON BEAM CURRENT WAS TYPICALLY 2 MICRO-
            AMPS, GIVING A FLUX OF 5.0E+07 NEUTRONS/SEC ON THE
            TARGET
           (POLNS) THE POLARIZATION OF THE PROTON BEAM WAS 71 PER
            CENT, AND THAT OF THE NEUTRONS ABOUT 29 PER CENT. THE
            POLARIZATION WAS FLIPPED EVERY FEW SECONDS. THE POLA-
            RIZATION OF THE PROTON BEAM WAS MONITORED WITH A PC
            ELASTIC SCATTERING POLARIMETER.
INC-SPECT  .QUASIMONOENERGETIC NEUTRON SPECTRUM ARE EXTRACTED AT 0
            DEGREES. THE NEUTRON BEAM SPOT WAS DEFINED TO A DIA-
            METER OF 18 CM BY A BRASS COLLIMATOR.
METHOD     (COINC) THE RECOIL DEUTERON AND CAPTURE GAMMA RAY WERE
            DETECTED IN COINCIDENCE.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) THE RECOILING DEUTERONS WERE DETECTED IN AN
            ACTIVE TARGET CONSISTING OF SIX PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR
            BARS OF BC400, FORMING A BLOCK OF 20 BY 50 BY 12 CM3.
            THE BLOCK WAS LOCATED 2.5 M FROM THE COLLIMATOR EXIT,
            AND WAS TILTED BY 35 DEGREES. THE INDIVIDUAL BARS WERE
            READ OUT BY FAST 3 INCH PM TUBES.
           (NAICR) THREE PAIRS OF 20 CM DIAMETER BY 20 CM LONG
            NAI(TL) CRYSTALS, PLACED SYMMETRICALLY LEFT AND RIGHT
            OF THE TARGET AT A DISTANCE OF 52 CM, SERVED TO DETECT
            THE EMITTED CAPTURE GAMMA RAY. WITH 8 CM THICK LEAD
            COLLIMATORS, THE EFFECTIVE SOLID ANGLE WAS REDUCED TO
            73 MSR.

SAMPLE     .THE SCINTILLATOR USED FOR DEUTERON DETECTION WAS ALSO
            USED AS AN ACTIVE HYDROGEN TARGET, HAVING A THICKNESS
            OF 1.3 GRAMS OF HYDROGEN PER CM2.
