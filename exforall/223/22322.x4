TITLE      -PECULIARITIES FOUND BY USING DIFFERENT COUNTING GASES
            FOR CF-252 SPONTANEUOUS FISSION.

METHOD     (EDE  )
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) A TWIN FRISCH GRIDDED IONIZATION CHAMBER WAS
            USED. THE DISTANCE CATHODE - GRID WAS 46 MM AND THE
            DISTANCE GRID - ANODE WAS 12 MM. THESE DIMENSIONS WERE
            ADAPTED IN VIEW OF A WORKING PRESSURE OF 0.6E+05 PA.
            BOTH CH4 GAS AND A MIXTURE OF 90 PERCENT ARGON AND
            10 PERCENT CH4 WERE USED AS COUNTER GASES, WITH N55
            QUALITY AT PRESSURES OF 0.6E+05 PA AND 1.2E+05 PA. AT
            THE LOWER PRESSURE NO ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION USING ALPHA
            PARTICLES FROM CF-252 COULD BE PERFORMED. THE VOLTAGES
            APPLIED TO THE CHAMBER PLATES WERE -2.5 KV ON THE
            CATHODE AND +2.1 KV ON THE ANODE FOR BOTH COUNTER
            GASES AT 0.6E+05 PA. FOR THE 1.2E+05 PA PRESSURE THE
            VOLTAGES WERE -2.5 KV ON THE CATHODE AND +2.1 KV ON
            THE ANODE FOR THE GAS MIXTURE, AND -2.5 KV ON THE
            CATHODE AND +2.1 KV ON THE ANODE AND -4.7 KV ON THE
            CATHODE AND +4.0 KV ON THE ANODE FOR CH4.
PART-DET   (FF   )
SAMPLE     .THE CF-252 SAMPLE WAS MOUNTED ON A 0.12 MG/CM2 NICKEL
            BACKING IN THE CENTER OF THE COMMON CATHODE.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR ELECTRONIC INSTABILITIES
            AND DIFFERENT CALIBRATION FACTORS BETWEEN THE FOUR
            ELECTRONIC CHAINS. THE FRISCH GRID INEFFICIENCY WAS
            ALSO TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THE ANGLE-DEPENDENT ENERGY
            LOSS IN THE SAMPLE AND BACKING WAS EXPERIMENTALLY
            DETERMINED AND INCORPORATED IN THE ANALYSIS. MASS
            DEPENDENT CORRECTIONS FOR THE PULSE HEIGHT DEFECT,
            PHD, WERE APPLIED.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)
COMMENT    .THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION OF HOW THE DETERMINED
            QUANTITIES DEPEND ON THE CHOICE OF COUNTING GAS. IT
            WAS FOUND THAT THE MIXTURE 90 PERCENT ARGON AND
            10 PERCENT CH4 GAVE THE MOST RELIABLE RESULTS.
