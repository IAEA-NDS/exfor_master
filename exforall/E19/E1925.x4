SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is 99%.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is about 40 mg/cm**2.
           - Target is self supported.

                   al., Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A506(2003)35].
                   Efficiency was about 2.0e-4 and effective
                   analyzing power was -0.43+-0.02 at a proton
                   energy of 22 MeV.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic error of proton
                     polarization (=asymmetry / effective
                     analyzing power) includes those of asymmetry
                     and effective analyzing power. Error in the
                     asymmetry includes (1) the effect of the
                     anisotropic angular distribution of emitted
                     protons, (2) the uncertainty in the
                     scattering angle and solid angle due to a
                     horizontal shift of the proton focal spot in
                     polarimeter. Error in the effective
                     analyzing power includes same errors as
                     asymmetry as well as the systematic error of
                     polarization used to derive effective
                     analyzing power of polarimeter.
