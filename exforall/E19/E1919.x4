INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 5E12 PPS.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 0.280 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing is carbon. Additional 10 micro-gram/cm**2
             carbon layer also evaporated on the target to
             protect the target from sputtering
           - Backing-thickness is 0.03 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF) To obtain information on masses of heavy
                 products
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNIPC) RIKEN linear accelerator (RILAC)
DETECTOR   - Solid angle of detector is 12.2 msr.(Acceptance of
             GARIS system)
           - Detector resolution: Energy resolution obtained by
             summing the energy-loss signal from the stop
             detector and the residual energy from the side
             detector was typically 70 eV for alpha particles.
           (MAGSP) Gass-filled recoil ion separator (GARIS)
           (MCPLT) To obtain ToF signals for reaction products
                   and used to distinguish decay events in the
                   PSD and the implantation events
           (SI) To measure energy of reaction products (PSD)
           (SI) To detect decay alpha-particles escaping from PSD
