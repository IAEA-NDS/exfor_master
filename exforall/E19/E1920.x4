INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 2.4e12 PPS.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 0.45 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing is carbon. Additional 10 micro-gram/cm**2
             carbon layer also evaporated on the target to
             protect the target from sputtering
           - Backing-thickness is 0.03 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF) To obtain information on masses of heavy
                 products

DETECTOR   Detector resolution: Energy resolution for decay
           alphas measured only by PSD was 39 keV (FWHM), while
           that for those measured as sum of PSD and SSD was 66
           keV (FWHM).
           (MAGSP) Gas-filled recoil ion separator (GARIS)
           (MCPLT) To obtain ToF signals for reaction products
