DECAY-DATA (110-DS-271,,A)
           9.9 to 10.8 MeV alphas with T1/2=1.63+0.44-0.29 msec
            (g.s.) and 69+56-21 msec (isomer) measured. These
           values are obtained by combining two results from
           RIKEN and GSI.
           (108-HS-267,,A)
           9.6 to 10.0 MeV alphas with T1/2=52+13-8 msec (g.s.)
           and 0.80+3.8-0.37 sec (isomer) measured. These value
           is obtained by combining two results from RIKEN and
           GSI.
           (106-SG-263,,A) 8.5 to 9.4 MeV alphas measured
           (104-RF-259,,A) 5.9 to 9.0 MeV alphas measured
           (102-NO-255,,A) 7.7 to 8.1 MeV alphas measured
INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 5E12 PPS.
SAMPLE     - Target enrichment is 98.4%.
           - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness is 0.19 to 0.27 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing is carbon. Additional 10 micro-gram/cm**2
             carbon layer also evaporated on the target to
             protect the target from sputtering
           - Backing-thickness is 0.03 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF) To obtain information on masses of heavy
                 products

DETECTOR   - Detector resolution: Energy resolution for decay
             alphas measured only by PSD was 70 keV (FWHM), while
             that for those measured as sum of PSD and SSD was
             140 keV (FWHM).
           - Efficiency: Efficiency of detection system is
             0.80+-0.15.
