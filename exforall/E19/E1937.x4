INC-SOURCE Beam intensity is about 250000 PPS.
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is element.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target-thickness: 100 micro-meter
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)

                           fragmentation of 70 MeV/nucleon 13C

                            241Am alpha source.
           (PPAC) To measure TOF of productions
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Due to basically the record of the number of
                     incident particles and the determination of
                     the effective detection area of the
                     telescopes (-20%)
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
COMMENT    By author: To confirm the origin of the 10,11Be
           isotopes further, the relation between the angle and
           energy of each isotope has been checked. It is found
           that the results are consistent with the two-body
           transfer kinematics within the limit of the energy and
           angular resolution of the detection system. The 11Be
           events could be checked more carefully by the
           coincident relationship.
