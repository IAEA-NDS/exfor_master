TITLE      Short lived fission products yield measurement for
           239Pu(nth, f)

FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) 35 kW Miniature Neutron Source Reactor.
SAMPLE     (94-PU-239,ENR=0.758) Liquid sample are included 239Pu,
            238Pu and 240Pu, and the mass abundances are 75.8%,
           23.4% and 0.8%, respectively. Due to small fission
           cross sections, the effects of 238-Pu and 240-Pu in
           sample is small.
METHOD     (RELFY,GSPEC) Relative measurements of fission
           products 88Rb, 95Y, 101Mo, 101Tc 138Cs and 142La at
           thermal neutron induced.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
            1) The volume of HPGe detector is 110 cm3.
            2) The relative efficiency is around 40%.
MONITOR    (94-PU-239(N,F)40-ZR-97,CUM,FY)
ANALYSIS   Decay gamma spectrum area was determined with SPAN
           code, and fission yield was calculated by FYAUTOLS
           code.
CORRECTION To subtract the contamination from interfere nuclides,
           the half-life analysis method was adopted.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measurement mainly due to
           monitor data, gamma counting statistics. Uncertainty
           due to decay data is excluded.
           (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty of the reference nuclei
           fission yield of 97Zr.
           (ERR-1,,2.0) Uncertainty of efficiency of HPGe is less
           than 2.0%.
