FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 6 gram of high purity Ho2O3 powder(natural
           isotopic composition) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and
           a pellet, around 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter
           was obtained. Monitor foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm
           thick) of the same diameter as the pellets were then
           attached in front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources, which were Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) During irradiation, the neutron flux was
           monitored by a Au-Si surface barrier detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
           60 min with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10 n/s. The
           groups of samples were placed at 0deg. or 135deg.
           angles relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Mo target at distances of around 4 cm.
           The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in 135 degree
           that accompanied the alpha-particle tube was at a
           distance of 110 cm from the target as neutron flux
           monitor.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy of 136 keV
           and beam current of 280 uA were used to produce
           neutrons. And the tritium-Molybdenum (T-Mo) target
           used in the generator was 0.566 mg/cm2 thick.

CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for gamma-ray
           attenuations and fluctuation of neutron flux. The
           data for Ho-165(n,2n)Ho-164m reaction cross sections
           are corrected for the contribution from Ho-165(n,p)Dy-
           165 which 94.7 keV gamma line contributes to the
           94.0 keV gamma line.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data are taken from
           Table 3 at page 014604-4 in J,PR/C,89,014604,2014.
