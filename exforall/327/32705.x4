INSTITUTE  (3CPRLNZ)
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRNPC) The K-400 Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     Two samples (ThO2 powder of 99.95% purity) and monitor
           aluminum (thin Al foil of 99.99% purity) were made
           into round disks with a diameter of 2.0 cm; the
           thickness of samples was 1.0 mm and 1.3 mm, and the
           thickness of Ni and Zr was 0.3-0.5 mm.
           The samples were placed at 50-135 deg. angle relative
           to the deuteron beam direction and centered about the
           target at distances of 3.5 cm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A deuteron beam of 220 keV and beam current of
           350 mA used. The solid tritium-titanium target used
           in the neutron generator was about 2.18 mg/cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A calibrated GEM-60P coaxial HPGe detector were
           used with 70.1x72.3 mm in diameter and length. And the
           relative efficiency is around 68%, and the energy
           resolution is around 1.7 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990)
           The cross section of monitor reaction was determined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Detector efficiency at 5.5 cm (~2%)
CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption in
           the sample, for coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays, and for geometry correction factor.
