FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 7 gram of ruthenium powder of natural isotopic
           composition (99.99 % pure) was pressed as a pellet at
           10 ton/cm2, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter.
           Monitor foils of Nb (99.99% pure, 0.2 mm thick) and
           Al (99.999% pure, 0.04 mm thick) of the same diameter
           as the pellets were then attached in front and at the
           back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources such as Na-24, Nb-92m, Tc-101, Mo-101.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted 128 min
           with a yield around 4E10 to 5E10 n/s, and cooled for
           5-10 min. The groups of samples were placed at 0deg.,
           90deg. or 135deg. angles relative to the beam
           direction and centered about the T-Ti target at
           distances of around 4 cm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy of 134 keV
           and beam current of 230 uA were used to produce
           neutrons. And the tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used
           in the generator was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of cross section result
           from counting statistics, standard cross sections
           uncertainties, detector efficiency, weight of samples,
           self-absorption of gamma-rays and the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays, the uncertainties of
           irradiation, cooling and measuring times. And some
           other errors contribution form the parameters of the
           measured nuclei and standard nuclei, such as,
           uncertainties of the branching ratio of the
           characteristic gamma rays, uncertainties of the half
           life of the radioactive product nuclei and so on all
           are considered.
           (ERR-S,0.1,15.) Counting statistics (0.1-15%)
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) Detector efficiency (2-3%)
           (ERR-2) Weight of samples (0.1%)
           (ERR-3) Self-absorption of gamma-ray (0.5%)
           (ERR-4,0.,5.) The coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays (0-5%)
           (ERR-5,0.1,1.0) The uncertainties of irradiation,
           cooling and measuring times (0.1-1.0%)
CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for gamma-ray
           attenuations, random coincidence (pile-up), dead time
           and fluctuation of neutron flux.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor
           reaction data are taken from Table 2 at page 1228 in
