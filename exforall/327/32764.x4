INC-SOURCE The average neutron flux was (3.95+-0.20)E14 per cm2.
SAMPLE     The aluminum oxide powder samples with a purity
           99.999% were packed into a disk with 10 mm diameter
           and 2 mm thick.
DETECTOR   DeltaE-E gas detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated by monoenergetic
           neutron beam for about 20 days.
           (AMS) The irradiated aluminum oxide powder was
           mounted in sample holders of the sputter negative ion
           source without any chemical pretreatment. The
           negative ions of aluminum were produced, then
           injected into the EN tandem accelerator after
           selection by the 90 deg. injection magnet, converted
           to positive ions by the argon-gas stripper. These
           positive ions were accelerated further and analyzed by
           the 90 deg. high energy analyzer magnet. The 27Al3+
           current was monitored by a side Faraday cup. Only
           26Al3+ ions were transported through the successive
           45 deg. deflecting magnet and 20 deg. electrostatic
           deflector to the gas detector.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainty
STATUS     (CURVE) Data were digitalized from Fig.2 of
           Chin.Phys.Lett., Vol.15, No.1(1998)8.
