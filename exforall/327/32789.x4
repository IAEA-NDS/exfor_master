SAMPLE     Neptunium dioxide foil was about 100 mg and placed in
           a plexiglass round box. The round box was covered
           with 1 mm thick cadmium metal.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The gamma ray spectrometry method was used
           for measuring 22 fission products in this work. Two
           samples were used for the short and long half-life
           fission products. The irradiation was lasted 14 min
           and 5.2 h respectively.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma spectrometer with 4096 Channels were
           consist of a Ge(Li) detector (volume: 60cm3) and
           Multi-20. The energy resolution was 2.2 keV at 1.332
           MeV for Co-60. The efficiency of the detector was
           pre-calibrated with a series of standard gamma
           sources provided by China Institute of Atomic Energy.
           The error of efficiency was 3-6 %.
