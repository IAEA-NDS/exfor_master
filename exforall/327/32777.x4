FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     (32-GE-76,NAT=0.0773) Two disks, about 0.1 and 0.19
           cm in thickness and 20 mm in diameter, were formed by
           pressing approximately 1.7 and 3.2 g of Ge (99.99%
           pure) powder (natural isotopic composition) at 980 MPa
           to form a pellet. The samples were irradiated near
           the target and sandwiched between two Nb foils (99.99%
           pure, 0.12 mm thick) with the same diameter which
           were used to monitor the neutron fluence via the
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reaction.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced with an effective
           deuteron beam energy of 135 keV, beam current of 240
           uA, and the diameter of the deuteron beam spot was
           under 0.6 cm. The samples were centered a 0.566 mg/cm2
           thick T-Mo target at a distance of about 50 mm. The
           diameter of the active zone of the T-Mo target is 1.2
           cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The measurements were carried out using low-
           background high-purity germanium detector (ORTEC,
           model GEM 60P, crystal diameter 70.1 mm, crystal
           length 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of about
           68% and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV
           for Co-60. The detector was pre-calibrated for energy
           and efficiency by using the standard gamma ray
           sources Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137,
           Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226. The distance from sample
           to detector was 2.0 cm.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in
           alpha-particle tube was positioned at 135 degree and
           110 cm from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted
           approximately 3 minutes with a neutron yield 3 to
           4E10 n/s in 4pi solid angle. The groups of samples
           were placed at 0, 90, and 135 degree relative to the
           beam direction. During irradiation, the neutron flux
           was monitored by accompanying alpha-particles so that
           corrections could be made for small variations of the
           yield.

CORRECTION Total correction factor of the activity were made up
           of fs and fg: F=fs*fg. fs and fg were the correction
           factors for the self-absorption of the sample at a
           given gamma-ray energy and the counting geometry.
           Correction factors for the self-absorption at 139.68
           and 264.6 keV gamma-rays are 1.163, 1.067 for sample
           1 (0.1863 cm), and 1.081, 1.034 for sample 2 (0.0948
           cm).
