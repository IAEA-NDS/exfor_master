TITLE      The cross section measurements for the 51V(n,a)48Sc
           and 51V(n,p)51Ti reactions

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     (23-V-51,NAT=0.99750) The samples of V and Al as
           foils 20 mm in diameter were 99.5% and 99.999% in
           purity, and 0.3 and 0.2 mm in thickness. The distance
           between target and sample is 5~28 cm. The V sample in
           each group was sandwiched between two Al foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy and beam
           current is 125 keV and about 20 mA. T-Ti target was
           around 0.9 mg/cm2 thick. Neutron yield is 2E12 n/s.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 2.6 keV at 1.33 MeV. The
           efficiency was calibrated by a standard gamma-source,
           standard reference material 4275 from the National
           Institute of Standards and Technology. In gamma ray
           measurement, the distance between sample and HPGe is
           2 cm.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 0.5 and 6 hours,
           the angle is from 0 to 130 degree between deuteron
           beam and target.

           (ERR-8) Sample weight for 27Al 0.2%.
           (ERR-9,0.8,1.1,U) Statistical uncertainty for 24Na
           0.8~1.1%.
           (ERR-10) Uncertainty due to neutron energy uncertainty
           0.4%.
           (MONIT-ERR,1.2,1.5) Monitor cross sections 1.2~1.5%.
