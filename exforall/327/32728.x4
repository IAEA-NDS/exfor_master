FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP) 600 kV High Voltage Multiplier
SAMPLE     The 238U sample is depleted uranium whose purity is
           99.9% and size is 10x10x2 cm. The sample is placed at
           the distance of 10 cm from the neutron source, and of
           40 cm from the emulsions. The normal of the sample is
           at 30 deg relative to the incident neutron beam and
           60 deg to the emulsions.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Totally six national nuclear emulsions N-4 are
           used, which have the size of 3x4x0.04 cm.
METHOD     The tracks in experiment have been recognized
           manually with binocular microscope system.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Counting statistics
CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for the probability of
           proton tracks and track confusion counting of
           different energy ranges, different attenuation of the
           neutron flux when neutrons with different energies
           going through the emulsion, and the emulsion
           shrinkage. No correction is required for background
           neutrons because only the neutrons greater than 3 MeV
           are considered.
