SAMPLE     About 5 gram of Ru powder of natural isotope
            composition (99.99% purity) was pressed at 10 t/cm2,
            and a pellet, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter.
           Monitor foils of Al (99.999% pure, 0.04 mm thick) of
            the same diameter as the pellets were then attached
            in front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
            diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
            68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
            gamma ray from Co-60.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted 128 min
            with a yield ~4E10 to 5E10 n/s.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,14.959HR,DG,1368.6,1.00)
MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,,1990)
           The cross section of monitor reaction was determined
            by interpolation of the evaluated values from
            reference.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
            generator was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measurement.
           (ERR-S,1.,8.) Counting statistics is between 1-8%.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of weight of sample is 0.1%.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of self-absorption of
            gamma-ray is 0.5%.
           (ERR-3,2.,3.) The uncertainty of detector efficiency
           is between 2% and 3%.
           (ERR-4,0.1,1.) Uncertainties of irradiation, cooling
            and measuring times is between 0.1% and 1.0%.
           (MONIT-ERR) The uncertainty of monitor cross section.
CORRECTION The data for nat-Ru(n,x)99mTc reaction cross sections
           were corrected for the measured contributions of the
           102Ru(n,a)99Mo.
