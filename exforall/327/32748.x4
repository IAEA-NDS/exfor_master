REL-REF    (M,,G.Zhang+,J,ARI,70,888,2012)The threshold
           correction and self-absorption correction.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) The 4.5-MV Van de Graff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuteron beam current was about 3.0uA.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The a-particle detector is a twin-gridded
           ionization chamber.The distances from the cathode to
           grid, grid to anode, and anode to shield were 61.0,
           15.0, and 9.0 mm. The working gas of the ionization
           chamber was a mixture of Kr + 2.82% CO2 with 1.0-atm
           pressure. High voltages applied on the cathode, grid,
           and anode were -1500, 0, and +750 V. The distance
           from the cathode of the chamber to the center of the
           deuterium gas target was 16.3 cm. A 238U(238U3O8)
           film sample was placed in the chamber at the other
           position of the sample changer to determine the
           absolute neutron flux by measuring the fission
           fragments. Isotopic abundance is 99.999%, thickness
           is 493.6 ug/cm2(238U only), diameter is 45.0 mm,
           backing is Ta sheet.
           (BF3) The neutron flux monitor is a BF3 long counter.
           The axis of the BF3 long counter and the normal line
           of the electrodes of the ionization chamber were at
           0degree to the beam line. The distance from the front
           side of the long counter to the center of the gas
           target was 272 cm.
