TITLE      The cross section measurements for the 67Zn(n,p)67Cu
           and 66Zn(n,2n)65Zn reactions

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The samples of Zn and Al as foils 20 mm in diameter
           were 99.5% and 99.999% purity, and 0.3 and 0.1 mm in
           thickness. Groups of samples were placed at 0 to 130
           degree relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at distances of 10-28 cm. The
           Zn sample in each group was sandwiched between two Al
           foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy and beam
           current is 125 keV and 20 mA. T-Ti taret was around
           0.9 mg/cm2 thick. Neutron yield is around 2E12 n/s.
           The neutron energies for various directions were
           determined by cross section ratios of
           90-Zr(n,2n)89m+g-Zr and 93-Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 2.6 keV at 1.33 MeV. The
           efficiency was calibrated by a standard gamma-source,
           standard reference material 4275 from the National
           Institute of Standards and Technology. In gamma ray
           measurement, the distance between sample and HPGe
           detector is 2 cm.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 6.6 hours.

           (ERR-4) Gamma self-absorption correction for 24Na 1.0%.

           1.0%.
           (ERR-7) Sample weight 0.1%.
           (ERR-8) Sample weight for 27Al 0.15%.
           (ERR-9,0.6,1.1,U) Statical uncertainty for 24Na
           0.6~1.1%.
           (ERR-10) Uncertainty due to neutron energy uncertainty
           0.4%.
