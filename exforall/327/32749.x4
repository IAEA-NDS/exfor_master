           reaction

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The T-400 Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The samples of Mo and Al as foils 20 mm in diameter
           were 99.99% and 99.999% purity, and 0.2 and 0.1 mm in
           thickness. Groups of samples were placed at 0 to 150
           degree relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at distances of 4-9.3 cm. The
           Mo sample in each group was sandwiched between two Al
           foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy and beam
           current is 360 keV and about 2 mA. T-Ti taret was
           around 1.6 mg/cm2 thick. Neutron yield is around
           1~2E11 n/s. The neutron energies for various
           directions were determined by cross section ratios of
           90-Zr(n,2n)89m+g-Zr and 93-Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 2.6 keV at 1.33 MeV. The
           efficiency was calibrated by a standard gamma-source,
           standard reference material 4275 from the National
           Institute of Standards and Technology. In gamma ray
           measurement, the distance between sample and HPGe is
           2 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 1~4 hours, the
           angle is 45 degree between deuteron beam and target.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on the source of uncertainty
           (ERR-1,,1.5) The absolute efficiency curve of HPGe at
           2 cm from neutron source was less than 1.5%.
