FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Neutron Generator.
SAMPLE     Sample pellets (0.2 cm in thickness, 2.0 cm in
           diameter, around 3 g in weight, and >99.99% pure)
           were pressed from natural Tm2O3 powder. Each of them
           was sandwiched between two Nb metal foils, and the
           purity of the Nb foils was >99.99%.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced with an effective
           deuteron beam energy of 136 keV and beam current of
           280 uA. The T-Mo target used in the generator had a
           thickness of 0.566 mg/cm2 and an active area with a
           diameter of 1.2 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detector (ORTEC, model
           GEM 60P, crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal length:
           72.3 mm, made in the United States) with a relative
           efficiency of around 68% and an energy resolution of
           1.69 keV at 1332 keV for 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Lasted about 13 h with a yield of about 2 to
           3E10 n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples were placed at
           0- or 135-deg angle relative to the beam direction
           and centered about the tritium-molybdenum (T-Mo)
           target at distances of about 4 cm.
