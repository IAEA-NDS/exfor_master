FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 7 gram of high purity Sc2O3 powder(natural
           isotopic composition) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and
           a pellet, 0.4 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained. Monitor foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm
           thick) of the same diameter as the pellets were then
           attached in front and at the back of each sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources, which were Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109,
           Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about 2
           hours with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10 n/s. The groups
           of samples were placed at 0deg., 90deg. or 135deg.
           angles relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at distances of around 5 cm.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy of 125 keV
           and beam current of 200 uA were used to produce
           neutrons. The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in
           the generator was 2.38 mg/cm2 thick.

CORRECTION Measurements were corrected for gamma-ray attenuations
           and fluctuation of neutron flux.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions cross sections are
           taken from Table 2 at page 609 in J,RCA,101,607,2013,
           and the isomeric cross section ratios are taken from
           subsection 4.4 at page 610 in J,RCA,101,607,2013.
