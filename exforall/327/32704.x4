           energy range of 13.5 to 14.8 MeV

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 8 gram Ga2O3 powder of natural isotope
           composition sample (>99.99% purity) was pressed at 10
           ton/cm2, and a pellet, 0.4 cm thick and 2.0 cm in
           diameter was obtained. Monitor foils of Al (99.999%
           pure, 0.04 mm thick) of the same diameter as the
           pellets were then attached in front and at the back of
           each sample. Finally, wrapped in 1 mm thick cadmium
           foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources such as Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Cd-119, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted 121 min
           with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10 n/s.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,14.959HR,DG,1368.6,1.00)
MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) The cross section of
           monitor reaction was determined by interpolation of the
           evaluated values of the reference.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy of 125 keV
           and beam current of 200 uA were used to produce
           neutrons. And the tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used
           in the generator was 2.40 mg/cm2 thick.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of cross section is in the
           range from 10% to 20%. The uncertainties resulted from
           counting statistics, standard cross sections
           uncertainties, detector efficiency, weight of samples,
           self-absorption of gamma-rays and the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays.
CORRECTION The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium fission
           chamber so that corrections were made for small
           variations in the yield. The self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, the coincidence sum
           effect of cascade gamma-rays in the investigated
           nuclide and in the counting geometry were taken into
           account in data analysis, respectively.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor
           reaction data are taken from Table 2 at page 233 in
           J,RCA,100,231,2012.
