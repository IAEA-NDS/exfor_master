FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 intense neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuterium beam energy of 200-250
           keV and beam current of 230 uA. The tritium-titanium
           Target (T-Ti) was 2.18 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A coaxial GMX60 HPGE detector with a relative
           efficiency of about 68% and an energy resolution of
           1.7keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV
SAMPLE     ThO2 powder of 99.7% purity were pressed into
           circular disks with a diameter of 14 mm. The
           thickness of sample was about 2 mm. Each sample was
           sandwiched between two monitor aluminum (thin Al foil
           of 99.99% purity)foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
           117 minutes with the neutrons flux yield about 2 E11
           n/(4pi*s). The samples were placed at 0, 45, 90 degree
           angles relative to the deuterium beam direction and
           centered about the T-Ti target at a distance of 35 mm.
