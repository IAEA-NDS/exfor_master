FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 9 g of Pr2O3 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (>99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.3 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out and
           lasted 121 min with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10
           n/(4pi*s).
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)

MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990)
           The cross section of monitor reaction was determined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was used in
           the generator. The effective source neutron energy at
           irradiation position was determined by the Nb/Zr
           method.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty were due to the counting
            statistics, standard cross sections, detector
            efficiency, weight of samples, self-absorption of
            gamma-ray and the coincidence sum effect of cascade
            gamma-rays, the uncertainties of irradiation, cooling
            and measuring times, isotopic abundance, etc.

           reaction data are taken from Table3 at page 263 in
