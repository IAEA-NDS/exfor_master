FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T)The neutrons with the yield of about 1 to 3E12
           n/s, were produced by d-T reaction with an effective
           deuteron beam energy and current of 125 keV and 20
           mA. The thickness of the tritium-titanium (T-Ti)
           target was 0.9 mg/cm2.
SAMPLE     (82-PB-206,NAT=0.241) The natural lead foils of
           99.99% purity and 0.25 mm thickness were made into
           circular samples with a diameter of 20 mm. Each of
           them was sandwiched between natural niobium foils of
           the same diameter, all the niobium foils with
           purities better than 99.9% and 0.2 mm in thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-ray activities of the residual nuclei
           were measured by a CH8403 coaxial HPGe detector with
           sensitive volume 110 cm3 and relative efficiency of
           20% and energy resolution of 3 keV at 1.33 MeV.
           (FISCH) Used to monitor the neutron yield fluctuation.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Lead samples were measured after having
           been cooled for more than 18 times of the half-life
           of Pb-203g (51.873 h) to avoid the effect of the
           gamma-ray (279.1967 keV) from Pb-203g.

CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption
           in the sample, for gamma-ray coincidence summing
           effects, for fluctuation of the neutron flux during
           the irradiation and for sample geometry.

CRITIQUE   By compiler:
            The cross sections are higher than those in the
            literature. This could be due to interference by the
            284.1 keV gamma-line (Ig=10%) of 205Pb from
            206Pb(n,2n)205Pb reaction.
