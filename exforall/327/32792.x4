FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 5SDH-2.2x1.7 MV minim tandem
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-Ti target bombarded by the deuteron
           beam was of the size 10 mm in diameter, thickness of
           about 5.5 mg/cm2 and, the adsorption of tritium was
           4.0 to 4.5 Ci for every target. The deuteron beam
           energy was 3 MeV.
SAMPLE     The samples used in the irradiation were 16 mm in
           diameter disks made of natural uranium metal about 2 g.
           The uranium disk was sealed in a pure aluminum
           foil of 0.2 mm thickness. The sample sandwiched
           between two standardized thin samples to monitor the
           fission rate absolutely was mounted in the double
           fission chamber. The standardized thin samples were
           made of the same uranium as the thick ones. The
           double fission chamber was covered with Cd of 1 mm
           thickness to shield the thermal neutrons in the
           environment.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Four samples were irradiated for periods
           about 30 h, every time 2 samples were irradiated, one
           had a distance of about 5 cm from the neutron source
           in the direction of zero degree, another one 5 mm
           from the neutron source, 0 degree.
           (GSPEC) The gamma-ray spectra were recorded
           successively over a period of two months to encompass
           the wide range of half-life involved and to eliminate
           the cross interfering of the gamma-rays from the
           product nuclides of almost the same energy that can
           not be resolved by the HPGe detector.

           - Gamma-ray self-absorption
