INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron with a yiels of about 2E11 n/s was
           produced.
SAMPLE     The natural abundance uranium sesquioxide (U2O3, 98%
           purity) powder for uranium target was pressed into
           circular disk with a diameter of 12.0 mm and a
           thickness of about 1.0 mm. Each sample disk was
           covered by a polyethylene film, and then sandwiched
           between two thin pure aluminum foils (99.99% purity).
           Three U2O3 samples (with mass around 1 g), which were
           placed at 0 deg, 45 deg and 90 deg angles related to
           the deuteron beam direction and centered about the
           T-Ti target at a distance of 4.0 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-Purity Germanium (HPGe,ORTEC) gamma-ray
           spectrometer with 68% relative efficiency and 1.7 keV
           energy resolution at 1332.5 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Two sets of measurement schemes were arranged
           to distinguish the short half-life and long half-life
           fragments. Firstly, the samples after irradiating and
           cooling (4.5 min) were measured by the HPGe detector
           about 90.0 min for the gamma-spectrum accumulation
           from short half-life nuclides. Meanwhile, the
           gamma-spectrum was recorded every minute during this
           measurement (about 90.0 min) , so as to investigate
           the nuclide with much shorter half-life. Secondly,
           after a long cooling time (24 h) the samples were
           measured for every 12 h, and more than twenty gamma
           spectra were recorded.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           Fang Kaihong (2019-10-24):
            The values are 121.1 mb at 14.1 MeV, 116.0 mb at
            14.5 MeV and 113.4 mb at 14.7 MeV.

CORRECTION Correction factor F=Fg*Fs*Fc includes three parts:
           The geometry correction factor (Fg) which originates
           from volume effect of samples. The self-absorption
           correction factor (Fs) caused by the gamma-ray
           absorption as penetrating the sample itself, which
           becomes more negligible with the increase of
           gamma-ray energy. The correction (Fc) is due to the
           coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties mainly come from the
           counting statistics of the characteristic peak,
           detection effciency and the self-absorption. Other
           uncertainties, caused by the weight of samples,
           sample geometry, coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays, neutron energy and fluence, the time
           schedule and the cross-section of monitor reaction,
           were also considered.
           (ERR-S) Counting statistics of the characteristic
                   peak, about 2.5%
           (ERR-1) Detection effciency, about 2%
           (ERR-2) The self-absorption about 1%

COMMENT    By the authors:
            The measurement shows that the 134I yield is
            negligible in comparison with the 134Te yield.
