SAMPLE     Three targets (UO2(NO3)2 powder of 99% or more purity)
           and monitors (aluminum foil of 99.99% purity, 0.05 mm
           thick) were made into circular disks with diameters of
           13.4 mm, 13.8 mm and 14.4 mm respectively.
           The thickness of the UO2(NO3)2 samples were 4.3 mm,
           4.5 mm and 5.4 mm, respectively.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used at
           135 deg, accompanying the alpha-particle tube, was at
           a distance of 110 cm from the target.
           (HPGE) A coaxial GMX60 HPGe detector (ORTEC, made in
           USA) with a relative efficiency of 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.82 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV. The
           calibration of point source efficiency is done by
           152Eu,137Cs and 60Co standard point sources.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Three sandwiches of Al-U-Al were mounted
           at 0, 45 and 90 deg angles respectively, relative to
           the deuteron beam direction and centered about the
           tritium-titanium target at distances of 50 mm. In
           order to prevent the scattered thermal neutrons, a
           cadmium foil was covered the sandwich sample during
           the irradiation. The samples were irradiated for 70
           min and cooled for about 3 h. The gamma-activities
           of the irradiated UO2(NO3)2 and Al samples were
           measured off-line.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons with a yield of about 5E10 n/s. The
           ion beam current was about 230 uA with effective
           deuteron energy of 134 keV.
CORRECTION The total correction factor mainly includes the
           self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma-ray
           energy, the coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays in the investigated nuclide and in the
           counting geometry.
