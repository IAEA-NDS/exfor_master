           neutrons on natural yttrium

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC)K-400 neutron generator
SAMPLE     The stacked foils is 2.160 mm and 2.0 cm in thickness
           and diameter.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy and
           current is 135 keV and 260 uA. The T-Mo target
           thickness is 0.566 mg/cm2 and an active zone diameter
           of 1.2 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources, which were Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in
           the 135-deg accompanying alpha-particle tube was 110
           cm from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The sample was irradiated and lasted around
           24 hours with a yield around 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The
           sample groups were placed at 0, 90 or 135 degree
           relative to the beam direction and centered about the
           T-Mo target at distances of around 4 cm. During
           irradiation, the neutron flux was monitored by
           accompanying alpha particles so that corrections
           could be made for small variations in the yield.

CORRECTION The self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma
           energy, in the counting geometry, and the coincidence
           sum effect of cascade gamma rays in the investigated
           nuclide were corrected.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-S,0.1,13.1) Counting statistics 0.1-13.1%
           (ERR-1,2.,4.) Detector efficiency 2-4%
           (ERR-2) Weight of samples 0.1%
           (ERR-3) Self-absorption of gamma-ray 1.0%
           (ERR-4,0.1,0.5) Uncertainties of irradiation, cooling
           and measuring times 0.1-0.5%
           (ERR-5) Some uncertainties are come from the
           branching ratio of the characteristic gamma rays,
           uncertainties in the half-lives of the radioactive
           product nuclei, and so on. 2%
