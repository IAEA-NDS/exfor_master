FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 8 g of Er2O3 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.5 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted 152 min
           with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10 n/s, and cooled for
           6-83 min.
