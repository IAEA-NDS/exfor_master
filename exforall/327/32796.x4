FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The cesium iodide (CsI) powder of natural isotopic
           composition (purity 99.99%) was pressed into a
           pellet, approximately 20.0 mm in diameter, and 1.5 mm
           in thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A lead-shielded HPGe detector (ORTEC, USA).
           The efficiency of the detector was calibrated using
           152Eu standard sources. The relative efficiency of
           the detector was 68% compared to the NaI detector,
           and the energy resolution was 1.82 keV (FWHM) at 1.33
           MeV of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation was lasted approximately 17 h.
           Three groups of samples were placed at 35, 75, and
           112 deg relative to the deuteron beam direction and
           centered around the T-Ti target at a distance of
           approximately 4.5 cm.

DECAY-MON  (41-NB-92-M,10.150D,DG,934.440,0.99150)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons were produced with a yield of
           approximately 3 to 4E10 n/(4pis). The deuteron ion
           beam current was 180 uA with of an energy of 250 keV.
           The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was approximately 2.59 mg/cm2 thick.
CORRECTION The correction includes self-absorption correction,
           cascade coincidence correction, and geometric
           correction, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty of measured cross sections
           includes the gamma-ray characteristic peak counts,
           efficiency, gamma-ray intensity, timing factor,
           isotopic abundance of the nuclei, number of atoms and
           monitor reaction cross-section.
           (ERR-S) The gamma-ray characteristic peak counts
           (ERR-1) The full energy peak efficiency
           (ERR-2) The branching intensity of gamma-rays
           (ERR-3) The time factor
