FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) TD-300 Neutron Generator for sample
           irradiations.
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure neodymium oxide and gadolinium
           oxide were made into circular samples with a diameter
           of 2.0 cm and thickness of 0.5 cm, which were
           sandwiched by two Al foil with the same diameter.
           Al metal purity was better than 99.99%. They were
           placed at 0, 90 and 135 degree angles relative to the
           deuteron beam direction and centered about the T-Ti
           target at distances of 1.2-3.0 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity
           germanium (HPGe) detector was used with 70.1x72.3 mm
           in diameter and length for the crystal. The relative
           efficiency was about 68%, and the energy resolution
           was about 1.69 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out and
           lasted 40 min with a neutron yield of about 3E10 to
            5E10 n/s. The neutron flux was monitored by the
           accompanying alpha particles.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)

           The cross section values of the monitor reaction were
           obtained by interpolating the evaluated work of the
           literature.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was
           used with 2.4 mg/cm2 in thickness and with a effective
           deuteron beam of 121 keV and beam current of 300 uA.
           Neutron energies in the measurements were determined
           by cross section ratios for 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb and
           90Zr(n,2n)89m+gZr reactions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measurement.
           (ERR-S,1.,5.) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of detector efficiency.
           (ERR-2,,3.) Uncertainty of the coincidence sum effect
           of cascade gamma-ray.
           (ERR-3,,0.5) Uncertainty of sample weights and self-
           absorption of gamma-ray.
           (ERR-4,,0.5) Uncertainties from irradiation, cooling
           and measurement time.
           (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty of monitor cross section.
CORRECTION Dead-time and pulse pileup corrections were less than
           2% in all cases. While determining the activities of
           the gamma-rays, corrections for self-absorption of the
           gamma-rays, real coincidence summing and geometry were
           made.
