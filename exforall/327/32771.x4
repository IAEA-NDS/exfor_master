FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuteron beam current was about from 2.5 to
           3.5 uA. The length and pressure of the deuterium gas
           target were 2.0 cm and 0.30 MPa. For neutrons with
           energy of 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 MeV, the energies were
           0.21, 0.19 and 0.16 MeV, respectively.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin gridded ionization chamber (GIC) was
           used as the charged particle detector with forward
           and backward asymmetrical sections.
           (BF3) The BF3 counter was used as the neutron flux
           monitor.
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.940) The 10B sample consists of four
           components: the 10B deposit, the aluminum-film
           backing as the substrate of 10B deposit, the tantalum
           frame bearing the aluminum backing, and the aluminum
           washer to fix and flatten the tantalum frame. In
           addition to the 10B sample, a thin-film background
           sample was also prepared without the 10B deposits on
           the aluminum backing which was used for the
           background measurement.
           (3-LI-6,ENR=0.90) The reference 6LiF sample was also
           prepared and the lithium fluoride was evaporated onto
           a tantalum-foil backing (48.0 mm x 0.1 mm) without
           holes.
           The number of 10B atoms was determined by the relative
           comparison method using the thermal neutron induced
           10B(nth,a)7Li and 6Li(nth,t)4He reactions with a 6LiF
           sample as the reference.
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.99997) The mass and the diameter of
           the 238U sample were 493.6 ug/cm2 and 4.50 cm.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections of the 10B(n,t2a) and 10B(n,a)7Li
           reactions were calculated using the event counts from
           the spectrum unfolding method and the residual
           method. The residual method was taken as the final
           results since the event counts obtained by the
           residual method are more accurate. The event counts
           from the (n,t2a) and (n,a) can be separated on the a
           energy spectrum.

COMMENT    The experiment was performed in 2017, the anode and
           grid signals of the GIC are used, the uncertainties
           of the measurement results were big especially for
           the 10B(n,t2a) three-body reaction. To obtain better
           results, the experimental data are re-analysed using
           the anode and cathode signals of the GIC.
