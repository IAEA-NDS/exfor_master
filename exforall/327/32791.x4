FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium gas chamber was of size 10 mm
           diameter X 40 mm thickness and made of stainless steel.
           The chamber was filled with the purified tritium
           gas of 0.22 MPa. The deuteron energy was 6.0 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight technique was used to measure
           the neutron spectrum.
           (GSPEC) The gamma-ray spectra were recorded
           successively over a period of two months to encompass
           the wide range of half-life involved, and to
           eliminate the cross interfering of the gamma-rays
           from the product nuclides of almost the same energy,
           which can not be resolved by the HPGe detector.
           (ABSFY) Fission rate was monitored by fission chamber.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,NAT=0.902) The samples used in the
           irradiation were 16 mm in diameter disks of uranium
           metal with isotopic composition of 234U (1.1%),
           235U (90.2%), 236U (0.3%), and 238U (8.4%).
           The uranium disk was sealed in a pure aluminum foil
           of 0.2 mm thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After the irradiation, the gamma-ray spectra
           of the samples were recorded directly by using HPGe
           gamma-ray spectrometer.
           (FISCH) The sample sandwiched between two
           standardized thin samples was mounted in a double
           fission chamber, which covered with Cd of 1 mm
           thickness.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the self-absorption of the
           gamma-rays, the cascade coincidence losses, the
           influence of background neutrons, the independent
           yields and the fission from 238U.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties (1 sigma) of the yields were
           given by considering all known sources of random
           errors according to the error propagation law.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 1 of
           P,INDC(CPR)-053,4,2001
