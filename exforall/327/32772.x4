FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The deuteron beam energy is 136 keV and beam
           current is 260 uA.
SAMPLE     (63-EU-153,NAT=0.5219) Three Eu2O3 samples (99.99%
           pure) were compressed at 10 t/cm2 to obtain 2.0 cm in
           diameter. Thickness was 0.1427, 0.1718, and 0.1065 cm.
           Each one of them was sandwiched between two Nb monitor
           foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm thick) of the same
           diameter as the samples.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) It consisted of a relative efficiency of
           around 68% and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at
           1332 keV for Co-60 HPGe detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm,
           made in USA). The efficiency of the detector was
           pre-calibrated using various standard gamma sources,
           which were Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137,
           Eu-152, Am-241, and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used to
           detect alphas from d-T reaction in alpha-particle
           tube was positioned at 135 deg and 110 cm from the
           target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted approximately 120
           min with a yield of 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The groups
           of samples were positioned at 0, 90, and 135 deg
           relative to the deuteron beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at distances of 40 mm. To avoid
           the effect of low energy neutrons, samples were
           wrapped in cadmium foil. During irradiation, the
           neutron flux was monitored by accompanying
           alpha-particles so that corrections could be made for
           small variations in the yield.

CORRECTION Total correction factor of the activity: F=fs*fg*fc.
           fs was correction factors for the self-absorption of
           the sample, fg was correction factors for the
           counting geometry, fc was correction factors for the
           coincidence sum effect of the cascading gamma rays.
           Correction factors for the self-absorption at 89.489,
           841.63, and 1112.1 keV were 3.993, 1.038, 1.031 for
           sample 1 (0.1427 cm thick), 4.754, 1.046, 1.038 for
           sample 2 (0.1718 cm thick), and 3.087, 1.028, 1.023
           for sample 3 (0.1065 cm thick).
