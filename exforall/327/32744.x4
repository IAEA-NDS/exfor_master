FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 intense neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons around 14 MeV were produced with a
           deuteron beam of 270-280 keV and beam current of 350
           uA. The solid T-Ti target used in the generator was
           about 2.19 mg/cm2 thick.
SAMPLE     (22-TI-46,NAT=0.0825) Natural Titanium foils of
           99.99% purity and 2.98-3.0 mm thickness were made
           into circular samples with a diameter of 2.0 cm. Each
           of them was sandwiched between disks of thin Niobium
           of the same diameter, all the Niobium foils with
           purities better than 99.99% and 1 mm thickness.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity
           germanium ORTEC detector (crystal diameter 70.1 mm,
           crystal length 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of
           about 68% and an energy resolution of about 1.69 keV
           FWHM at 1.332 MeV for 60Co was used to study the
           gamma-activities of irradiated samples. The efficiency
           of the detector was pre-calibrated using various
           standard gamma sources.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted for 6.5-
           7.5 h with a yield of about 4 to 5E10 n/s. The neutron
           flux was monitored by the accompanying alpha-particles.
           Groups of samples were placed at 0, 45 and 90 degree
           angles relative to the deuteron beam direction and
           centered about the T-Ti target at a distance of about
           3-5 cm. Two measurements have been done for the
           characteristic 1157.02 keV gamma-line. First
           measurement was carried out after the irradiated
           samples were cooled for about 20-30 min (28 min),
           and the second measurement was carried out after the
           cooling time of about 9.4 times the half-life of
           44gSc (78.73 h).

CORRECTION Corrections were made for dead-time and pulse pile-up
           losses in gamma-ray spectrometry, for gamma-ray
           self-absorption in the sample, for fluctuation of the
           neutron flux during the irradiation, for coincidence
           sum effect of cascade gamma-rays and for sample
           geometry.

ANALYSIS  1Derived from the 1157.02 keV counts after cooling for
            78.73 h assuming that all counts are originated from
            the 44mSc -> 44gSc isomeric transition.
          2Derived from the 1157.02 keV counts after cooling for
            28 min and subtraction of 44mSc -> 44gSc isomeric
            transition by using the information from the counts
            after 78.73 h cooling.
