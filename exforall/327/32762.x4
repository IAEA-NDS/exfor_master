FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) Heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC,THCOL) Thermal neutrons from the thermal column
           of heavy-water reactor. Neutron beam filtered through
           monocrystalline silicon, the cross-section with 8 cm
           in diameter.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.902) Isotopic composition of the
           sample are 234U (1.1%), 235U (90.2%), 236U (0.3%) and
           238U (8.4%). The thick uranium with 16 mm in
           diameter and 0.4-0.8 g/cm2 thick was wrapped by pure
           aluminium foil with 5 mg/cm2 thick. The thin standard
           uranium with 16 mm in diameter and 0.3-0.4 mg/cm2
           thick was electrodeposited on the platinum foil with
           0.10-0.15 mm thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The volume of P-type coaxial HPGe detector is
           110 cm3. For gamma energy 1332.5 keV the gamma-energy
           resolution FWHM is 1.8 keV. The distance between
           detector and sample can be adjusted. At a distance of
           31.6 cm, the detection efficiency was calibrated
           relatively using Eu-152, and was calibrated
           absolutely using various standard gamma sources,
           which were Mn-54, Co-57, Zn-65, Cd-109 and Cs-137.
           The ratio of detection efficiency between distance of
           1.3 cm and 31.6 cm, was mensurated using Cr-51, Mn-54,
           Zn-65, Zr-95, Ru-103, Cs-137, Ba-140, Ce-141 and
           Ce-144. The uncertainty of efficiency is less than 2%
           at 1.3 cm distance.
           (FISCH) Double-fission chamber were used to measure
           the absolute fission rate.
METHOD     (ABSFY,FPGAM)
ANALYSIS   Decay gamma spectrum area were determined with SPAN
           code.
CORRECTION (1) gamma self-absorbtion for thick sample.
           (2) geometry.
           (3) neutron scattering from the wall of fission
               chamber.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Absolute uncertainty of measurement.
           (ERR-1,,2.0) Uncertainty of efficiency of HPGe is
           less than 2.0%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 2 of Atom. Ener. Sci.
           and Tech.,34(S1) 170,2000. The data for 105Cd and
           124Sb were discarded that approved by first author.
