INC-SOURCE An 8-O-18 beam with energy of 117 MeV was used. The
           8-O-18 beam was kept to about 5 enA, which is
           measured by a Faraday cup.
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.994) The thickness of target is
           300 ug/cm2.
           (40-ZR-94,ENR=0.963) The thickness of target is
           350 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SI) A silicon dE/E telescope was used to identify
           the light ejectile particles.
           (SCIN) Two LaBr3(Ce)detectors with a size of 4 inch
           in diameter x 5 inch in length were used for
           gamma-ray detection.
PART-DET   (8-O-16,G)
METHOD     (EDE) (1) The dE detectors with trapezoidal shape are
           arranged to form a ring shape around the beam axis in
           an angular range of 22-39 degree relative to the beam
           direction. The thickness is 75 um. (2) The E detector
           is an annular-type detector and has 16 ring-shaped
           strips. The resolution of the scattering angle of the
           ejectile is around 1.2 degree. The thickness is 300 um.
CORRECTION The correction of the integrated 8-O-18 beam current,
           the target thickness, the absolute detection
           efficiency of the LaBr3 detectors, and the absolute
           branching ratio of gamma lines were done.
ANALYSIS   (SURGT) Surrogate technique: The 94Zr(18O,16O)96Zr
           and 90Zr(18O,16O)92Zr reactions represent
           95Zr(n,g)96Zr and 91Zr(n,g)92Zr, respectively. The
           gamma intensities 80.0% (1750 keV) and 91.7% (934 keV)
           were adopted for identification of 96Zr and 92Zr,
           respectively.
