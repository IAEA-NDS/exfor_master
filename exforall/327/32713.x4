FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 10 gram of La2O3 powder of natural isotopic
            composition was pressed at 10 t/cm2 and a pellet
            0.3 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter.
           The samples were placed at 0, 90 or 135 degree
            relative to the beam direction and centered about the
            T-Ti target at distances of around 3-5 cm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy and beam
            current is 125 keV and 200 uA. T-Ti target was
            2.40 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
            diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
            68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
            gamma ray from Co-60.
           The efficiency of the detector was pre-calibrated
            using various standard gamma sources, which were
            Mn-54, Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152,
            Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
            fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 121 min with a
            yield around 3 to 4E10 n/s. The average neutron
            fluence rate in the place of the samples is around
            0.95-3.54E8 n/(cm s).

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainties of the branching ratio of the
            characteristic gamma rays, uncertainties of the half
            life of the radioactive product nuclei and so on,
            have also been considered.

            and measuring times 0.1-1%

            gamma-ray 0- 5%
