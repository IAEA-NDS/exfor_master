FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 9 gram of Tb2O3 powder of natural isotopic
           composition (>99.99% pure) was pressed at 10 ton/cm2,
           and a pellet, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained. The samples in each group were sandwiched
           between two Nb or Al foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in
           135 degree accompanying alpha particle tube was at a
           distance of 110 cm from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
           13 hours with a yield around 2E10 to 3E10 n/s, and
           cooled for around 5.5 to 78 hours. The groups of
           samples were placed at 0deg., 90deg. or 135deg.
           angles relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Mo target at distances of around 4 cm.

MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) The cross section of
           monitor reaction was determined by interpolation of the
           evaluated values of the reference.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy of 136 keV
           and beam current of 280 uA were used to produce
           neutrons. And the tritium-Molybdenum (T-Mo) target
           used in the generator was 0.566 mg/cm2 thick, and
           diameter of active zone is 1.2 cm.
