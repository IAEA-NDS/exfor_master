SAMPLE     The natural Manganese powder of 99.9% purity was made
           into circular thin samples with a diameter of 20 mm
           and the thickness of 1.5-2.6 mm, which were
           sandwiched between two disks of thin Al of the same
           diameter. The purity of the Al metal was better than
           99.99%.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity
           germanium (HPGe) detector was used with 70.1x72.3 mm
           in diameter and length for the crystal, respectively.
           The relative efficiency was about 68%, and the energy
           resolution was about 1.69 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiation of the samples was carried
           out and lasted 15 min with a neutron yield of about
           3E10 to 5E10 n/s.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)

           The cross section values of the monitor reaction were
           obtained by interpolating the evaluated work of the
           literature.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was
           used with 2.4 mg/cm2 in thickness.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of measurement.
           (ERR-S,,1.) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of detector efficiency.
           (ERR-2,,2.) Uncertainty of the coincidence sum effect
           of cascade gamma-ray.
           (ERR-3,,0.5) Uncertainty of sample weights and self-
           absorption of gamma-ray.
           (ERR-4,,0.5) Uncertainties from irradiation, cooling
           and measurement time.
           (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty of monitor cross section.
CORRECTION Dead-time and pulse pileup corrections were less than
           2% in all cases. While determining the activities of
           the gamma-rays, corrections for self-absorption of the
           gamma-rays, real coincidence summing and geometry were
           made.
COMMENT    The reactions and associated decay data of products
           were taken from Table 1 at page 1564 in J,IPC,81,(10),
           1563,201204. In Table 1, the half-life of 52V was
           3.743 month. We have consulted the NUCLEAR WALLET
           CARDS (Jagdish K. Tuli, Oct. 2011), and found the
           half-life of 52V was 3.743 minutes. It was a clerical
           mistake confirmed by the author.

STATUS     (TABLE) All measured data were taken from Table 2 at
           page 1565 in J,IPC,81,(10),1563,201204.
