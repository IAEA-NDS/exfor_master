INSTITUTE  (3CPRAEP)
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP) 600 kV Cockcroff-Walton accelerator
SAMPLE     A natural iron sample with 3x3 cm in diameter and
           thickness were used.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T-Ti target were used to produce incident
           neutron.
METHOD     (COINC) Apply the coincidence method to measure the
           prompt gamma from residual nuclei with 846.8 and
           1238.3 keV energy.
           (GSPEC,ASSOP)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 2 clover detectors are consist of 8 co-axis N-
           type HPGe with 60x60 mm in diameter and thickness,
           which was calibrated using Eu-152 gamma source.
           (SIBAR) The associated alpha particle are detect by
           Au-Si surface detector as neutron flux monitor.
ERR-ANALYS Total uncertainty of measurement mainly due to
           gamma full-energy peak counting statistics, distance
           between sample and detector, weight of sample and
           correction factor calculation etc.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for gamma-ray self-absorption
           in the sample, fluctuation of the neutron flux during
           the irradiation, multi-scattering, dead-time, cascade
           gamma rays coincidence, and sample geometry.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 1 in page 2180 of
            J,CST,Vol.47,p.2177,201312.
