FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP) The sample had been irradiated on a
           neutron generator.
           (VDGT,3CPRAEP) Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)
           based on a HI-13 tandem accelerator.
SAMPLE     A high-purity natural nickel foil with a thickness of
           0.25 mm and a size of 10 mm x 10 mm. To avoid
           interference from thermal neutrons, the sample was
           wrapped with Cd foil with a thickness of 2 mm during
           the irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer. The system has an
           energy resolution of 1.83 keV and a relative
           efficiency of 47% for 1.33 MeV gamma ray.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for ~8 hours.
           (AMS) 59Ni/60Ni ratio determined with standard 60Ni.
           Separately prepared at CIAE.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(D,n)a reaction
           with a D beam current of about 500 uA. The thickness
           of the solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in
           the generator was 1.0 mg/cm2 and the energy of
           incident D beam was 300 keV. The incident neutron
           energy was determined to be (14.60+-0.40) MeV, with a
           neutron yield of about (2-5)x10**10 n/s.
           The relative neutron fluence was monitored by the
           accompanying alpha particles.

           (ERR-3) background deduction.
