FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRNPC) The K-400 Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     Two samples (ThO2 powder of 99.5% purity) and monitor
            Al (thin Al foil of 99.99% purity) are made into
            round disks with a diameter of 2.0 cm; the
            thicknesses of samples are around 1.0 mm (THO2) and
            0.05 mm (Al).
           The samples were placed at 0, 45 and 90 deg. relative
            to the deuteron beam direction and centered about the
            target at distances of 35 mm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A deuteron beam of 220-250 keV and beam current
            of 230 uA used.
           The solid tritium-titanium target used in the neutron
            generator was about 2.18 mg/cm2.
           The neutron energies in the measurements are
            determined by the cross section ratio of the
            90Zr(n,2n)89Zr to 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reactions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The relative efficiency is 68%, and the energy
            resolution is around 1.7 keV at 1332.5 keV.
PART-DET   (A) The neutron flux is about 2x10E11 n/s monitored
            by accompanying alpha particle.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,M.B.Chadwick+,J,NDS,112,2887,2011)
           Evaluated data in ENDF/B-VII.1
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties mainly come from the
            detection efficiency calibration and the counting
            statistics of characteristic gamma-ray peaks.
CORRECTION Corrections are made for contributions form
            background neutrons, gamma-ray self-absorption in the
            sample, gamma-ray coincidence summing effects, pile
            up and coincidence losses of cascade gamma-rays,
            fluctuation of the neutron flux during the
            irradiation and the sample geometry.
