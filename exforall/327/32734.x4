FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The metallic natural samples of Re and Al as foils 20
           mm in diameter were 99.9% and 99.999% purity. The Re
           sample in each group was sandwiched between two Al
           foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) An effective deuteron beam energy and beam
           current is 125 keV and 20 mA. T-Ti target was around
           0.9 mg/cm2 thick. The neutron energies for various
           directions were determined by cross section ratios of
           90-Zr(n,2n)89m+g-Zr and 93-Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 3 keV at 1.33 MeV. The
           efficiency was calibrated by a standard gamma-source,
           standard reference material 4275 from the National
           Institute of Standards and Technology.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 2.5 hours with a
           yield of 1 to 3E12 n/s. Groups of samples were placed
           at 0 to 130 degree relative to the beam direction and
           centered about the T-Ti target at distances of 2-20 cm.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on the source of uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) The absolute efficiency curve at 2 cm was
           around 1.5%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 2 of
           J.Radioanal.Nucl.Chem.,218,127,1997.
