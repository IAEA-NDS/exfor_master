FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     About 10 gram of Dy2O3 (99.995% purity) powder was
            pressed at 980 MPa, and thin 20 mm diameter samples
            were obtained.
           The samples were irradiated in contact with the target,
            sandwiched between standard Nb foils (99.999% purity,
            0.5 mm thick) of the same diameter utilized to
            monitor the neutron fluence via the 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb
            reaction.
           The groups of samples were placed at 0 deg or 135 deg
            relative to the beam direction and were centered about
            the tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target at distances of
            about 40 mm.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A T-Ti target was used in the generator, with a
            thickness of 2.40 mg/cm2, and the diameter of the
            active zone was 12 mm. Neutrons were produced with an
            effective deuteron beam energy of 134 keV and beam
            current of 260 uA.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma ray activities of 162Tb, 163Tb and
            93mNb were determined by a high-purity germanium
            detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P, crystal diameter:
            70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm) with a relative
            efficiency of about 68% and an energy resolution of
            1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV for 60Co.
           The efficiency of the detector was measured using
            various standard gamma sources, namely Co-57, Co-60,
            Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           Standard Reference Material QCR9110 was obtained from
            China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), scope of
            activity is 3.04E4 to 4.26E4 Bq.
           (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was located
            at 135 degree to accompany the a-particle tube placed
            at a distance of 1.10 m from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
            60 min with a yield about 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s).

CORRECTION Corrections were made for the self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, in the counting
           geometry, and the coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays in the investigated nuclide (162,163Tb).
