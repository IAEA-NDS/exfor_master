FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     Approximately 15 g of high purity BaCO3 powder (99.99%
           pure) was pressed at 980 MPa, and a pellet around 0.4
           cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was obtained. Three
           such pellets were prepared.
           Monitor foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm thick) of the
           same diameter as the pellets were then attached in
           front and at the back of each sample.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced with an effective
           deuteron beam energy and current of 135 keV and 260
           uA. The T-Ti target has a thickness of 2.4 mg/cm2 and
           the diameter of the active zone is 1.2 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in
           diameter and length. The relative efficiency is about
           68%, and energy resolution is 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           gamma ray from Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources, which were Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used in
           the 135-deg accompanying alpha-particle tube was 110
           cm from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
           117 min with a yield around 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The
           groups of sample were placed at 0, 90 or 135 degree
           relative to the beam direction and centered about the
           T-Ti target at distances of around 40 mm.
           During irradiation, the neutron flux was monitored by
           accompanying alpha particles so that corrections
           could be made for small variations in the yield.

CORRECTION The self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma
           energy, in the counting geometry, and the coincidence
           sum effect of cascade gamma rays in the investigated
           nuclide were corrected.
