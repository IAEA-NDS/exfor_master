FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The Tritium-Ti target, 10 mm diameter, and 5.2
           mg/cm2 thickness. The deuteron beam energy was 3 MeV.
SAMPLE     The uranium metal (about 2 g) disks with 16 mm diameter
           were sealed in a pure Al foil of 0.2 mm thickness. It
           was sandwiched between two standardized thinner uranium
           samples. The standardized thin samples were made of the
           same uranium as the thick ones. The abundance of
           Uranium isotopes:
                             U-235, 90.2%
                             U-234, 1.1%
                             U-236, 0.3 %
                             U-238, 8.4%
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-spectrometers.
           (FISCH) The sample was mounted in a double fission
           chamber, covered with Cd of 1 mm thick in order to
           shield it from the thermal neutrons from the
           environment.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Four samples were irradiated for 30 h at a
           distance of about 5 cm from the neutron source in the
           direction of zero degree.
           (GSPEC) Fission product activities were measured by
           HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry. The gamma ray spectra
           were collected over a period varying from 30 seconds
           up to two months, and the gamma ray spectra were
           analyzed by the decay program SPAN. The fission
           yields were obtained by FYAUTOLS.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement of fission rate
CORRECTION Corrections were made for coincidence losses, pileup
           losses in the counting system, influence of the
           background neutrons, self absorption of gamma ray,
           independent yields and influence from other uranium
           isotopes.
COMMENT    The sum of the yields directly measured was 61.1% for
           the light mass groups, and 53.2% for the heavy mass
           groups.
