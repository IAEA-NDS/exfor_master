TITLE      Probability of prompt neutron emission from
           spontaneous fission of 240Pu

SAMPLE     Plutonium sample (4.09 mg, of which the amount of
           240Pu is 327 ug) was electrodeposited on platinum
           plate with 1.6 cm in diameter.
DETECTOR   (STANK) 60 cm diameter spherical fission neutron
           detector with 111 L cadmium loaded scintillating
           liquid.
           (IOCH) Multilayer plate fisson ionization chamber
           placed at centre of scintillator tank for detection
           of fissions.
CORRECTION Background, resolution time.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty mainly from overlap
            leakage correction, statistical and systematic error.
