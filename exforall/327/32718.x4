FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) 2 x 1.7 MV Tandem Accelerator
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.902)Isotopic composition of the sample
           are 234U(1.1%), 235U(90.2%), 236U(0.3%) and
           238U(8.4%). The thick uranium target with 16 mm in
           diameter and 0.6-0.8 g/cm2 in mass thickness, was
           wrapped by pure aluminium foil with 5 mg/cm2 in mass
           thickness. The thin uranium target with 16 mm in
           diameter and 0.3-0.4 mg/cm2 in mass thickness, was
           electrodeposited on the platinum foil with 0.10-0.15
           mm thickness.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The 0.57 MeV neutrons were obtained by
           7Li(p,n)7Be. LiF target thickness is 1 mg/cm2. The
           incident energies of proton is 2.36 MeV.
           (P-T) The 1.0 and 1.5 MeV neutrons were obtained by
           T(p,n)3He. T-Ti target thickness is 5 mg/cm2. The
           incident energies of proton are 2.05 and 2.50 MeV.
METHOD     (ABSFY,GSPEC) Absolute measurements of the cumulative
           yields of fission product 99Mo were determined for
           the fission of 235U induced by 0.57, 1.0 and 1.5 MeV
           neutrons. Fission product activities were measured by
           HPGe gamma ray spectrometry. Absolute fission rate
           was monitored with a double-fission chamber.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The volume of HPGe detector is 110 cm3. The
           energy resolution is 1.8 keV for 60Co at 1332.5 keV
           gamma ray.
           (FISCH) Double-fission chamber were used to measure
           the absolute fission rate, and monitor the changing
           of fission rate with time.
ANALYSIS   Decay gamma spectrum area were determined with SPAN
           code, and fission cumulative yields were calculated by
           FYAUTOLS code.
CORRECTION The main correction is the gamma-ray self-absorption
           in the target. The effects of all kinds of secondary
           neutrons on fission yield data were discussed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty.
           (ERR-S) The uncertainty of gamma counting statistics.
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of fission rate is 2.0%.
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of efficiency calibration is
           2.0%.
           (ERR-3) The uncertainty of self-absorption is 0.18%.
STATUS     (TABLE) The fission yield and total uncertainty data
           were taken from Table 2, and the detailed
           uncertainties were taken from Table 3 at page 1477 in
           J,CST,47,1473,2013.
