INC-SOURCE (D-D) The neutrons were generated using deuteron beam
           to bombard a deuterium gas target in pressure 0.30
           MPa, the intensity of the deuteron beam was about 2.5
           uA and the length of the target gas cell was 2.0 cm.
           The deuterium gas target was separated from the
           vacuum tube of the accelerator by a molybdenum
           membrane 5.0 um in thickness. The gas target was
           cooled by a compressed air jet.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin-gridded ionization chamber was used as
           the charged particle detector. The distances from
           cathode to grid and anode to grid were 6.1 and 1.5
           cm, respectively. The working gas Kr+CO2(2.7%)
           pressures were 0.052 MPa for 4.0-5.0 MeV region and
           0.068 MPa for 5.5-6.0 MeV region, respectively.
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter located at 0 degree with
           respect to the deuteron beam axis was used to
           monitor the relative neutron fluence. The outer
           radius of the BF3 long counter was 27 mm and its
           length was 300 mm. The BF3 long counter was
           surrounded by a moderator with radius of 350 mm and
           length of 400 mm, and a cadmium plate 0.5 mm in
           thickness was mounted at the front face of the
           counter. The distance between the front face of the
           BF3 long counter and the center of the gas target was
           about 3.0 m.
SAMPLE     (12-MG-25,ENR=0.986) The material of the 25Mg sample
           is 25MgO. The sample radius was 22.0 mm. The 25Mg
           nucleus number of forward and backward direction were
           1.623 x E20 (+-5%) and 1.580 x E20 (+- 5%),
           respectively. The tantalum backing layers with 0.1 mm
           thick were faced with each other.
