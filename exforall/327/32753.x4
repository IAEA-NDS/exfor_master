SAMPLE     Three pellets, about 0.15 cm thick and 20 mm in
           diameter were formed by pressing approximately 10
           gram of Eu2O3 (99.99% pure) powder (natural isotopic
           composition) at 980 MPa to form a pellet. The samples
           were irradiated in contact with the target and
           sandwiched between two standard Al foils (99.999%
           pure, 0.3 mm thick) of the same diameter used to
           monitor the neutron fluence via the 27Al(n,a)24Na
           reaction.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 2.40 mg/cm2 thick tritium-titanium (T-Ti)
           target at a distance of about 5 cm. Neutrons were
           produced with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           125 keV and beam current of 200 uA.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium detector (ORTEC, model
           GEM 60P, crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal length:
           72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of about 68% and
           an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV for
           60Co. The efficiency of the detector was
           pre-calibrated using the standard gamma sources 54Mn,
           57Co, 60Co, 109Cd, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am and
           226Ra.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted
           approximately 2 hours with a yield about 3-4E10
           n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples were placed at 0, 90
           and 135 degree relative to the beam direction.
