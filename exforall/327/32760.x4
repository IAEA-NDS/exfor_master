FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II intense neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron yield about 1 to 3E12 n/(4pi*s) .
           Effective average energy of deuteron beam was about
           125 keV and beam current was about 20 mA. The
           thickness of T-Ti target was about 0.9 mg/cm2. The
           samples were placed at the angles 0 to 140 deg
           relative to the beam direction. The neutron energies
           for various directions were determined by the cross
           section ratios of 90Zr(n2n)89m+gZr and 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb.
SAMPLE     The samples of Al and Cd 20 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm
           and 0.8 mm in thickness and 99.999% and 99.6% in
           purity were made of natural metal foils. The Cd
           sample in each group was sandwiched between two Al
           foils. The groups of samples were placed at 5 to 28 cm
           away from the neutron source.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) CH8403 coaxial HPGe detector made in China
           with a relative efficiency of 20% and an energy
           resolution of 3 keV at 1.33 MeV. The efficiency of
           detector was calibrated with the standard gamma
           source SRM4275. The error in the absolute efficiency
           curve at 2 cm was less than 1.5%, while the error of
           the activity of the standard source was less than 1%.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated for 6.6 hours.
CORRECTION Some corrections were made for the gamma-ray
           self-absorption in the samples, the cascade decay,
           the counting geometry, and the effect of neutron
           fluence fluctuation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The major uncertainties were calculated as
           quadratic sum of the errors such as the error of
           reference cross sections, efficiency of Ge(Li)
           detector, correction of sum peak, gamma-absorption in
           sample, variation of neutron flux during irradiation,
           counting statistics, gamma-ray intensities.
