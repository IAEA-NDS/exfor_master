REFERENCE  (J,JLNZ,32,57,1996) In Chinese.
FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The samples of Nb and Zr as foils 20 mm in diameter
           all were 99.99% purity, and 0.5 and 0.2 mm thickness.
           The distance between target and sample is 10~30 cm.
           The Nb sample in each group was sandwiched between
           two Zr foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron yield is around 1E12 n/s. The neutron
           energies at 0, 40, 60, 96, 110 and 130 degree were
           measured by silicon detector method.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 2.6 keV at 1.332 keV. The
           distance between sample and detector is 2 cm.
           (SI) Neutron energy was determined by silicon detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 6 hours, the angle
           is 0, 40, 60, 96, 110 and 130 degree between deuteron
           beam and target.
