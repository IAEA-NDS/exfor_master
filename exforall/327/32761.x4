FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) ZF-300-II intense neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron beam was 125 keV effective energy and
           20 mA current. The thickness of T-Ti target was about
           0.9 mg/cm2. The neutron flux fluctuation was
           monitored by a uranium fission chamber.
SAMPLE     Natural oxide mercury powder was pressed in to disc
           of 20 mm diameter and packed in a thin polyethylene
           foil. Each sample was sandwiched between two iron
           foils, which used to measure the neutron fluence on
           the sample. 5 groups of samples were placed
           respectively at 5 angles distances ranging from 0
           deg to 120 deg relative to the beam direction and
           distances of samples from the target were about 5 to
           25 cm.
METHOD     The irradiation lasted up to 61 hours with neutron
           intensity of about 1-3E12 n/s/4pi.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activities of the samples and monitors
           were measured by gamma ray spectroscopy using a
           CH8403 coaxial HPGe detector made in China in
           conjunction with a EG and ORTEC 7450 Multichannel
           Analyzer. The energy resolution of the detector is
           2.7 keV for 1.33 MeV gamma ray.
MONITOR    (26-FE-54(N,P)25-MN-54,,SIG) The abundance of 54Fe
           was 0.0058
DECAY-MON  (25-MN-54,312.2D,DG,834.8,0.9997)
CORRECTION Corrections could be made for variance of neutron
           yield during the irradiation. Some corrections were
           made for the effects of neutron intensity fluctuation,
           gamma ray self-absorption in the sample, the sum
           peak effects in the investigated nuclide and the
           counting geometry.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors were from counting statistics,
           standard cross sections, detector efficiency,
           weighting of samples, self-absorption of gamma-gay,
           coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays.
           (ERR-1) The error of the relative photopeak detection
           efficiency of the detector was 2%.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 2 of
