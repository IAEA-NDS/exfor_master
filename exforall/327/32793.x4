FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium gas chamber was used to produce
           neutrons by the bombardment with the deuteron beam.
SAMPLE     Natural uranium metal disks of 1.6 cm diameter X 0.05
           cm thickness with an average weight of about 1.5 g,
           packed in 0.2 mm thickness pure aluminium foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe-92X Spectrum Master of gamma-
           spectrometer. The resolution of the 120 cm3 HPGe
           detector was 1.85 keV (FWHM) for the 1.33 MeV gamma
           ray of Co-60.
           (FISCH) The sample sandwiched between two
           standardized thin samples was mounted in a double
           fission chamber, which covered with Cd of 1 mm
           thickness. The efficiency of the fission chamber was
           checked by 197Au(n,g) 198Au reaction with thermal
           neutrons.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight technique was used to measure
           the neutron spectrum.
           (GSPEC) Fission product activities were measured by
           HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry. Four samples were
           irradiated for a period varying from 0.5 to 30 h at a
           distance of about 5 cm from the neutron source in the
           direction of zero degree.
           (ABSFY) Fission rate was monitored by fission chamber.

CORRECTION Corrections were made for the gamma self-absorption,
           gamma geometry, gamma cascade coincidence losses and
           fission induced by background neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties (1 sigma) of the yields were
           obtained by consideration of all known sources of
           systematic and random errors such as mass
           determination of standard sample, detector efficiency
           of HPGe spectra system, statistic error of gamma-ray
           peak area, and corrections, with the usual rules of
           error propagation. Uncertainties of decay data are
           not included.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from TABLE 2 of
