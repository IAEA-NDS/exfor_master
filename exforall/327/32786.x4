FACILITY  1(VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
          2(VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 tandem accelerator
INC-SOURCE1(D-D) At 5.5 MeV based on the 4.5-MV Van de Graaff
           accelerator, a deuterium gas target 2.0 cm in length
           and about 0.30 MPa in pressure. The deuterium gas
           target was separated from the vacuum tube of the
           accelerator by a molybdenum foil 5 um in thickness.
           (A-BE) At 7.7 MeV based on the 4.5-MV Van de Graaff
           accelerator, a solid beryllium target about 500
           ug/cm2 in thickness.
          2(D-D) At 8.5, 9.5, and 10.5 MeV based on the HI-13
           tandem accelerator, a deuterium gas target 3.0 cm in
           length and about 0.25 MPa in pressure. The deuterium
           gas target was separated from the vacuum tube of the
           accelerator by a molybdenum foil 10 um in thickness.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin gridded ionization chamber was used as
           the charged particle detector. The separations of the
           cathode grid and the grid anode were 61 and 15 mm,
           respectively. The distance from the anode to the
           fission cathode (or to the shielding electrode) was 9
           mm. The working gas was Xe + 5% H2 mixtures and the
           pressures were 0.052 MPa at 5.5 MeV, 0.072 MPa at 7.7
           MeV, and 0.095 MPa at 8.5-10.5 MeV, separately.
SAMPLE     At four sample positions, back-to-back 56Fe samples,
           54Fe samples, Ta backings, and compound alpha sources
           were mounted, individually. The radii of the 56Fe and
           54Fe foil samples ranged from 21.5 to 23.0 mm and the
           corresponding thickness ranged from 0.54 to 0.58
           mg/cm2. The thickness of the Ta backing was 0.1 mm.

CORRECTION Contribution of the low energy neutrons were
            subtracted for 238U(n,f) above 7 MeV but ignored
            for(n,a) reactions.

           (ERR-3,2.1,11.4,U) The detected alpha events, 2.1-11.4%
           (ERR-4,0.1,0.4,U) The detected fission events, 0.1-0.4%

                  events, 0.4-2.5%
           (ERR-6,1.0,1.2) The detection efficiencies of fission
                  events, 1.0-1.2%
           (ERR-7,3.3,4.3) The ratio of the average fluence of
                  the main neutrons through the 238U sample over
                  those through the 56,54Fe samples, 3.3-4.3%
           (ERR-8,0.2,3.6) The proportion of fission events
                  induced by low-energy neutrons, 0.2-3.6%
