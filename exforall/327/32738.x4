FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     Three pellets, about 0.2 cm in thickness and 20 mm in
           diameter, were formed by pressing approximately 10
           gram of CeO2 (99.99% pure) powder at 980 Mpa. The
           samples were irradiated in contact with the target
           and sandwiched between two standard Nb foils (99.99%
           pure, 0.5 mm thick) of the same diameter.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the T(d,n)4He
           reaction with an effective deuteron beam energy of
           125 keV and beam current of 200 uA.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium detector, crystal
           diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm, with a
           relative efficiency of about 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 keV at 1.332 keV for 60Co. The
           detector was pre-calibrated for energy and efficiency
           by using the standard gamma ray sources 54Mn, 57Co,
           60Co, 109Cd, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am and 226Ra.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber allowing corrections to be made for
           small variations in the yield.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted
           approximately 2 hours with a yield about 3 to
           4E10 n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples were placed at
           0, 90, and 135 degree relative to the beam direction
           and centered about a 2.40 mg/cm2 thick T-Ti target at
           a distance of about 5 cm.

MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) The cross section of
           monitor reaction was taken from the reference.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the self-absorption of
           the sample at a given gamma-ray energy and the
           counting geometry.
