TITLE      Cross section of (n,2n) reaction on the low-abundance
           isotopes 156,158Dy at 13.5 and 14.8 MeV

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     The samples were made from natural Dy2O3 (99.995%
           purity) powder, and pellets, about 0.2 cm in
           thickness and 20 mm in diameter were obtained using
           the press method (10 t/cm2). Two such pellets were
           prepared. The samples were sandwiched between two
           standard Nb foils (99.999% purity, 0.5 mm thickness
           each) of the same diameter utilized to monitor the
           neutron fluence via the 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reaction.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A T-Ti target was used in the generator, with a
           thickness of 2.40 mg/cm2, and the diameter of the
           active zone was 12 mm. An effective deuteron beam
           energy of 134 keV and beam current of 260 uA.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (ORTEC,
           model GEM 60P, crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal
           length: 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of about
           68% and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV
           for 60Co. The efficiency of the detector was
           pre-calibrated using various standard gamma sources,
           namely 57Co, 60Co, 109Cd, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am
           and 226Ra.
           (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was located
           at 135 degree to accompany the a-particle tube placed
           at a distance of 1.10 m from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about
           60 min with a neutron yield about 3 to 4E10
           n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples were placed at 0 or
           135 degree angles relative to the beam direction and
           were centered about the tritium-titanium (T-Ti)
           target at distances of about 40 mm.

           T1/2=10.152 d in the article is typo and should read
           10.15(2) d which was used in the cross section
           calculation.
MONIT-REF  (,M.Wagner+,B,PH-DAT,13-5,1990) The cross sections
           for the 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb monitor reaction were
           obtained by interpolating the evaluated values
           reported by Wagner et al.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the self-absorption of the
           sample at a given gamma-energy, in the counting
           geometry, and the coincidence sum effect of cascade
           gamma-rays in the investigated nuclide (155Dy and
           157Dy).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis
           was carried out using the quadrature method.
           (ERR-1,1.0,6.1) Counting statistics 1.0-6.1%
           (ERR-2,2.,4.) Detector efficiency 2-4%
           (ERR-3) Standard cross sections uncertainties 1.5%
           (ERR-4) Weight of samples 0.1%
           (ERR-5) Self-absorption of gamma-ray 1%
           (ERR-6,0.1,1.) The cooling and measuring times 0.1-1%
           (ERR-7) The branching ratio of the characteristic
           gamma-rays, the half-life of the radioactive product
           nuclei, and so on 2%
