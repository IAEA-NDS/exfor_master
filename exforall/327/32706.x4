TITLE      Measurements of the 71Ga(n,g)72m+gGa cross section in
           the neutron energy range of 13.5 to 14.8 MeV

FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     (31-GA-71,NAT=0.398929) About 8 g of Ga2O3 powder of
           natural isotopic composition (>99.99% pure) was
           pressed at 10 ton/cm2, and a pellet, 0.4 cm thick and
           2.0 cm in diameter was obtained.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe detector with a relative efficiency of
           ~68%, and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at 1332 keV
           for Co-60.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out and
           lasted 121 min with a yield around 3E10 to 4E10
           n/(4pi*s). Cooled for 21 to 24 h after irradiation.

           The cross section of monitor reaction was determined by
           interpolation of the evaluated values of the reference.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target used in the
           generator was 2.40 mg/cm2. The effective source
           neutron energy at irradiation position was determined
           by cross section ratios for the (n,2n) reaction of Nb
           and Zr target.

COMMENT    Author did not do a vacant target experiment, but the
           new T-Ti target was used in the present work, and the
           time of irradiating the samples was short around 2 h.
           Furthermore, the samples were wrapped in cadmium foil
           and placed at the appropriate positions, which were
           both far and also near around 3 to 5 cm away from the
           center of the T-Ti target, so the influence of
           low-energy neutrons was reduced to a very low level.
