INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuteron beam current of 300 mA and beam
           energy of 2.0 MeV. The solid Tritium-Ti target had a
           thickness of approximately 1.20 mg/cm2.
SAMPLE     (49-IN-115,NAT=0.957) The 115In samples were pure
           indium with a purity of higher than 99.99%. Disks of
           pure indium, 0.5 mm in thickness and 10 mm in
           diameter, were sandwiched between two Au foils of 0.3
           mm in thickness. These foils were wrapped with 0.3 mm
           in thickness cadmium box and put into 90 deg angle
           relative to the deuteron beam direction. Samples at
           the high energy neutron emitting direction between 0
           deg and 60 deg, were not sandwiched between the Au
           foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Well-calibrated coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector (GEM30P4-76, ORTEC, USA), with an entrance
           window thickness of 1.5 mm, a sensitive volume of 75
           cm3 and a sensitive diameter of 60 mm. The detector
           has 20% relative efficiency and an energy resolution
           of 1.85 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) 8-h of irradiation.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the multiple scattering (S)
           and the flux attenuation (F). The total correction
           factor was calculated by F = S x D. For 2.95 MeV,
           3.94 MeV and 5.24 MeV, S were 1.013, 0.977 and 1.016,
           D were 0.960, 0.970 and 0.966, F were 0.973, 0.948
           and 0.981.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) total typical uncertainty 2.5%
           (ERR-S) Statistics of full energy peak 1.0%
           (ERR-1) Detecting efficiency 1.5%
           (ERR-2) Standard cross section of Au 1.5%
           (ERR-3,,1.0) Decay scheme less than 1.0%
           (ERR-4,,1.0) Background neutron less than 1.0%

METHOD     Neutron flux at 2.95 MeV was determined by using the
            198Au activity, while the neutron flux at 3.94
            and 5.24 MeV were determined by the 2.95 MeV 198Au
            activity and the (d,n) angular differential cross
            section ratio.
