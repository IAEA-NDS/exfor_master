DETECTOR   (HPGE) A low background, high efficiency HPGe
           detector (ORTEC, made in USA) with a relative
           efficiency of about 68%, and an energy resolution of
           1.7 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.
SAMPLE     Three ThO2 samples
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were placed at 0, 45 and 90 deg
           angles relative to the deuterium beam direction and
           centered about the T-Ti target at distance of 35 mm.
           The irradiation lasted about 110 min. The cooling time
           was about 5 min. The gamma collection were
           recorded every one min.

DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,,DG,1368.6,1.00)
CORRECTION Corrections were made for neutron flux fluctuation,
           self-absorption, geometry and coincidence.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main uncertainties came from the
           detection efficiency calibration, the statistical
           ones of characteristic gamma-ray peaks, and the
           uncertainties of other parameters.
           (ERR-S,1.5,4.0) The statistical uncertainties of
           characteristic gamma-ray peaks
           (ERR-1,2.0,2.5) The detection efficiency calibration
COMMENT    The isotope 134I of which characteristic gamma-rays
           were detected in the gamma-spectrum was concluded to
           be originated from 134Te decay. According to the
           cascade deduction formulism, the cross-section of
           232Th(n,f)134I was estimated to be below a value
            (~5.7E-3 mb) refered to the Minimal Detectable
           Activity (MDA) with the gamma measurements.
