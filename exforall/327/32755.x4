FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG) 4.5-MV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuterium gas cell is 2.0 cm in length and
           0.9 cm in diameter, and separated from the beam-line
           vacuum by molybdenum foil 5.0 um in thickness. The
           deuterium gas pressure was 3.0 atm and the incident
           deuteron beam current was about 3.0 uA.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) Neutron energy spread in one standard
           deviation.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Double-section gridded ionization chamber (GIC)
           with a common cathode was used as the alpha particles
           detector. The distance from the cathode to the grid
           was 61 mm, and that from grid to anode 15 mm. Working
           gas of the GIC was Kr + CO2 (2.83%).
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter was used to monitor the
           neutron flux.
           (FISCH) Absolute neutron flux was determined using a
           238U film sample placed in the GIC at the forward
           direction by counting the fission fragments.
SAMPLE     (62-SM-144,ENR=0.950) Sample material was 144Sm2O3.
           The thicknesses of the forward and backward samples
           were 4300 and 3370 ug/cm2, respectively, and the
           diameter of both samples were 44.0 mm.
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.99999) Sample material was 238U3O8.
           The thickness and diameter of the 238U sample were
           493.6 ug/cm2 (238U only) and 45.0 mm.
PART-DET   (A,FF) Alpha particles and fission fragments.
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
           A separate run was performed with 238U for neutron
           flux calibration.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty
           (ERR-1,20.,30.,U) Counting uncertainty for alpha
           particles 20~30%
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of detection efficiency for
           alpha particles 10.0%
           (ERR-3,,,U) Fission counts of 238U 4.0%
           (ERR-4) BF3 counts normalization 1.5%
           (ERR-5) Number of the 144Sm nucleus 1.0%
           (ERR-6) Number of the 238U nucleus 1.3%
           (MONIT-ERR) 238U fission cross section 1.0%
