FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 intense neutron generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 2.18 mg/cm2 thick solid T-Ti target was used,
           and neutrons with a yield of about 2E11 n/(4 pi*s)
           were produced. The variation of the neutron yield was
           monitored by accompanying alpha-particles, so that
           corrections could be made for the fluctuation of the
           neutron flux. The neutron energies in the irradiation
           positions were determined by the method of the cross
           section ratio for the 90Zr(n,2n)89m+gZr and
           93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reactions.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity induced in thorium oxide and
           monitor foils was measured nondestructively using a
           lowbackground, high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           spectrometer (ORTEC, made in USA, 68% relative
           efficiency, 1.7 keV energy resolution at 1332.5 keV
           of 60Co). The efficiency of the HPGe gamma spectrometer
           system was pre-calibrated using the standard point
           sources 22Na, 60Co, 137Cs and 152Eu etc.
SAMPLE     The thorium oxide (99.7% purity) powder for Thorium
           target was pressed into circular disks with a
           diameter of 14 mm. The thickness of the samples was
           about 2 mm. The disk was covered by a polyethylene
           bag and then sandwiched between two thin pure
           aluminum foils (99.99% purity and 50 um thickness).
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation lasted about 110 min. The
           samples were placed at 0, 45 and 90 degree angles
           relative to the deuteron beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at a distance of 3.5 cm.
           Measurements were carried out in two steps after the
           irradiation. Firstly, the activated samples were
           cooled off for about 5 min and then the gamma
           spectrum was measured for short half-life nuclides.
           The gamma-ray spectrum was recorded every minute, and
           more than one hundred gamma-ray spectrums were
           obtained finally. In the second step, the samples
           were measured again after cooling for about 24 h.
           About twenty gamma-ray spectrums were recorded every
           about 12 h.

            Qiang Wang (2021-3-3):
            The values were obtained by fitting and interpolating
            the data of ENDF/B-VII.1

CORRECTION The correction includes the geometry correction, the
           self-absorption of the sample at a given gamma-energy,
           the coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays, the
           neutron-fluctuation and the effect of the precursor
           nuclide.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties mainly come from the
           counting statistics of the full-energy peaks,
           detection efficiency. Meanwhile, other factors like
           the weight of samples, sample geometry,
           self-absorption of gamma-rays, coincidence summing
           effect of cascade gamma-rays, neutron energy and
           fluency uncertainties, the irradiation, cooling and
           measuring times and monitor reaction cross section
           were also considered.
