FACILITY   (CRASS,3CPRNPC)
SAMPLE     The ThO2 powder sample as foils 20x10 mm in diameter
           and thickness were 99.9% purity and 0.74336 g.
INC-SOURCE The source neutron were come from a critical device,
           which use a highly enriched Uranium cylinder and
           outer is a depleted Uranium reflector.
INC-SPECT  The neutron spectrum is similar the fission spectrum,
           and the average neutron energy is 1.42 MeV.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 7340 seconds.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG,,SPA)
CORRECTION Self-absorption correction and neutron source area
           correction is 0.958 and 1.01.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were obtained from Table 1 of
