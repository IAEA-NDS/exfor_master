FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) Pd-300 neutron generator
SAMPLE     Approximately 10 g of natural isotopic composition
            (99.99% pure) was made into a pellet of 0.156 cm
           thickness and 2.0 cm diameter. Three such pellets
           were prepared. Monitor foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.12
           mm thick) of the same diameter as the pellets were
           then attached in front and at the back of each sample.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by an effective deuteron
           beam energy of 134 keV and beam current of 260 uA.
           The T-Ti target used in the generator had a thickness
           of 2.8 mg/cm2, and the diameter of the active zone
           was 1.2 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-ray activities were determined by a high-
           purity germanium detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P,
           crystal diameter: 70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm,
           made in the United States) with a relative efficiency
           of about 68% and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at
           1332 keV for Co-60. The efficiency of the detector
           was pre-calibrated using various standard gamma
           sources, which were Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133,
           Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used at
           135 deg accompanying alpha-particle tube was 110 cm
           from the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about 3
           to 4 min with a yield around 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s) .
           The groups of sample were placed at 0, 90 or 135
           degree relative to the beam direction and centered
           about the T-Ti target at distances of about 40 mm.
           During irradiation, the neutron flux was monitored by
           accompanying alpha particles so that corrections
           could be made for small variations in the yield.
