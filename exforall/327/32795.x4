FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 Intense Neutron Generator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons in 14 MeV region with a yield of about
           5E10 n/s. Deuteron beam energy was 255 keV and beam
           current was 350 uA. The solid T-Ti target used in the
           generator was about 2.19 mg/cm2 thick.
SAMPLE     (72-HF-180,NAT=0.3508) The natural hafnium foils of
           99.99% purity and 3 mm thickness were made into
           circular samples with a diameter of 2.0 cm. Each of
           them was sandwiched between two disks of thin niobium
            (99.99% purity and 1 mm thickness) of the same
           diameter, and was then wrapped in 1mm thick cadmium
           foil (purity better than 99.95%). Groups of samples
           were placed at 0, 45, 90 and 135 deg angles relative
           to the deuteron beam direction. The distances of
           samples from the center of the T-Ti target were about
           3-5 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity
           germanium (HPGe) detector (crystal diameter 70.1 mm,
           crystal length 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of
           about 68% and an energy resolution of 1.69 keV at
           1.332 MeV was used to measure the gamma-ray activities.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time was 17 h.
