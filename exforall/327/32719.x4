FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP)
SAMPLE     The target was a 232Th metallic foil with 20 mm in
           diameter and  bout 1. gram in mass, and wraped by
           aluminium foil with 20 um thickness to restraint the
           escaping of fission fragments.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
METHOD     (RELFY,FPGAM) The relative cumulative yields of 62
           fission products were determined using direct
           gamma-ray spectrum method.
           The obtained relative chain yields were normalized
           so that their summation becomes 200%.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The volume of HPGe detector is 230 cm3, and
           the relative efficiency is 90%.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector is used to
           measure the accompanying alpha particle from
           T(d,n)4He reaction as neutron flux monitor.
ANALYSIS   Gamma spectrum area were determined with SPAN code.
           The relative cumulative yields were calculated by
           FYAUTOLS and FYNorm code. 62 fission products were
           measured, 47 mass cumulative yields data were
           directly obtained from measurement, and other 15 mass
           cumulative yields were obtained by interpolation and
           extrapolation method.
CORRECTION The main correction includes the gamma-ray
           self-absorption in sample and cascade gamma-ray
           emission.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty (<10.2%)
           (ERR-S,,8.) The uncertainty of gamma counting
           statistics (<8%)
           (ERR-1,,1.5) The uncertainty of gamma-ray cascade
           correction (<1.5%)
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of efficiency calibration(1.5%)
           (ERR-3,,1.2) The uncertainty of gamma-ray
           self-absorption (<1.2%)
           (ERR-4,,2.) The uncertainty of cumulative yields
           normalization (<2%)

STATUS     (TABLE) The fission yield and total uncertainty data
           are taken from Table 1, and the detailed uncertainties
           are taken from Table 2 at page 905 in
           J,CST,47,901,2013.
