INC-SOURCE (D-T) Tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was at distances
           of about 40 mm. Neutrons were produced with an
           effective deuteron beam energy of 136 keV and beam
           current of 260 uA.
SAMPLE     (63-EU-151,NAT=0.4781) Approximately 10 g of high
           purity Eu2O3 powder was pressed at 980 MPa, and a
           pellet, about 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was
           obtained. Three such pellets were prepared. Monitor
           foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm thick) of the same
           diameter as the pellets were then attached in front
           and at the back of each sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation lasted about 120 min with a yield
           of about 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples
           were placed at 0, 90 or 135 deg angle relative to the
           beam direction. After the irradiation process, three
           samples were cooled for 1 h-6.5 years.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector
            (ORTEC, model GEM 60P, crystal diameter: 70.1 mm,
           crystal length: 72.3 mm, made in USA) with a
           relative efficiency of about 68% and an energy
           resolution of 1.69 keV at 1332 keV for 60Co. The
           efficiency of the detector was pre-calibrated using
           various standard gamma sources, which were 57Co, 60Co,
           109Cd, 133Ba, 137Cs, 152Eu, 241Am and 226Ra.
           (SIBAR) The Au-Si surface barrier detector used to
           detect accompanying alpha particle was at 135 deg and
           a distance of 110 cm from the target.

CORRECTION F is the total correction factor of the activity:
           F=fs*fg*fc. fs, fg, and fc are the correction factors
           for: the self-absorption of the sample at a given
           gamma energy; the counting geometry; the coincidence
           sum effect of cascade gamma rays in the investigated
           nuclide, respectively. Correction factors for the
           self-absorption at 333.97/406.52 keV were 1.106/1.076
           for sample 1 (0.1427 cm thick), 1.128/1.092 for
           sample 2 (0.1718 cm thick), and 1.078/1.057 for
           sample 3 (0.1065 cm thick).
