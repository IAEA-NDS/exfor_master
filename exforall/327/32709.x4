FACILITY  1(CCW,3CPRAEP) 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator for
           sample irradiation
          2(VDGT,3CPRAEP) HI-13 tandem accelerator for accelerator
           mass spectrometry.
SAMPLE     The sample was made of 99.99% purity U3O8 powder with
           a diameter of 5 mm, and sandwiched between two disks
           made of thin Co foils. The high-purity (99.999%) Co
           monitors had diameters of 5 mm and thicknesses of 0.2
           mm.
DETECTOR  1(HPGE) A HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer consisting of an
           ORTEC GEM35-PLU HPGe detector (sensitive volume 110
           cm3), an ORTEC DESPEC-PLUS analyzer, and a PC
           computer. The emission rates of 810.7953-keV gamma
           rays from 59Co(n,2n)58Co reaction were measured with
           this system. The system has an energy resolution of
           1.83 keV and a relative efficiency of 47% (both are
           for 1.33 MeV gamma ray).
           (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was
           installed at 155 degree with respect to the D beam
           and a distance of 195 cm from the 3H-Ti target for
           the detection of accompanying alpha particles.
          2(SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was used as
           the energy detector for mass/charge discrimination.
           (MCPLT) The secondary electrons induced by the
           incoming ions at a 7 ug/cm2 carbon foil (with a
           diameter of 30 mm) were reflected by an electrostatic
           mirror, collected and multiplied by the MCPLT.
METHOD    1(ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was carried out
           and lasted 198 h with a neutron yield around 3E10 to
           5E10 n/(4pi*s).
          2(TOF) The TOF system consisted of a microchannel
           plate (start detector) and a gold-silicon surface
           barrier detector (stop detector). The two detectors
           were separated by a flight path of 1.8 m.
           (AMS) This facility is based on an HI-13 accelerator
           equipped with a cesium sputter ion source. The
           dedicated injector is composed of a 90 degree
           spherical electrostatic analyzer (SESA), a 112 degree
           double focusing analyzing magnet (DFMA) and some ion-
           optical elements. The SESA has a curvature radius of
           750 mm and maximum electric field strength of 4 kV/cm.
           The DFMA has a bending radius of 800 mm and a maximum
           magnetic field of 1.3 T.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) The thickness of the solid tritium-titanium
           target used in the generator was 1.0 mg/cm2 and the
           energy of incident D beam was 300 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty is the combination of the
           uncertainties in integral neutron flux, determined by
           gamma-ray spectrometric measurement of the activated
           monitor and the 236U/238U, determined by AMS.
           (ERR-1,,0.1) The uncertainties of the accompanying
           alpha particle counting statistics is less than 0.1%.
           (ERR-2,,0.1) Uncertainty of weight Co sample.
           (ERR-3,,0.1) Uncertainty of the composite correction
           factor F of the activity.
           (ERR-4,,0.1) Uncertainty of gamma ray branching ratio
           of 58Co (810.7953 keV).
           (ERR-5) The uncertainties of the HPGe efficiency
           calibration is 1.2%.
           (ERR-S) The uncertainty of gamma-ray peak counting
           statistics is 0.3%.
           (ERR-6) The uncertainty is come from the U236/U238
           ratio measurement by AMS method.
           (MONIT-ERR) The uncertainty in the cross-section of
           59Co(n, 2n) is 1.0%.
           (EN-ERR) Uncertainty of incident neutron energies is
           the quadratic summation of the uncertainties caused
           by the energy straggling of incident D in target and
           the angle divergence from target to samples.
STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor
           reaction data are taken from J,PR/C,87,014612,2013.
COMMENT    The uncertainties in incident neutron energies are
           included in neither the uncertainty of the neutron
           flux nor the cross-section values in the experiment.
           Since neither neutron source nor sample is a
           geometrical "point", neutron energy dispersion is
           inevitable in any experiment. Users of cross-section
           values may therefore be aware of the uncertainty in
           incident neutron energy. (Commented by author)

           correctly given in TABLE VI.
