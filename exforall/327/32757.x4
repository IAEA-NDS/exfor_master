FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) The ZF-300-II Intense Neutron Generator
SAMPLE     The samples of Nb and Zr as foils 20 mm in diameter
           all were 99.99% purity. The Nb sample in each group
           was sandwiched between two Zr foils.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron yield is around 3E12 n/s. T-Ti taret
           was around 0.9 mg/cm2 thick. The neutron energies at
           0, 50, 90 and 120 degree were determined by cross
           section ratios of 90-Zr(n,2n)89m+g-Zr and
           93-Nb(n,2n)92m-Nb.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A CH8403 coaxial high-purity germanium
           detector with a relative efficiency of 20% and an
           energy resolution of 3 keV at 1.33 MeV. In gamma ray
           measurement, the distance between sample and HPGe is
           2 cm.
           (FISCH) The neutron flux was monitored by a uranium
           fission chamber.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation was lasted 568 hours, the
           angle is 0, 50, 90 and 120 degree between deuteron
           beam and target. Counting was finished after 2-8 hrs
           after irradiation.
