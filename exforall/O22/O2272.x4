FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI) heavy-ion synchrotron SIS
INC-SOURCE Ru-96 ions from the linear accelerator (UNILAC) were
           first accelerated to 100 MeV/u in the heavy-ion
           synchrotron (SIS) and then stripped to the bare charge
           state of 44+ using a 11 mg/cm**2 carbon stripper foil.
SAMPLE     H(2) target of about 10E+13 particles/cm**2,
           a  luminosity of about 2*1025/cm**2/s  has been
           achieved.
ANALYSIS   The (p,g) cross section can be normalized
           by two methods using the theoretical single EC cross
           section and the calculated K-REC cross section at 90
           degree. The single EC cross section and the K-REC cross
           section can be predicted very well by different
           theoretical models.There are large uncertainties, about
           30%, in accurately determining the absolute beam
           intensities, target densities, and beam-target overlap
           at the ESR. To remove these large uncertainties, both
           the K-shell REC(radiative electron capture,accompanied
           by the emission of a photon) products (photons) and the
           EC products were registered by our detectors, which
           allowed to absolutely determine the (p,g) cross section
           using two normalization methods.
DETECTOR   (GE) The X-rays emitted from the atomic reactions were
           registered by a Ge detector
           (MWPC) The down-charged 96Ru ions produced by EC were
           recorded by a position sensitive multiwire proportional
           chamber-MWPC
           (SISD) The separated nuclear reaction products were
           detected by position-sensitive double-sided silicon
           strip detectors-DSSSDs.
METHOD     (EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty from tables.
           The uncertainty of the (p,g) cross section is dominated
           by the uncertainty of the calculated K-REC or EC cross
           section-20% and the uncertainty of N(pg) approx.20%,
           while the uncertainty of other factors is always less
           than 10%.
