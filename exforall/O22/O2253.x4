SAMPLE     Zr-nat foils, 10 mum as targets, Ti-nat foils, 10 mum
           acting as a monitor, placed in front of each target
           and Al foils, 10, 20, 100 mum, placed after each target
           foil, acting both as catcher for recoils particles and
           energy degrader, were used. Zr-96 is only 2.8% of
           natural Zr targets, the irradiation time was about 4 hr
           long.

ERR-ANALYS The overall uncertainty of each cross section value has
           been evaluated by taking the square root of the sum of
           the squares of individual uncertainties-reference cross
           section 8 or 12 %
           (ERR-1).Error in detector efficiency and sample-
           detector geometry-5%.
