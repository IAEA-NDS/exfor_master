METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
SAMPLE     Two stacks made of four 120Sn targets with an average
           thickness of 0.5mg/cm**2, evaporated on 93Nb catcher
           foils of 1.5mg/cm2,were irradiated by 6Li beams,
           delivered by the Tandem Van de Graaff, at E(lab)=25 MeV
           and at E(lab)= 21 MeV,respectively.
           From this data mean cross-section were deduced.
           The targets were characterized by determining their
           surface morphology-from this information functions for
           each target in the stack could be determined and the
           corresponding values of E-mean beam energy and
           E-effective could be calculated.
DETECTOR   (SILI)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty associated with the
           experimental procedure.Any information is absent.

COMMENT    The fusion cross-section plotted versus E-mean beam
           energy and E-eff. In the case of uniform targets it is
           expected that the E-eff energy is always shifted toward
           higher values with respect to E-mean energy because
           of the weighted average with the exponential increasing
           cross-section.

COMMENT    The fusion cross-section plotted versus E-mean beam
           energy and E-eff.For a nonuniform target with a cross-
           section independent of beam energy, Eeff < E-mean,
           since the incoming beam particles can locally explore
           a target thickness larger than the average one,
           thus reducing the average interaction energy.
