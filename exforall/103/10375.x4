AUTHOR     (P.W.Martin,R.McFadden,B.L.White)
TITLE      Small angle elastic scattering of 4.3 MeV neutrons from
            U, Bi, and Pb
FACILITY   (VDG,1CANUBC)
SAMPLE     The targets, of approximate thickness 10 mu-g/cm2, were
           rotated to increase the usable beam current to values
           of typically 2 mu-A.
METHOD     (ASSOP,TOF) Associated particle time-of-flight
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface barrier detector for 3He.
           (SCIN) NE218 for detection of scattered neutrons
           encapsulated in an aluminum container of rectangular
           dimensions (1.76 in. x 4 in. x 2.76 in. deep) and
           coupled to a 56AVP photomultiplier.
MONITOR    Neutron flux monitored by a large scintillator in
           coincidence with the 3He DETECTOR.
           Data normalized to data taken at the 15. degree angle.
CORRECTION Data corrected for effects of finite detector solid
           angle, multiple scattering, and air scattering.
