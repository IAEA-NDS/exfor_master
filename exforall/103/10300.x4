DETECTOR   (SOLST,STANK) Solid state fission fragment detector.
           Liquid scintillation tank neutron detector.
SAMPLE     The 257Fm was produced by successive neutron capture
           in Cm targets irradiated in the high-flux isotope
           reactor (HFIR) and processed at the trans uranium
           processing facility (TRU) at Oak Ridge National
           Laboratory. The 257Fm was further purified at Los
           Alamos by standard cation column procedures involving
           elution with ethanol-HCl and hot
           a-hydroxy-isobutyrate to separate the Fm from other
           actinides. The principle contaminant before
           separation was ~10**6 dis/min of 253Es. A solution of
           the purified source was evaporated on a 5*10**-3-in. Pt
            disk.
METHOD     (COINC) 257Fm source was positioned ~3 mm from a 1-
           cm-diam. by 30-microm-deep Si surface-barrier
           detector. A 252Cf source, prepared in a similar
           manner, was placed in the same position relative to a
           second surface barrier fission detector. The two
           sources, back-to-back, and their detectors were
           placed in a vacuum container in the center of a
           75-cm-diam. spherical Gd-loaded liquid scintillator
           tank having a l5-cm-diam. cylindrical hole through
           the center. The apparatus was placed in a low
           background room having thick concrete walls.
           Experimental data were collected for more than five
           months. During that time 10532 257Fm and 98659 252Cf
           fission events were detected. The 257Fm fission
           detection rate varied from 5.5 SF/h at the start of
           the experiment to 1.8 SF/h at the conclusion. From a
           least squares fit to the observed decay rate we
           obtained a value of 99.3 -+ 1.6 d for the half-life
           of 257Fm, in good agreement with the recently
           published value of 100.5 +- 0.2 d.
