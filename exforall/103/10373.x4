TITLE      Search for Doubly Radiative np Capture
FACILITY   (REAC,1USANBS)
INC-SPECT  Beam of MgO filtered thermal neutrons.
SAMPLE     Target material: 175 gm of H2O in a Lucite cylinder,
            6 cm in diameter by 7 cm long with 0.16-cm wall
            thickness.
METHOD     Searched for two-photon np capture by looking for
            gamma rays of the appropiate energy emerging in
            coincidence. Foreground plus background spectra
            accumulated in straightforward coincidence runs
            with H2O target in place.
           Accidental component measured in a delayed-coincidence
            spectra obtained with an arbitrary delay in one leg
            of the coincidence circuit using the H2O target.
           Background-prompt-coincidence spectra obtained using
             D2O in place of H2O.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 5 x 5 cm NaI detectors. RCA photomultiplier
            tubes used for fast timing and good energy resolution.
ASSUMED    (ASSUM,1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG) Assumed cross section.
            for single-photon capture, theoretically 302 mb.
CORRECTION Corrections are made for absorptions, detector
            efficiencies, solid angles and fraction of phase
            space available.
