TITLE      Neutron Diffraction Study of Hydrogen Bonding and
            Thermal Motion in Deuterated Alpha and Beta Oxalic
            Acid Dihydrate.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Brookhaven high Flux Beam Reactor. The neutron
            intensity at the sample was 1.5*10**6 n/cm**2/sec at
            a wavelength of 1.07 Angstrom.
SAMPLE     Alpha- and beta-DOX crystals.
METHOD     (DIFFR) Neutron diffraction
DETECTOR   (PROPC) BF3 counter
CORRECTION An absorption correction using an absorption
            coefficient of 0.13 cm**-1 computed from the true
            absorption cross sections of the atomic species
            present was applied to the alpha-DOX data. No
            absorption correction was made for beta-DOX.
           Extinction treated in the least-squares refinement.
ANALYSIS   Because the deuterium percentage in the crystal was not
            accurately known, the deuterium scattering lengths
            were considered parameters in a least squares program.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author
