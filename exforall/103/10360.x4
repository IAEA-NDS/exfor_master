TITLE      Isomeric-yield ratios of 117Cd in the (n,gamma) and
            (d,p) reactions
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMIT)
SAMPLE     About 5 mg of CdO powder enriched to 94.11% 116Cd.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Relative intensities of decay gammas were
            measured at several times following irradiation.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) Gamma ray spectra were measured with
            a 7.6 by 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) crystal, an earlier type
            planar Ge(Li) detector, and an 18-cm**3 coaxial
            Ge(Li) detector.
ANALYSIS   Isomer ratios determined as average of 4 experiments:
           . two from 117In 314-keV vs 554-keV gammas:
             samples counted 1 hr, 40 mins after irradiation
             and 2 hrs, 39 mins after irradiation.
           . one from 117In 554-keV gamma, 2 successive
             countings 9 hrs, 24 mins after irradiation and
             11 hrs, 21 mins after irradiation.
           . one from 117Cd spectra counted 5 hrs, 50 mins after
             irradiation for 59 mins.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Isomeric yield ratio error calculated from
            deviations from the average of four measured ratios.
