TITLE      Half-life of 178(m2)Hf and its neutron capture
            production
INC-SOURCE (REAC) MTR.
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum
SAMPLE     2 samples of natural Hf (18.5% 177Hf); 2 samples
            enriched to 84% 177Hf.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
            Six-month irradiation in a flux of 5*10**14 n/cm**2
            sec.
ANALYSIS   Determined from the decay data of the enriched samples,
            using an upper limit for the burn-up cross section of
            178Hf-m2 of 20 b determined from the two natural Hf
            samples.
           For each gamma ray spectrum, the intensities of six
            gamma rays from 178Hf-m2 were determined relative to
            that of the 270-keV line from 182Hf (half life 9E+06
            y). Data for each gamma ray analyzed by means of a
            weighted, least squares fit of a linear function to
            the logarithm of the observed relative intensity.
           For the production cross section analysis, data from
            all four samples were used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data errors due to uncertainties in the
            integrated flux at the sample (perhaps as high as 25%)
            and in the unknown burnup (20%).
           Some systematic errors in the half-life data, caused
            perhaps, by the long period involved.
