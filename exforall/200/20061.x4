TITLE       Measurements of the Fe-54(n,p)Mn-54 reaction cross
            section in the neutron energy range 2.3-3.8 MeV
AUTHOR     (A.Lauber,S.G.Malmskog)

INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE )
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDAE )  5.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction.
SAMPLE     (26-FE-54,ENR=0.859) 8 milligram of enriched Fe-54
            deposited on a 0.01 cm platinum backing,
            isotopic composition =
            85.9% Fe-54, 13.6% Fe-56, 0.19% Fe-57, 0.03% Fe-58.
           19 mu-m thick polyethylene foil for normalization.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)    Solid state of surface-barrier type, n-type
            silicon for charged particle detection. The detectors
           had a sensitive area of 12 mm in diam., lined with
           approximately 50. mu-g/cm2 gold.
           (LONGC) long counter for monitoring
           (SOLST) solid state proton recoil detector used as
            monitor simultaneously with the long counter
            Detector placed at 0 degree to the incident beam
            two measurements at different distance between
            neutron source and target.
ANALYSIS    For each neutron energy one iron, one background
            and one n-p scattering spectrum was registered.
            The neutron flux was determined by means of a hydro-
            genous radiator, detecting the scattered protons
            with the solid state detector and calculating the
            number of impinging neutrons from the well known
            cross section
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            total neutron-proton scattering
REL-REF    (M,20056001,J.Konijn+,J,NP,48,191,1963) -error analysis
            and experimental setup and measuring technique were
            nearly identical.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes:
            * error sources of the same order of magnitude as
            given in an earlier work (see REL-REF)
           (ERR-1,2.,20.) uncertainty in possible shift in
            pulse-height spectra when subtracting the background
            in the measurements
           (ERR-2,,1.) the error in the neutron-proton
                       scattering cross section           < 1%
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in the neutron monitoring with
                                        the proton recoil   2%
           (ERR-4,,3.) uncertainty in the solid angle
                       estimation  < 3%
