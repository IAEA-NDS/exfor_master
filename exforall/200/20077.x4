COMMENT     There is a large discrepancy in the cross section
            values obtained by the integral technique and those
            obtained from differential measurements.  The dis-
            crepancy is so large that the assumptions about the
            cross section shape (1/V dependence) seem to be
            seriously in error.
            The value of natural 71-Lu as spectral indicator is
            therefore small.
