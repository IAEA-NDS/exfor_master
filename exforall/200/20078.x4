TITLE       Determination of the diffusion parameters for thermal
            neutrons in water using the pulsed method and
            spherical geometries

FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDCTH)  SAMES type accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium
INC-SPECT   Thermalized neutrons
SAMPLE     Ten water-filled aluminium spheres, maximal
            eccentricity 0.15, diameters from 5 to 20 cm,
            covering a buckling range of 0.09 to 1.3 /cm2.
METHOD     (PLSED)    Pulse die-away in spherical tanks.
DETECTOR   (BF3)    Two BF3-proportional counters, mounted
            outside the spheres.
ANALYSIS    The decay constants from the different spherical tanks
            have been fitted to a second degree polynomial in the
            buckling. Each point was weighted by its variance.
            The cross-section is derived from the zero degree term
CORRECTION  The decay curves have been corrected for
            dead time and coincidences in the time analyzer.
            A small background.
            Higher modes by an iterative computer program
            dropping one by one the first channels until a
            constant lambda (decay constant) results.
            All data have been reduced on a constant temperature
            of 21.7 degrees-Celsius.
            Other corrections turned out to be negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error is due to the standard errors in
            the fitting to the buckling polynomial.
