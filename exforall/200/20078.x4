TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE DIFFUSION PARAMETERS FOR THERMAL
            NEUTRONS IN WATER USING THE PULSED METHOD AND
            SPHERICAL GEOMETRIES-
FACILITY   (CCW)      COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T)      DEUTERON-TRITIUM
INC-SPECT  .THERMALIZED NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE                TEN WATER-FILLED ALUMINIUM SPHERES,
            MAXIMAL EXCENTRICITY 0.15, DIAMETERS FROM 5 TO 20 CM,
            COVERING A BUCKLING RANGE OF 0.09 TO 1.3 /CM-SQ.
METHOD     (PLSED)    PULSE DIE-AWAY IN SPHERICAL TANKS.
DETECTOR   (BF3  )    TWO BF3-PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS, MOUNTED
            OUTSIDE THE SPHERES.
ANALYSIS   .THE DECAY CONSTANTS FROM THE DIFFERENT SPHERICAL TANKS
            HAVE BEEN FITTED TO A SECOND DEGREE POLYNOMIAL IN THE
            BUCKLING. EACH POINT WAS WEIGHTED BY ITS VARIANCE.
           .THE CROSS-SECTION IS DERIVED FROM THE ZERO DEGREE TERM
STATUS                DATA FROM PUBLICATION.

CORRECTION .THE DECAY CURVES HAVE BEEN CORRECTED FOR
           .DEAD TIME AND COINCIDENCES IN THE TIME ANALYZER.
           .A SMALL BACKGROUND.
           .HIGHER MODES BY AN ITERATIVE COMPUTER PROGRAMME
            DROPPING ONE BY ONE THE FIRST CHANNELS UNTIL A
            CONSTANT LAMBDA (DECAY CONSTANT) RESULTS.
           .ALL DATA HAVE BEEN REDUCED ON A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE
            OF 21.7 DEGREES-CELSIUS.
           .OTHER CORRECTIONS TURNED OUT TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
ERR-ANALYS .THE ERROR IS DUE TO THE STANDARD ERRORS IN THE FITTING
            TO THE BUCKLING POLYNOMIAL.
