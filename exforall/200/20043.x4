TITLE      -48-Cd-115 isomer yield ratios from deuteron fission of
            92-U-238  and from  50-Sn-118(D,ALPHA P),
            50-Sn-118(N,ALPHA), 49-In-115(D,2P), 49-In-115(N,P),
            and  48-Cd-114(D,P) reactions from 10 TO 25 MeV.-
FACILITY   (CYCLO)    200 cm cyclotron of Nobel Institute of
            Physics, Stockholm
INC-SOURCE (D-BE)    4-Be-9(D,N)5-B-10 reaction.
             About 50 mg samples ,compressed into 1 cm**2
            depressions in copper plugs,held by 13-15 microm
            platinum foils. Deuteron energy distribution has half
            width probably 2-3 MeV at used energies.
            Neutron flux approx.imately 1.0E+10 neutrons/cm**2/sec
            at targets.
INC-SPECT   "Neutron energies" quoted are calculated incident
            deuteron energies. Actual neutron spectrum was complex
            and extended from about 3 MeV above deuteron energy to
            near zero values. Effective neutron energy was roughly
            proportional to deuteron energy.
METHOD     (ACTIV)  Activation.
           (CHSEP)  Chemical separation.
           Cadmium dithizonate precipitates were deposited evenly
           over 5 cm**2 area by vacuum filtration onto 17 mg/cm**2
           filter paper backed with 9 mg/cm**2 scotch tape and
           covered with 3 mg/cm**2 polystyrene film.
           Decay of cadmium samples was followed for five months.
           Decay curves resolved into the 54 hr and 43 day
           components. No evidence of contamination by activities
           of other half-lives was found.Feather analysis of
           aluminum absorption curves verified the published
           values of the beta-particle energies.

           (20080122A) M.M.  Upper-lower case correction.
            REACTION codes were changed : sig-g/sig-m -> SIG/RAT
            in SF6 position.BIB information and common were added.
CORRECTION -Raw counting data were corrected for background and
            coincidence loss.
           -Corrected for beta- absorption in sample cover,counter
            window and the air in between.
           -Correction for backscattering of electrons in
            paper-scotch tape backing.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) quoted errors include:
           (ERR-1) 4 % in half-life, correction factors and
            detector efficiency,
           (ERR-2) 1 % in chemical yield,
           -the rest of the error is statistical.
