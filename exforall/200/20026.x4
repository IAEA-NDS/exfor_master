TITLE       A method for the absolute measurement of fast neutron
            flux with a large liquid scintillator
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDFOA)      Van de Graaff generator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    Pulsed neutron beam, Li7(p,n)Be7 reaction,
            Li-metal target
           .The neutrons from the source were collimated by a
            channel, 40 cm long, through a block of paraffin.
SAMPLE     .Li-6 glass containing 5.07 +- 0.08% by weight. The
            isotopic enrichment was 95.17 +- 0.02% in Li-6.
            Its dimensions were 1.5 inch diameter, and 3/8 inch
            thickness. At the same time detector.
METHOD      .A Li6-loaded glass scintillator was mounted
            in the centre of a liquid scintillator tank and the
            number of (n,alpha) reactions in the glass was re-
            gistered for a certain integrated neutron flux
            which was given by the scintillator tank.
            The efficiency of the scintillator tank for an
            isotropic neutron flux was well known. For the
            collimated beam used here, a lead scatterer was placed
            in the beam, which acts as a pure isotropic scatterer.
            (TRN) The fraction of neutrons scattered was
            determined by a transmission measurement (the total
            cross section is equal to the scattering cross sect.)
            in this way the incoming neutron flux can be
            absolutely measured.
           (TOF)    Time-of-flight techniques have been used to
            select the primary neutrons and discriminate against
            neutrons scattered in the glass, thermalized in the
            tank and scattered back in the glass-detector.
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    Li6-loaded glass scintillator
           (STANK)    Liquid scintillator tank for neutron flux
            measurement by looking at the fraction of the
            collimated neutron beam which was scattered by means
            of a lead scatterer mounted at the center of the tank
            just in front of the glass detector.
           .The flux is monitored by a current integrator on the
            lithium metal target and by a Li6-I(Eu) scintillator
            in a polyethylene sphere.
COMMENT    .Value somewhat lower than the value published in
            BNL-325.
           .Good agreement with the relative measurement of
            Schwarz et al, Nucl.Phys.63(1965)593.(See entry 20059)
REL-REF    (A,20059001,S.Schwarz+,J,NP,63,593,1965)
CORRECTION .Scattering in the scintillator liquid of neutrons
            scattered out of the beam increase the number of
            neutrons detected by the Li6-glass.  The use of time-
            of-flight techniques keeps this correction below 0.5%.
           .Correction for multiple scattering in the glass
            detector using a Monte-Carlo technique, 7%.
