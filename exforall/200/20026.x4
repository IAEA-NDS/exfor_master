TITLE      -A METHOD FOR THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF FAST NEUTRON
            FLUX WITH A LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR-
FACILITY   (VDG)      VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    PULSED NEUTRON BEAM LI7(P,N)BE7 REACTION
            LI-METAL TARGET
           .THE NEUTRONS FROM THE SOURCE WERE COLLIMATED BY A
            CHANNEL, 40 CM LONG, THROUGH A BLOCK OF PARAFFIN.
SAMPLE     .LI-6 GLASS CONTAINING 5.07 +- 0.08 PERCENT OF
            95.17 +- 0.02 PERCENT (IN LI-6) ENRICHED LITHIUM.
            ITS DIMENSIONS WERE 1.5 INCH DIAMETER, AND 3/8 INCH
            THICKNESS. AT THE SAME TIME DETECTOR.
METHOD     .A LI6-LOADED GLASS SCINTILLATOR WAS MOUNTED
            IN THE CENTRE OF A LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TANK AND THE
            NUMBER OF (N,ALPHA) REACTIONS IN THE GLASS WAS RE-
            GISTERED FOR A CERTAIN INTEGRATED NEUTRON FLUX
            WHICH WAS GIVEN BY THE SCINTILLATOR TANK.
            THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SCINTILLATOR TANK FOR AN
            ISOTROPIC NEUTRON FLUX WAS WELL KNOWN. FOR THE
            COLLIMATED BEAM USED HERE, A LEAD SCATTERER WAS PLACED
            IN THE BEAM, WHICH ACTS AS A PURE ISOTROPIC SCATTERER.
            THE FRACTION OF NEUTRONS SCATTERED WAS DETERMINED BY
            A TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT (THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION
            IS EQUAL TO THE SCATTERING CROSS SECTION)
            IN THIS WAY THE INCOMING NEUTRON FLUX CAN BE ABSOLUTEL
            MEASURED.
           (TOF  )    TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED TO
            SELECT THE PRIMARY NEUTRONS AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
            NEUTRONS SCATTERED IN THE GLASS, THERMALIZED IN THE
            TANK AND SCATTERED BACK IN THE GLASS-DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (GLASD)    LI6-LOADED GLASS SCINTILLATOR
           (STANK)    LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TANK FOR NEUTRON FLUX
            MEASUREMENT BY LOOKING AT THE FRACTION OF THE
            COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM WHICH WAS SCATTERED BY MEANS
            OF A LEAD SCATTERER MOUNTED AT THE CENTER OF THE TANK
            JUST IN FRONT OF THE GLASS DETECTOR.
           .THE FLUX IS MONITORED BY A CURRENT INTEGRATOR ON THE
            LITHIUM METAL TARGET AND BY A LI6-I(EU) SCINTILLATOR
            IN A POLYETHYLENE SPHERE.
COMMENT    .VALUE SOMEWHAT LOWER THEN THE VALUE PUBLISHED IN
            BNL 325.
           .GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATIVE MEASUREMENT OF
            SCHWARZ ET AL, NUCL.PHYS.63(1965)593.(SEE ENTRY 20059)
