TITLE      -RESONANCE PARAMETER DETERMINATION OF THE MAIN
            RESONANCE OF INDIUM BY ACTIVATION FOILS.-
FACILITY   (REAC)     REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     TRIGA MARK-II REACTOR, THERMAL NEUTRONS
            BLOCKED OFF BY A CADMIUM ABSORBER OF 1.5 MM THICK.
INC-SPECT  .COLLIMATED NEUTRON BEAM.
SAMPLE                TIN-INDIUM ALLOY, 2.5 PER-CENT INDIUM
            ALLOYED WITH THE TIN BACKING MATERIAL, DISCS OF 20 MM
            DIAMETER AND 50 MICRON THICKNESS.
           .CADMIUM ABSORBER FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS 1.5 MM THICK.
METHOD                SELF-INDICATION BY VARIATION OF THE
            TEMPERATURE.
ANALYSIS   .RATIO OF SATURATION FOR THE FOIL
            WITHOUT ABSORBER AND THE FOIL WITH ABSORBER,
            MEASUREMENTS AT TWO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
            (4.2 AND 239 DEGREES KELVIN) YIELD THE
            TWO RESONANCE PARAMETERS GAMMA AND SIGMA(R).
