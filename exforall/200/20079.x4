TITLE       Resonance parameter determination of the main
            resonance of indium by activation foils
AUTHOR     (C.M.Fleck)

INSTITUTE  (2AUSATI)
FACILITY   (REAC,2AUSATI)  TRIGA Mark-II reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) thermal neutrons
            blocked off by a cadmium absorber of 1.5 mm thick.
INC-SPECT  .Collimated neutron beam.
SAMPLE      Tin-indium alloy, 2.5% indium alloyed with the tin
            backing material, discs of 20 mm in diam. and
            50 micron thickness.
            Cadmium absorber for thermal neutrons 1.5 mm thick.
            The In-content was determined as having a value of
            0.9688 +- 0.002 mg/cm2 at 293.degr.Kelvin.
            At 4.2 degr.Kelvin, a minor deviation of the surface
            density of 0.9815 +- 0.002 mg/cm2 was noted.
METHOD     (STTA) Two discs stuck to each other and thereby formed
           a foil sandwich.
            Self-indication by variation of the  temperature.
ANALYSIS    Ratio of saturation for the foil
            without absorber and the foil with absorber,
            measurements at two different temperatures
            (4.2 and 239 degrees Kelvin) yield the
            two resonance parameters gamma and sigma(r).
DETECTOR    The activities of both discs were measured
            simultaneously in two counters of 2Pi geometry, where
            one counter was calibrated in relation to the other.
CORRECTION .For side resonances, 1/V contribution and
            influence of the cadmium wing, computer evaluation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors resulted from taking the average
            of the error ellipsis which was determined by the
           computer.
