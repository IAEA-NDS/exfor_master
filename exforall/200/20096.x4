TITLE      -THREE-PARTICLE EXCITATION IN LU-177.-
FACILITY   (REAC )    DR-2 REACTOR,DENMARK
INC-SOURCE (REAC )    NEUTRON FLUX OF 8.0E+12 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ/SEC.
            OF OR-2 REACTOR WAS USED FOR 5 DAYS.
INC-SPECT  .REACTOR NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE                LU(2)-O(3).
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION FOR HALF-LIFE MEASUREMENTS.
           (CHSEP)    A RADIOCHEMICAL ANLYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY
            CATION EXCHANGE TECHNIQUE WITH AMMONIUM-HYDROXY-
            ISOBUTYRATE SOLUTION.
           .THE SAMPLE WAS SEPARATED IN THE COPENHAGEN ISOTOPE
            SEPARATOR.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    NAI(TL) CRYSTAL. 50 * 50 MM-SQ WELL-TYPE.
            THE DETECTOR WAS HEAVILY SHIELDED.
           .DAILY COUNTINGS PERFORMED WITH ABOUT 1 PER CENT
            STATISTICAL ACCURACY OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT 4 MONTHS.
ANALYSIS   .THE RESULTING HALF-LIFE IS 155 +- 5 DAYS.
           .THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE LU-176(N,GAMMA)LU-177-M1
            REACTION WAS CALCULATED FROM HALF-LIFE MEASUREMENTS
            AND IRRADIATION DATA.
COMMENT    .FURTHER STUDY FOR SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS WAS DONE
            USING THE ISOTOPICALLY SEPARATED SAMPLE.
