TITLE       Three-particle excitation in Lu-177
AUTHOR     (M.Jorgensen, O.B.Nielsen, G.Sidenius)
REFERENCE  (J,PL,1,321,1962)
INSTITUTE  (2DENCOP)
FACILITY   (REAC,2DENCOP)    DR-2 reactor, Denmark
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Neutron flux of 8.0E+12 neutrons/cm2/sec
            of OR-2 reactor was used for 5 days.
INC-SPECT   Reactor neutrons.
SAMPLE     5 mg of natural Lu(2)-O(3)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation for half-life measurements.
           (CHSEP)A radiochemical analysis was performed by
            cation exchange technique with ammonium-hydroxy-
            isobutyrate solution.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal. 50 * 50 mm2 well-type.
            The detector was heavily shielded.
            Daily counting performed with about 1%
            statistical accuracy over a period of about 4 months.
ANALYSIS    The resulting half-life is 155 +- 5 days.
            The cross section for the Lu-176(n,gamma)Lu-177-m1
            reaction was calculated from half-life measurements
            and irradiation data.
COMMENT     Further study for spectroscopic measurements was done
            using the isotopically separated sample.
ERR-ANALYS  No information.
