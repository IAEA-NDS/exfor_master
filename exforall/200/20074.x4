AUTHOR     (I.Asplund-Nilsson,H.Conde,N.Starfelt)
TITLE       An absolute measurement of nu-bar of Cf-252
METHOD     (COINC)    Measurement of coincidences between fission
            and capture gamma rays
             Neutron detection efficiency = 0.6905+-0.0053
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    Fission chamber mounted in centre of axial
            tube through scintillation tank, which is a
           (STANK)    60 cm glass bulb, filled with p-terphenyl
            and 'POPOP' in tri-ethylbenzene, loaded with cadmium
            octoate.  Cadmium/hydrogen atomic ratio about 0.002.
            12 photomultipliers uniformly distributed over sphere
            surface
COMMENT      n-detection efficiency determined by n-p scattering
            in anthracene crystal replacing the fission chamber
            nu-bar=1.
            Adding the number of delayed neutrons per fission
            0.86E-2,  a total nu-bar of 3.778 +- 0.038 is obtained
            (error given in 72VIENNA,,277,7211 is wrong according
            to private communication with author).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty includes counting statistics,
           estimated errors from double scattering of neutrons
           on carbon and hydrogen or two hydrogen atoms, proton
           escape (end effect), escape of neutrons through the
           channel, tritium and/or air content of deuterium
           target and pile-up corrections.
           (ERR-1) Error in correction other then counting
           statistics about 20%.
           (ERR-2) Inaccuracy in fission neutron spectrum gives
           about 0.5%
