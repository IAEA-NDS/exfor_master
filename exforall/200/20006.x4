              Desintegration products removed after each
              measurement in order to reduce parasitic
              gamma background.
           -Copper,  powder sample of the same density
               and the same geometry.

            Al - 7.50%.Sample density 2.30 g/cm**3. Used to obtain
            correction for effects of neutron scattering in sample
            and surrounding materials.

ANALYSIS  2 Cross sections derived from ratios.
MONITOR   2(29-CU-0(N,G),,SIG)
PART-DET   (G)    For thorium  1.8 - 2.2 MeV,
                      for copper   3.  - 6.  MeV
                             and   1.8 - 2.4 MeV in the cases
            where both elements has been measured in a common
            gamma energy range.
STATUS     (TABLE) Private communication 18/11/1968.Data in Table.
            In Table of 1-st reference the experimental and
            corrected ratios of cross-sections are presented.
             Graph of cross-section is in REL-REF, page 10-85.
CORRECTION  Three types of background,
           -From gamma activity of thorium decay products,
            minimized by chemical separation.
           -From background in the reactor hall,
            minimized by a heavy lead shield round sample and
            detector, surrounded by 10 cm paraffin mixed with
            H(3)-B-O(3),
            both backgrounds are recorded in 140 channels of the
            256 channel analyzer.
           -Scattering of neutrons in the sample and giving
            capture gammas from elsewhere.
            Minimized by a B(4)-C shield round sample,
            measured using a sample with the same scattering and
            without gammas above 1.8 MeV .
           -Not corrected for selfscreening, but this will cancel
            in the ratio provided the macroscopic cross sections
            are the same for the two samples.
            Applied correction factors are given in Table of
            reference for energies from 0.253 (1.00) to 3.40 eV
             (0.920).
