TITLE      -THE (N,2N) CROSS SECTION OF BE-9 IN THE ENERGY REGION
            2.0 - 6.4 MEV-
FACILITY   (VDG)      5.5 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (P-T)      T(P,N)3HE REACTION UP TO 4.6 MEV
            THIN ADSORBED TRITIUM TARGET
           (D-D)      D(D,N)3HE REACTION ABOVE 4.6 MEV
SAMPLE                BE SAMPLE IN THE FORM OF DISCS
            3 CM IN DIAMETER AND WITH A LENGTH CORRESPONDING
            TO ABOUT 1/3 OF THE TOTAL MEAN FREE PATH FOR NEUTRONS.
METHOD     (COINC)    THE TWO NEUTRONS IN THE (N,2N) REACTION
            WERE DETECTED BY A LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR BY
            MEASURING THE CORRELATION TIME BETWEEN THE PULSES DUE
            TO THE TWO NEUTRONS.
           .IRON COLLIMATOR, 20 CM SQUARE, 1.5 M LONG
            SURROUNDED BY LEAD AND PARAFFIN SHIELDS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     GD-LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR NE313 IN A
            CYLINDRICAL TANK, 50 CM IN DIAMETER, 50 CM IN LENGTH
            SIX 12.7 CM PHOTOMULTIPLIERS.
           .DETECTOR EFFICIENCY DETERMINED ON 85+-2 PER-CENT BY A
            98-CF-252 NU-BAR MEASUREMENT, (NU-BAR = 3.772+-0.020).
           .TIME CORRELATION MEASUREMENTS VIA A COINCIDENCE
            CIRCUIT, ON THERMAL CAPTURE PULSES, (PROMPT RECOIL
            PULSES ARE REMOVED).
           .CARBON SCATTERER USED TO DETERMINE ZERO CORRELATION.
           (SCIN )    PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR LOCATED AT THE CENTER
            OF THE CHANNEL THROUGH THE SCINTILLATOR TANK DURING
            ABSOLUTE NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENT RUNS.
           (LONGC)    A LONG COUNTER AT A DISTANCE OF 5 M FROM THE
            TARGET WAS USED AS A MONITOR OF THE RELATIVE NEUTRON
            FLUX.
ANALYSIS   .THE (N,2N) CROSS SECTION WAS CALCULATED USING THE
            TOTAL CROSS SECTION OF BE-9 FROM THE COMPILATION BY
            DOHERTY, AEEW-M513(1965), IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
            SAMPLE THICKNESS.
COMMENT    .THE (N,2N) CROSS SECTION INCREASES RAPIDLY ABOVE THE
            THRESHOLD AT 2.70 MEV FOR THE INELASTIC NEUTRON
            SCATTERING TO THE 2.43 MEV LEVEL OF BE-9, WHICH SUB-
            SEQUENTLY DECAYS BY NEUTRON EMISSION.
           .THERE ALSO EXISTS A SMALL (N,2N) CROSS SECTION IN THE
            ENERGY RANGE 2.0 - 2.7 MEV.

CORRECTION .MULTIPLE SCATTERING WAS CORRECTED BY USE OF A MONTE-
            CARLO PROGRAMM.
            THE CORRECTION WAS 14 PERC. AT 4.2 MEV AND THE ERROR
            WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THEN 2 PER-CENT.
           .VARIATION OF NEUTRON DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WITH NEUTRON
            ENERGY.  THE CORRECTION WAS 8 PERC. AT 6.4 MEV
           .ABSORPTION OF THE (N,2N) NEUTRONS BY THE (N,ALPHA)
            PROCESS IN THE BE SAMPLE. THE CORRECTION WAS 2 PERC.
            AT 6.4 MEV WITH AN ESTIMATED ERROR OF 1 PER-CENT.
           .NEUTRON ESCAPE ALONG THE AXIAL CHANNEL OF THE
            SCINTILLATOR TANK.  THE CORRECTION WAS (2+-1) PERC.
           .SPECTRUM OF INCIDENT NEUTRONS.  THE CORRECTION WAS
            (3+-1) PERC. AT 6.40 MEV
           .NEUTRON FLUX CORRECTION (2+-1) PER-CENT.

           .TOTAL ERROR IN THE ENERGY REGION ABOVE 2.80 MEV 8 PERC
           .THE VALUE IS HOWEVER (NOT LINEARLY) DEPENDENT ON THE
            VALUES OF CF-252 NU-BAR AND OF THE BE TOTAL
            CROSS-SECTION USED.
