TITLE       Measurement of nu in fast neutron fission of Th-232
            and U-238
FACILITY   (CCW,2SWDFOA)    Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-D)      D(d,n)He-3 for 3.6 MeV neutrons
           (D-T)      T(d,n)He-4 for 14.9 MeV neutrons
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidences between fission fragments and
            prompt neutrons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)    Liquid scintillation detector
            50 x 50 cm, 6 photomultipliers
           (FISCH)    Fission chamber in the center of the
            cylindrical scintillator tank.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU)
CORRECTION .For pile up (3%.), subtraction of background,
           .Spontaneous fission of U-238 (1%),
           .Random coincidences (less then 0.5%)
           .Variation of the detection efficiency (0.5%)
           .Escape of neutrons to the axial tube of the tank(0.5%)
           .Fission caused by neutrons which had lost energy in
            the collimator (1 to 2.5%)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  5 - 10 separate runs per energy and element
            were performed to give a statistical accuracy

REACTION   (90-TH-232(N,F),PR,NU)
SAMPLE     The total amount of Th-232  was approximately 220 mg
           distributed on five plates, while the amount of Cf-252
           gave about 80 spontaneous fissions per minute.
PART-DET   (PN,FF)    Prompt neutrons and fission fragments in
            coincidence.
COMMENT    .The values are in good agreement with earlier accurate
            measurements.
           .The parameters of the equation
            nu-bar(E(n)) = nu-bar(0) + a*E(n), where E(n) is the
            neutron energy in MeV have been obtained by fitting a
            straight line to the available data using the least
            square method yielding nu-bar(En) = 1.87+0.177*En.
STATUS     (SPSDD,20112002) Data have also been published by
           H.Conde and M.Holmberg, Salzburg Conf.,vol.2,(1965)p.57
            assuming different corrections. (See Subent 20112.002)
            nu-bar = 2.41+-0.10 at 3.6 +-0.3 MeV and
            nu-bar = 4.32+-0.13 at 14.9+-0.3 MeV.
