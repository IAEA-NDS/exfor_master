TITLE       Thermal neutron activation cross-section of Se-74
REFERENCE  (J,JNE,21,373(2),1967)
AUTHOR     (E.Steinnes)
INSTITUTE  (2NORKJL)
FACILITY   (REAC,2NORKJL)    JEEP I reactor,
            In thermal column (cadmium-ratio of gold about 1.0E+4)
           In isotope channel (cadmium-ratio of gold about 2.6).
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)  JEEP I reactor, thermal column and
           (REAC ) isotope channel, (pile neutrons).
SAMPLE     (34-SE-74,NAT=0.0087) About 10 millig. of elementary
            Se or Se-O(2).
            The sodium monitor samples were about 10 mg of Na
            either in the form of sodium carbonate or as an
            aqueous solution of sodium chloride.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3.x3.in. NaI(Tl)-crystal, multichannel analyzer
ANALYSIS    Integration of the counts in the 280 keV photopeak.
            The value given is the mean value of 3 thermal column
            and 3 pile measurements reduced to thermal energies.
            The calculations were based on the complex peak of
            Se-75 at about 280 keV (265 + 280 + 305 keV), and
            either the 1370 keV or the 2760 keV peak of Na-24.
              Branching ratio of (265+280+305, keV) gamma-rays =
            85% total.

CORRECTION  Correction applied for epithermal activation (when
            pile neutrons have been used) by irradiating separate
            samples within Cd-cover.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation quoted.
            The accuracy of the mean value presented is mainly
            dependent on the accuracy of the nuclear data used
            in the calculations.
