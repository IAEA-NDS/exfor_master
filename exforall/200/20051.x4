TITLE      -THERMAL NEUTRON ACTIVATION CROSS-SECTION OF SE-74.-
FACILITY   (REAC )    JEEP I REACTOR,
           .IN THERMAL COLUMN (CADMIUM-RATIO OF GOLD ABOUT 1.0E+4)
           .IN ISOTOPE CHANNEL (CADMIUM-RATIO OF GOLD ABOUT 2.6).
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)    JEEP I REACTOR, THERMAL COLUMN AND
           (REAC )    ISOTOPE CHANNEL, (PILE NEUTRONS).
SAMPLE                ABOUT 10 MILLIG. OF ELEMENTARY SE OR SE-O(2)
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    NAI(TL)-CRYSTAL, MULTICHANNEL ANALYZER.
ANALYSIS   .INTEGRATION OF THE COUNTS IN THE 280 KEV PHOTOPEAK.
           .THE VALUE GIVEN IS THE MEAN VALUE OF 3 THERMAL COLUMN
            AND 3 PILE MEASUREMENTS REDUCED TO THERMAL ENERGIES.
MONITOR    (11-NA-23(N,G)11-NA-24,,SIG)
            CROSS-SECTION = 531+-8 MILLIBARN.
COMMENT    .FOLLOWING DATA USED IN CALCULATIONS,
            NA-24, T(1/2) = 15.0 HOURS.
            SE-75, T(1/2) = 120. DAYS.
            ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCE OF SE-74 = .78 PERCENT.
            BRANCHING RATIO OF (265+280+305, KEV) GAMMA-RAYS =
            85 PERCENT TOTAL.

CORRECTION .CORRECTION APPLIED FOR EPITHERMAL ACTIVATION (WHEN
            PILE NEUTRONS HAVE BEEN USED) BY IRRADIATING SEPARATE
            SAMPLES WITHIN CD-COVER.
ERR-ANALYS .STANDARD DEVIATION QUOTED.
           .ACCURACY MAINLY DEPENDENT ON NUCLEAR DATA FOR SE-75
            AND NA-24. IF THE ERROR IN THE NUCLEAR DATA IS
            5 PER-CENT OR BETTER THE VALUE CAN BE GIVEN
            AS 52+-3 BARN.
