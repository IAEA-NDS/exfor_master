TITLE      -HALF-LIFE MEASUREMENTS OF TL-204 AND AG-110-M1.-
FACILITY   (REAC)     REACTOR R1
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     IN REACTOR R1, FOR 1 WEEK.
INC-SPECT   REACTOR NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE                AG-FOILS WITH A THICKNESS OF 12 MG/CM-SQ.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION
                      CADMIUM RATIO MEASUREMENTS
           .THE ACTIVATION RESONANCE INTEGRAL WAS DEDUCED BY
            COMPARING THE CADMIUM RATIO OF THE SAMPLE WITH THE
            CADMIUM RATIOS OF THIN GOLD FOILS, WHICH WERE
            IRRADIATED SIMULTANIOUSLY TOGETHER WITH THE SAMPLE.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)    GEIGER-MUELLER COUNTER SET UP (MX 123).

              SIGMA(0.0253 EV)=3.2+-0.4 BARNS
            FROM BNL-325 (1958).
COMMENT    .THE HALF-LIFE OF AG-110-M WAS MEASURED AS 249+-3 DAYS.
