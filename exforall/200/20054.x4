TITLE       Half-life measurements of Tl-204 and Ag-110-m
AUTHOR     (R.Nilsson)
REFERENCE  (J,NP,29,66,1962)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE )
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDAE )     Reactor R1
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     In reactor R1, for 1 week.
INC-SPECT   Reactor neutrons.
SAMPLE      Ag-foils with a thickness of 12 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
                      cadmium ratio measurements
            The activation resonance integral was deduced by
            comparing the cadmium ratio of the sample with the
            cadmium ratios of thin gold foils, which were
            irradiated simultaneously together with the sample.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)    Geiger-Mueller counter set up (MX 123).

ADD-RES     The half-life of Tl-204 was found. =(3.91-4-0.09)y
STATUS     (TABLE) From the text of Nucl.Phys.,29(1961)66
CORRECTION  The Au-activities were extrapolated to zero thickness
            but no corrections of that kind were applied to the
            Ag-activities
