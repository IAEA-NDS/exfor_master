TITLE      -THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL OF GOLD-
FACILITY   (REAC)     HEAVY WATER, NATURAL URANIUM REACTOR R1
           (CHOPF)    FAST CHOPPER.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     REACTOR NEUTRON BEAM EXTRACTED FROM THE
            CENTRE OF THE REACTOR BY MEANS OF A GRAPHITE BLOCK AS
            A SCATTERER.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL FLUX OF 8.0E+7 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ/SEC.
           .SPECTRUM MEASURED WITH THE FAST CHOPPER.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION
                      CADMIUM RATIO MEASUREMENT OF THIN FOILS IN A
            NEUTRON BEAM. COMPARISON WAS MADE WITH A 1/V DETECTOR
            AND THE NEUTRON SPECTRA WERE MEASURED WITH A CHOPPER.
