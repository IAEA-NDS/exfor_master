TITLE       The resonance integral of gold
AUTHOR     (K.Jirlow,E.Johansson)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE )
REFERENCE  (J,JNE/A,11,101,1960)
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDAE ) Heavy water, natural uranium reactor R1
           (CHOPF,2SWDAE )    fast chopper.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Reactor neutron beam extracted from the
            centre of the reactor by means of a graphite block as
            a scatterer.
DETECTOR   (BF3) five BF, counters forming a rectangular
            detector area of 150 x 470 mm.
INC-SPECT  .Thermal flux of 8.0E+7 neutrons/cm2/sec.
           .Spectrum measured with the fast chopper.
SAMPLE      The lead-gold foils were 0.1 mm thick and contained
            0.1 mg/cm2 gold. The foils were supported by 1.0 mm
            thick aluminium disks.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
                      cadmium ratio measurement of thin foils in a
            neutron beam. Comparison was made with a 1/V detector
            and the neutron spectra were measured with a chopper.

COMMENT     Resonance integrals also estimated from the resonance
            parameter data of BNL-325, computed value of
            resonance integral = 1529 +- 70 barns.
STATUS     (TABLE)  Data from p.106 of J.Nucl.En.,A11(1960)101
CORRECTION  The main correction depends on deviation from the 1/v
            law of the absorption cross-section in the thermal
            region
            Self-absorption correction of 4 barns
