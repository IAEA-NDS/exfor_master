                      CADMIUM RATIO MEASUREMENTS IN A NEUTRON BEAM
           .COMPARISON WAS MADE WITH THE CADMIUM RATIO OF
            A 1/V DETECTOR, (A THIN B-F(3) COUNTER).
           .THE NEUTRON SPECTRA WERE MEASURED WITH A CHOPPER

CORRECTION .FOR DEVIATION OF THE FLUX FROM 1/E DEPENDENCE
           .FOR SCATTERING AND SELF-ABSORPTION OF NEUTRONS IN THE
            FOILS.  MULTIPLE SCATTERING AS WELL AS ENERGY CHANGES
            IN THE COLLISIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
ERR-ANALYS .THE UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF
            RESONANCE PARAMETERS AND BY EFFECT OF DOPPLER
            BROADENING HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FINAL VALUES FOR
            THE RESONANCE INTEGRALS.

COMMENT    .THE MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE ON THE ISOMER COBALT-60-M
            WHOSE HALF-LIFE IS 10.4 MIN.
           .IN THE EVALUATION WAS ASSUMED THAT THE CROSS-SECTION
            RATIOS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE 10.4 MIN AND 5.2 YEAR
            STATES ARE THE SAME FOR THERMAL AND RESONANCE NEUTRONS
            AND THUS A TOTAL RI OF 55.2+-4.5 BARNS WAS OBTAINED.
           .IF ONE INCLUDES THE 1/V PART ONE GETS 72.3+-5.0 BARNS.
            THIS VALUE COMPARES WELL WITH THE RESULT 75+-5 BARNS
            BY JOHNSTON ET AL., J.NUCL.ENERGY, 11(1960)95 AND THE
            73+-5 BARNS BY EASTWOOD ET AL., CHALK RIVER REPORT
