TITLE      -INELASTIC SCATTERING OF 95 KEV NEUTRONS FROM THE
            45 KEV LEVEL IN U-238.-
FACILITY   (VDG)      VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    7LI(P,N)7BE REACTION
SAMPLE                2 CM DIAMETER SPHERE OF NATURAL URANIUM
METHOD     (TOF  )    STANDARD TIME OF FLIGHT TECHNIQUE
           .THE SCATTERING SPHERE WAS PLACED 60 MM FROM THE TARGET
            AND THE DETECTOR ABOUT 210 MM FROM THE SCATTERER IN
            105 DEG. SCATTERING ANGLE
DETECTOR   (SCIN )    6LI GLASS SCINTILLATION DETECTOR

CORRECTION .THE GENERAL BACKGROUND OF NEUTRONS SCATTERED BY THE
            TARGET ASSEMBLY AND THE SURROUNDING AIR WAS SUBTRACTED
            FROM THE 92-U-238 AND 82-PB SPECTRA.
           .THE FLAT BACKGROUND CORRESPONDING TO THE NATURAL RADIO
            ACTIVITY WAS FURTHER SUBTRACTED FROM THE U238 SPECTRUM
ERR-ANALYS .BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE TOTAL
            ERROR IS DUE TO THE BACKGROUND OF AIR-SCATTERED
            NEUTRONS COMPARED TO WHICH THE OTHER TERMS ARE
            PRACTICALLY NEGLIGABLE.

COMMENT    .ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE QUOTIENT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL
            ELASTIC CROSS SECTIONS AT 95 KEV
           .THIS RESULT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE 1.56
            CALCULATED BY ABACUS-II, EVEN IF ALLOWANCE IS MADE FOR
            THE FACT THAT THE CALCULATION WAS PERFORMED FOR PB-208
            NEGLECTING THE MULTIPLE SCATTERING CORRECTION OF A FEW
            PERCENT.
