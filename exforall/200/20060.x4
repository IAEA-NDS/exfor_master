TITLE       Inelastic scattering of 95 keV neutrons from the
            45 keV level in U-238
REFERENCE  (J,NP,71,511,1965)
AUTHOR     (L.G.Stroemberg,S.Schwarz)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDFOA)
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDFOA)      Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    7Li(p,n)7Be reaction
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) neutron energy spread
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.9927) 2 cm diameter sphere of
           natural uranium
METHOD     (TOF) Standard time of flight technique. The scattering
           sphere was placed 60 mm from the target and the
           detector about 210 mm from the scatterer in 105 deg.
           (BCINT) Two methods were used for monitoring of the
           incident neutron flux, viz. beam current integration
           and a LiI-polythene counter, the latter being placed
           well within the cone of neutron emission to avoid undue
           dependence on fluctuations of the proton energy, and
           further at a position such as to eliminate any possible
           interference from scattering.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  6Li glass scintillation detector
CORRECTION .The general background of neutrons scattered by the
            target assembly and the surrounding air was subtracted
            from the 92-U-238 and 82-Pb spectra.
           .The flat background corresponding to the natural radio
            activity was further subtracted from the U238 spectrum

COMMENT    .Estimated value of the quotient of the differential
            elastic cross sections at 95 keV
           .This result is not consistent with the value 1.56
            calculated by ABACUS-II, even if allowance is made for
            the fact that the calculation was performed for Pb-208
            neglecting the multiple scattering correction of a few
            percent.

COMMENT    .An isotropic inelastic scattering angular distribution
            was assumed
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error
            By far the most important contribution to the total
            error is due to the background of air-scattered
            neutrons compared to which the other terms are
            practically negligible.
