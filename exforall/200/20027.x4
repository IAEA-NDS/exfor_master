TITLE       Inelastic neutron scattering cross sections of Cu-63
            and Cu-65 in the energy region 0.7 to 1.4 MeV
AUTHOR     (B.Holmqvist,T.Wiedling)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE )
REFERENCE  (J,AF,35,71,1968)
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDAE )  Van de Graaff accelerator provided
            with a pulsed ion source
INC-SOURCE (P-T)Proton-tritium. The neutrons were obtained by
            bombarding a tritium gas target 3 cm long, filled to
            a pressure of 0.8 kp/cm2. The mean current on the
            target was about 0.8 mu-A in most experiments.
INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL-HW) The total neutron energy
                                     spread was +- 40 keV
SAMPLE      The scatterers were cylinders of natural elements with
            2.5 cm outer diam., 0.9 cm inner diam., and an axial
            thickness of 2.5 cm, positioned with their axis
            perpendicular to that of the detector.
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Sodium-iodide crystal. A 1.5 x 1.5 inch diam.
           (LONGC) long counter used as a neutron monitor below
            the threshold of 845 keV gamma level
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(N,INL)26-FE-56,PAR,DA)
             measured is the 845 keV gamma line under an angle
            of 90 degrees. This relative value is reduced to
           (26-FE-0(N,INL)26-FE-0,,SIG)
              iron total inelastic cross section
            and compared with values from KFK-120.

COMMENT     The experimental (n,n') cross sections for the levels
            at 668 and 961 keV in Cu-63 and 764 and 1114 keV in
            Cu-65 have been compared to a modified Hauser-Feshbach
            theory for inelastic neutron scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors of the measurements
            and are negligible in comparison to the iron
            cross section errors
           (ERR-1) errors of the iron cross section
CORRECTION Corrections for neutron multiple scattering as well
           as neutron absorption have been calculated for iron
           and copper using the Monte Carlo program 'Multscat'
