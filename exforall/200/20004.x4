TITLE      -AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF THE STATISTICAL THEORY OF
            NUCLEAR REACTIONS.-
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )    DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION.
SAMPLE        2 CM * 1 CM TARGETS ON 0.01 CM GOLD STRIPS.
              POWDER SAMPLES.
              BETTER THAN 90 PER CENT IF ENRICHED.
              NO SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER
            NUCLIDES IN THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN THE
            RELEVANT ENERGY RANGE.
METHOD                DIRECT DETECTION OF PROTONS IN A
DETECTOR   (TRD  )    PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE TRACK DETECTOR,
            2.5 CM * 2.5 CM, 300 MU THICK ILFORD C2.
           .PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE CEMENTED IN THE CENTRE OF A 8 CM
            DIAMETER ALUMINIUM DISC.
           .IT WAS SURROUNDED BY A 2.54 CM WIDE 0.05 CM THICK GOLD
            ANULAR BAND WITH SIX 2.0 CM * 1.2 CM RECTANGULAR
            WINDOWS THROUGH WHICH CHARGED PARTICLES FROM SIX
            DIFFERENT TARGETS COULD REACH THE PLATE.
           .PLATE AND TARGET PLACED IN A CYLINDRICAL DRUM LINED
            WITH 0.05 CM GOLD.
           .THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY PLACED IN ALUMINIUM ALLOY VACUUM
            CHAMBER.
           .PLATE SCREENED FROM DIRECT NEUTRONS BY 15 CM LONG
            1.3 CM DIAMETER COPPER ROD WITH AXIS PERPENDICULAR ON
            THE PLATE.
           .THE NEUTRON SOURCE IS ON THE AXIS OF THIS ROD AT 7.6
            CM FROM THE END AND THE ANULAR BAND IS SEEN UNDER A
            HALF ANGLE OF 8.5 DEGREES.
           .THE ROD IS AT RIGHT ANGLE TO THE DEUTERON BEAM.
           .THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE INCIDENT NEUTRONS AND THE LINE
            PLATE-TARGET IS 120 DEGREES FOR ALL TARGETS.
           .THE APPARATUS IS ROTATING ROUND ITS AXIS OF SYMMETRY
            ONCE EVERY TWO MINUTES IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE
            BACKGROUND ANISOTROPY.
COMMENT     MEASUREMENTS ARE IN FAVOUR OF FERMI-GAS MODEL FOR
            THESE NUCLIDES ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE
            THEORETICALLY CALCULATED CROSS SECTIONS AS COMPARED
            WITH THE MEASURED ONES, THE SHAPE OF THE PROTON
            SPECTRA FITTED TO BOTH THEORIES IN THE REGION
            WHICH WAS FREE FROM (N,N P) CONTAMINATION.
