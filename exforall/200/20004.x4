TITLE       An experimental test of the statistical theory of
            nuclear reactions
INC-SOURCE (D-T)    Deuteron-tritium reaction.
SAMPLE     Most of the targets were isotropically pure (> 90 %)
           and they were deposited upon the 0.01 cm gold strips as
           the element, oxide or carbonate (halogen targets were
           prepared from silver or tin halides). Some of the
           deposits were electroplated and others were laid down
           as compacted powders to form layers of thickness
           varying from 6 to 40 mg/cm2.
             0.2 to 0.5 mg/cm2 of polystyrene binder was added to
           some of the powder targets to obtain a mechanically
           stable deposit.
            A Pb3O4 target was exposed simultaneously with the
           oxide and carbonate targets in order to measure the
           contribution of protons from the 0-16(n,p)N-16
            reaction (Q = -9.6 MeV).
METHOD     (STTA)    Direct detection of protons.
           .The apparatus is rotating round its axis of symmetry
            once every two minutes in order to eliminate
            background anisotropy.
DETECTOR   (TRD)    Photographic plate track detector,
            2.5 cm * 2.5 cm, 300 mum thick Ilford C2 photographic
            plate cemented in the centre of a 8 cm diam.
            aluminium disc.
           .It was surrounded by a 2.54 cm wide 0.05 cm thick gold
            anular band with six 2.0 cm * 1.2 cm rectangular
            windows through which charged particles from six
            different targets could reach the plate.
           .Plate and target placed in a cylindrical drum lined
            with 0.05 cm gold.
           .The whole assembly placed in aluminium alloy vacuum
            chamber.
           .Plate screened from direct neutrons by 15 cm long
            1.3 cm diameter copper rod with axis perpendicular on
            the plate.
           .The neutron source is on the axis of this rod at
            7.6 cm from the end and the anular band is seen under
            a half angle of 8.5 degrees.
           .The rod is at right angle to the deuteron beam.
COMMENT     Measurements are in favour of Fermi-gas model for
            these nuclides especially with respect to the
            theoretically calculated cross sections as compared
            with the measured ones, the shape of the proton
            spectra fitted to both theories in the region
            which was free from (n,n+p) contamination.
CORRECTION  (n,np) contribution is subtracted to obtain
             (n,p) cross section
