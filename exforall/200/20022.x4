TITLE      -HIGH PRECISION N-P TOTAL CROSS SECTION IN THE ENERGY
            RANGE 0.5 TO 7.0 MEV.-
FACILITY   (SYNCY)    HARWELL SYNCHROCYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE .NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE.
SAMPLE     .DIFFERENT HYDROCARBON LIQUID, THE RATIO OF
            HYDROGEN TO CARBON IN THE SAMPLES WAS VARIED SUCH AS
            TOLUEN, CYCLOHEXANE AND 2-2-4 TRIMETHYL PENTANE,
           .CARBON SAMPLE.
METHOD     (TOF  )    TIME OF FLIGHT. THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE
            DETERMINED FROM A SERIES OF MEASUREMENTS OF THE RELA-
            TIVE TRANSMISSION OF A NEUTRON BEAM THROUGH CARBON
            AND HYDROCARBON SAMPLES, IN WHICH BOTH THE MASS OF
            MATERIAL IN THE BEAM AND THE RATIO OF HYDROGEN TO
            CARBON IN THE SAMPLES WERE VARIED.
COMMENT    .THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESENT MEASUREMENT
            AFFORDS NO EVIDENCE FOR AN OSCILLATORY TERM IN THE
            N-P TOTAL CROSS SECTION OF THE TYPE REPORTED BY
            HREHUSS AND CZIBOK GREATER THAN ABOUT 6 MILLIBARN,
            (PHYS.LETT.28B,585(1968)).

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY.
           (ERR-1) SYSTEMATICAL UNCERTAINTY, WHERE THE MOST
            SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION COMES FROM THE UNCERTAINTY
            IN THE RESOLVING TIME OF THE COINCIDENCE SYSTEM USED
            IN THE DETECTION OF NEUTRONS ( ABOUT +- 7 MB). IN-
            CLUDED IN THIS UNCERTAINTY IS ALSO THE CONTRIBUTION
            FROM BACKGROUND CORRECTION ( ABOUT 0.03 TO 0.2 PER-
            CENT).
