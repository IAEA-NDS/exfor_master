TITLE       High precision n-p total cross section in the energy
            range 0.5 to 7.0 MeV
AUTHOR     (A.Langsford, P.J.Clements)
INSTITUTE  (2UK HAR)
REFERENCE  (P,AERE-PR/NP-16,39,1969) The result of a series of
            measurements in the following references.
           (P,AERE-PR/NP-15,33,1969) - short issue
           (P,AERE-PR/NP-14,50,1968) - determination of the
              singlet n-p effective range parameter
           (P,AERE-PR/NP-11,28,1967) - analysis of uncertainties
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2UK HAR)    Harwell synchrocyclotron.
INC-SOURCE  No information available.
SAMPLE      Different hydrocarbon liquid, the ratio of
            hydrogen to carbon in the samples was varied such as
            toluene, cyclohexane and 2-2-4 trimethyl pentane,
            carbon sample.
METHOD     (TOF)    Time of flight. The cross sections were
            determined from a series of measurements of the rela-
            tive transmission of a neutron beam through carbon
            and hydrocarbon samples, in which both the mass of
            material in the beam and the ratio of hydrogen to
            carbon in the samples were varied.
COMMENT     The authors conclude that the present measurement
            affords no evidence for an oscillatory term in the
            n-p total cross section of the type reported by
            Gy.Hrehuss and T.Czibok greater than about 6 mb,
             (Phys.Lett.28B,585(1968)).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematical uncertainty, where the most
            significant contribution comes from the uncertainty
            in the resolving time of the coincidence system used
            in the detection of neutrons ( about +- 7 mb).
             In this uncertainty is also included the contribution
            from background correction (about 0.03 to 0.2%).
