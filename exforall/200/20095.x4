INC-SOURCE  No information given
INC-SPECT   No information given.
SAMPLE      Highly purified B10-F(3) gas at 10 mm Hg
            together with 3 atm. Argon to reduce the wall effect.
METHOD      The branching ratio was obtained from the
            two peaks corresponding to the two different q-values
            as a result of the ionization of the reaction
            fragments in the counter gas.
DETECTOR   (BF3)  B10-F(3) gas
ANALYSIS    The branching ratio is calculated from the
            quotient between the sums of the number of pulses in
            the 2.78 MeV and in the 2.30 MeV peak

           (A,,H.F.Brinkmann+,J,KE,3,309,1960)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,,1.) The statistical accuracy was better the 1%
            In the determination of the number of counts.
            The given value of the branching ratio is the average
            of 10 measurements taken with different gas mixtures
            and different gas amplification factors in order to
            minimize systematic errors.
           (ERR-1) Systematic errors estimated as +-0.05%.
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty.

REACTION   ((5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG)//
           (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG))
            Branching ratio between the (n,alpha) reaction to the
            ground state of Li-7 with a q-value q1 = 2.78 MeV
            and the (n,alpha) reaction to the first excited state
            of Li-7 with a q-value q2 = 2.30 MeV
            the ratio is given in absolute units not as a percenta
PART-DET   (A,RSD) Sum pulses of the alphas and the residual
            nuclei (Li-7).
