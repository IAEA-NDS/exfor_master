TITLE      -THE BRANCHING RATIO OF THE B-10(N,ALPHA)LI-7 REACTION-
FACILITY   .NO INFORMATION GIVEN
INC-SOURCE .NO INFORMATION GIVEN
INC-SPECT  .NO INFORMATION GIVEN.
SAMPLE     .HIGHLY PURIFIED B10-F(3) GAS AT 10 MM HG
            TOGETHER WITH 3 ATM. ARGON TO REDUCE THE WALL EFFECT.
METHOD     .THE BRANCHING RATIO WAS OBTAINED FROM THE
            TWO PEAKS CORRESPONDING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT Q-VALUES
            AS A RESULT OF THE IONIZATION OF THE REACTION
            FRAGMENTS IN THE COUNTER GAS.
DETECTOR   (BF3  )    PROPORTIONAL COUNTER CONTAINING B10-F(3) GAS
ANALYSIS   .THE BRANCHING RATIO IS CALCULATED FROM THE
            QUOTIENT BETWEEN THE SUMS OF THE NUMBER OF PULSES IN
            THE 2.78 MEV AND IN THE 2.30 MEV PEAK
COMMENT    .VALUE CONFIRMS THE RESULTS OF DE JUREN ET AL.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) THE STATISTICAL ACCURACY WAS BETTER THE 1 PERC.
            IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF COUNTS.
           .THE GIVEN VALUE OF THE BRANCHING RATIO IS THE AVERAGE
            OF 10 MEASUREMENTS TAKEN WITH DIFFERENT GAS MIXTURES
            AND DIFFERENT GAS AMPLIFICATION FACTORS IN ORDER TO
            MINIMIZE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS.
           (ERR-1) SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ESTIMATED AS +-0.05 PERCENT.
           (ERR-T) TOTAL UNCERTAINTY.

REACTION   (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG,,MXW/REL)
           .BRANCHING RATIO BETWEEN THE (N,ALPHA) REACTION TO THE
            GROUND STATE OF LI-7 WITH A Q-VALUE Q1 = 2.78 MEV
