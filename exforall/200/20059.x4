TITLE       A relative measurement of the Li6(n,alpha)H3 reaction
            cross section in the range 1 < En < 600 keV
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDFOA) A pulsed van de Graaff accelerator,
           beam pulse =about 15 nanosec, repetition rate = 2 MHz,
           average beam current = 3 to 5 microA.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7-reaction. Metallic lithium and
           Li-F targets evaporated onto silver backings. The
           proton beam was monitored by means of gamma rays from
           the F-19(p,alpha)O-16 reaction. The amount of LiF
           evaporated onto the backing was determined
           approximately by weighing on a microbalance. As a rule
           targets with 5-10 mu-g/cm2 were used.
SAMPLE     .Li-6 glass scintillator.
METHOD     (TOF) Flight path varied between 30 and 100 cm.
           (BCINT) Monitoring of the beam was also performed
           with a current integrator
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Li6 glass scintillator = sample,
            diameter = 1.9 and 3.8 cm, thickness = 0.9 cm.
           (NAICR) Na-I-(Tl) detector to monitor the proton
            beam.
CORRECTION .Experimental data corrected for multiple scattering
            in the scintillator according to the Monte-Carlo
            calculations.

REACTION   (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)
ANALYSIS   .In the low energy range (E(n)= 1 to 90 keV), the
            results are based on the assumption that the neutrons
            from the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction are isotropically
            distributed in the centre-of-mass system for proton
            energies close to the neutron threshold.

STATUS     (TABLE) .Private communication to CCDN, August 1966.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The experimental error is estimated to be
           about 5%  throughout the energy interval covered. The
           errors contributing to the results are of two
           different characters. One group consists of
           uncertainties inherent in the counting process and the
           experimental apparatus, that should be consider
            (i) counting statistics,
            (ii) monitoring,
            (iii) resolution,
            (iv) instability and non-linearity and
            (v) self-absorption in the backing material.
           The other group contains the errors due to treatment
           of the experimental data going from primary results to
           desired physical information, i.e. contributions as
            (vi) secondary effects in the detector,
            (vii) uncertainty in normalizing factors,
            (viii) deviations from theoretical assumptions and
            (ix) ambiguity of theoretical interpretation.
