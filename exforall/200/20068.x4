TITLE       The (n,2n) cross section of  H-2 in the energy region
            4.0 - 6.5 MeV
AUTHOR     (M.Holmberg)
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,129,327,1969)
INSTITUTE  (2SWDFOA)
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDAE ) 5.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-T) D(d,n)He-3 reaction.
SAMPLE      The D20 sample was located at the centre of the axial
            tube of the large liquid scintillator.
            Carbon and H2O samples were used to measure background
METHOD     (COINC) D(2)-O sample located at the centre of a
            large liquid scintillator.  Knowing the time
            correlation between the two capture pulses the number
            of (n,2n) events could be separated from the randomly
            distributed background.
            Iron collimator, length 1.5 m., 20 cm square with
            a conical hole 10 mm in diameter at the entrance and
            40 mm at the end.
            The iron collimator was surrounded by a lead and
            paraffin shield, about 1 m square and 1.5 m in length.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) GD-loaded liquid scintillator
            surrounded by 20 cm of lead and 20 cm of paraffin.
            Time correlation measurements via a coincidence
            circuit, on thermal capture pulses, (prompt recoil
            pulses are removed).
            Carbon scatterer used to determine zero correlation.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator located at the center
            of the channel through the scintillator tank during
            absolute neutron flux measurement runs.

CORRECTION  Multiple scattering correction - 9%  at 6 MeV.
            Neutron escape along the axial channel of the large
            scintillator tank correction to the (n,2n) cross
            section was 10% at 6.0 MeV and a rather arbitrary
            error of 50% was estimated for the correction.
            Variation of neutron detector efficiency with neutron
            energy. The correction was 3% at 6 MeV of incident
            neutron energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Almost no information about source of
            uncertainties. At 6 MeV an estimated error due to
            multiple scattering is 2%.
