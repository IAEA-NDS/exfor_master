TITLE      -THE (N,2N) CROSS SECTION OF  H-2 IN THE ENERGY REGION
            4.0 - 6.5 MEV-
FACILITY   (VDG)      5.5 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T)      D(D,N)HE-3 REACTION.
SAMPLE                D(2)-O
METHOD     (COINC)    D(2)-O SAMPLE LOCATED AT THE CENTRE OF A
            LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR.  KNOWING THE TIME
            CORELLATION BETWEEN THE TWO CAPTURE PULSES THE NUMBER
            OF (N,2N) EVENTS COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE RANDOMLY
            DISTRIBUTED BACKGROUND.
           .IRON COLLIMATOR, LENGTH 1.5 M., 20 CM SQUARE WITH
            A CONICAL HOLE 10 MM IN DIAMETER AT THE ENTRANCE AND
            40 MM AT THE END.
           .THE IRON COLLIMATOR WAS SURROUNDED BY A LEAD AND
            PARAFFIN SHIELD, ABOUT 1 M SQUARE AND 1.5 M IN LENGTH.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     GD-LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
            SURROUNDED BY 20 CM OF LEAD AND 20 CM OF PARAFFIN.
           .TIME CORRELATION MEASUREMENTS VIA A COINCIDENCE
            CIRCUIT, ON THERMAL CAPTURE PULSES, (PROMPT RECOIL
            PULSES ARE REMOVED).
           .CARBON SCATTERER USED TO DETERMINE ZERO CORRELATION.
           (SCIN )    PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR LOCATED AT THE CENTER
            OF THE CHANNEL THROUGH THE SCINTILLATOR TANK DURING
            ABSOLUTE NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENT RUNS.
COMMENT    .THERE IS REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PRESENT
            RESULTS AND THOSE OF CATRON ET AL., PHYS.REV.,
            123(1961)218  AND ALSO WITH THE CROSS SECTIONS
            CALCULATED BY FRANK AND GAMMEL, PHYS.REV.,93(1954)463.

CORRECTION .MULTIPLE SCATTERING CORRECTION
            9 PERC. AT 6 MEV WITH AN ESTIMATED ERROR OF 2 PERC.
           .NEUTRON ESCAPE ALONG THE AXIAL CHANNEL OF THE LARGE
            SCINTILLATOR TANK.
            10 PERC. AT 6.0 MEV AND A RATHER ARBITRARY ERROR OF
            50 PERC. WAS ESTIMATED FOR THE CORRECTION.
           .VARIATION OF NEUTRON DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WITH NEUTRON
            ENERGY.
            THE CORRECTION WAS 3 PERC. AT 6 MEV OF INCIDENT
            NEUTRON ENERGY.
