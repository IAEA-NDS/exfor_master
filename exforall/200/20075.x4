            Preliminary reports.
INSTITUTE  (2SWDFOA)
FACILITY   (CCW,2SWDFOA) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator for 14.8 MeV
           (VDG,2SWDAE ) 5.5 MeV accelerator at Studsvik for all
            other energies.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) T(p,n)He3 reaction up to 3.5 MeV neutrons
           (D-D) D(d,n)He3 reactions from 4.5 to 7.5 MeV
           (D-T) T(d,n)He4 reaction for 14.8 MeV neutrons
SAMPLE      140 mg of U-238 was painted on five platinum plates
            with a thickness of about 4 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidences between fission fragments and
            prompt neutrons.
DETECTOR   (STANK)   Cylindrical liquid scintillation detector
            (50 cm in diam, and 50 cm in length) except for
            14.8 MeV neutrons where the shape was
            spherical (60 cm in diam.).
           (FISCH)    Fission chamber in the center of the
            cylindrical scintillator tank.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU)
COMMENT     A least square fit to the present results yields
            nu-bar(En) = 2.313 + 0.154*En above the threshold for
            fission, where 'En' is the neutron energy.
CORRECTION  For pile up (1.5%), subtraction of background,
            Spontaneous fission of U-238 (1%),
            Random coincidences (less then 0.2%)
            Variation of the detection efficiency (0.5%)
            Escape of neutrons to the axial tube of the tank(0.5%)
            Fission caused by neutrons which had lost energy in
            the collimator (1 to 2.5%)
             The anisotropy correction was less than 0.2%.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The stated errors are due to counting
           statistics only
