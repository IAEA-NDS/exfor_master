           with respect to the incident beam.

            signal to background ratio.

ANALYSIS   (4PI1A)  4pi*90 degree cross section value.
            The area under the normalized response
            function was used to determine the cross section for
            neutron capture leading to the emission of a gamma-ray
            of the corresponding energy.
            The cross section was determined by a straight-forward
            calculation using the integrated target beam current
            and the gas pressure to obtain the neutron flux
COMMENT     The given cross sections have been evaluated for high-
            energy gamma-ray transitions from capturing state to
            low-lying states in the residual nuclei.
            A comparison between these cross sections and calcul-
            ations based on semi-direct capture theories shows
            that the semi-direct capture processes are important
            to explain the magnitude and energy variation of the
            neutron capture cross section in the region of the
            electric dipole giant resonance.
CORRECTION  At each neutron energy several runs were performed
            with sample in and sample out to reduce the influence
            of small fluctuations in background and drift in the
            electronic circuits.
            Corrections due to neutron and gamma-ray attenuation
            in the sample, to the attenuation of gamma-rays in
            lithium hydride and lead placed in front of the
            detector and to neutron multiple scattering in the
            sample were calculated and taken into account.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The estimated total error
            The dominating error in the cross section
            originates from the unfolding calculation of the
            gamma-ray spectra.
           (ERR-1,,15.) The maximum total error resulting from the
            unfolding procedure was estimated never to exceed
            15% for the highest gamma-ray peak.

COMMENT     Cross section values for neutron capture in Ni-58 and
            Ni-60, where the primary gamma rays go to levels of
            Ni-59 and Ni-61 in the excitation energy ranges
            0.9-2.0 MeV and 0.0-0.9 MeV, respectively. It is not
            possible to conclude that the second peak in the gamma
            spectra is due entirely to capture in Ni-60, since
            capture leading to levels around 1.5 MeV in Ni-59 may
            contribute.  For this reason no abundance correction
            has been applied to the experimental values.
SAMPLE     Natural nickel in the form of 15 cm diam.,
           1.5 cm thick disks.
