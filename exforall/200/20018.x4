TITLE       Studies of the fission integrals of  U-235 and
             Pu-239 with cadmium and boron filters
AUTHOR     (E.Hellstrand)
REFERENCE  (R,AE-181,1965)

INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE )
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDAE )    Swedisch R1 reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Beam from carbon scatterer in central
            position of R1 reactor.
INC-SPECT  .Spectrum measured with fast chopper.
           .Excess neutron temperature 22 degrees Celsius.
           .Westcott factor  r = 0.0411 +- 0.0011.
METHOD     .Cadmium ratio of counts in filtered and unfiltered
            beams.
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    Fission chamber
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,RI) Capture integral

ANALYSIS   .Ratio of thermal and epithermal flux measured by
            cadmium ratio of known standard (resonance integral
            of gold).
           .cadmium ratios and 2200 m/sec. Cross-sections from
            samples and standard gave together with the spectrum
            parameters the resonance integrals.
COMMENT    .A crude additional activation measurement on Pu-foils
            gave results in agreement with the cadmium ratio
            measurements.
           .Boron filter ratio measurements were done giving
            'effective' resonance integrals in agreement with
            calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Main contribution to the limits of error for Th
            data originates from the uncertainty in the resonance
            integral of gold.  Other errors that have been
            considered are uncertainties in the lethargy flux, in
            the cadmium cut-off, in the cadmium ratios involved,
            and in the other cross sections used
           (ERR-1,,1.) Uncertainty of the neutron flux
