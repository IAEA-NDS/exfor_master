TITLE      -CROSS SECTIONS FOR HIGH-ENERGY GAMMA-TRANSITIONS FROM
            MEV NEUTRON CAPTURE IN PB-206.-
FACILITY   (VDG  )    STUDSVIK 5.5 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  )    D(D-N)-REACTION, GAS TARGET,
            IN THE ENERGY RANGE 4.5 TO 8.5 MEV.
           (P-T  )    T(P,N)-REACTION, GAS AND ABSORBED TARGET,
            IN THE ENERGY RANGE BELOW 4.5 MEV.
SAMPLE                RADIOGENIC LEAD.
                      PB-204 0.085 PERCENT,  PB-206 88.38 PERCENT,
                      PB-207 8.57  PERCENT,  PB-208 29,7  PERCENT.
           .A BISMUTH SAMPLE OF SAME SIZE AS THE PB-206 WAS USED
            TO DETERMINE THE BACKGROUND.
METHOD                DIRECT DETECTION.
           (TOF  )    TIME-OF-FLIGHT, DISTANCE SAMPLE TO GAMMA-
            DETECTOR IS 0.9 M. AND 1.4 M. IN TWO RUNS RESPECTIVELY
           .NATRIUM-IODIDE DETECTOR PLACED AT 90 DEGREES TO THE
            INCIDENT ION BEAM.
           .PLASTIC SCINTILLATION DETECTOR PLACED AT 140 DEGREES
            TO THE INCIDENT ION BEAM.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    LARGE NAI(TL) DETECTOR, 22.6 CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 20.8 CM LONG.
           (SCIN )    PLASTIC SCINTILLATION DETECTOR FOR MONITOR-
            ING NEUTRON YIELD UNDER 140 DEGREES BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            TECHNIQUES.
           .A 4096-CHANNEL ANALYSER WAS USED IN TWO-PARAMETER MODE
            WITH FLIGHT TIME RECORDED IN 16 CHANNELS AND GAMMA-RAY
            PULSE HEIGHT IN 256 CHANNELS.
ANALYSIS   .THE PULSE-HEIGHT SPECTRA WERE UNFOLDED BY THE DETECTOR
            RESPONSE FUNCTIONS. THE PULSE-HEIGHT DISTRIBUTION
            OBTAINED FROM THE C-12(N,G)C-13 REACTION AT E(N) =
            8.50 MEV WAS COMPARED WITH THE RESPONSE FUNCTION AT
            12.77 MEV.
           .SEE FOR DETAILS OF THE FURTHER ANALYSIS
            I.BERGQVIST ET AL., NUCL.PHYS.,A120(1968)161.
MONITOR               T(P,N) NEUTRON PRODUCTION CROSS-SECTION.
           .FOR NEUTRON ENERGIES LESS THAN ABOUT 1 MEV AT 140 DEG.
            (CORRESPONDING TO LESS THAN ABOUT 4 MEV AT 0 DEGREES),
            THE PRODUCT OF THE INTEGRATED TARGET CURRENT,
            THE TARGET GAS PRESSURE AND THE NEUTRON PRODUCTION
            CROSS-SECTION WAS USED TO NORMALIZE TO THE NEUTRON
            YIELD AT HIGHER ENERGIES, AS THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            MONITOR COULD NOT BE USED IN THAT CASE.
           (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            FOR HIGHER ENERGIES, THE PLASTIC
            SCINTILLATOR PLACED AT 140 DEGREES TO THE INCIDENT
            BEAM WAS USED. THIS COUNTER WAS CALIBRATED AGAINST
            A POLYETHYLENE COUNTER OF LOS ALAMOS DESIGN,
            J.S.BAME JR. ET AL., REV.SCI.INSTR.,28(1957)997 AND
            31(1960)911.
COMMENT    .THE RESULTS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PREDICTION OF
            SEMI-DIRECT CAPTURE THEORY.
HISTORY    (701105C)
           (710908E)
CORRECTION .THE RESULTS ARE CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON AND GAMMA-RAY
            ATTENUATION AND FOR NEUTRON MULTIPLE SCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS .THE ERRORS FOR UNFOLDING OF SPECTRA WERE DISCUSSED.
