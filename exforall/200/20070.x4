INSTITUTE  (2SWDAE ,2SWDFOA)
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDAE ) 5.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)  D(d-n)-reaction, gas target,
            in the energy range 4.5 to 8.5 MeV.
           (P-T)  T(p,n)-reaction, gas and absorbed target,
            in the energy range below 4.5 MeV.
SAMPLE     Radiogenic lead.
            Pb-204 0.08%,  Pb-206 88.38%,
            Pb-207 8.57%,  Pb-208 29,7%.
            A bismuth sample of same size as the Pb-206 was used
            to determine the background.
METHOD                Direct detection.
           (TOF)    Time-of-flight, distance sample to gamma-
            detector is 0.9 m. and 1.4 m. In two runs respectively
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    Large NaI(Tl) detector, 22.6 cm in diameter
            and 20.8 cm long.
            Natrium-iodide detector placed at 90 degrees to the
            incident ion beam.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillation detector for monitoring
            neutron yield under 140 degrees by time-of-flight
            techniques.
            Plastic scintillation detector placed at 140 degrees
            to the incident ion beam.
            A 4096-channel analyser was used in two-parameter mode
            with flight time recorded in 16 channels and gamma-ray
            pulse height in 256 channels.
ANALYSIS    The pulse-height spectra were unfolded by the detector
            response functions. The pulse-height distribution
            obtained from the C-12(n,gamma)C-13 reaction at
            E(n) = 8.50 MeV was compared with the response
            function at 12.77 MeV.

MONITOR               T(p,n) neutron production cross-section.
            For neutron energies less than about 1 MeV at 140 deg.
            (Corresponding to less than about 4 MeV at 0 degrees),
            the product of the integrated target current,
            the target gas pressure and the neutron production
            cross-section was used to normalize to the neutron
            yield at higher energies, as the time-of-flight
            monitor could not Be used in that case.
           (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
            For higher energies, the plastic
            scintillator placed at 140 degrees to the incident
            beam was used. This counter was calibrated against a
            polyethylene count. of Los Alamos design (see REL-REF)
COMMENT     The results are in agreement with the prediction of
            semi-direct capture theory.
CORRECTION  The results are corrected for neutron and gamma-ray
            attenuation and for neutron multiple scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details. Only the errors for unfolding
            of spectra were discussed.
