TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTIONS
            20-CA-42(N,P)19-K-42 AND 20-CA-43(N,P)19-K-43 AND
            METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF CARRIER-FREE POTASSIUM
            ISOTOPES.-
FACILITY   (REAC)     SWEDISH R1 REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     CENTRAL POSITION OF REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  .FAST NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
           .FAST NEUTRON FLUX WAS ALMOST A DECADE LOWER THAN THE
            THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX WHICH WAS 12.E+11 N/CM-SQ/SEC.
SAMPLE                CA-C-O(3) WRAPPED IN A 0.3 MM THICK CADMIUM
            FOIL TOGETHER WITH 0.5 G OF ALUMINIUM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    ACTIVATION
           (CHSEP)    CARRIER FREE SEPARATION OF POTASSIUM.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    3 X 3 INCH NATRIUM-IODIDE(TL) CRYSTAL.

ERR-ANALYS .THE ERRORS GIVEN FOR THE FINAL CROSS SECTION VALUES
            ARE NOT STRICTLY MATHEMATECALLY DEDUCED, AS ALLOWANCE
            WAS MADE FOR SOME SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WITHIN THE LIMITS.
           .THE AUTHOR IS CONVINCED THAT THE ERRORS SHOULD MATCH
            A CONFIDENCE LEVEL OF AT LEAST 90 PER-CENT, IF THE
            UTILIZED VALUES FOR THE MONITOR CROSS SECTION AND THE
            GAMMA INTENSITIES FROM 19-K-43 ARE CORRECT.
