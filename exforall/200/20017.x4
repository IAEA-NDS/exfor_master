TITLE       Determination of the cross section for the reactions
            Ca-42(n,p)K-42 and Ca-43(n,p)K-43 and methods for
            production of carrier-free potassium isotopes
FACILITY   (REAC,2SWDKTH)     Swedish R1 reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     Central position of reactor.
INC-SPECT  .Fast neutron spectrum.
           .Fast neutron flux was almost a decade lower than the
            thermal neutron flux which was 12.E+11 n/cm-sq/sec.
SAMPLE                Ca-C-O(3) wrapped in a 0.3 mm thick cadmium
            foil together with 0.5 g of aluminium.
METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
           (CHSEP)    carrier free separation of potassium.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)    3 X 3 inch natrium-iodide(Tl) crystal.
ANALYSIS   .Count rate under photo-peak
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
            = 0.56 millibarn
COMMENT    .Description of a method for the production of carrier-
            free potassium isotopes in the original paper.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given for the final cross section
            values are not strictly mathematecally deduced, as
            allowance was made for some systematic errors within
            the limits.
           .The author is convinced that the errors should match
            a confidence level of at least 90%, if the utilized
            values for the monitor cross section and the gamma
            intensities from K-43 are correct.
