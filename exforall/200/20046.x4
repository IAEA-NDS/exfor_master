DETECTOR   (SCIN) The activity of gold was measured with a plastic
           scintillator and a photomultiplier tube.
            For the registration of fission fragments and
           alpha-particles, detectors were made consisting of
           ZnS(Ag) with a small content of uranium, boron, or
            lithium.
           (TRD) In some cases, fissions were registered
           by means of photographic plates
