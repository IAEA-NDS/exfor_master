TITLE      -GEOMETRIC BUCKLING MEASUREMENTS USING THE PULSED
            NEUTRON SOURCE METHOD-
INC-SOURCE (D-D  )    HEAVY-ICE TARGET, PULSED DEUTERON BEAM.
SAMPLE                POLYETHYLENE, DENSITY = .918+-.001 G/CM**3
            CARBON CONTENT = 85.6+-.1 PERCENT, HYDROGEN CONTENT =
            14.4+-0.1 PER-CENT.
                      COMBINATIONS OF 8 OR LESS DISCS 18 CM IN
            DIAMETER, 2.2 CM THICK.
METHOD     (PLSED)    PULSE DIE-AWAY IN POLYETHELENE DISCS.
DETECTOR   (BF3  )    B10-F(3) COUNTERS OF UP TO 150 CC SENSITIVE
            VOLUME, MOUNTED RADIAL (IF 4 DISCS OR LESS) OR AXIAL
            (IF 4 DISCS OR MORE) IN THE ASSEMBLY.
ANALYSIS   .CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF CARBON = 3.4 MILLIB.

ERR-ANALYS .DISCUSSED IN EXTENSO IN THE ARTICLE.
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR ARISING FROM A POSSIBLE PRESENCE
            OF A SIXTH ORDER BUCKLING TERM COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED
            WITH THE THEORY FOR DECAY MODES USED, IT WAS THEREFORE
            ASSUMED.
