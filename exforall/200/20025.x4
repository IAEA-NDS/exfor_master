SAMPLE      56 mg of U-235 was deposited on five platinum disks
            with a coating thickness of 1.5 mg/cm2.
            The material was enriched to 93% U-235, 6% U-238
            and 1% U-234.
METHOD     (COINC)  Coincidence
           (TOF)    Time of flight technique at 7.5 and 14.8 MeV
DETECTOR   (SCIN)   Large spherical liquid scintillator for the
           liquid 60 keV and 14.8 MeV data and a large cylindrical
            scintillator for the 7.5 MeV data.

COMMENT     Data are compared with other measurements a mean value
            for nu-bar(thermal)(U235)=2.412+-0.015 is derived

                            by the multiple reaction formalism
ANALYSIS    The thermal nu-bar value is calculated by
            an extrapolation to thermal energy assuming a linear
            energy dependence of nu-bar with a slope of 0.085
            neutrons per MeV.
