ANALYSIS   .The thermal nu-bar-value was calculated by
            an extrapolation to thermal energy assuming a linear
            energy dependence of nu-bar with a slope of
            0.085 neutrons/MeV, starting from nu-bar at 60 keV.

COMMENT    .Nu-bar(total) = 2.433+-0.015 at thermal energy is
            obtained by adding nu-bar(delayed) from S.Cox et al.,
            Phys.Rev., 112(1958)960.
           .Estimated nu-bar for 7.5 MeV is 3.47 +- 0.06.
           .the 60 keV value is not given.
CORRECTION .The total correction was estimated to be 0.013+-0.007.

            counting statistics and uncertainties in the
            corrections
