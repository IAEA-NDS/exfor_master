            HIGH FLUX BEAM REACTOR WITH CHOPPER SPEED OF 15000-RPM
SAMPLE     306-GMS OF CCL(4) IN A 10 BY 15 BY 1.3-CM AL HOLDER
            PLACED 45-DEG TO BEAM.
DETECTOR   (GELI) GERMANIUM-LITHIUM DETECTOR, 46-CM FROM SAMPLE.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME-OF-FLIGHT WITH 48-M FLIGHT PATH. DATA ARE
            SUMMED RESULTS OF THREE 24-HOUR RUNS AT EACH ANGLE.
            PRIMARY GAMMAS AT EACH ANGLE NORMALIZED TO SUM OF SIX
            SECONDARY TRANSITIONS(ASSUMED ISOTROPIC). BACKGROUND
            FREE SPECTRUM OBTAINED BY SUBTRACTION OF OFF-RESONANCE
            CAPTURE COMPONENTS FROM RESONANCE COMPONENTS UNDER
            PEAK.
