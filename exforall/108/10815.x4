TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE U-238(N,G) CROSS SECTION WITH AN
           FE-FILTERED NEUTRON BEAM
FACILITY   (LINAC) RPI LINEAR ACCELERATOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR, 1.25-METER DIAMETER.
           10-B(4)C-NAI DETECTOR FOR NEUTRON FLUX.
SAMPLE     HIGHLY ENRICHED U-238, 7.68-CM DIAMETER, THICKNESS OF
            (2.322+-0.012)E-03 ATOMS/BARN, LESS THAN 5-PPM U-235.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH 25.64-METER PATH LENGTH.
            SPLIT ARMCO FE FILTER, 7.5-CM THICK AT 3-METERS AND
            12.5-CM THICK PLACED AT 22-METERS. NEUTRON BEAM
            MEASUREMENTS USED COMPOSITE FILTER OF 20-CM FE,
            0.08-CM CD, AND 0.32-CM PB. IODIDE SCATTERING IN
            DETECTOR DETERMINED BY REPLACING 10-B(4)C SLAB WITH
            GRAPHITE.
CORRECTION CORRECTED FOR DETECTOR EFFICIENCY.
           CORRECTED FOR RESONANCE SELF-PROTECTION AND MULTIPLE
            SCATTERING IN SAMPLE USING U-238 AVERAGE TOTAL AND
            SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS. CORRECTIONS RANGE FROM
            4.9-PERCENT TO 4.2-PERCENT.
