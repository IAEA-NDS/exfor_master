TITLE      Emission of long-range alpha-particles in the
            subthermal-, thermal-and resonance-neutron fission of
            Pu-239
FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Brookhaven graphite research reactor
SAMPLE     36 micro-GMS/sq-cm highly enriched Pu-239, 1.27-cm
            diameter
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Li-drifted semiconductor detector with effect-
            IVE area of 2.0 sq-cm and depletion depth of 1-mm.
           (BF3) Boron trifluoride counter to monitor neutron beam
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutrons
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),BIN/TER,SIG/RAT) To normalize Pu data.
            5.157-MeV spectrum from Pu-239 fission and
            5.486-MeV alpha spectrum from Am-241 fission used
            to calibrate energy scale.
METHOD     Neutron energy range selected by filters of Be or
            quartz with a mechanical monochromator. Samarium
            filter used to isolate 0.297-eV Pu resonance.
           Run 1 consists of measurement of binary events
            followed by measurements of ternary events
            with an aluminium foil between the source and
            counter.
           Background measured by inverting foil and
            making run with Al-foil between source and counter.
            Fission ratio of Pu-239 obtained from long-range
            alpha distribution by consideration of long-range
            alpha particle distribution of U-235 and evaluation of
            hidden part of Pu alpha distribution.
