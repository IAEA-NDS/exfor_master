TITLE      UPPER LIMIT FOR THE H-1(N,TWO GAMMA)H-2 CROSS SECTION
INC-SOURCE CHALK RIVER NRU REACTOR WITH BRAGG REFLECTOR AND
            PYROLITIC GRAPHITE MONOCHROMATOR.
INC-SPECT  0.009-EV NEUTRONS FROM REACTOR ARE THERMALIZED IN
            TARGET BEFORE CAPTURE
MONITOR    (8-O-16(N,G)8-O-17,,SIG) DATA NORMALIZED TO KNOWN CROSS
            SECTION.
           (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG) DETECTION OF 2.223-MEV GAMMA
            FOR NEUTRON FLUX DETERMINATION.
DETECTOR   (GELI) TWO GERMANIUM LITHIUM COAXIAL DETECTORS SHIELDED
            FROM EACH OTHER BY A 4.9-CM THICK HEAVY METAL DIVIDER.
            SUBTENDED ANGLE OF 85-DEGREES.
SAMPLE     50-CM**3 DISTILLED H(2)O ENCLOSED IN 0.1-MM THICK POLY-
            ETHYLENE BAG
METHOD     NEUTRON BEAM TRAVELS DOWN TUBE LINED WITH ENRICHED
            LIF (90-PERCENT LI-6) TO SHIELD DETECTORS FROM SCAT-
            TERED NEUTRONS. DETECTOR LIMITED TO GAMMA ENERGY RANGE
            BETWEEN 600 AND 1620-KEV. HEAVY METAL SHIELD PREVENTS
            GAMMAS FROM CROSSING BETWEEN DETECTORS. NEUTRON CAP-
            TURE IN GRAPHITE, MELAMINE, AND LITHIUM HYDRIDE USED
            TO DETERMINE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY.
CORRECTION CORRECTED FOR RESIDUAL CROSS REGISTRATION AND BACK-
            GROUND.
ERR-ANALYS APPROX 20-PERCENT UNCERTAINTY IN CROSS REGISTRATION
            CORRECTION.
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY E.D.EARLE, 79/4/2.
