TITLE      U-238 RESONANCE SELF-INDICATION CAPTURE MEASUREMENTS.
FACILITY   (LINAC) GAERTTNER LINEAR ACCELERATOR LABORATORY
SAMPLE     FOR LOW TEMPERATURE, TWO 7.62-CM DIAMETER SHEETS OF
            HIGHLY ENRICHED (LESS THAN 4-PPM U-235) U-238.
            COMBINED THICKNESS OF 0.053-CM.
           FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE, SINGLE 5.77-CM DIAMETER SHEET OF
            HIGHLY ENRICHED (LESS THAN 10-PPM U-235) U-238.
           DEPLETED URANIUM SHIELDING SAMPLES OF VARIOUS THICK-
            NESSES WITH 0.26+-0.03 ATOM PERCENT U-235.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH 25.65-M FLIGHT PATH. SHIELD-
            ING SAMPLE LOCATED APPROX 4-METERS FROM SAMPLE, CYCLED
            IN AND OUT OF BEAM. COLLIMATORS OF STEEL, CH(2), AND
            B(4)C LOCATED NEAR TARGET, B(4)C AND LEAD LOCATED NEAR
            DETECTOR. LEAD SHEET, 0.34-CM THICK, USED TO REDUCE
            GAMMA FLASH. THERMAL AND OVERLAPPING NEUTRONS SUP-
            PRESSED WITH CADMIUM AND B(4)C FILTERS. SAMPLE PLACED
            AT CENTER OF SCINTILLATOR AND IS SHIELDED WITH 5-CM
            THICK LIH TO PREVENT COUNTS DUE TO LOW ENERGY NEUTRONS
            SCATTERED OFF SAMPLE. SHIELD ALSO PREVENTS LOW ENERGY
            NEUTRONS SCATTERED INTO DETECTOR SOLUTION FROM RETURN-
            ING TO THE SAMPLE.
DETECTOR   (STANK) LIQUID SCINTILLATOR, 1.25-M DIAMETER WITH
            1100 LITERS OF XYLENE-BASED BORON LOADED SOLUTION AND
            PHOTOMULTIPLIERS.
           (NAICR) 5-CM THICK BY 20-CM DIAMETER NAI DETECTOR FOR
            MONITOR.
           (SCIN) PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR WITH PHOTOMULTIPLIER FOR
            NEUTRONS
MONITOR    RELATIVE FLUX DETERMINED USING B-10(4)-NAI FLUX DETECT-
            OR. NORMALIZED TO 6.67-EV SATURATED CAPTURE RESONANCE.
CORRECTION CORRECTED FOR DEADTIME, BACKGROUND, RELATIVE FLUX
            MEASUREMENT AND MULTIPLE SCATTERING.
ERR-ANALYS ERRORS INCLUDE-
            -DETECTOR COUNT ERRORS
            -BACKGROUND ERRORS
            -ERROR IN PRODUCT OF DETECTOR EFFICIENCY AND FLUX
             NORMALIZATION, 1-PERCENT.
            -RELATIVE FLUX ERROR, 1.5-PERCENT.
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY R.C.BLOCK, 79/4/2.
