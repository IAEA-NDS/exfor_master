TITLE      Uranium-238 Resonance Self-Indication Capture
            Measurements
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USARPI) Gaerttner Linear Accelerator
             Laboratory
SAMPLE     For low temperature, two 7.62-cm diameter sheets of
            highly enriched (less than 4-ppm 235U) 238U with a
            combined thickness of 0.053 cm.
           For high temperature, single 5.77-cm diameter sheet of
            highly enriched (less than 10-ppm 235U) 238U.
           Depleted uranium shielding samples of various
            thicknesses with 0.26+-0.03 atom% 235U.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight with 25.65-m flight path.
            Shielding sample located approx 4 meters from sample,
            cycled in and out of beam. Collimators of steel, CH2,
            and B4C located near target, B4C and lead located near
            detector. Lead sheet, 0.34-cm thick, used to reduce
            gamma flash. Thermal and overlapping neutrons
            suppressed with cadmium and B4C filters. Sample placed
            at center of scintillator and is shielded with 5-cm
            thick LiH to prevent counts due to low energy neutrons
            scattered off sample. Shield also prevents low energy
            neutrons scattered into detector solution from
            returning to the sample.
DETECTOR   (STANK) Liquid scintillator, 1.25-m diameter with
            1100 liters of xylene-based boron loaded solution and
            photomultipliers.
           (NAICR) 5-cm thick by 20-cm diameter NaI detector for
            monitor.
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator with photomultiplier for
            neutrons
MONITOR    Relative flux determined using 10B4-NaI flux detector.
            Normalized to 6.67-eV saturated capture resonance.
CORRECTION Corrected for deadtime, background, relative flux
            measurement and multiple scattering.
ERR-ANALYS Errors include:
            - detector count errors,
            - background errors,
            - error in product of detector efficiency and flux
              normalization (1%),
            - relative flux error (1.5%).
