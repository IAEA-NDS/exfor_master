TITLE      INTERIM REPORT ON THE ORNL ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS OF
            AVERAGE PROMPT NU-BAR FOR CF-252
FACILITY   (LINAC) OAK RIDGE ELECTRON LINEAR ACCELERATOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 900-LITER NE-224 ALUMINUM SCINTILLATION TANK
            WITH GADOLINIUM. SURROUNDED WITH THICK MARBLE WALL TO
            REDUCE BACKGROUND FROM K-40. HORIZONTAL THROUGH-TUBE
            OF 13.69-CM INNER DIAMETER ALUMINUM USED AS BEAM PATH.
             PROTON RECOIL NE-213 LIQUID SCINTILLATOR PLACED IN
            NEUTRON BEAM AND NORMAL TO IT. 4.45-CM IN DIAMETER AND
            0.6-CM THICK WITH PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION.
           (FISCH) CF FISSION CHAMBER LOCATED ABOVE BEAM. CONSISTS
            OF A 0.0004 MICRO-GRAM, 0.5-CM DIAMETER CIRCLE OF CF
            ON NICKEL FOIL OVERCOATED WITH GOLD. CHAMBER FILLED TO
            1-ATM WITH METHANE.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) PROTON RECOIL DATA USED TO
            NORMALIZE A MONTE CARLO CALCULATION FOR TOTAL
            SCINTILLATOR TANK EFFICIENCY.
           SCINTILLATOR TANK PULSE HEIGHT RESPONSE CHECKED USING
            CF-252 FISSION GAMMAS,NEUTRON ABSORPTION GAMMA
            RAYS AND GAMMA RAY SOURCES.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT. FISSION EVENTS SIGNALED BY
            COINCIDENCE BETWEEN FISSION CHAMBER AND PROMPT
            SCINTILLATOR TANK PULSES FROM FISSION GAMMAS. NEUTRONS
            SCATTERED FROM BEAM SIGNALED BY PROTON RECOIL PULSE.
            GRAPHITE USED TO FILL IN SCINTILLATOR THROUGH-TUBE TO
            MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF ASYMMETRY. DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
            FROM 0.5 TO 7.125 MEV DETERMINED USING NEUTRON WHITE
            SOURCE.
