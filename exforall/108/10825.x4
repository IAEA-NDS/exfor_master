DETECTOR   (GELI) 4 and 14 cm3 GeLi detectors.
METHOD     (TOF,GSPEC) 22-m and 48-m flight paths at Brookhaven
           fast chopper facility. GeLi detectors were used to
           measure absolute gamma-ray intensities due to neutron
           capture in individual resonance of 173Yb. Gamma rays
           were gated using time of flight information.
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The spins of resonances were determined by
           examination of the low- and high-energy primary gamma
           rays. Because the spin and parity of the target
           nucleus are 5/2+, the interaction of s-wave neutrons
           with 173Yb would excite 2+ and 3+ states.
           Observations of strong transitions to either 4+ or 1+
           low-lying final states would indicate that spin of
           resonance is 3+ or 1+.
