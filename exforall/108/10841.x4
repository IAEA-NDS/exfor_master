TITLE      The Li-6(n,alpha) cross section from 80-470 keV
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) Oak Ridge electron linear accelerator.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 1-mm thick Li-6 glass scintillator with Li-6
           content uncertainty less than 1% was used for alpha
           particles, neutron flux was measured with 12.7-mm
           Li-6 and 6.6-cm thick by 10-cm diameter NE-110
           detector.
PART-DET   (N,A)
METHOD     (FLUX,TOF,PHD) Two series of measurements were
           performed: with a flight path of 80 m (1) and with
           the 30 m (2). Iron filters of 20 and 30 cm thick were
           used. NE-110 scintillator spectra were used to
           monitor neutron fluxes.
CORRECTION Corrected for multiple interactions in Li-6 detector
            using Monte Carlo technique.
SAMPLE     The 1-cm thick Li-6 scintillator was an active
           target.
ANALYSIS   The data analysis was based on the following
           formula: sigma(E)=C(n,alpha)/(Na phi(E)), where E is
           energy of incident neutron, C(n,alpha) is number of
           reactions, Na is number of 6Li atoms and phi(E) is
           the neutron flux. Measurements were performed at two
           neutron flight paths of 80 and 30 m and the final
           result was averaged. Monte Carlo techniques were used
           to compute efficiency of neutron flux detectors using
           the 05S code by R.E. Textor and V.V. Verbinski.
HISTORY    (19790214C)
           (20120618A) BP: Added thesis data for 30 and 80 m
           flight paths and averaged numbers, revised the fist
           and second  subentry using the thesis data and
           experiment description, converted to new date formats,
           lower case, corrected according to last EXFOR rules
           and Dict.
