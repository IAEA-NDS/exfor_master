FACILITY   (VDG,3INDNSD) 15UD-Pelletron accelerator of the Inter-
           University Accelerator Center (IUAC), New Delhi,
           India. Irradiations have been carried out in the
           General Purpose Scattering Chamber (GPSC) along with
           an In-vacuum Transfer Facility (ITF).
SAMPLE     The thickness of the sample has been estimated  D6086
           by the alpha-transmission method which is based on
           the measurement of the energy loss by the alpha
           particles of energy 5.486 MeV from the Am-241 source
           while passing through the sample material. The
           samples have been pasted on rectangular aluminium
           holders (1.2 x 1.2 cm2) having concentric hole of 1
           cm diameter, Al holders have been used for rapid heat
           dissipation during the irradiations.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)Volume of detector was 100 c.c coupled with the
           CAMAC-based FREEDOM software
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) Experimentally measured cumulative
            (CF+ICF) production cross-sections, deduced (using
           RRDs) cross-section for ICF and CF components and the
           theoretically calculated (PACE) cross-sections for
           the residues produced in  the 16O + 159Tb or
                                             16O + 169Tm system.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
           (ERR-1)Error due to target thickness 1%
           (ERR-2)Error due to fluctuation in beam current 3%
           (ERR-3,,3.)Error due to geometry-dependent
                                         efficiency < 3%
           (ERR-4,,6.) Error in efficiency due to solid-angle
                        effect   <6%
           (ERR-5)Error due to decrease in beam intensity 2%
           (ERR-6) Error due to dead time of spectrometer 10%
