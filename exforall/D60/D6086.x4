TITLE      Observation of complete- and incomplete-fusion
           components in 159Tb,169Tm(16O,x) reactions:

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15UD-Pelletron accelerator.
           Irradiations have been carried out in the General
           Purpose Scattering Chamber (GPSC) along with an In-
           vacuum Transfer Facility (ITF).
SAMPLE     The thickness of the sample has been estimated
           by the alpha-transmission method which is based on
           the measurement of the energy loss by the alpha
           particles of energy 5.486 MeV from the Am-241 source
           while passing through the sample material. The
           samples have been pasted on rectangular aluminum
           holders (1.2 x 1.2 cm2) having concentric hole of 1
           cm diameter, Al holders have been used for rapid heat
           dissipation during the irradiations.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Volume of detector was 100 c.c coupled with the
           CAMAC-based FREEDOM software
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) Experimentally measured cumulative
            (CF+ICF) production cross-sections, deduced (using
           RRDs) cross-section for ICF and CF components and the
           theoretically calculated (PACE) cross-sections for
           the residues produced in the 16O + 159Tb or
                                             16O + 169Tm system.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
           (ERR-1) Error due to target thickness 1%
           (ERR-2) Error due to fluctuation in beam current 3%
           (ERR-3,,3.) Error due to geometry-dependent
                                         efficiency < 3%
           (ERR-4,,6.) Error in efficiency due to solid-angle
                        effect   <6%
           (ERR-5) Error due to decrease in beam intensity 2%
           (ERR-6) Error due to dead time of spectrometer 10%
