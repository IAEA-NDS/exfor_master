            data from 16O+184W reaction were
                              compiled at EXFOR Entry D6049
DETECTOR   (PS) Evaporation residue were detected at the focal
           plane of HIRA using a 50 x 50 mm**2 2D position
           sensitive silicon detector with a resistive layer at
           the front.
           (SIBAR) Elastically scattered beam-like particles
           were registered in two silicon surface barrier
           detectors.
           (BGO) A 14 element BGO detector array was mounted at
           the target chamber for measuring gamma fold
           distribution in coincidence with ERs at the focal
           plane.
SAMPLE     Enriched isotopic (99.99 %) 181-Ta (250 mu-m/cm2)
           target on carbon backing was used for the measurement.
METHOD     (AMS,GSPEC) ERs were separated using the recoil mass
           spectrometer. Transmission efficiency of HIRA was
           determined by the gamma ray method in separate run.
