SAMPLE     The samples of enriched isotopes of 128Te (87%) were
           prepared by vacuum evaporation technique. The 128Te
           material was deposited on the aluminium (Al) foils of
           thickness 6.75 mg/cm2. The measured thickness of the
           128Te deposition was found to be ~92 mg/cm2. A stack
           of four samples was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)detector of 100 c.c. active volume coupled to a
           PC through CAMAC based FREEDOM software.
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) The stack of samples was
           irradiated for nearly six hours keeping in view the
           half-lives of interest. Beam current of %10 pnA
           behind the target assembly was measured with an
           electron suppressed Faraday cup. The total beam
           fluence was found to be 1253 mC.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes statistical
                   uncertainty and:
           (ERR-1,,6.) error in the efficiency on account of
                   solid angle effect is <6%
           (ERR-2,,1.) error due to non uniform deposition
                       is expected to be <1%
           (ERR-3,,3.) error in beam fluctuations  <3%
           (ERR-4,,2.) error due to decrease in beam intensity
                       is expected to be <2%.
           (ERR-5,,10.) error in dead time is kept less than 10%
           Further, the uncertainties in the:
                            * branching ratio,
                            * decay constant etc.,
                   which are taken from Nuclear Data Tables,
                   Data sheets and Table of Isotopes etc., have
                   not been taken into account.
