TITLE      Large pre-equilibrium contribution in A + nat.Ni
           interactions at ~ 8-40 MeV

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     The natural Ni samples (prepared by rolling) of
           thickness ~3.32 mg/cm**2 (measured by the
           alpha-transmission method) were pasted into
           aluminium holders.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Various standard sources of known strength
           were used to determine the efficiency of the
           detector at various source-detector separations. The
           sample-detector separations were suitably adjusted
           to minimize the dead time to <10 %.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) An excitation functions for A + nat.Ni
           have been measured by using the stacked foil
           activation technique followed by off-line gamma-ray
           spectrometry.
INC-SOURCE  A collimated alpha beam ~40 MeV has been allowed to
           fall on a stack of eight targets for ~12 hours with a
           beam current ~100 nA. Post-irradiation analysis has
           been performed by using high resolution, large volume
            (100 c.c.), precalibrated HPGe detector coupled with
           a data-acquisition system.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The evaporation residues were identified by
           their characteristic gamma-ray energies, half-lives
           and branching ratios. Area under the peaks of
           identified gamma-lines of evaporation residues were
           used to compute the experimentally measured
           cross-sections. The experimentally measured Efs are
           compared with the calculations performed with the
           theoretical model code ALICE-91, which takes both
           equilibrium and pre-equilibrium (PE) decay processes
           into account. The CN calculations in this code are
           performed by using the Weisskopf-Ewing model, whereas
           the PE component is simulated by using the
           geometry- dependent hybrid model.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)The geometry-dependent effciency of gamma-ray
           counting at various source-detector separations has
           been deduced and fitted with fourth-order polynomial
           function, where the uncertainty from the fitting is
           found to be < (or =) 3%.
           (ERR-2) The errors in efficiency on account of the
           solid-angle effect have been found to be < (or =) 2%.
           (ERR-3)The errors expected in the number of nuclei
           on account of the non-uniform thickness of the sample
           may be deduced by measuring the thickness at
           different positions of the sample and are found to
           be ~1%.
           (ERR-4) The error from the fluctuations in the beam
           current was found to be ~3%.
           (ERR-5) During irradiation of the stack, the beam
           traverses the thickness of the material , thus
           reducing the initial beam intensity. It
           is estimated that the error from this decrease in
           beam intensity is < (or = )2%.
           (ERR-T) The overall errors in the present
           measurement are found to be < (or =) 15%.
