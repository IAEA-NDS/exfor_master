SAMPLE     Targets of the enriched isotope of 74Ge (with 98.9%
           enrichment)were prepared by the vacuum evaporation
           technique, wherein the 74Ge material was deposited on
           circular aluminium foils of thickness 1.14 mg/cm2
           spread over a circular area of diameter 15 mm.
           The thickness of the target material 74Ge deposited on
           aluminium backings was found to be between 80 to
           270 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 100 cm3 HPGe detector, coupled to a PC based
           data acquisition system was used to record the
           spectra of residual -activities induced in individual
           activated foils. The irradiated targets were
           positioned in front of the detector in a particular
           geometry so as to achieve a dead time of less than 10%.
METHOD     (ACTIV,BCINT,STTA)a PC based data acquisition system
           was used to record the spectra of residual-activities
           induced in individual activated foils.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)The excitation functions (EFs) of the following
           nine reactions: 74Ge(16O, 4n)86Zr, 74Ge(16O,
           p2n)87gY, 74Ge(16O, p3n)86Y, 74Ge(16O, p4n)85Y,
           74Ge(16O, n)85mSr, 74Ge(16O, 3n)83Sr, 74Ge(16O,
           p2n)83Rb, 74Ge(16O, p3n)82mRb, and 74Ge(16O, 2
           3n)79Kr measured with ion beams between 60.2 and
           111.6 MeV
COMMENT    Theoretical estimates of the cross-sections are
           obtained using statistical model based code PACE-2
           that uses the Monte-Carlo simulation technique
           for the de-excitation of a compound nucleus. The
           optical model parameters for the emitted particles
           (neutrons, protons, and alphas), and the average
           gamma transition strength are taken from the
           systematics.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Various factors likely to introduce errors and
           uncertainties in the present cross-section measurements
           and their estimates are:
           (ERR-1,,2.) Estimation of the error in the number of
           nuclei present in the sample were adopted
           non-uniform deposition method and transmission
           method. The non-uniformity in the target material
           thickness introduces an error of less than 2%.
           (ERR-2,,6.) Fluctuations in the beam current has
           been measured by taking the weighted average of the
           beam current, and is estimated to be less than 6%.
           (ERR-3,,5.) Estimation of error in the geometry
           dependent detector efficiency calculated by
           measuring of efficiency using standard source
           152-Eu, efficiency calculation were estimated to be
           less than 5%
           (ERR-4,,10.) The dead time in the pulse processing
           electronics may lead to a loss in the counts by
           adjusting the sample-detector distance, the
           dead-time correction has been minimized, that is
           below 10%.
           (ERR-5,,1.) Errors due to a decrease in the oxygen
           ion beam intensity because of scattering while
           traversing through the stack are estimated to be
           less than 1%.
