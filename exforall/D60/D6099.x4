SAMPLE     Stacks of natural uranium target foils (75 um thick)
            and aluminium catcher foil (25 um) thick
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 5-15 minutes using an external
             alpha particle beam in the energy range of 25-44 MeV.
            The beam current of 1-2 uA during irradiation was
             measured using a Faraday cup.
           (RCHEM,REC) After the irradiation, the aluminium
             catcher foil for each uranium foil facing the beam
             was dissolved.
            Tellurium and iodine were separated radiochemically
             from the dissolved solution within 5-15 min from the
             end of the irradiation.
           (GSPEC) Standard aliquots of purified tellurium and
             iodine samples were counted for optimum durations as
             a function of time at a fixed geometry on an energy
             and efficiency calibrated 90 cc HPGe detector
             coupled to a 4 K multichannel analyser in live time
             mode.
            Counting was carried out over a period of three half-
             lives to confirm the purity of the individual
             photopeak of the concerned radionuclide.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resolution of the detector system was 2.0
             keV at 1332.0 keV and the dead time during the
             counting was always less than 10% to avoid the pile-
             up effect.
MISC-COL   (MISC) fission fragment angular momenta (Jrms)
CORRECTION Photopeaks were corrected for the Compton background.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Including the errors due to
             - counting statistics
             - absolute abundances of the gamma lines
             - detector efficiencies
            (as well as those associated with the cumulative
             yield of the precursor.)
