TITLE      Fission fragment anisotropies for the 13-C+235-U
            system at near-Coulomb barrier energies

SAMPLE     The 235-U target of thickness 200-300 micro gram/cm*2
            deposited on thin aluminum backing was placed at the
            center of the general purpose scattering chamber.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The fission fragments were detected by two
            DeltaE(10-15 microns)-E(300-500 microns)surface
            barrier detector telescopes each of solid angle 0.7
            msr.
METHOD     (EDE)
ANALYSIS   The fission cross section were obtained by integrating
            the measured  angular distribution. The fission cross
            section assumed to be same as the fusion cross
            section for this high fissility system as the
            evaporation residue cross section are negligible. The
            fusion excitation function thus obtain for the
            present reaction was compared with the theoretical
            values based on coupled-channels code CCDEF.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error bar include both statistical and
            least squares fit errors.

COMMENT    This particular combination of target and projectile
            leads to 248-Cf compound nucleus that has been
            studied earlier using three other entrance channels
            viz.
           11-B + 237-Np, 12-C + 236-U and 16-O + 232-Th.
           A comparison of the measured anisotropy data for all
            the four systems, with the statistical saddle point
            model and pre-equilibrium fission (PEF) model, brings
            out a clear signature of entrance channel dependence
            in fission anisotropy values, characteristic of the
            PEF model.
