SAMPLE     The self supporting foil of gold of thickness
                                            ~600 microgram/cm2
DETECTOR   (SILI)three SI(LI) detector 1 to 3mm thickness were
           placed 10 degrees apart on the moveable arm of the
           scattering chamber
           Another Si(Li) detector (thickness ~ l mm) was kept on
           the other arm which was kept fixed throughout the
           measurement. It served as the monitor detector.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current was measured by an ORTEC
           current integrator. An appropriate secondary electron
           suppressor measured the charge collected by the
           Faraday cup.
           The signals from the detector processed by a system
           of charge sensitive pre-amplifier and spectroscopy
           amplifier were fed to ADC of the multichannel
           analyser through a multiplexer unit
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall absolute error in cross-section
           values is estimated to be +- 10% which includes
           uncertainties due to:
             * counting statistics,
             * current measurement, and
             * normalization to Rutherford cross-section.
