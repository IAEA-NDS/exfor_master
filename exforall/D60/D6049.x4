SAMPLE     Enriched, isotopic W-184 target of thickness 210
           microgm/cm2 on a 110 microgm/cm2 carbon backing was
           used. As the residues were of low energy (5.5 to 8
           MeV),the carbon foil was made to face the beam to
           avoid energy loss of residues in carbon foil.
DETECTOR   (BGO) 14 BGO detectors were used with seven detectors
           at the top and the remaining seven at the bottom.
           (SIBAR) Elastically scattered oxygen ions were
           registered in two Si surface barrier detectors placed
           at 25 degree with respect to the beam direction.
           (HPGE) A high resolution HPGe detector of 23%
           relative efficiency was mounted at the target
           chamber. Gamma rays were recorded by the HPGe detector
           in singles and in coincidence with ERs.
METHOD     (TOF,GSPEC)A pulsed beam, with a pulse separation of
           4 microsec was used to record the time of flight
           (TOF) of slowly moving residues. The start signal for
           TOF was taken from focal plane Si detector and the
           stop signal was the RF used for pulsing, with 4
           microsec pulse separation. The (TOF) setup gave a
           clean separation of ERs from the beam like particles.
           The transmission efficiency of HIRA was determined by
           the gamma ray method at 100 MeV beam energy.

           Total fusion cross sections (open triangles) are
           obtained by adding fission and evaporation residue
           cross sections. The fission cross sections have been
           taken from the literature (see REL-REF)
