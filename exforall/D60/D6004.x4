SAMPLE     Prepared by vacuum evaporation of gold onto
           super-pure aluminium foil. Thickness of gold layer
           200 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Using a pre-calibrated HPGe detector connected
           to a Pc-based 4k-channel analyser with resolution of
           2.0keV at 1332keV OF Co-60.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The uncertainties quoted on the formation
           cross-section are the standard deviation of the
           multiple counting reflecting the uncertainty due to
           counting statistics. However, the overall uncertainty
           on the formation cross-sections of evaporation residues
           will be higher due to the contribution from systematic
           errors, mainly:
             * the error in the detection efficiency (2-7%)
             * uncertainty in the target thickness (5%);
             * the efficiency error at the energies of the
               gamma-rays which have been used for the residue
               measurement, is within 2-4%.
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in the target thickness
ANALYSIS    The yield of a mass chain is calculated using the
            experimentally determined independent yield or
            cumulative yield of the fission products.
