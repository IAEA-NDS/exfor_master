SAMPLE     Uranium foils of thickness 71 mg/cm**2 covered with
           6.75 mg/cm**2 thick superpure aluminium foils were
           Irradiated with 40.0 p/m 0.4 MeV alpha particle beam
           at VECC, Calcutta with beam current of 1.0-2.0 micro
           ampere.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resultant precipitate of silver antiomonide,
           dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted on a 45 cc HPGe
           detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live time. The
           resolution of the detector was 2.2 keV at 1332 keV.
           The  gamma spectra indicated that there was no
           contamination from other fission products in the
           separated antimony isotopes.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC) After the irradiation, the front
           side catcher of the irradiated target was dissolved
           with NaOH in presence of antimony carrier. Antimony
           was separated from the active solution by distilling
           antimony hydride and collecting into silver nitrate
           solution. The resultant precipitate of silver
           antiomonide, dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted on
           a 45 cc HPGe detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live
           time mode.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) From the photopeak areas of the gamma rays of
           The nuclides' independent isomeric yields were
           determined using usual decay-growth equations after
           for correcting the precursor contribution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error on an individual measurement is
           about 15 % which is the compounded error due to
           counting statistics, the uncertainties on the
           gamma-ray abundances, the fractional cumulative yield
            (FCY) 128-Sn, the irradiation and separation  times
           and the half lives. The errors quoted on the mean
           isomeric yield ratios are the precision of the
           measurements.

STATUS     (APRVD) By Dr.B.S.Tomar, RCD, BARC
COMMENT    fragment angular momenta estimated from the measured
           isomer ratios using the statistical model analysis
           showed significantly larger fragment angular momenta
           in the medium energy fissioning system compared to
           the low energy fissioning system. This has been
           attributed to the effect of higher excitation energy
           and angular momentum in the entrance channel leading
           to increased fragment temperature, moments of inertia
           and angular velocity.
