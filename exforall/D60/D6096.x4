           India
SAMPLE     Thin self supporting yttrium foils of 3 and 3.8mg/cm2
           thickness were prepared by proper rolling. Target foils
           and aluminium catcher foils MERCK of 1.5mg/cm2
           thickness were mounted on aluminum ring of 10 mm inner
           and 22 mm outer diameter with 0.5 mm thickness. Target
           stack was assembled by 5 foils of yttrium each
           separated by aluminium catcher.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)After the bombardment, the foils were assayed for
           the gamma-ray activity of the product radionuclides by
           an HPGe detector of 2.13 keV in resolution at 1332 keV
           coupled with a PC based MCA, PCA2, OXFORD.
METHOD     (STTA,GSPEC,CHSEP)stacked-foil technique followed by
           off-line gamma-ray spectrometry. Chemical separation
           of the radionuclides by liquid liquid extraction LLX
           and solid liquid extraction SLX techniques was also
           carried out.
                 Irradiation time (3.75 h)
INC-SOURCE Target stack thus prepared was bombarded with 9Be4+
           ions of current less than 25 nA beam current for 3.75
           h with a total charge of 304 muC measured with a
           current integrator. Terminal voltage of the Pelletron
           was maintained at 10.9MV that yielded a maximum
           energy of 47.5MeV.Energy range covered was from
           30-48MeV. The total
           charge of irradiation was collected from an electron
           suppressed Faraday cup stationed at the rear of the
           target assembly.
ANALYSIS   Efficiency calibration of the detector was performed
           as a function of gamma-ray energy using a standard
           152Eu of half life = 13.506 y source of known activity.
           Activated foils were measured for 300 seconds in the
           live time mode and successive measurements were carried
           out in the same geometry. The projectile energy at a
           target is calculated as the average
           of incident and outgoing beam energy. Beam energy
           degradation in the target and the catcher foils was
           calculated using the software code, stopping and range
           of ions in matter SRIM. The yields of the 93,94,95Tc
           radionuclides produced in each foil were calculated
           using the reported nuclear data. Background
           subtracted peak area counts corresponding to gamma-ray
           energy 1363.09, 702.63 and 765.789 keV are the measures
           of the product yields of 93Tc, 94Tc, and 95Tc,
           respectively.
