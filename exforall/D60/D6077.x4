TITLE      Fission studies in the reaction of 19F with 209Bi
           at 99.2 MeV
AUTHOR     (S.Singh, A.Mhatre)
COMMENT    Fission product yield studies in the reaction of 99.2
           MeV 19-F with 209-Bi have been carried out using
           gamma-ray spectrometry. Cross sections for the
           production of fission products have been determined.
           Yield distribution of fission products was found to be
           symmetric and broad with FWHM around 22 mass units and
           peak near mass 111. The average number of neutrons
           emitted per fission has been found to be around 6.7.
           Comparison of the fission products yield distribution
           of 209Bi using projectiles like 4He, 12C, 16O, and 19F
           have shown that the mass of symmetric peak increases as
           the mass of the compound nucleus increases.
           High fission yield around mass 112 has been attributed
           to the presence of deformed neutron shells.
           Total fission cross section and width of the mass
           distribution have been found to be low in case of 16O
           induced fission as compared to the 4He, 12C, and 19F
           induced fission of 209Bi.

SAMPLE     Targets of super pure 209-Bi were prepared by vacuum
           evaporation on 7.6 micro-meter super pure aluminium
           foil. Targets of 0.84 mg/cm**2 of bismuth were used
           for Irradiation. The fission products were collected on
           25.4 micro-meter thick aluminum foil by recoil catcher
           technique. The whole assembly was put in a target
           holder and irradiated for a suitable length of time
           with 100 MeV 19-F particle beam of ~100 nano-ampere.
           Average incident energy of 19-F on the bismuth targets
           was 99.2 MeV.
           Aluminium catcher foil used for collection of fission
           products was mounted on a thin perspex plate and
           counted at suitable distance from a 8% HPGe detector.

METHOD     (BCINT)
           (ACTIV,EXTB) Four irradiations were carried out for
           varying duration of time from around 2 and 12 hours so
           as to cover both the short and long lived fission
           products.
           (GSPEC) The decay of the activity for the fission
           products was followed from a few minutes to a few days
           for the short irradiations and from a few hours to 10
           days for the longer irradiations.
           The cumulative production cross section was determined
           for most of the mass chains. In case of shielded nuclei
           independent production cross section was determined.

COMMENT    In order to determine the fractional cumulative yield
            (FCY)of parent and fractional independent yield of the
           daughter (FIY), the latter was assumed to be the last
           member of the mass chain involved.
           Since there can be some yield of the grand daughter
           product, the above mentioned FCY in the true sense is a
           relative fractional cumulative yield (RCY).

METHOD     Measured independent and cumulative cross sections
           of the given fission products was used to arrive
           at the total chain yield (YA). The independent yield
           and cumulative yield of a fission product in a given
           mass chain was assumed to be in the Gaussian form.
           In the absence of data on the width of the distribution
            (Sz) and most probable charge (Zp), the Zp was
           determined assuming unchanged charge distribution
            (UCD). Since, neither the data on Sz nor on average
           number of neutrons emitted per fission (vT) was
           available for 209Bi(19F,f), hence these were determined
           by fitting the experimental yields to the equations in
           an iterative manner.
           An average value of vT was assumed and the YA for the
           fission products was determined. Calculated YA was
           used to arrive at the new vT value. The input and
           calculated vT were compared. The input vT value was
           varied between 5 to 10 to arrive at the appropriate
           value of vT. This whole process was repeated for
           various Sz values from 0.8 to 1.1. YA were compared for
           all these Sz values to arrive at the best fit.
           The input value of vT = 6.7 for 99.2 MeV gave the best
           fit for the YA distribution at  Sz = 0.90.
COMMENT    * Comment by compiler (S.Singh, 2009-08-13):
            In the EXFOR library there is no suitable reaction
            code for this type of reactions. I have used as
            (83-BI-209(9-F-19,F)MASS,CUM,SIG,,,DERIV)
            but in fact it should be CHN instead of CUM, as this
            is a chain yield cross section
           * Comment by NDS (N.Otsuka, 2009-08-14)
            REACTION code is changed to
              (83-BI-209(9-F-19,F)MASS,,SIG)
            for the moment.

ANALYSIS   (CHGDS) Total chain yield cross section for a given
           mass chain was determined by integrating the product
           yields for all the fission product in a given
           mass chain. Unchanged charge distribution assumed
                   Dispersion of charge= 0.90
                   nu-bar= 6.7.
