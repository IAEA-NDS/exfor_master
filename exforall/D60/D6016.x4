TITLE      Influence of incomplete fusion on complete fusion:
           Observation of a large incomplete fusion fraction
           at E~ 5-7 MeV/nucleon

SAMPLE     The self-supporting 159-Tb (abundance==99.99%)
           targets of thickness ~0.83 mg/cm*2 were prepared by
           rolling method and the 169-Tm (abundance=100%)
           targets of 0.65 mg/cm*2 thickness, using
           vaccum-evaporation technique. The Al-backing of
           169-Tm targets served as energy degrader as well a
           catcher foil during the irradiations. The 159-Tb
           targets were backed by thick Al-cathers of ~2
           mg/cm*2 thickness to trap the recoiling nuclei. The
           targets were cut into the size of 1.2 x 1.2 cm*2 and
           were pasted on Al-holders having concentric hole of
           1.0 cm diameter. The Al-holders were used for rapid
           dissipation of heat produced during the irradiations.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The evaporation residues populated in each
           target-catcher foil assembly via complete and/or
           incomplete fusion of 16-O were identified by counting
           the induced activities using high resolution HPGe
           gamma-ray spectrometer of 100 c.c. active volume
           coupled to PC through CAMAC based FREEDOM software.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC) Particle-gamma coincidence technique
           for various projectile-target combinations over wide
           projectile energy range has been employed for
           precise measurement and analysis of excitation
           functions, recoil range distributions, and spin
           distributions of residues populated via complete
           and/or incomplete fusion. Recoil-catcher technique
           followed by off-line gamma-ray spectrometry has been
           also employed in the measurement.
INC-SOURCE Two stacks each containing four and five samples of
           159-Tb were irradiated at beam energies ~87 and 95
           MeV, while two stacks of 169-Tm targets having four
           and three samples each where irradiated at energies
           ~92 and 95 MeV by an 16-O beam. The beam current was
           monitored ~30-50 nA for both the systems in all
           irradiations.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Data analysis have been performed using
           FREEDOM software for nuclear data analysis. Area
           under the peaks of identified gamma-lines of
           evaporation residues were used to estimate the count
           rate followed by production probability measurement.
           A FORTRAN program EXP-SIGMA has been used for the
           determination of the production cross sections of
           evaporation residues. In order to examine the extent to
           which the observed quantities are described in terms of
           the equilibrated decay of 175-Ta* and 185-Ir* populated
           in the interaction of 16-O with 159-Tb and 169-Tm
           within the energy range ~75-95 MeV, the presently
           measured excitations functions have been compared with
           those calculated using statistical model code PACE2
            (based on Hauser-Feshbach theory). The code PACE2 is
           based on statistical approach of CN deexcitation by
           Monte Carlo procedure. The angular momentum projections
           are calculated at each stage of deexcitation. The
           angular momentum conservation is explicitly taken into
           account at each step, and the CF cross sections are
           calculated using BASS formulla. It may, however, be
           pointed out that the ICF process is not taken into
           account in code PACE2. Hence, the enhancement of
           experimentally measured production cross sections as
           compared to the theoretical predictions may be
           attributed to the incomplete fusion process.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The non uniformthickness of samples that may
           lead to the uncertainty  in the determination of
           the number of target nuclei. It is estimated that
           the error in the thickness of the sample material is
           less than 1%. Fluctuations in the beam current may
           result in the variation of incident flux, proper
           care has been taken to keep the beam current
           constant as far as possible and, correction in flux
           determination from the fluctuations in beam current
           has been applied.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in the determination of
           geometry dependent spectrometer efficiency. The
           error in the efficiency determination due to the
           statistical fluctuations in counts is estimated to
           be less than 2%. In this measurements both the
           sample and the catcher foils were counted together
           and hence, the losses due to the recoiling of nuclei
           is avoided.
           (ERR-3) The dead time of the spectrometer was kept
           <(or=)10% by suitably adjusting sample detector
           distance.
           (ERR-T) The overall errors from these factors
           including statistical errors are estimated to be
           <(or=)15%.

COMMENT    The experimental data has been compared with the
           prediction of theoretical model code PACE2. The
           enhancement in the production crosssections, in case
           of alpha-emmision channels (after correcting the
           precursor contribution, if any), as compared to
           PACE2 calculations has been attributed to the
           incomplete fusion reaction. The incomplete fusion
           fraction is found to be <(or=)1% at ~75 MeV, while
           it is approaching ~20% of the total fusion cross
           section at ~95 MeV for 16-O + 159-Tb system.
           However,the incomplete fusion fraction is found to
           be <(or=)10% at ~75 MeV and observed to be ~30% 0f
           the total fusion cross section at ~95 MeV for 16-O +
           169-Tm system. It may however be pointed out that
           the incomplete fusion fraction is also found to be
           more in mass symmetric systems, though, the
           projectile structure effect appears to play
           significant role in the systematics but this
           conjecture needs to be confirmed by further
           experimental data.
