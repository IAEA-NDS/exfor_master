SAMPLE     2500 grams of depleted U3O8 oxide in which the
           ratio of isotopes 238U/235U was 3800. 92 uranium
           pellets were produced. Each pellet was 2.57 cm in
           diameter, 0.70 cm in height,and weighted 20 grams.
           These were held in little Al dishes, each of which
           weighed slightly less than 2 grams. The 92 pellets
           were arranged inside a graphite brick 10 x 10 x 120
           cm long in a cubic lattice of spacing 5.21 cm, 23
           periods long.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Low geometry thin mica window counter.
METHOD     (REAC,CHSEP) Reactivity coefficient measurement. The
           absorption cross section of 238U was measured by
           comparing the change in reactivity of a pile produced
           by a sample of oxide in which the isotopic ratio was
           3800, with that produced by a standard boron
           absorber. The temperature of the pile neutrons with
           which the measurement was made was found to be 381 K.
           Cd wires were used to determine neutron temperature.
           After the irradiation the pellets were dissolved in
           nitric acid. Five grams of purified material was
           pressed into a pellet and the beta-ray activity of
           the 23.5 minute half life of 239U was measured.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data reproducibility error.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,G)92-U-239,,SIG)
INC-SPECT  Sub-Cd spectrum.
ANALYSIS   From the (thermal+resonance)/resonance ratio of 2.649.
           0.6225 fraction below the Cd limit: 0.6625 x 4.158 =
           2.59 b. From this effect of B and Cd impurities found
           in spectrographic analysis had to be subtracted. This
           amounted to 0.006 b. The final number of 2.58 b may
           have to be reduced slightly if other dangerous
           impurities are found.

           absorption by 238U after corrections.
MONITOR    (5-B-0(N,ABS),,SIG) Relative to boron thermal
           absorption of 703 b at 2200 m/sec.
CORRECTION Correction of 0.143 b due to the effect of 235U in
           the sample was added. In addition, 0.022 b had to be
           added to correct for the effect of fast fission in
           238U.
