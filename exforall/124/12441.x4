TITLE      Capture cross section of U-235 for pile neutrons
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS)
           (SPECM,1USALAS)  Mass spectrographic determination of
            U-236/U-235 ratio.
SAMPLE     The material used in each case was uranium hexafluoride
           and the UF(5) ions formed by electronic
           bombardment were studied.
           Several samples of enriched materials have been
           irradiated in the Clinton and Hanford piles for
           varying lengths of time.
