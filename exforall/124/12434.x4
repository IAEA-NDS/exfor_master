TITLE      Normalization of the Pu239 and Pu241 fission cross
            sections.
FACILITY   (SPECC,1USAHAN) Crystal spectrometer
DETECTOR   (PROPC) The resulting activity of the gold and hence
           the neutron flux of the irradiation was determined by
           a measurement of the beta activity of the gold foil in
           a calibrated 4Pi beta proportional counter.

             - average from seven measurements.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9198) The weight of the fission foil
           has been tentatively
           established at O. 144 mg/cm2 by comparison alpha
           counting against a standard foil prepared from the
           same material by electrodeposition
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-S) The standard statistical error of terms other
           than those due to the weight of the U235 fission foil
           and of the gold cross section
           (ERR-1) An uncertainty in the weight of the U235
           fission foil was assumed in arriving at the stated
           uncertainty of the U235 fission cross section.

SAMPLE     Three plutonium fission samples were used. The weights
           of the foils were obtained from a measured alpha
           emission rate, the alpha half-lives of the isotopes,
           and mass spectrometric determinations of the isotopic
           contents of the samples.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The three values of each cross section were
            weighted by the reciprocal squares of their
            uncertainties and a weighted average obtained. Since
            the assigned uncertainties of each value were
            determined primarily by the uncertainties in the
            isotopic contents and alpha half-lives these
            uncertainties are not independent. The uncertainty
            of the final answer was then chosen as the smallest
            uncertainty of the individual determinations.
