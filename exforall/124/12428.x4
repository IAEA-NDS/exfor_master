METHOD     (INTB,CHSEP) In the first irradiation a sample of
           natural uranium was irradiated bare and a sample of
           enriched 235U was irradiated under cadmium. The
           arrangements for the second irradiation were similar
           except that both the bare natural uranium and
           cadmium-covered enriched uranium were accompanied by
           sample of PuO2. After cooling, the capsules were cut
           open and the irradiated samples dissolved in nitric
           acid. The solutions of the uranium samples were
           analyzed for plutonium by alpha counting, and for
           uranium by colorimetry using KCNS; this Pu/U analysis
           measured the destruction of U during the course of
           the irradiation. Purified uranium samples were
           prepared from these solutions for isotopic analysis
           by mass spectrometry. The irradiated plutonium
           samples were purified and analyzed
           mass-spectrometrically; 241Am was removed immediately
           before analysis.

SAMPLE     Bare samples considered: The samples, located at
           opposite ends of an aluminum capsule, each consisted
           of about 25 mg U3O8 spread out over an area of about
           1.1 cm in a small aluminum can. The capsule was
           irradiated close enough to the central plane of the
           reactor for the effects of the vertical flux gradient
           to be negligible.
ANALYSIS   Maxwellian sigma for 2 runs=(0.1790+-0.0033) and
            (0.1787+-0.0017), corrected to 2200 m/sec using
           Westcott formalism and g and s from Critoph, CRRP-
           1191(1964).

SAMPLE     Cadmium-covered samples considered: The samples,
           located at opposite ends of an aluminum capsule, each
           consisted of about 25 mg U3O8 spread out over an area
           of about 1.1 cm in a small aluminum can.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The enriched sample was enclosed in a cadmium
           box 0.8 mm thick, 1.3 cm diameter and 1. 3 cm high,
           located about 6 cm below the bare sample. The capsule
           was irradiated close enough to the central plane of
           the reactor for the effects of the vertical flux
           gradient to be negligible.

           (ERR-1) The experimental uncertainty is almost
