DETECTOR   (FISCH) The fission counter was the double chamber type
           with one chamber containing a Pu-239 standard acting as
           a flux monitor. In the second chamber alternate counts
           were taken on the sample, blank background plates and
           Pu-239 standards. Of the six Pu-239 standards used,
           three were nearly isotopically pure Pu-239, while the
           others contained a known amount of Pu-240.

METHOD     (ACTIV)    Activation
           The pile-neutron capture cross section of Pu-238 was
           measured by inserting three quartz capsules, each
           containing about a microgram of the same Pu-238 used
           in the fission cross-section measurements, into the
           rabbit facility of the Materials Testing Reactor for
           approximately two, three, and five days' neutron
           irradiation, respectively.
           After separation and purification of the plutonium,
           plated samples were made, and the amount of Pu-239
           produced in each irradiation was determined by
           fission-counting.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
            The pile-neutron flux was monitored by the neutron-
           capture activation of cobalt wire and the results were
           corrected for resonance neutron activation and
           self-protection.
CORRECTION It was necessary to make a slight correction in the
           fission-counting rate for those fissions contributed
           by Pu-238.
ANALYSIS   Allowing for the destruction of a small fraction of
           the Pu-238 and of Pu-239 during its formation, the
           resulting Pu-238/Pu-239 ratio and the known integrated
           neutron flux on each sample yield a capture cross
                                      section of 520+-40 barns.

COMMENT    It is not quite clear from the article what isotope
           was measured. From half-lives that authors used in
           calculations one can made conclude that it is Am-242-m.
