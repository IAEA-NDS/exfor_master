TITLE      The cross-section for U238 fission by fission neutrons

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Los Alamos homogeneous reactor.
INC-SPECT  A thermal-neutron flux of 3*10**7 neutrons/cm2/sec.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Double ionization chamber.
SAMPLE     The U238 in the form of U323808 of 110,000:1 isotopic
           abundance was on a thin aluminum hemisphere which was
           concentric with another thin but larger aluminum
           hemisphere. The two aluminum hemispheres constitute
           an ionization chamber which detects the U238 fission
           fragments.
METHOD     By means of measurements with a double ionization
           chamber, the average fission cross section of U238
           for neutrons from the fission of U235 was determined
           in terms of nu, the average number of neutrons per
           fission of U235. The number of fissions of U238 was
           measured in one of the ionization chambers while the
           number of fissions from the fission neutron source of
           U235 was measured in the other chamber.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The standard deviations of the mean of the
           measurements and does not include uncertainties in
           neutron scattering calculations, in the calculations
           of unobserved U238 fissions, or in the method of
           background measurements. The largest uncertainty in
           these measurements is 235U mass and number of 235U
           fission neutrons.
CORRECTION Several corrections of several percent or less for
           neutron absorption and neutron scattering must be
           applied. Corrections are necessary for absorption and
           scattering of thermal neutrons in the platinum and
           Dural between the U deposit and the U235 disc.
           Corrections are necessary because fission neutrons
           were, in addition, scattered to the U238 by the
           reactor face, the outside case of the chamber, and
           the various hemispheres within the case. In addition,
           the absorption of the fission neutrons by the cadmium
           and the inner aluminum hemisphere was taken into
           account. The largest of these corrections is 2 to 3%
           for the scattering of neutrons from the hemisphere
           containing U238; that is, a greater effective
           thickness of U238 is "seen" by the deflected fission
           neutrons than is "seen" by the unscattered neutrons.
