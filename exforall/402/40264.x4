HISTORY    (750107C)     COMPILED AT THE CENTRE
           (881116U)  SEVERAL ERRORS CORRECTED
                 NUC-QUANT INTO REACTION CONVERTED
                 DATA-ERR  INTO ERR-T CHANGED. THREE

COMMENT      SEPARATE DEFINITION METHOD OF THE TARGET NEUTRON
              YIELD AND OF THE FISSIONS VELOCITY IN IT WAS USED.
              NEUTRON YIELD WAS MEASURED BY THREE METHODS
METHOD     (ASSOP)    IN CARBON SPHERE WITH PAST CALIBRATION ON
                ASSOCIATED PARTICLES AT USING OF DEUTERON-TRITIUM
                   REACTION,
           (ACTIV)  BY METHOD OF AURUM ACTIVATION IN WATER TANK
           (MANGB)    BY METHOD OF MANGANESE BATH.

DETECTOR   (SOLST)               CHAMBER WITH SILICON SURFACE-
                  BARRIER DETECTOR OF FISSION FRAGMENTS
PART-DET   (FF)       FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE REGISTRATED AT
                  DETERMINATION OF FISSIONS VELOCITY
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)             1)STATISTICAL ERROR,
                               2)UNCERTAINTY OF EXTRAPOLATION OF
