REFERENCE  (C,73KIEV,4,76,197306)  Preliminary data are given
           (R,YFI-17,34,197408)    No data given
STATUS     (PRELM)       Preliminary data from C,73KIEV,4,76,7306
METHOD       Separate definition method of the target neutron
              yield and of the fissions velocity in it was used.
              Neutron yield was measured by three methods :
                    In carbon sphere calibrated by
                associated particles of T(d,n)alpha reaction.
           (ACTIV)  By method of gold activation in water tank
           (MANGB)  By method of manganese bath of 85 cm diameter,
                    95 cm high.
MONITOR     No information
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)  Chamber with silicon surface-barrier
                   detector - for fission fragments registration.
SAMPLE      Two Cf-252 of 0.383 and 0.909 microg sources were made
           by thermospraying and electrolysis, respectively.
PART-DET   (FF)       Fission fragments were registered at
                  determination of fissions rate.
CORRECTION For low-energy "tail" extrapolation.
           No correction for FF scattering on backing .
           For Cf source self-scattering.
           For Cf source diameter increasing - 0.5% .
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)  Total error 0.7 %.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error.
           (ERR-1) uncertainty of extrapolation of energy
                   spectrum "tail".
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of self-scattering  of Cf source.
           (ERR-3) Determination of solid angle.
           (ERR-4) Raveling out of active spot.
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M.
           In C,75KIEV,5,166,1975 ( next publication of authors)
           it's mentioned for experiment of this Entry 40264 :
           weighting-average error of neutron yield as 0.9 %,
           0.7% - error of fission rate measurement
HISTORY    (19750107C)     Compiled at the centre
           (19881116U)  Several errors corrected
                 NUC-QUANT into REACTION converted
                 DATA-ERR  into ERR-T changed. three
                 names corrected (Kramarovskiy,Shlyamin,Yarutsina)
           (20130315A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           Units were corrected NO-DIM -> PRT/FIS .
           BIB information was updated. Errors values were added.
