SAMPLE     0.5-40 g ZrOCl2 x 8H2O
METHOD     (CHSEP) Reaction products were separated
           radiochemically.
ANALYSIS    The ratio of the initial activities of Y-90m and Y-90g
           was determined by comparing the initial intensities of
           220-keV gamma line of Y-90m and the initial beta
           activity  of Y-90g in Y samples separated chemically
           from Zr and Nb targets.
