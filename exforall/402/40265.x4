TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF AVERAGE PROMPT NEUTRON NUMBER
           FOR PU-239 IN ENERGY RANGE 0.01-40 EV
INC-SOURCE (REAC)     REACTOR
METHOD     (COINC)    COINCIDENCE METHOD BETWEEN FISSION NEUTRONS
                      AND FISSION FRAGMENTS
           (TOF)      TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHOD FOR DETERMINATION
                      OF NEUTRON ENERGY. FLIGHT BASE = 9.2 METERS
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     FOUR DETECTORS ON THE BASE OF STILBENE
                      CRYSTALS WERE USED FOR COUNTING
                      OF FISSION NEUTRONS. NO INFORMATION
                      ABOUT DETECTOR FOR MEASUREMENT
                      OF FISSION FRAGMENTS.
ANALYSIS   VALUE OF NU FOR PU-239 WAS MEASURED AS REGARDS
           NU FOR PU-239 AT THERMAL NEUTRONS.
MONITOR    NORMALIZED TO NU FOR PU-239 IN ENERGY RANGE 0.02-0.04EV
PART-DET   (FF)       FISSION FRAGMENTS
           (PN)       FISSION PROMPT NEUTRONS
           (DG)       DECAY GAMMA
HISTORY    (750228C)
CORRECTION FOR DETERMINATION OF RELATIVE VALUE OF NU
           FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
           1. CORRECTION ON ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENCE AND
              DEAD TIME OF EXPERIMENTAL PLANT
           2. DEPENDENCE OF EFFICIENCY OF REGISTRATION
              FOR NEUTRON DETECTOR FROM NEUTRON ENERGY
