TITLE      Measurement of average prompt neutron number
           for Pu-239 in energy range 0.01-40 eV

INSTITUTE  (4RUSKUR)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSITE)
SAMPLE      Metal, 10 x 10 cm size, 2.2E-3 at/b thickness.
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence method between fission neutrons
                   and prompt gamma rays and capture gamma rays.
           (TOF)      Time-of-flight method for determination
                      of neutron energy. Flight base = 9.2 m.
           (PSD) Neutron and gamma rays pulses were separated by
                 shape.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     Four detectors on the base of stilbene
                      crystals (67 x 7 cm) were used for counting
                      of fission neutrons. No information
                      about detector for measurement
                      of fission fragments.
ANALYSIS   Value of nu for Pu-239 was measured as regards
           nu for pu-239 at thermal neutrons.
MONITOR    Normalized to NU for PU-239 in energy range 0.02-0.04eV
PART-DET   (PN,G)
CORRECTION For determination of relative value of NU
           following corrections were taken into account
           1. correction on accidental coincidence and
              dead time of experimental setup,
           2. dependence of efficiency of registration
              for neutron detector from neutron energy
HISTORY    (19750228C)
           (20210831A) M.M. correction for current rules and
            dictionaries. REAC -> CYCLO. PSD was added.
            PART-DET (FF) was deleted.

COMMENT     Of authors. Nu in the thermal energy range and at
            0.3 eV resonance ( and also probaly at resonances of
            energy up to 40 eV) is constant in average with
            accuracy 1.%.
