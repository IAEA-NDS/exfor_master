TITLE      Some data on the spontaneous fission of Cm-244
METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence between fission fragments
            either between emitted neutron and fission fragment
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Double grid ionization chamber - for
           measurements of kinetic energy of fragments
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) All errors are mean square errors calculated
           from variability of results in individual series
           of measurements
