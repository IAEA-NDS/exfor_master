TITLE      Prompt-neutron multiplicity in spontaneous fission.
METHOD     (COINC) Neutron-fission fragments-coincidence.
           Distributions of events in the number of recorded
           neutron was obtained for Cm-246, Cm-244 and
           for background. The total number of fission events were
           1.0E+5 for Cm-255, 1.3E+5 for Cm-246.
           Data for Cm-244 obtained in previous measurement ( see
           REL-REF of M.Dakovskii+, detection efficiency 48.2% )
           were also included in analysis.
REL-REF    (M,40188001,M.Dakovskii+,J,YF,17,(4),692,1973)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) 36 proportional He-3 neutron counters.
           Detection efficiencies for Cm-244 and Cm-246 were
           assumed equal. Statistics were collected for two values
           of neutron-detection efficiency- 39.9% and 44.4%.
           (SIBAR) Silicon-gold surface-barrier detectors for
           fission fragments.
PART-DET   (N) Neutrons
           (FF) fission fragments
CORRECTION Corrections were introduced on sample isotope
           contents, the fragment discrimination threshold(<0.4%),
           the background (< 0.003 n/fis), the time resolution of
           neutron counters ( <10%).
