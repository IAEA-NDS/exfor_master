INSTITUTE  (4RUSKUR)
FACILITY   (LINAC)    Electron linear accelerator
METHOD     (TOF)      Time-of-flight path 35 m.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)    Liquid scintillation detector of 400l volume.
           (IOCH)   Ionization chamber with Cf-252 layer for
            measurement of gamma-rays registration efficiency.
            Gamma quanta registration efficiency 0.347+-0.002 .
            Fission neutron registration efficiency 0.700+-0.004.
CORRECTION At Nu-bar calculation
           1) incident neutron-fission angle correlation
           2) average energy change of fission neutron with Nu-bar
           increase and difference of fission neutron spectrum of
           Cf-252 from one of isotope studied
           3)Multiplication of neutron formed into sample studied
               were taken into account
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)      At calculation of errors
                   1)statistical calculation
           (ERR-1) 2)Change of neutron registration efficiency
           because of instability of apparatus
           (ERR-2) 3)error of background measurement by means of
           lead sample
           (ERR-3) 4)error of correction on starting of time
           channel at En < 0.9 MeV by fission neutron
           were taken into account
