TITLE      The investigation of level at 1167 eV for Fe-56
           by moving sample method
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSKUR) Linear accelerator of electrons
SAMPLE     Admixtures in samples 0.01 %.
           Thickness of moving sample 0.0468 atoms/b.
           Thickness of sample placed in detector 0.0038 atoms/b.
METHOD     (TOF)      Flight path 37 m.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
PART-DET   (N,G)
COMMENT    Method of moving sample (see Phys.Letters,14,123,1965)
           used at orbital momentum identification of level.
HISTORY    (19740514C)  Compiled at the centre
           (20210831A) M.M. correction for current rules and
            dictionaries.
ERR-ANALYS Areas under two experimental resonance curves
           agree to about 2.5 %, depending on sample movement
           direction.  If L=0 then the areas calculated under the
           same curves agree only to about 19 %.
