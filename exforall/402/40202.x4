TITLE      The 2.9 MeV neutron angular distributions for the
           scattering from magnesium nuclei
FACILITY   (CCW,4UKRIJD) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuteron-deuterium
SAMPLE     (12-MG-24,NAT=0.786) The sample weight is 122 grams.
           Mg-24 enrichment- 78.6%
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight method with the time resolution
           2.5 nsec/m
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Solid scintillator detector
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
            Cross sections were measured relatively to the n-p
           scat. cs. taken from Fast Neutron Physics,
           Marion and Fowler, New York, London, 1960
MONIT-REF  (,J.B.Marion+,B,FAST N.PH.,,1960)
ADD-RES    (COMP) Measured diff. inelast. scat. cross section is
           compared with the Hauser-Feshbach theory calculation
CORRECTION Corrections were introduced on the multiple scattering,
           flux absorption in the sample and angular resolution
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted elast. scat. cs. errors (about 5%)
           and inelast. scat. cs.errors (about 8%) consist of
           statistical error, arrangement non-stability error
           and geometry error.
COMMENT    Of author T.I.Yakovenko via O.Gritzay, 2015-01-31:
           1. 40311 includes the same data as in 40045,40065,40202
           2. all data in C.M.
           3. For Mg: Mg-0 for elastic, Mg-24 for inelastic (they
           identified the first level)
           Of compiler M.M. :
              In UFZ,14,(11),1874,1969 the measurement is
           explained as done "in angle interval 30-135 degrees
           by step of 15 degrees". Such the same step in the whole
           angle range is usually applied in Laboratory system.
