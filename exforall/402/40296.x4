INSTITUTE  (4RUSRI)
INC-SOURCE (CF252)    Spont.fiss.californium-252 .
            Prepared by thermoscattering of Cf.
            Diameter of Cf foil 3.0+-0.2 mm.
SAMPLE      Prepared by high-frequency plasma spraying.  U(3)O(8).
           Non-uniformity less 1%.
           Weights were measured by alpha-activity in 2PI geometry
           in mesh ionization pulse chamber (U-238) and
           semi-conductor detector in a small solid angle (U-235).
           Isotopic analysis was performed by alpha spectrometer.
ANALYSIS    Fission cross-section is defined according to
            the formula
               SIGMAfis=(2PI*A*Nf*R**2)/(N0*P*NUCf*G*K*NCf)
            here Nf- a number of fissions for uranium isotope,
                 N0- Avogadro number,
                 R- radius of the active foil target,
                 P- weight of the fissionable material in target,

                NCf- a number of fissions for Cf-252,
                 G - geometry factor of experimental setup
                 K - coefficient of correction for counting errors
                     in Cf-252 FF counting channel,
                 A - atomic weight of U isotope.
