SAMPLE      Prepared by high-frequency plasma spraying.  U(3)O(8).
           Non-uniformity less 1%.
           Weights were measured by alpha-activity in 2PI geometry
           in mesh ionization pulse chamber (U-238) and
           semi-conductor detector in a small solid angle (U-235).
           Isotopic analysis was performed by alpha spectrometer.
ANALYSIS    Fission cross-section is defined according to
            the formula
               SIGMAfis=(2PI*A*Nf*R**2)/(N0*P*NUCf*G*K*NCf)
