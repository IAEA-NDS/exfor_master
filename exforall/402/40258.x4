ANALYSIS    KNOWING FLUX OF NEUTRONS IRRADIATING ON THE TARGET
            OF U-235 AND NUMBER OF FISSION FRAGMENTS
            FISSION CROSS-SECTION WAS CALCULATED
CORRECTION  FOR DETERMINATION OF FISSION CROSS-SECTION
            FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
            1. REGISTRATING EFFICIENCY OF FISSION FRAGMENTS
               BY MEANS OF MICA DETECTORS IS EQUAL 96+-1 PER-CENT.
            2. CONTRIBUTION OF FISSION FRAGMENTS FOR FISSION
               OF U-238 AND U=234.NO NUMERICAL INFORMATION
            3. GEOMETRY OF NEUTRON FLUX - 2 PER-CENT
            5. CONTRIBUTION OF ELASTIC SCATTERING NEUTRONS
               AT THE PART OF CONSTRUCTION - 1 PER-CENT
