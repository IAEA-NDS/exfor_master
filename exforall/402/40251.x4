TITLE      Excitation function for the reaction C-12(n,p)B-12
           at the neutron energies 16-18 MeV
FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRKGU) Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium. Target thickness 100 keV
SAMPLE     Natural carbon
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
           B-12 activity was measured in intervals between pulses
           of duration 20 msec; pulses frequency 10 1/sec.
           For each neutron energy - five measurements of signal
           and background were made.
DETECTOR   (CSICR)  Thin CsI(Tl) crystal, CsI light pipe and
            FEU-14B photomultiplier. Bismuth as structural
           material for detector; Bi layer between detector and
           target chamber.
           (SCIN) Stilbene crystal scintillation detector at
           150 deg to the deuteron beam was used to monitor the
           incident neutrons.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(N,P)5-B-12,,SIG)  Initial value of
            C-12(n,p)B-12 cross-section is taken 7 mb, obtained
           from:

CORRECTION Correction is introduced on anisotropic distribution
           of neutron from source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,2.,3.) Average of 5 measurements root mean
           square error is 2-3% ( for single measurement - 5-6%).
           The relative stat. error in the measurement of the B-12
           activity against the noise background was 3% ( 10 sec
           measurement time).
