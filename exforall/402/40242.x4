TITLE       Average number of instantaneous neutrons from
            spontaneous fission of Pu-242
COMMENT    Of compiler M.M. There is incorrect translation in
           the title in SJA,25,1369,1968: instantaneous -> prompt.

METHOD     (COINC)    Coincidence impulses between neutron
                      detector and ionization chamber of fission
                      are registered
SAMPLE     Chamber with layers of Pu-242 (0.4 mg) and
           Cm-244 (2.5 mu-g)
DETECTOR   (FISCH)    Fission chamber for registration
                      of fission fragments
           (PROPC) 12 He-3 proportional counters for registration
            of fission neutron. In cylindrical paraffin block.
           The neutron detector efficiency was ~ 12.5 % .
