           relativistic deuteron-on-lead reactions

INSTITUTE  (4ZZZDUB)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,4ZZZDUB) Nuclotron accelerator of the High
           Energy Laboratory of JINR
METHOD     (TRN) Beam attenuation technique was used.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs)
           and activation detectors (depleted U, natural Au
           samples and natural Cd foils) were used for the
           measurement of neutron and proton spatial distribution.
SAMPLE     A lead target, 50 cm in length and 8 cm in diameter,
           surrounded by a natural uranium blanket was used.
           Four sections of the target constituted the spallation
           source. Each section was covered by 30 U rods, which is
           the blanket. Each rod had a cylindrical form, 10.4 cm
           in length and 3.6 cm in diameter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
