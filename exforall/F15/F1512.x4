SAMPLE     Enriched 204PbS targets (0.5 mg/cm2 thick) on a
           1.5-mu-m Ti backing were used.

           (82-PB-206,ENR=0.0004)

DETECTOR   (SISD) GABRIELA detector array was used to detect the
           residues and their subsequent alpha decay or fission
           as well as gamma rays, X rays and conversion
           electrons. The evaporation residues pass through a
           time of flight detector and are then implanted into a
           10x10 cm2 500 mu-m thick double-sided silicon strip
           detector. Particles escaping from the DSSD are
           detected in eight 6x5 cm2 DSSDs with 16 strips on each
           side.
           (GE)The Ge array consists of a large clover detector
           installed just behind the DSSD and 4 coaxial detectors
           forming a cross around the DSSD.
METHOD     (OLMS) The separator for heavy elements spectroscopy
            (SHELS) was used to select the evaporation residues.
           (TOF,ASPEC)
ADD-RES    (DECAY) Two fission activities with half-lives of
           52.8(4.4) mu-sec and 9.9(1.2) ms were measured for
           253Rf. A third state, at much higher excitation
           energy, was also observed 0.66 (+0.40/-0.18) ms.
STATUS     (TABLE,,A.Lopez-Martens+,J,PR/C,105,L021306,2022) Data
           from text p. L021306-3.
           (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. A.Lopez-Martens.
