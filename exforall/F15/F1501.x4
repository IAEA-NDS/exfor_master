SAMPLE     Targets wheels accommodating 6 metallic Bi targets on
           a 3 mu-m Al backing were used. The average thickness of
           the Bi target segments on a given wheel varied from
           0.38 to 0.51 mg/cm2 + -0.02 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SISD) GABRIELA detector array was used to detect the
           residues and their subsequent alpha decay or fission
           as well as gamma rays, X rays and conversion
           electrons. The evaporation residues pass through a
           Time of Flight detector composed of 2 emissive foils
           and 4 large-size (70x90 mm2) micro channel plate
           detectors. The residues are then implanted into a
           10x10 cm2 300 mu-m thick Double-sided Silicon Strip
           Detector. Particles escaping from the DSSD are
           detected in eight 6x5 cm2 DSSDs with 16 strips on each
           side.
           (GE)The Ge array consists of a large clover detector
           installed just behind the DSSD and 4 coaxial detectors
           forming a cross around the DSSD.
METHOD     (OLMS) The Separator for Heavy Elements Spectroscopy
            (SHELS) was used for separation of fusion-evaporation
           reaction products.
           (TOF,ASPEC)
COMMENT    *By author* The data were taken in two experiments.
           The first experiment was performed in two campaigns.
           During the first campaign, cyclotron beam energies of
           255 and 265 MeV were used, while in second the
           primary beam energies were 255 and 275 MeV. For the
           second experiment, primary beam energies of 255, 265
           and 275 MeV were used.
           Cross sections were averaged over the first and second
           experiments. Mid-target energies are given.
