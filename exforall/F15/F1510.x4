FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-400M cyclotron (primary 11B beam)
INC-SOURCE Primary 11B beam intensity was ~ 1p mu-A.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (COINC) The 3He recoils were detected in coincidence
           with 3H.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD) Two identical dE -E -E telescopes were
           used to detect 3He nuclei. Each telescope consisted
           of three Si detectors: one 20-micron SSD (50x50 mm2,
           16 strips) and two 1000- micron SSDs (61x61 mm2, 16
           strips). The telescopes were located 166 mm
           downstream from the D2 target.
            Tritons emitted from 7H were detected by the 64x64 mm2
           telescope installed at zero laboratory angle 280 mm
           downstream from the target. It consisted of one
           1500-micron Si DSD (32x32 strips) and a set of 16
           square CsI(Tl)/PMT modules.
SAMPLE     Primary 11B beam was focused into a 5-mm spot on the
           1-mm thick beryllium production target. The secondary
           8He beam with energy 26 AMeV, ~90% purity, and
           intensity ~10**5 pps, was focused into a 17-mm spot
           on the deuterium gas target. The 4 mm thick gas cell
           was equipped with 6 mu-m stainless steel windows. The
           D2 target was cooled to 27 K, and its thickness made
           ~ 3.8x10**20 cm**(-2).
ADD-RES    (STRUC) For the first time, the 7H excited state is
           observed. Indications for the 7H ground states are
           found.
STATUS     No response from authors was received.
