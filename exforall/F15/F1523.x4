FACILITY   (SYNCH,4RUSITE)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) An ultralow background germanium spectrometer
           GeTHU was used. HPGe detector efficiency was 40%. The
           height of the germanium crystal was 59.8 mm and the
           diameter was 59.9 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Radiation time was 25 min.
           (GSPEC) Firstly, the sample was measured for 7 days
           directly on the surface of the detector cryostat at a
           height of 0 mm; then the sample was measured for 14
           days at a height of 40 mm above the top of the surface.
SAMPLE     Natural Pb (204Pb-1.4%, 206Pb-24.1%, 207Pb-22.1%, 208Pb
           -52.4%) was used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Cross section uncertainty includes the the
           uncertainty of the radionuclide's activity, the
           uncertainty of the production rate, the uncertainty
           of the half-life and the uncertainty of proton's flux
           density.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. Z.Zeng.
