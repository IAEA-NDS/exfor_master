FACILITY   (ISOCY,4RUSKUR) U-150 cyclotron
INC-SOURCE Beam current was 80.7+-1.3 nA.
SAMPLE     (56-BA-136,ENR=0.9545) Thin targets of barium
           carbonate enriched by the isotope 136Ba (136Ba-95.45%,
           138Ba-2.25%, 137Ba-1.56%, 135Ba-0.75%, 134Ba-0.04%)
           were prepared by the sedimentation method. 11
           mechanically stable and visually homogeneous
           [136Ba]BaCO3 targets with thicknesses of 2.4-5.8 mg/cm2
           were prepared. A cover layer of aluminum foil
            (8.4 mu-m) was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectrometer with an ORTEC GEM 35P4 high
           purity germanium with an energy resolution of 850 eV
           for the 122 keV line and 1.8 keV for the 1332 keV
           line was used.
METHOD     (STTA,EDEG) Aluminum degraders (~30, 117, and 44 mu-m)
           and copper monitors (~10 mu-m) were placed in a stack
           between the targets.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation time was 30 min. The first
           measurement was carried out 2-5 h after the end of
           bombardment; the second measurement was carried out on
           the next day. Two measurements were made for each
           target foil at calibrated distances of 6 cm and 11.5
           cm. The dead time of measurements did not exceed 10 %.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured excitation functions were compared
           with the data from TENDL-2023 library.
STATUS     (APRVD) Entry was approved by Dr. I.A.Khomenko.

COMMENT    *By authors* The main process leading to the formation
           of 133La is the reaction 135Ba(p,3n)133La. The
           insignificant contribution of the reaction 134Ba(p,2n)
           for the isotopic mixture of the target is ~0.3 mb at
           13 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total experimental uncertainty was
           calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares
           of the individual relative uncertainties and took into
           account:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in detector efficiency;
           (ERR-2,3.,40.) uncertainty of total absorption peak
           area depending on the counts statistics;
           (ERR-3) uncertainty of target thickness;
           (ERR-4) uncertainty of beam current value;
           (ERR-5) uncertainty of nuclear data.
