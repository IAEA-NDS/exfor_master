TITLE      Cross sections for the (n,p) reaction on Ti-46,48 and
           Ti-50.
FACILITY   Nothing said.
DETECTOR   Nothing said.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T(d,n) source.
            The sample of titanium was placed immediately behind
            a 600 mu-g/cm2 Zr-T target which was bombarded by
            300 keV deuterons
SAMPLE     A sample was of pure Ti02
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
ANALYSIS   The spectrum of gamma-rays from the irradiated sample
           was recorded at varying intervals over a period of
           several weeks.The relative yields of the 46Ti(n,p)46Sc,
           48Ti(n,p)48Sc and 50Ti(n,p)50Sc reactions were
           determined by analysis of gamma-ray photopeaks at 1.12,
           1.31 and 1.56 MeV due to the decay of 46Sc, 48Sc and
           50Sc, respectively

ERR-ANALYS1(DATA-ERR) The estimated standard deviation in the
            cross sections for the '6Ti and 50Ti target nuclei is
            approximately 30% assuming a standard deviation of 20%
            for the 48Ti measurement as M.Hillman(1962) estimates.
            It is expected that the 47Ti(n,n+p)46Sc reaction will
            contribute a small error to the measurement of the
            46Ti(n,p)46Sc cross section. This error has not been
            included in the above estimates.
