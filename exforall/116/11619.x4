TITLE      Differential Cross Sections of the 39,41K(n,n'gamma)
           Reaction

INSTITUTE  (1USAKTY)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USAKTY) The University of Kentucky 5.5-MeV
           accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Neutrons were produced via the T(p,n) 3He
           reaction in a 3-cm-long gas cell operated at 1.2 atm.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) The gamma-ray detector was a heavily
           shielded anti-Compton or Raboy-Trail spectrometer
           consisting of a central NaI(T1) crystal 6 cm in
           diameter and 16.5 cm long surrounded by an annular
           NaI(T1) crystal with a 21.5 cm outside diameter and
           30.5 cm long. Additional data were taken at a neutron
           energy of 3.42 MeV with a 6-cc Ge(Li) detector at 90
           degrees.
SAMPLE     The sample was a 5.8-cm-diam sphere of KOH and was
           located 8.7 cm from the gas cell along the beam axis.
MONITOR    (26-FE-56(N,INL)26-FE-56,PAR,DA,G)
CORRECTION - Corrections due to geometry: Corrections were
           made for three additional geometrical effects. For
           each of these the effect was calculated by an
           integration over the sample volume.
           - The effect of sample absorption of gamma rays and of
           incident neutrons was calculated by numerical
           integration of neutron and gamma-ray transmission
           throughout the sample volume.

           (20210920A) BP: Updated to new date formats, lower
           case. Corrections according last EXFOR rules and
           Dict. Updated entry, added doi, ERR-ANALYS, SAMPLE,

REL-REF    (M,11591001,D.B.Nichols+,J,PR,151,879,1966) The
           pulsed-beam techniques.
METHOD     Angular-distribution measurements extended from 40 to
           135 degrees with an angular resolution of +-19.6
           degrees. The neutron flux was monitored by a
           time-gated plastic scintillator located 90 cm from
           the source. Rejection of background not correlated in
           time with the beam pulses was accomplished by the
           pulsed-beam techniques described previously.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative errors within an angular
           distribution were evaluated by combining the
           statistical uncertainty of each photopeak area with a
           sample position uncertainty of 1 mm. Error bars on
           all angular distribution plots indicate these
           relative uncertainties which vary from 3 to 14%, and
           are typically 5%. Additional uncertainties in the
           gamma-ray production cross sections were
           (ERR-1) monitor instabilities, 2%;
           (ERR-2) absorption corrections, 4%;
           (ERR-3) 56Fe normalization cross section, 8%;
           (ERR-4,0.,3.) energy dependence of detector efficiency,
            0 to 3%;

REL-REF    (M,11591001,D.B.Nichols+,J,PR,151,879,1966) The
           pulsed-beam techniques.
METHOD     Angular-distribution measurements extended from 40 to
           135 degrees with an angular resolution of +-19.6
           degrees. The neutron flux was monitored by a
           time-gated plastic scintillator located 90 cm from
           the source. Rejection of background not correlated in
           time with the beam pulses was accomplished by the
           pulsed-beam techniques described previously.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative errors within an angular
           distribution were evaluated by combining the
           statistical uncertainty of each photopeak area with a
           sample position uncertainty of 1 mm. Error bars on
           all angular distribution plots indicate these
           relative uncertainties which vary from 3 to 14%, and
           are typically 5%. Additional uncertainties in the
           gamma-ray production cross sections were
           (ERR-1) monitor instabilities, 2%;
           (ERR-2) absorption corrections, 4%;
           (ERR-3) 56Fe normalization cross section, 8%;
           (ERR-4,0.,3.) energy dependence of detector efficiency,
            0 to 3%;
           (ERR-5,0.,6.) uncertainty of gamma-ray anisotropy,

REL-REF    (M,11591001,D.B.Nichols+,J,PR,151,879,1966) The
           pulsed-beam techniques.
METHOD     Angular-distribution measurements extended from 40 to
           135 degrees with an angular resolution of +-19.6
           degrees. The neutron flux was monitored by a
           time-gated plastic scintillator located 90 cm from
           the source. Rejection of background not correlated in
           time with the beam pulses was accomplished by the
           pulsed-beam techniques described previously.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative errors within an angular
           distribution were evaluated by combining the
           statistical uncertainty of each photopeak area with a
           sample position uncertainty of 1 mm. Error bars on
           all angular distribution plots indicate these
           relative uncertainties which vary from 3 to 14%, and
           are typically 5%. Additional uncertainties in the
           gamma-ray production cross sections were
           (ERR-1) monitor instabilities, 2%;
           (ERR-2) absorption corrections, 4%;
           (ERR-3) 56Fe normalization cross section, 8%;
           (ERR-4,0.,3.) energy dependence of detector efficiency,
            0 to 3%;
           (ERR-5,0.,6.) uncertainty of gamma-ray anisotropy,

REL-REF    (M,11591001,D.B.Nichols+,J,PR,151,879,1966) The
           pulsed-beam techniques.
METHOD     Angular-distribution measurements extended from 40 to
           135 degrees with an angular resolution of +-19.6
           degrees. The neutron flux was monitored by a
           time-gated plastic scintillator located 90 cm from
           the source. Rejection of background not correlated in
           time with the beam pulses was accomplished by the
           pulsed-beam techniques described previously.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative errors within an angular
           distribution were evaluated by combining the
           statistical uncertainty of each photopeak area with a
           sample position uncertainty of 1 mm. Error bars on
           all angular distribution plots indicate these
           relative uncertainties which vary from 3 to 14%, and
           are typically 5%. Additional uncertainties in the
           gamma-ray production cross sections were
           (ERR-1) monitor instabilities, 2%;
           (ERR-2) absorption corrections, 4%;
           (ERR-3) 56Fe normalization cross section, 8%;
           (ERR-4,0.,3.) energy dependence of detector efficiency,
