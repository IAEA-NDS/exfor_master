METHOD     The measurements were performed inside a 0.102 cm
           thick cadmium tube, having an effective cutoff energy
           of 0.56 eV, located in the center of ATSR (reactor).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data from measurements on teflon and
           carbon were used to estimate errors introduced by
           moderation effects of the samples.

CORRECTION In the case of molybdenum the correction for slowing
           down was of the order of 1%.
