SAMPLE     A self-supporting thorium target of thickness 2.0
           mg/cm**2 was bombarded with a 6-Li beam.
DETECTOR   (SOLST,SISD) a solid state delta E - E telescope of
           thickness 150.0 micro millimeter to 1.0 millimeter was
           kept at 90 degree with respect to the beam direction
           around the transfer grazing angle to identify the
           projectile-like-fragments (PLF). A 16 strip solid
           state detector (each strip of size 2.0 X 64.0 mm) was
           placed at a back angle covering the laboratory angular
           range of 141-158 degree to detect fission fragments in
           coincidence with PLFs.
METHOD     (EDE) The proton, deuteron, triton, alpha and 6-Li
           particles are uniquely identified by plotting delta
           E against the delta E + E. This plot was transformed
           to create an effective particle identification versus
           energy plot.
INC-SOURCE A self-supporting thorium was bombarded with 6-Li
           beam of energy 38.0 MeV from a 14 MV Pelletron
           accelerator at Mumbai.
ANALYSIS   (SURGT) The 234-Pa and 236-U compound systems have
           been populated at overlapping excitation energies in
           the same experiment through 232-Th (6-Li,A) 234-Pa and
           232-Th (6-Li,D) 236-U transfer channels at E (lab) = 38
           MeV, and the absolute surrogate method is used to
           determine fission decay probabilities of the above
           compound nuclei by dividing the number of PLF-fission
           coincidences by the associated PLF-singles data. The
           experimental values of fission decay probability
           ratios of 234-Pa and 236-U compound nuclei at the same
           excitation energies have been used to deduce the 233-Pa
            (n,f) cross-section using a surrogate ratio approach.
COMMENT    A new hybrid surrogate ratio approach has been
           employed to determine neutron-induced fission cross
           sections of 233-Pa in the energy range of 11.5 to
           16.5 MeV for the first time. The 233-Pa
           (n,f) cross sections are deduced from the measured
           fission decay probabilities ratios of 234-Pa and
           236-U compound nuclei using the surrogate ratio
           method. The 233-Pa (n,f) cross section data from the
           present experiment along with the data from the
           literature, covering the neutron energy range of 1.0
           to 16.5 MeV have been compared with the predictions
           of statistical model code EMPIRE-2.19. While the
           present data are consistent with the model
           predictions, there is a discrepancy between the
           earlier experiment data and EMPIRE-2.19 predictions
           in the neutron energy range of 7.0 to 10.0 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties shown in the measured cross
           section is due to the statistics of coincidence
           counts in each energy beam.

COMMENT    The excitation energy was scaled down to the
           equivalent neutron energy range of 11.5-16.5 MeV by
           subtracting the neutron separation energy of 234-Pa
            (Sn = 5.22 MeV)
