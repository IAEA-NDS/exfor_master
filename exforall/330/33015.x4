SAMPLE     Samples were prepared by mixing powders of zirconium
           and iron.Three sets of samples, each set containing
           five samples were made. Each sample was made by
           packing 0.5 gm enriched zirconium-90 (70%) powder
           with 0.3 gm natural iron powder(99.99%) in a
           polythene vial, and such five samples were made. The
           isotope Fe-56 in natural iron was used as monitor
           element

           175 KeV deuterons, neutron flux was 5.10**7 n/sec/cm2
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors includes:
            * errors of sample weight (MAX. 0.003%),
            * Errors due to uncertainties in neutron flux
              measurement (MAX.1.5%),
            * Other systematical and Statistical errors
