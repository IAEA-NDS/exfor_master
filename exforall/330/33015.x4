SAMPLE     Samples were prepared by mixing powders of zirconium
           and iron.Three sets of samples, each set containing
           five samples were made. Each samplewas made by
           packing 0.5 gm enriched zirconium-90 (70%) powder
           with 0.3 gm natural iron powder(99.99%) in a
           polythene vial, and such five samples were made. The
           isotope Fe-56 in natural iron was used as monitor
           element

           175 KeV deuterons, neutron flux was 5.10**7 n/sec/cm2
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Errors includes:
            * errors of sample weight (MAX. 0.003%),
            * Errors due to uncertainties in neutron flux
              measurement (MAX.1.5%),
            * Other systematical and Statistical errors
