TITLE      Prompt gamma-ray emission in the spontaneous ternary
           fission of 252Cf
AUTHOR     (N.N.Ajitanand)
INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,133,625,1969)
SAMPLE     The source of 252Cf deposited over an area of 0.2 cm
           diameter on a 61.4 mg/cm2 thick platinum backing. The
           source foil was mounted between two steel rings. The
           source side was covered by a thin 20 mu-g/cm2 thick
           VYNS plastic film to prevent escape of californium
           atoms from the platinum foil. The distance between
           the source and the surface of the solid-state
           detector was l.1 cm. The distance from source to NaI
           crystal face was 6.5 cm.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 5 cm x 5 cm NaI(Tl) crystal was used to
           detect the gamma rays.
           (SIBAR) A silicon surface-barrier semiconductor
           detector was reverse-biased to a voltage of 90 V to
           give a depletion depth of about 310 mu-m for
           detection of the fission fragments in the binary
           experiment, while in the separate ternary experiment,
           it was covered with a 10 mg/cm2 thick aluminium foil
           so that only those long-range alpha particles which
           had an energy greater than 6.8 MeV could be detected.
METHOD     (COINC) Measured prompt gammas and fission fragments
           in coincidence
CORRECTION Subtraction of chance coincidences as well as
           correction for contributions from fission neutrons
           were done. These were calculated to be 8% for the
           binary case and 4% for the ternary case.
COMMENT    Digitization is done on Fig.2 in which the X-axis is
           given in channel number. Authors also provided the
           corresponding gamma energies for each tick. However,
           the plot of channel number versus gamma energy is not
           linear which may introduce some error.

COMMENT    Due to poor quality of the figure, the digitized
           value of six data points above gamma energy of
           1463.56 keV may not be good.
