FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM) The first experiment with the neutron
           energies of 1.12, 2.12 MeV was performed using the
           folded tandem ion beam accelerator
           (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14UD BARC-TIFR Pelletron facility at
           TIFR,with neutron energies of 3.12,4.12MeV
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) LiF target bombarded by proton energies of
           3,4,5 and 6 MeV.
SAMPLE     Au(59 to 59.4 mg) and In(58.1-64.3 mg) metal foils
           wrapped with 0.025 mm thick aluminium foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detector pre-calibrated
           80 cm3 HPGe detector couple to a PC based 4094
           channel analyser. The resolution of the detector
           system during counting was 2.0 keV at 1332 keV of 60Co.

           (ERR-S,3.1,5.5) Counting statistics (3.1-5.5%)
           (ERR-SYS) total systematic error (3.6%) is due to:
           (ERR-1) due to irriadiation time(~0.1%)
           (ERR-2) due to half life of the reaction products and
           gamma ray abundances(~2%)
           (ERR-3) Due to detector efficiency(~3%)
