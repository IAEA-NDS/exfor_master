DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-rays of reaction products from the
           irradiated Ni,In and Au samples were counted in an
           energy and efficiency calibrated 80 c.c. HPGe
           detector coupled to a PC-based 4K channel analyzer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty represents contribution
           from both statistical and systematic errors (~11-16%)
           (ERR-S,10.,15.) Statistical uncertainty (~10-15%)
           (ERR-SYS) Overall systematic uncertainty contains:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in irradiation time
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in detection efficiency calibration
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in half-life of the fission
           products and the gamma-ray abundances

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The neutron beam was obtained from the
           7-Li(p,n)reaction by using the proton beam. The lithium
           foil was made of natural lithium of thickness 3.7
           mg/cm2 and wrapped with tantalum foil.
           Neutron flux was 1.1 x 10**7 n/cm2/s
SAMPLE     (28-NI-58,NAT=0.6807) A known amount (0.1448 g)
           of natural nickel with 58Ni (68.077%) and 0.1556 g of
           natural indium metal foil were wrapped separately
           with 0.025 mm thick Al foil. The size of the Ni-In
           stacked was 4 mm x 4 mm. Then a stacked was made from
           these two targets, which were additionally wrapped with
           Al foil of 0.025 mm thick.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 6 hrs and cooled for 2 hrs
