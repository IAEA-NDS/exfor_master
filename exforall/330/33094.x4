TITLE      Measurement and covariance analysis of reaction cross
            sections for 58Ni(n,p)58Co relative to cross section
            for Formation of 97Zr fission product in
            neutron-induced fission of 232Th and 238U at
            effective neutron energies En=5.89, 10.11, and
            15.87 MeV

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium with thickness of 3.2 mg/cm2
           was sandwiched between two tantalum foils of
           different thicknesses. The front tantalum foil facing
           the proton beam was 3.9 mg/cm2 and the back tantalum
           foil was 0.025 mm thick. Uncertainty assigned to
           neutron energy is obtained based on full- width at
           half-maximum (FWHM) taken from the spectrum
           corresponding to the primary group of neutrons.
SAMPLE     Natural thorium and uranium metal foil (as flux
           monitors) and natural nickel foil were used for the
           neutron irradiation. The sizes of the U, Th, and Ni
           square-shaped metal foils were 1.0 cm2. The U-Th-Ni
           stack was mounted at 0 deg w.r.t the beam direction
           at a distance of 2.1 cm from the location of the Ta-
           Li-Ta stack.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity germanium detector coupled with a
           personal computer based 4 K multichannel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The proton current during the irradiations
           varied from 100 to 250 nA.

ANALYSIS   The two monitors (cross section for the fission
           yield of 97Zr in 232Th and cross section for the
           fission yield of 97Zr in 238U), were used to obtain
           two ratios at each of the three effective neutron
           energies along with covariance information, which was
           further used to obtain the evaluated values of the
           58Ni(n,p)58Co reaction cross section at three
           effective neutron energies 5.89, 10.11, and 15.87 MeV
           with covariance information.

COVARIANCE Covariance information of efficiency calibration of
           the HPGe detector, ratio measurement, and
           normalization are obtained. Covariance information
           obtained is used to obtain covariance information of
           ratio measurement, which is further used in
           normalization to obtain covariance information for
           the 58Ni(n,p)58Co reaction cross section at three
           effective neutron energies 5.89, 10.11, and 15.87 MeV.
