           surrogate method

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14 UD Pelletron Accelerator
SAMPLE     A self-supporting 232Th target of thickness 1.3 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier
           detector telescopes, referred to as dE(150 mu-m and
           100 mu-m) detectors and identical E(thickness 1.0 mm)
           detectors, were mounted in a reaction plane at angles
           of 85 and 105 degrees, respectively, to identify
           projectile-like fragments.
           (SOLST) A large-area (450 mm2) solid state detector
           was kept at an angle of 160 deg. with respect to the
           beam direction and subtended a solid angle of 63 msr
           with an angular opening of 16 deg. to detect fission
           fragments in coincidence with PLFs.

ANALYSIS   (SURGT)Cross section for 234Pa(n,f) determined by
           Hybrid surrogate ratio method. 232Th(7Li,af)235Pa
           reaction for cross section determination of
           234Pa(n,f) and 232Th(7Li,tf)236U reaction for
           235U(n,f) considering the well-measured 235U(n,f) as
           reference.
