INC-SOURCE (REAC)The neutron flux was estimated from the peak
            area of the 411.8 keV of the flux monitor 198-Au.
SAMPLE     About 6 g of thorium nitrate salt was wrapped with
            0.025 mm thick aluminum foil and doubly sealed with
            alkathene.5.2 ng of separated 233-Pa in the form of
            nitrate was dried on a 0.025 mm thick aluminum foil.
           Dried 233-Pa(NO3)3 was covered with a 0.0075 mm thick
            Lexan foil of size 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm.233-Pa was
            prepared from activation of 232-Th followed by beta
            decay.
           Di-isobutyl carbinol (DIBC), procured from Aldrich,
            USA, was used as an extractant for the radiochemical
            separation of 233-Pa and quantitative stripping was
            achieved by 0.1 N HCl.
           The amount of 233-Pa was estimated using gamma-ray
            (311.9 keV) spectrometric technique and decay
            equation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE,TRD) The Purity and amount of the 233-Pa was
            ascertained by a gamma-ray spectrometric technique
            using an energy and efficiency calibrated 80 cm3 HPGe
            detector coupled to a PC-based 4K channel
            analyzer.
           The gamma-ray counting of the irradiated gold target
            (flux monitor) was also done for the 411.8 keV gamma-
            line of 198-Au using same 80 cm3 HPGe detector
            coupled to the PC-based 4K-channel analyzer.
           The counting of fission tracks in lexan foil within a
            few fields i.e. fraction of the total area was done
            by visual inspection under the microscope.
METHOD     (ACTIV,RCHEM,GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   The fission track in the lexan was counted manually
            using optical microscope.
           The 233-Pa(2nth,f)fission cross-section was calculated
            from the fission track using tack density equation.
