DETECTOR   (HPGE) An 80 cm**3 HPGe detector coupled to a PC-
           based 4K channel analyser. The energy resolution was
           1.8 keV at 1.33 MeV gamma-ray energy of 60Co. The
           photo-peak efficiency of the HPGe detector was
           determined using standard gamma-ray sources such as
           152Eu and 133Ba.
ANALYSIS   The gamma peak areas were obtained by using PHAST
           and GENIE-2K peak fitting programs.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainties in the cross-section
           includes statistical and systematic error described
           below:
           (ERR-S) Counting statistics (~4%)
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in decay data (~2%)
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in efficiency and energy
           calibration of the detector (~3%)
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in monitor cross-section (~2%)
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in self-absorption of
           gamma-rays(~2%)
           (ERR-5) Uncertainty in neutron flux estimation (~4%)
ADD-RES    Theoretical calculations using TALYS-1.4 and
           EMPIRE-2.19 have been performed.

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14 UD BARC-TIFR Pelletron facility at
           Mumbai,India.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The neutron beam was produced from the 7Li(p,n)
           reaction by using the proton beam. The thickness of
           lithium and tantalum foils were 3.7 mg/cm**2 and
           3.9 mg/cm**2 respectively. The In-Fe-U stack was
           mounted at zero degree angle with respect to the proton
           beam direction at a distance ~ 1.8-2 cm from the
           location of the Ta-Li-Ta stack. The incident proton
           beam of energies were 7.8,12 and 18 MeV respectively.
           The neutron flux were 3.03*10**6 n/cm2/s,
           1.3*10**7 n/cm2/s and 1.53*10**7 n/cm2/s corresponding
           to the average neutron energies of 5.9+-0.6, 9.85+-0.38
           and 15.5+-0.7 MeV.
SAMPLE     (26-FE-56,NAT=0.91754) The Iron sample (with purity
           ~99.99%) in the form of thin metallic foil was used. A
           known amount (60-170 mg) of the iron metal foil was
           wrapped with 0.025 mm thick aluminum foil. Similarly, a
           known amount of indium (141-156 mg) and uranium
           (570-990 mg) foil of the same size also wrapped
           separately with 0.025 mm thick aluminum foil. The iron
           foil was sandwiched between the In and U metal foil
           and additionally wrapped with aluminum foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The samples were irradiated for 15,4 and
           5 hrs corresponding to the average neutron energies of
           5.9+-0.6, 9.85+-0.38 and 15.5+-0.7 MeV. The samples
           were cooled for 3-5 hrs after the irradiation.
