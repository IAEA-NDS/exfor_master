FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) A collimated neutron beam from a beam
           hole of the CIRUS reactor.
SAMPLE     A source of 235U of thickness 250 microgram/cm2 coated
           on an area of 0.5 cm2 of a thin VYNS film by the
           electrospraying technique.
DETECTOR   (SI) The kinetic energies of the pairs of fragments
           were measured by two diffused junction silicon
           detectors placed on either side of the source foil at
           distances of 2.2 and 1.6 cm, all mounted inside an
           evacuated chamber.
           (NAICR) The x-ray energies were measured with a 1 mm
           NaI(Tl) crystal of 9 cm2 area covered with a 0.008
           inches beryllium window and mounted on a 6292
           photomultiplier tube.
METHOD     (COINC) Fission fragment and X-ray detected in
           coincidence.
CORRECTION The measurements were carried out with and without a
           copper filter of thickness 440 mg/cm2 to correct for
           the background triple coincidences.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,3.) Maximum uncertainty in the calculated
           solid angle of about 3%.
           (ERR-T) No detail information on sources of
           uncertainties.
ADD-RES    Fragment mass dependence of K X-ray multiplicity per
           fragment.
