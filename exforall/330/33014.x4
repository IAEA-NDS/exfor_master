SAMPLE     229-Th used in this work was obtained by milking of
           sample of 233-U. The stock was sufficiently old so
           that 228-Th (half life~1.9 year)practically
           decayed. The target 229-Th(~10 micro gram)was made by
           electro deposition from an aqueous 0.001 M  nitric acid
           solution on a 6.75 mg/cm*2 super pure aluminium foil.
           Amount  of 229-Th in each target was determined from
           the electro deposition efficiency.
DETECTOR   (TRD,HPGE) In order to determine the absolute
           yields of the fission  products, a lexan track
           detector was taken in dilute solution of known
           concentration of 229-Th in a sealed polypropylene tube.
           HPGe detector connected to a PC based 4K MCA was used
           for gamma ray counting of fission products.
METHOD     (ABSFY,GSPEC)
           Cumulative yields of 27 fission products have been
           determined in  229-Th(n,f) by using  recoil cather
           technique follwed by gama ray spectrometry.
           Absolute fission tields were arrived at from the
           fission rate  measured by track etch counting method.
ANALYSIS   The activities of different radionuclides at
           the end of  irradiation were calculated from the peak
           areas of their  characteristics gamma rays after
           correcting for the detection efficiency, gamma ray
           abundance and cooling times.
           The cumulative yield of the fission products were
           calculated from the gamma ray activity at the end of
           irradiation using the standard activation  equation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)Errors given on the yields are due to counting
           statistics only.
