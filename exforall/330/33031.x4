TITLE      Charge Distribution for Light Mass Fission Products

            241Pu, 245Cm and 252Cf(SF).

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Research reactor CIRUS using pneumatic
            facility for irradiation for short lived products.
           Research (Swimming Pool Type) reactor APSARA for long
            lived fission products.
SAMPLE     For shortlived fission products nitrate solution of
            229Th (10 ug), 241Pu (2 ug), 245Cm (1 ug) sealed in
            polypropelebne tubes were irradiated for 5 seconds to
            30 minutes using pneumatic carrier facility of CIRUS
            reactor at a flux  of 5x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
           For long lived fission products, electrodeposited
            target of 229Th (100 ug), 241Pu (25 ug), and 245Cm
            (4 ug) were irradiated in the APSARA   reactor for
            5-60 minutes at a flux of 1.2x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
           In case of 252Cf(SF) recoil fission products were
            collected on Al foil from an electrodeposited source
            -(3 ug)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 80 c.c. HPge detector connected to a PC based
            4K channel analyzer.
           Resolution of the detector system was 2.0 keV at 1332
            keV of 60Co.
METHOD     (REC,GSPEC) Collection of fission products using
            recoil catcher technique, off line gamma ray
            spectrometric analysis of fission products in the
            irradiated sample.
ANALYSIS   Photo-peak areas were obtained from the gamma rays of
            light fission products;
            a) 229Th(n,f): 86Br, 90Kr, 91,92,93,94Sr 95Y, 97Zr
            b) 241Pu(n,f): 91,92,94Sr, 97Zr, 105Tc
            c) 245Cm(n,f): 90Kr,91,92,94Sr,97Zr, 108,109Ru, 112Pd
            d) 252Cf(sf): 106Tc
           Their cumulative yields - (CY) were determined using
            decay equation.
           From the cumulative yields, FCY were determined using
            mass chain yield from literature.
           FCY of some fission products like 91,92Sr,97Zr were
            determined using decay growth equation.
           From the FCY values, the most probable charge, width
            parameter sigma-Z and charge polarization delta-Z
            were deduced.
RESULT     (FRCUM)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in th FCY of the light mass
            fission products is precissional error due to
            replicate measurement.
