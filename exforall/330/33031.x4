TITLE      Charge Distribution for Light Mass Fission Products

           241Pu, 245Cm and 252Cf(SF).

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM)Research reactor CIRUS using pneumatic
           facility for irradiation for short lived products.
           Research (Swimming Pool Type) reactor APSARA for long
           lived  fission products
SAMPLE     For shortlived fission products nitrate solution of
           229Th  (10 micro g), 241Pu (2 micro g),
           245Cm ( 1 micro g) sealed in polypropelebne tubes
           were irradiated for 5seconds to 30 minutes using
           pneumatic carrier facility of CIRUS reactor at a flux
           of 5x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
           For long lived fission products, electrodeposited
           target of 229Th  (100 micro g), 241Pu  (25 micro g),
           and 245-Cm (4 micro g) were irradiated in the APSARA
           reactor for  5-60 minutes at a flux of
           1.2x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
           In case of 252Cf(SF) recoil fission  products were
           collected on Al foil from an electrodeposited source
            -(3 micro g)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 80 c.c. HPGe detector connected to a PC based
           4K channel  analyser. Resolution of the detector
           system was 2.0 keV at 1332 keV of  60Co.
METHOD     (REC,GSPEC)Collection of fission products using
           recoil catcher technique, off line gamma ray
           spectrometric analysis of fission products in the
           irradiated sample.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)Photo-peak areas were obtained from the gamma
           rays of light fission products;
             a) 86Br, 90Kr, 91,92,93,94Sr 95Y, 97Zr (from
           229Th(n,f))).
             b) 91,92,94Sr, 97Zr, 105Tc (from 241Pu(n,f)).
             c) 90Kr,91,92,94Sr,97Zr, 108,109Ru, 112Pd (from
            245Cm(n,f)).
             d) 106Tc (from 252Cf(SF)).   Their cumulative yields
           -(CY) were determined using decay equation. From the
           cumulative yields, FCY were determined using mass
           chain yield from literature. FCY of some fission
           products like 91,92Sr,97Zr were
           determined using decay growth equation.  From the
           FCY values, the most probable charge,  width
           parameter sigma-z and charge polarization delta-z
           were deduced.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in the FCY of the light mass
           fission  products is precissional error due to
           replicate measurement.
