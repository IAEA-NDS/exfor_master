FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Cirus reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of ~5.0E12 n/cm2-sec
SAMPLE     Targets of 229-Th and 235-U were prepared on platinum
           backing by electro deposition using isopropyl alcohol
METHOD     (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the
           thin target-recoil-catcher technique.
           (RCHEM) For low yield products radiochemical
           separation followed by Beta / Gamma ray counting
           (GSPEC)High yield fission products were measured by
           gamma ray spectrometry
           (EXTB)Thermal neutron from Cirus reactor were used
           (RELFY) The fision product yields were measured
           relative to the thermal neutron induced fission of
           235-U. Assuming that charge distribution pattern is
           similar in 229-Th and 235-U fission, the chain yields
           of 235-U were used to calculate the respective
           chain yields in 229-Th.
           91-Sr was taken as an internal standard for both
           229-Th and 235-U fission, so as to eliminate any
           error due to change in flux from one irradiation to
           another.
           The final mass yield values were obtained by
           normalising the area under the mass distribution
           curve to 200%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For high yield products.
           (PROPC) End window gas flow proportional counter, for
           low yield products.
MONITOR    235-U targets (0.1 micrograms) were irradiated
           together with the 229-Th targets (30 micrograms).
           Activities of the 235-U fission products were measured
           in the same way as those of 229-Th.
           The 235-U  fission product mass chain yields were
           taken from the compilation of Meek and Rider.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The deacy of each product was followed for
           suitable length of time to determine the activity at
           the end of irradiation
CORRECTION Chemical yield corrections were incorporated
           where ever chemistry was carried out.
           The decay for a suitable number of gamma rays of
           the nucildes were followed for suitable length of time
           to determine the activity at the end of irradiation.
           The correction for the decay during the irradiation
           were getting cancelled as the samples were irradiated
           simultaneously both for 229-Th and 235-U.
           The errors due detector efficiency, self absorption
           and scattering were getting cancelled as the samples
           were counted in similar geometry.
           It was assumed that the genetic relations are same
           both in case of 229-Th and 235-U fission products and
           under the conditions of the experiment.
           The correction due to fast fission of 229-Th and 235-U
           were negligible.
           No corrections were applied for neutron capture.
STATUS     Data is taken from table 1 of this paper
           Ref. Journal RCA,31,69,1982.
           The 235-U fission product yields were taken from the
           compilation of Meek and Rider. These values were used
           to determine the mass chain yield of fission products
           in 229-Th. The 91-Sr yield is used as monitor for
           yield of any other fission products of Th-229. The
           fission yield data of 229-Th are coded as the chain
           yield  in percent per fission.
