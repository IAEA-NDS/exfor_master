FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS Reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron induced flux of 5.0**12 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     Targets of 229Th and 235u were prepared on platinum
           backing by electro-deposition from isopropyl alcohol
METHOD     - The relative 'R-value' method was applied, starting
           from the respective 235U fission yields with 91SR
           as internal standard.
           (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the
           'thin target-recoil-catcher technique'.
           (CHSEP) For low yield products radiochemical methods
           were used.
           High yield products were measured by gamma-spectrometry
DETECTOR   (GELI). For high yield products.
           (PROPC) End window gas flow proportional counter,for
           low yield products.
MONITOR    235U targets (2 micrograms) were irradiated together
           with the 229TH targets. activities of the 235U fission
           products were measured in the same way as those of
           229TH.
           The 235U fission product yields were taken from the
           compilation of meek+rider.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay equation of fission products
CORRECTION 1) For aliquot and chemical yield
           2) For decay after irradiation
           3) Counting: for self-absorption and scattering;
           corrections for decay during irradiation cancelled out
              in the R-value because of simultaneous irradiation
              of samples. The authors assumed that the genetic
              relationships are the same in Th-229 and U-235
              thermal neutron fission under the conditions of the
              experiment and for the fission products considered.
              They discussed the complicated decay schemes and
              existing isomers for the isotopes of Ag, Cd, In and
              Sn, which they could not correct for, and concluded
              that the corresponding errors in R-values should
              have been small.
           Corrections for Th-229 and U-235 fast fission were
           negligible.
           No corrections were applied for neutron capture.
