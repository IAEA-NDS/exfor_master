INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
REFERENCE  (J,RCA,31,69,1982)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Cirus reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of ~5.0E12 n/sec/cm**2
SAMPLE     Targets of 229Th and 235U were prepared on platinum
            backing by electro deposition using isopropyl alcohol
METHOD     (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the
             thin target-recoil-catcher technique.
           (RCHEM) Low yield products were measured by
             radiochemical separation followed by beta/gamma ray
             counting
           (GSPEC) High yield fission products were measured by
             gamma ray spectrometry.
           (EXTB) Thermal neutron from CIRUS reactor were used.
           (RELFY) The fission product yields were measured
             relative to the thermal neutron induced fission of
             235U.
DETECTOR   (GELI) For high yield products.
           (PROPC) End window gas flow proportional counter, for
             low yield products.
MONITOR    235U targets (0.1 ug) were irradiated together with
            the 229Th targets (30 ug).
           Activities of the 235U fission products were measured
            in the same way as those of 229Th.
           The 235U  fission product mass chain yields were taken
            from the compilation of Meek and Rider.
           The 91Sr yield is used as monitor for yield of any
            other fission products of 229Th.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay of each product was followed for
             suitable length of time to determine the activity at
             the end of irradiation
            Assuming that charge distribution pattern is similar
             in 229Th and 235U fission, the chain yields of 235U
             were used to calculate the respective chain yields
             in 229Th.
            91Sr was taken as an internal standard for both 229Th
             and 235U fission, so as to eliminate any error due
             to change in flux from one irradiation to another.
            The final mass yield values were obtained by
             normalising the area under the mass distribution
             curve to 200%.
CORRECTION Chemical yield corrections were incorporated wherever
            chemistry was carried out.
           The decay for a suitable number of gamma rays of
            the nuclides were followed for suitable length of
            time to determine the activity at the end of
            irradiation.
           The correction for the decay during the irradiation
            were getting cancelled as the samples were irradiated
            simultaneously both for 229Th and 235U.
           The errors due detector efficiency, self absorption
            and scattering were getting cancelled as the samples
            were counted in similar geometry.
           It was assumed that the genetic relations are same
            both in case of 229Th and 235U fission products and
            under the conditions of the experiment.
           The correction due to fast fission of 229Th and 235U
            were negligible.
           No corrections were applied for neutron capture.
