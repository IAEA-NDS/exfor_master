FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Research Reactors CIRUS and APSARA
SAMPLE     CIRUS: 235U and 239Pu targets (~2 ug) in the form of
            nitrate solutions for 30s to 20min at a flux of
            5.0E+12 n/cm2/sec.
           APSARA: Electrodeposited targets of 245Cm (~2 ug)
            covered with 25 um thick super pure Al catcher foil
            were irradiated for about 30 min at a flux
            2.0E+12 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (REC) In the case of 252Cf spontaneous fission,
            fission products were collected using recoil catcher
            technique from an electrodeposited source.
           (CHSEP) Iodine was separated radio chemically within
            5 to 45 min after the end of the irradiation/collectio
            from the irradiated solutions or from the catcher foil
            after dissolution as the case may be.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 45 cc HPGe detector (resolution of 2.0 keV at
            1332.0 keV, the dead time was always less than 10%.)
ANALYSIS   The independent yields of the 132I isomers were
            obtained from the separation time activities after
            correcting for the precursor contributions during the
            irradiation through the chemical separation time
            considering the cumulative yields of the precursor
            and rate of fission and chemical yield etc.
           (DECAY) The observed activities as a function of time
            were analyzed using standard decay-growth equation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors due to
            - counting statistics,
            - absolute abundance of the gamma lines,
            - detector efficiencies,
            - fission yields of the precursor,
            - the least square analysis.
