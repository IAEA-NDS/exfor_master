FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Research Reactors CIRUS and APSARA in
           B.A.R.C, Trombay, Mumbai
SAMPLE     In the case of neutron induced fission studies in
           reactor Cirus, 235U and 239Pu targets (~2 micro
           gram) were irradiated pneumatically in the
           form of nitrate solutions for 30s to 20min at a flux
           of 5.0x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
           While in the reactor Apsara, electrodeposited targets
           of 245Cm (~2 micro gram) covered with 25 micro meter
           thick super pure aluminum catcher foil were irradiated
           for about 30 min at a flux 2.0x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC)In the case of 252Cf spontaneous
           fission, fission products were collected using
           recoil catcher technique from an electrodeposited
           source. Iodine was separated radio chemically within
           5 to 45 min after the end of the irradiation/collection
           from the irradiated solutions or from the catcher foils
           after dissolution as the case may be. Standard aliquots
           of the iodine solutions were analyzed gamma ray
           spectrometrically.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Standard aliquots of the iodine solutions were
           counted as a function of time at a fixed geometry
           on an efficiency calibrated 45 c.c. HPGe detector
           connected to a 4 K channel analyzer in live-time mode.
           The resolution of the detector system was 2.0 keV at
           1332.0 keV and the dead time was always less than 10%.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)The area under the photo peaks were calculated
           after subtraction of the linear Compton background.
           Absence of the precursor 132Te was monitored in each
           aliquot using its 228.2KeV gamma line. The observed
           activities as a function of time were analyzed using
           standard decay-growth equation. The independent yields
           of the 132I isomers were obtained from the separation
           time activities after correcting for the precursor
           contributions during the irradiation through the
           chemical separation time considering the cumulative
           yields of the precursor and rate of fission and
           chemical yield etc.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)The quoted uncertainty on the independent
           isomeric yield ratios include  the errors due to
           counting statistics, absolute abundance of the gamma
           lines, detector efficiencies, fission yields of the
           precursor and the  least square analysis.
DECAY-DATA The gamma lines and the nuclear spectroscopic data
           of different nuclides were taken from:
