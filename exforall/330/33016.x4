TITLE      Single-particle spin effect on fission fragment
            angular momentum

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) APSARA and CIRUS Research Reactor
SAMPLE     For long-lived fission products electrodeposited
            targets of 243-Am (~ 90 ug) were covered with 25 um
            thick aluminum foil or 75 um thick Lexan foil, which
            act as a catcher to collect the recoiling fission
            products during the neutron irradiation of the
            targets.
           They were then wrapped with 1 mm thick cadmium foil,
            doubly sealed in alkathene bags and irradiated for
            about 5 to 60 min at a of flux 1.2 0E10*12 n/cm2-sec.
           For short-lived fission products, the nitrate solution
            of 243Am (~ 50 ug) were sealed in a polypropylene
            tube and wrapped with 1 mm thick cadmium foil.
           They were additionally sealed in alkathene bags and
            irradiated using pneumatically carrier facility for
            3 to 5 min at a flux of 5.0 0E10*12 n/cm2-sec.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC,FPGAM) Fission products were
            collected using recoil catcher technique.
           The aluminium catcher foils in APSARA irradiation was
            used for radiochemical separation of tellurium and
            iodine.
           The irradiated solution in the CIRUS irradiation was
            used for radiochemical separation of cesium.
           The irradiated solutions, lexan catcher foils
            separated aliquots of tellurium, iodine and cesium
            were taken for gamma ray counting.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The fission products were analyzed by gamma ray
            spectrometry at a fixed geometry of an energy- and
            efficiency- calibrated 120 or 80-cm3 high-purity
            germanium detector coupled to a PC-based 4K channel
            analyzer.
           The resolution of the detector system was 2.0 keV at
            1332.0 keV and the dead time was always less than 10%.
ANALYSIS   The photo-peak areas of the gamma rays for the radio
            nuclides were calculated from their total peak areas
            by subtracting the Compton background.
           From the photo-peak areas, independent isomeric yields
            and thus their ratios were calculated using standard
            decay growth equation after correcting for precursor
            contribution.
           The activities of 92-Sr and 104-Tc were used as
            fission rate monitors in the long and short
            irradiated un-separated samples respectively.
           In the separated samples of tellurium, iodine and
            cesium samples 134-Te, 135-I and 139-Cs were  used as
            fission rate monitors respectively.
           Independent isomeric yield ratio(IYR)of 128-Sb, 130-Sb,
            132-Sb, 131-Te, 133-Te, 132-I, 134-I, 136-I, 135-Xe
            and 138-Cs were determined in 243-Am(n,f) using
            radiochemical and off line gamma ray spectrometric
            techniques.
           From the IYR fragment angular momenta (Jrms) were
            deduced using spin dependent statistical model
            analysis.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty on the IYR includes the
            error due to:
             - counting statistics,
             - absolute abundance of the gamma lines,
             - detector efficiencies,
             - the fission the yields of precursor
             - the least square fit analysis.
