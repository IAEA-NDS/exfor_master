SAMPLE     For long-lived fission products electrodeposited
           targets of 243-Am (~ 90 micro gram) were covered with
           25 micrometer thick aluminum foil or 75 micrometer
           thick Lexan foil, which act as a catcher to collect
           the recoiling fission products during the neutron
           irradiation of the targets. They were then wrapped with
           1 mm thick cadmium foil, doubly sealed in alkathene
           bags and irradiated for about 5 to 60 minutes at a
           of flux 1.2 0E10*12 n/cm2-sec.
           For short-lived fission products, the nitrate solution
           of 243Am (~ 50 micro gram) were sealed in a
           polypropylene tube and wrapped with 1 mm thick cadmium
           foil. They were additionally sealed in alkathene bags
           and irradiated using pneumatically carrier facility for
           3 to 5 minutes at a flux of 5.0 0E10*12 n/cm2-sec.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC,FPGAM) Fission products were
           collected using recoil catcher technique.The aluminium
           catcher foils in APSARA irradiation was used for
           radiochemical separation of tellurium and iodine. The
           irradiated solution in the CIRUS irradiation was used
           for radiochemical separation of cesium. The irradiated
           solutions, lexan catcher foils separated aliquots of
           tellurium, iodine and cesium were taken for gamma ray
           counting.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)The fission products were analyzed by gamma ray
           spectrometry at a fixed geometry of an energy- and
           efficiency- calibrated 120 or 80-cm3 high-purity
           germanium detector coupled to a PC-based 4K channel
           analyzer. The resolution of the detector system was 2.0
           keV at 1332.0 keV and the dead time was always less
           than 10%.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The photo-peak areas of the gamma rays for the
           radio nuclides  were calculated from their total peak
           areas by subtracting the Compton  background. From the
           photo-peak areas, independent isomeric yields and
           thus their ratios were calculated using standard decay
           growth equation  after correcting for precursor
           contribution. The activities of 92-Sr and 104-Tc were
           used as fission rate monitors in the long and short
           irradiated un-separated samples respectively. In the
           separated samples  of tellurium, iodine and cesium
           samples 134-Te, 135-I and 139-Cs were  used as fission
           rate monitors respectively.
           Independent isomeric yield ratio(IYR)of 128-Sb, 130-Sb,
           132-Sb, 131-Te, 133-Te, 132-I, 134-I, 136-I, 135-Xe
           and 138-Cs were determined in 243-Am(n,f) using
           radiochemical and off line gamma ray spectrometric
           techniques. From the IYR fragment angular momenta
            (Jrms) were deduced using spin dependent statistical
           model analysis.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty on the IYR includes the
           error due to:
             * counting statistics,
             * absolute abundance of the gamma lines,
             * detector efficiencies,
             * the fission the yields of precursor
             * the least square fit analysis.
DECAY-DATA The gamma lines and the nuclear spectroscopic data
           of different nuclides were taken from:
