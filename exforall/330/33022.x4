TITLE      Fission fragment angular momentum in the spontaneous
           fission of 244-Cm
AUTHOR     (H.Naik,R.J.Singh,R.H.Iyer)

REFERENCE  (J,RCA,92,1,2004)
SAMPLE     An electrodeposited source of 99.43 atom % of 244-Cm
           was prepared on a thin platinum planchet from an
           isopropyl alcohol medium. The target was heated red
           hot to fix the activity to the planchet.
METHOD     (REC,GSPEC) The recoiling fission products from the
           244-Cm target were collected on 0.0075 cm thick Lexan
            (polycarbonate) catcher foils kept  at a distance 6
           mm from the target in 2 pi geometry for 2 to 60 hours
           depending upon the half lives of the nuclides of
           interest. After the exposure the lexan foils were
           removed, washed with very dilute nitric acid and
           distilled water to remove any possible contamination of
           244-Cm. They were then mounted on a Perspex plate and
           counted at a fixed geometry and efficiency calibrated
           120 c.c. HPGe detector.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The lexan foils were counted at a fixed
           geometry on an energy and efficiency calibrated 120
           c.c HPGe detector coupled to a 4096 channel analyzer
           in live time mode. The resolution of the detector
           system was 1.8 keV at 1332 keV of 60-Co. The dead
           time was kept at less than 10% to avoid pile up effect.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) From the photo peak areas of gamma rays of the
           nuclides of interest, independent isomeric yield
           ratios were calculated using usual decay growth
           equation after correcting for the precursor
           contribution.  The activities of 92-Sr was used as the
           fission rate monitor.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty on the independent
           isomeric yield ratios includes the error due to
           counting statistics, absolute abundance of the gamma
           lines, detector efficiencies, the fission yields of the
           precursor and the least square analysis.
DECAY-DATA The gamma lines and the nuclear spectroscopic data
           of different nuclides were taken from:
            E.Browne and R.B.Firestone, in Table of Radioactive
           Isotopes, edited by V.S.Shirley (Wiley & Sons,NY,1986)
            and
            J.Blachot, Ch.Fiche, Ann.Phys. (Paris) 6, 3-218(1981).
