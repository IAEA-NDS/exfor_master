FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14 MV BARC-TIERtandem accelerator
           located at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector coupled to a PC based 4k channel
           analyzer. Efficiency and energy calibration was done
           using 152-Eu source. Half-lives of product nuclei
           were followed to check interference from other
           activities.
METHOD     (ACTIV)sample was irradiated in 0 degree direction
           placed at a distance of 2.1 cm from Li foil.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction(Q=-1.64MeV).
           Proton beams of 5.0 MeV and 5.6 MeV.
           Li foil of thickness 3.7 mg/cm**2 was sandwiched
           between Ta foil of thickness 3.9 mg/cm**2 followed by
           a thick Ta foil to stop protons
           neutron flux of ~10**7 n/cm**2/s.
PART-DET   (DG)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The statistical error and error on the
           standard cross section.
CORRECTION Experimental data following application of various
           corrections.
