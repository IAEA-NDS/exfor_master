ANALYSIS   The recoiling fission product from the 244-Cm target
           were collected on the 0.0075 cm thick Lexan
            (polycarbonate) catcher foils by exposing it at a
           distance of 6 mm from the target in 2pai geometry from
           a known length of time. Two sets of experiments were
           done. one of short duration of 2-3 hours and other
           is of long irradiation of order 60-400 hrs for longer
           lived  fissionproducts. A typical gammaray sprctrum
           of the fission products from the spontaneous fission
           of 244-Cm.

REACTION   (96-CM-244(0,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY)
SAMPLE     The isotopic composition of the curium was
           Cm-244-99.43, 245-Cm-6.5x 10-2, 246-Cm-0.48,
           247-Cm-6.5x 10-3 and 248-Cm-1.5x 10-2 atom %
           respectively. It was electrodiposited on a thin
           platinium planchet from isoprophyl alcohol medium.
           The target was heated red hot to fix the activity
           firmly to the planchet. The purity of the target
           and the amount was assayed and checked by alpha
           spectrometry.
