           (C,80WALTAI,,155,1980) preliminary data in table.
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Cirus reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron flux of ~5.0E12 n/cm2-sec
SAMPLE     Targets of 229-Th (~30 micro gram) were prepared on
           platinum backing by electro deposition using
           isopropyl alcohol
METHOD     (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the
           thin target-recoil-catcher technique.
           (GSPEC) The decay of the fission products were
           followed as a function of time using
           gamma ray spectrometry
           (EXTB)Thermal neutron from Cirus reactor were used
           (RELFY) The growth and decay of the daughter product
           related with the fractional cumulative yield (FCY) of
           the parent and fractional independent yield (FIY) of
           the daughter product with suitable equations as
           described in the paper.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 60 cm3 Ge(Li) detector Resolution 2.6 keV at
            1332 keV
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The deacy of each daughter product in a given
           mass chain was followed for suitable length of time.
CORRECTION The correction for the decay and growth during the
           irradiation for the parent and daughter product
           were incorporated in the equations
           The errors due detector efficiency, self absorption
           and scattering were getting cancelled as the samples
           were counted in similar geometry.
           The corrections for the loss of 135-Xe due to its high
           absorption cross section were applied during
           irradiation

STATUS     (TABLE) Data is taken from table 1 and 2 of this paper
            (Ref. Journal RCA,33,189,1983)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors listed are the standard
           deviations between the results from five different
           irradiations and various gamma rays.
           Errors are statistical, given as 1 standard deviation.
COMMENT    The FCY values for 135-I published in
           Phy.Rev. C17, 188 (1978) for 252Cf(s,f) and in
           Phy.Rev. C21, 1411(1980) for 245Cm(n,f) have been
           corrected  in this paper.
