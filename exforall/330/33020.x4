SAMPLE     Encapsulated solutions containing approximately 1
           micro gram of 241-Pu were irradiated pneumatically at
           a neutron flux of 1.0x10**13 n/cm2/sec.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resultant precipitate of silver antiomonide,
           dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted on a 45 cc HPGe
           detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live time. The
           resolution of the detector was 2.2 keV at 1332 keV.
           The gamma spectra indicated that there was no
           contamination from other fission products in the
           separated antimony isotopes.
METHOD     (RCHEM,GSPEC) After the irradiation antimony was
           separated from the irradiated target solution by
           distilling antimony hydride and collecting into
           silver nitrate solution. The resultant precipitate of
           silver antiomonide, dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted
           on a 45 cc HPGe  detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live
           time.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) From the photopeak areas of the gamma rays of
           the nuclides' independent isomeric yields were
           determined using usual decay-growth equations after
           correcting for the precursor contribution.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error on an individual measurement is
           about 15 % which is the compounded error due to
           counting statistics, the uncertainties on the
           gamma-ray abundances, the fractional cumulative yield
            (fCY)128-Sn, the irradiation and separation
           times and the half lives. The errors quoted on the
           mean isomeric yield ratios are the precision of the
           measurements.

STATUS     (APRVD) By Dr.B.S.Tomar, RCD, BARC
COMMENT    fragment angular momenta estimated from the measured
           isomer ratios using the statistical model analysis
           showed significantly larger fragment angular momenta
           in the medium energy fissioning system compared to
           the low energy fissioning system. This has been
           attributed to the effect of higher excitation energy
           and angular momentum in the entrance channel leading
           to increased fragment temperature, moments of inertia
           and angular velocity.
