SAMPLE     Separate sets of samples were made for irradiation
           for two different neutron energies. In the first set
           the thickness of uranium foil is 395.1 mg/cm2,
           whereas in the second set it is 344.1 mg/cm2.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural Lithium with 3.7 mg/cm2 thickness is
           sandwiched between two tantalum foils of different
           thicknesses.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector efficiency was 20% at 1332.5 keV.
           The resolution of the detector system had a
           full-width at half maximum of 1.8 keV at 1332.5 keV
           of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated for 5 to 7 h
           depending upon the proton beam energy facing the
           tantalum target. The proton beam energies were 10 and
           14 MeV. The corresponding average neutron energies
           impinging on the U targets were 8.04 +- 0.30 MeV and
           11.90 +- 0.35 MeV, respectively. The irradiated
           samples were cooled for 3 to 4 h.
