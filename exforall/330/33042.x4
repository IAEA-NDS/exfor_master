INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium consists of isotopes 6Li and
           7Li with abundances 7.42% and 92.58% respectively.
           The lithium foil was made up of natural lithium with
           thickness 3.7 mg/cm2 and is sandwiched between two
           tantalum foils of different thicknesses. The thinner
           tantalum foil facing the proton beam with thickness
           of 4 mg/cm2, in which the degradation of the proton
           energy is only 30 keV. The thicker tantalum foil of
           0.025 mm, which is located behind the lithium foil,
           is sufficient to stop the proton beam
SAMPLE     Natural thorium metal foil with thickness 143.8 mg/cm2
           was used. Th foil was wrapped with 0.025 mm thick super
           pure aluminum foil
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 80 cm**3 HPGe detector
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The 232-Th(n,gamma) reaction cross-
           section at average neutron energies of 8.04 and
           11.9 MeV has been determined for the first time using
           activation and off-line gamma-ray spectrometric
           technique. The samples were irradiated for 5-7 hrs.
           The samples were cooled for sufficient cooling time
           after irradiation.

INC-SPECT  The neutron flux calculated for 8.04 +- 0.30 MeV and
           11.90 +- 0.35 MeV neutron energies are obtained to be
            (3.56 +- 0.03) x 10**6 and (1.30 +- 0.02) x 10**7
           n/cm2/s corresponding to the proton energy of 10
           and 14 MeV,respectively.
CORRECTION The contribution from the tail region has been
           estimated using the ENDF/B-VII.0 and JENDL-4.0 by
           folding the cross-sections with neutron flux
           distributions in Poppe et al. (1976) and S.Mashnik et
           al. (2008). The actual value due to the neutrons from
           the main peak of the n0 and n1 groups of the neutron
           spectrum is obtained after subtracting the average
           cross-section due to neutrons from the tail region.

DECAY-DATA (90-TH-231,25.52HR,DG,84.2,0.066)
INC-SPECT  The neutron flux for the 232Th(n,2n) reaction at the
           average neutron energies of 8.04 +- 0.30 MeV and
           11.90 +- 0.35 MeV were obtained as
            (2.34 +- 0.02) x 10**6 and
            (9.06 +- 0.02) x 10**6 n/cm2/s, respectively.
           These values were obtained based on the ratio of
           neutron flux of the neutron spectrum of Refs. Poppe et
           al.(1976) and Mashnik et al.(2008) for (n,2n) reaction
           above its threshold to total flux.
