INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)The neutron beam was obtained from the 7-
           Li(p,n) reaction by using the proton beam. The
           lithium foil was made up of natural lithium with
           thickness of 3.7 mg/cm2, sandwiched between two
           tantalum foils of different thickness.
SAMPLE     The samples consist of natural 238-U metal foil and
            natural indium metal foil, which were wrapped
            separately with 0.025 mm thick aluminum foil to
            prevent contamination from one to the other.
           The size of 238-U metal foil was 1.0 cm2 with
            thickness of 29.3 mg/cm2, whereas indium metal foil
            is also of same size with thickness of 2.6 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-rays of reaction products from the
           irradiated U and In samples were counted in an energy
           and efficiency calibrated 80 c.c. HPGe detector
           coupled to a PC-based 4K channel analyzer.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiated for 4-6 hrs, cooled for 1 hr.

CORRECTION Contribution of tail neutrons was estimated by folding
            of evaluated (n,g) and (n,2n) cross sections in
            ENDF/B-VII.1 and JENDL-4.0 libraries by neutron
            spectra given in C.H.Poppe et al. (1976) and
            J.W.Meadows et al. (1972), and subtracted.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty is the quadratic sum of
           both statistical and systematic errors
           (ERR-S,10.,15.)Counting statistics (~10-15%)
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic uncertainty includes:
           (ERR-1)Neutron flux estimation (~4%)
           (ERR-2)Irradiation time (~2%)
           (ERR-3)Detection efficiency calibration (~3%)
           (ERR-4)Half-life of the fission products and the
           gamma-ray abundances (~2%)
