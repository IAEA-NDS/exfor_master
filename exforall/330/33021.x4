           momenta in 241-Pu(n,F)

FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Research Reactor APSARA in B.A.R.C,
           Trombay, Mumbai
SAMPLE     Electrodeposited target of 241-Pu (~50 micro gram)
           covered with 0.00254 cm thick superpure aluminium
           foil was irradiated in the Apsara reactor at a flux
           of 2.0x10**12 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC) Fission products were collected
           using recoil catcher technique. Tellurium and iodine
           were separated using standard radiochemical procedure
           after dissolution of the catcher foil within  20-30
           min from the end of the irradiations. After the
           separation the samples were counted on a 45c.c. HPGe
           detector in conjuction with a 4k analyzer in live
           time mode.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resolution of the detector system was 2.6
           keV at 1332.0 keV.  The dead time was maintained below
           10%.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) Linear Compton subtraction was done while
           computing the peak areas under the photo peaks of
           interest. The gamma-ray spectra of the separated
           samples were checked for the absence of the precursor
           activities. The observed activity profiles as a
           function of time were analyzed using standard decay
           growth equations to arrive at the separation time
           activities of the meta-stable and ground states.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The quoted limits of errors on the
           independent yield ratios  were obtained taking into
           account the observed precision with errors in
           calculated peak area statistics, precursor yield
           values and the least square fitting of the activity
           profiles. The limits of the error on the RMS angular
           momentum value arise from the errors on the
           independent isomeric yield ratios.
