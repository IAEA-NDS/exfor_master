SAMPLE     Powder of BaCl2.2H2O powder (99% purity) was used
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector was calibrated using standard
           gamma activity
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) 6 MeV electrons were incident on the W target
           for bremsstrahlung production , and further produced
           continuous neutron energy through the Be target
METHOD     (ACTIV) irrad./cool./count. = 600/30/198.47 seconds
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Irradiation, cooling and counting times (0.1%)
           (ERR-2) Isotopic abundance                      (0.1%)
           (ERR-3) Weight of sample                       (1e-4%)
           (ERR-4) Self-absorption of gamma-ray           (~0.5%)
           (ERR-5) Coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma   (1%)
           (ERR-6) Detector efficienc                        (3%)
