TITLE      Long-range alpha emission in P-wave neutron induced
           fission of 235U

SAMPLE     235U of area 4 cm2 and thickness 5 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The 235U fission source was used as the
           cathode of the ionization chamber and 7 mg/cm2 thick
           Aluminum foil was used as the collector.
           (TRD) Five Cellulose nitrate track detector (CNTD)
           foils were placed close to the collector foil. Each
           foil was of area 3x3 cm2 and thickness 100 um.
PART-DET   (A,FF) Alpha, fission fragments
METHOD     (COINC) Alpha particle and fission fragments were
           detected in coincidence.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction was used for producing
           neutrons of energies 125, 155, 185, 210, 240 keV and
           thermal neutrons (0.0000253 keV). 7Li(p,n) neutrons
           were moderated by the paraffin block to obtain the
           thermal neutrons.
           (P-T) For 365 and 480 keV neutrons T(p,n)3He reaction
           was used.
ANALYSIS   Long-range alpha particle spectra were obtained by
           rear-etching method. These spectra were fitted by
           Gaussian function to get the average energy and
           standard deviation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about the uncertainty
