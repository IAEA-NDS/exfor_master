TITLE      Energy and angular distribution of alpha particles
           from the 23Na(n,a)20F reaction induced by 14 MeV
           neutrons

PART-DET   (A)
SAMPLE     Ilford nuclear plates with Sodium Acetate
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford 200 microns plate nuclear emulsions
           (LONGC) To monitor neutron yield, foil activation was
           also used(neutron detection and foil activation are
           complementary to each other)
           (TRD) The neutron flux was also determined from
           recoil proton track analysis
METHOD     Scanning was accomplished by a Zeiss opton microscope
           having a magnification of (8 x 100), as usual;
           processing was done by the usual temperature method
           using low PH 6.6 amidol developer. For the hot stage
           20 min and 17 degree Celsius were selected as the
           suitable time and temperature.
