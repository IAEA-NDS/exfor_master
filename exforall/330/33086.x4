SAMPLE     Thin natural metallic Cd and In foil wrapped with
           0.025 mm thick ~99.99 % pure Al foil.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation time was 8.6 hrs. for the
           neutron energy of 1.12 MeV, 5.6 hrs. for 2.12 MeV,
           11.8 hrs. for 3.12 MeV and 13.4 hrs. for 4.12 MeV.
           (GSPEC) After cooling for 0.9-1.33 hr. (Cd) and 0.9-
           1.26 hr. (In).
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM) 6MV Folded Tandem Ion Accelerator
           (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14UD Pelletron Accelerator
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Pre-calibrated 80 cc HPGe detector having
           resolution 2.0 keV at 1332 keV of 60Co coupled to a
           PC based 4094 channel analyzer.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The proton beam of 3 and 4 MeV from FOTIA
           were bombarded on the LiF pellet of 1 cm diameter and
           3 mm thickness. The proton beam of 5 and 6 MeV were
           bombarded on natural lithium metal target with
           thickness 3.7 mg/cm2, sandwiched between two tantalum
           foils.

ADD-RES    The cross-section at 1.12 MeV normalized by monitor
           reaction 115In(n,n')115mIn taken from Physical
           Review,93,199,(1954) and J. Nucl. Phys. 2,337(1980)
           are also reported.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,3.8,5.7) Counting Statistics
           (ERR-SYS) Total systematic error is ~4.7% which is
           due to:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainties in the irradiation time ~0.1 %
           (ERR-2) Neutron flux due to monitor cross-section and
           neutron energy variation ~3%
           (ERR-3) Half-life of the reaction products and the
           gamma-ray abundances ~2%
           (ERR-4) Detection efficiency ~3%, which arises from
           the fitting error.
           (ERR-T)Combined uncertainties from both statistical
           and systematic error.
