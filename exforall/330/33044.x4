SAMPLE     Natural thorium metal foil of 1 cm2 length and
            0.025 mm thickness behind the Ta-Li-Ta stack.
           The foil was wrapped with 0.025 mm thick superpure
            aluminum foil
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiated for 5-7 hrs and cooled for
            6-24 hrs.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The lithium foil was made up of natural
           lithium having a thickness of 3.7 mg/cm2 and was
           sandwiched between two tantalum foils of different
           thicknesses. The thinner tantalum foil having a
           thickness of 4 mg/cm2 faced the proton beam, in which
           the degradation of the proton energy was only 30 keV.
           The thicker tantalum foil of 1.0 mm, located behind
           the lithium foil, was sufficient to stop the proton
           beam.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector (diam. 66.2 mm, height 66.7 mm) is
           a coaxial p-type HPGe detector with a relative
           efficiency of 50%. The resolution of the detector
           system was 2 keV at 1332.5 keV of 60Co.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) This overall uncertainty is the quadratic sum
           of both statistical and systematic errors.
           (ERR-S,5.,10.) The random error in the observed
           activity is primarily due to counting statistics,
           which is estimated to be 5-10%.
           (ERR-SYS) The systematic errors are due to
           (ERR-1) uncertainties in photon flux estimation ~2%,
           (ERR-2) uncertainties in the irradiation time ~0.5%,
           (ERR-3) uncertainties in the detection efficiency
           calibration ~3%,
           (ERR-4) uncertainties in the half-life of the reaction
           products and the gamma-ray abundances ~2%

INC-SPECT  Neutron flux is
            (9.65 +- 0.76) x 10**6 n/cm2/s at 13.50 MeV
            (3.09 +- 0.25) x 10**7 n/cm2/s at 15.50 MeV
            (8.59 +- 0.67) x 10**7 n/cm2/s at 17.28 MeV
CORRECTION The contribution from the tail region has been
           estimated using the ENDF/B-VII.0 and JENDL-4.0 by
           folding the cross-sections with neutron flux
           distributions in Poppe et al. (1976) and S.Mashnik et
           al. (2008). The actual value due to the neutrons from
           the main peak of the n0 and n1 groups of the neutron
           spectrum is obtained after subtracting the average
           cross-section due to neutrons from the tail region.

INC-SPECT  Neutron flux (7.02 +- 0.55) x 10**7 n/cm2/s
           Value was obtained based on the ratio of the
           neutron flux of the neutron spectrum for (n,2n)
           reaction in C.H.Poppe et al. (1976) and
           S.G.Mashnik et al. (2000) above its threshold to the
