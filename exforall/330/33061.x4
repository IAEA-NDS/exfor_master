PART-DET   (A)
INC-SOURCE (P-T) 5.5 MeV protons on titanium-tritium
SAMPLE     Physical-form of target is solid. (A teflon ribbon of
           20 mg/cm2 thickness was used as the target of
           fluorine.)
METHOD     (COINC) The pulse-height spectrum of alphas from the
            counter near the source, gated by the coincidence
            pulse derived from both the counters, was recorded on
            a TMC 400-channelanalyser.
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDTRM)
DETECTOR   Calibration: The spectrometer was calibrated using an
           241Am alpha source.
           (TELES,PROPC,PROPC) The counter telescope consist of
            two proportional counters filled with 95 % of krypton
            and 5% of CO2 at a pressure of 2 cm of Hg.
           (SCIN) Neutrons were monitored by a glycyryl borate
            plastic plus Zns scintillator-photomultiplier
            assembly, which is insensitive to gamma rays.

ANALYSIS   The 0 degree yield of alphas from fluorine has been
           compared with the 0 degree recoil proton yield from
           alkathene for which the differential cross section is
           reported by Fowler and Brolley as 530 mb/sr. With a
           knowledge of the effective thicknesses of the
           alkathene and teflon targets and hence the number of
           hydrogen and fluorine atoms, sigma(0 degree) for
           fluorine alphas has been computed.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in the cross section comprises
            the counting statistics, the finite angular aperture
            which varies from 16 to 4 degree at scattering angles
            from 0 to 180 degree, the large uncertainty in the
            effective fluorine target thickness particularly at
            low alpha energies.
