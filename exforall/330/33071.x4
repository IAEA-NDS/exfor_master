SAMPLE     A 252Cf source of strength 5x10E5 fissions per min
           deposited onto a thin nickel foil.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A surface-barrier detector with depletion
           depth of 400 micron was mounted at a distance of
           about 0.8 cm from the source to detect the light
           charged particles (LCP). This detector was covered
           with an aluminum foil of thickness 10 mg/cm**2 to
           stop completely all the natural alpha particles and
           the fission fragments emitted from the source.
           (GE) A semiconductor detector placed at right angles
           to the LCP detector was used to detect the fission
           fragments.
           (SILI) The energies of the K x-rays were measured
           with a cooled lithium-drifted silicon detector of 3
           mm thickness, placed on the other side of the source
           foil at a distance of 1.6 cm from the source in line
           with the LCP detector.
METHOD     (COINC)
           (XSPEC)
CORRECTION The observed K x-ray spectra were corrected: (i) for
           the background arising from the chance coincidences,
           measured by appropriately delaying the pulses from
           the LCP and fragment detector systems; and
           (ii) for the background arising from the true
           coincidences with the Compton scattered fission gamma
           rays, measured by inserting a copper filter (570
           mg/cm**2) in the path of the x rays. The detection
           efficiencies for x rays of different energies were
           calculated from the known photoelectric and total
           absorption cross sections in silicon, also taking
           into account a small attenuation of the x rays in one
           beryllium window of thickness 46 mg/cm**2 and one
           aluminum window of thickness 10 mg/cm**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No detail information on sources of
           uncertainties.
