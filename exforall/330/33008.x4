INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Apsara reactor and CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) CIRUS neutron flux  ~ 10.**13 n/cm**2/s.
                  Apsara neutron flux ~ 10.**12 n/cm**2/s.
SAMPLE     Plutonium containing about 95% 239Pu, enriched
           uranium containing about 90% 235U and uranium-233
           were purified chemically and used for target
           preparation. The targets were prepared by
           electroplating the required amount of fissile
           material from isopropyl alcohol medium onto a 10-mil
           superpure aluminium foil electroplated first with
           about 50-60 mu-g/cm2 of gold (which, being more
           electropositive than aluminium, offered a more
           suitable surface for electrodeposition; at the same
           time, the main backing was essentially aluminium with
           minimum scattering). The amount of fissionable material
           on a target varied from 10 to 50 mu-g depending on the
           length of irradiation and nuclides of interest.
           For range measurements the thin-target-thin-catcher
           method was used. The thickness of uranium or plutonium
           targets used was usually about 25 mu-g/cm2 and always
           less than 70 mu-g/cm2. The target was covered with a
            stack of three 0.3 mil superpure aluminium foils

ANALYSIS   The comparision method is used here. For plutonium
           fission yield determination, the U-235 and Pu-239
           targets were covered with 1-mil superpure aluminium
           foils(1.5 cm diam),wrapped with another superpure
           aluminium foil, sealed in polyehylene and irradiated
           simulteniously for different neutron flux in both
           above said reactors. After irradiation and sufficient
           cooling, the catcher foils were centered on marked Al
           plates and covered with cellophane of 6 mg/cm**2
           thickness. The details of the fission yield
           calculation are not given in this paper. For the
           range measurement the thin-target-thin catcher method
           was used.

INC-SPECT  Thermal neutron spectra
FACILITY   (REAC)Used both APSARA and CIRUS reactor having
           Thermal neutron flux 10**12 n/cm2/s and 10**13n/cm2/s
           respectively SAMPLE Plutonium containing about 95%
           Pu-239.The targets were prepared by electroplating
           the required amount of fissile material from isopropyl
           alcohol medium onto a 10 mil super pure aluminum foil
           electroplated first with about 50-60 microgram/cm**2
           of gold. The amount of fissionable material on a target
           varied from 10-50 microgram depending on the length of
           the irradiation depending on the length of irradiation
           and nuclides of interest. The actual amount deposited
           on a target was estimated by the difference in the
           amount of fissile material in the solution before and
           after electro deposition, the amount being deposited
           being determined by the liquid scintillation counting.
           The area of the fissile material was well defined and
           identical on all targets, the diameter being 1 cm.
