SAMPLE     Thin uniform curium targets of 50 microgram/cm2 was
           prepared by electrodeposition on electro-polished
           stainless steel planchests from an isopropyl alcohol
           medium. The isotopic composition of the purified curium
           determined mass spectrometrically was 244Cm(93.86%),
           245Cm(2.01%) and 246Cm(4.13%).
DETECTOR   (TRD) Lexan polycarbonate solid state track detector
           used to determined the fission rate of 244Cm target.
           (PROPC) Precalibrated low background beta proportional
           counter used for counting the fission products.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           (BSPEC) Followed for three to four half-lives on the
           low background counter.
           (ABSFY) Fission rate and disintegration rate were
           measured.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The overall systematic error is 5% which is
           mainly due to the uncertainty in the detector
           efficiency.
           (ERR-2,,2.) Statistical uncertainty due to fission
           rate determination(<2%)
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors based on four irradiations.
