           (C,80WALTAI,,147,1980) The same data in table.
SAMPLE     (96-CM-244,ENR=0.9386) Thin uniform curium targets of
           50 ug/cm2 was prepared by electrodeposition on
           electro-polished stainless steel planchests from an
           isopropyl alcohol medium. The isotopic composition of
           the purified curium determined mass spectrometrically
           was 244Cm(93.86%), 245Cm(2.01%) and 246Cm(4.13%).
DETECTOR   (TRD) Lexan polycarbonate solid state track detector
           used to determined the fission rate of 244Cm target.
           (PROPC) Calibrated low background beta proportional
           counter used for counting the fission products.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           (BSPEC) Followed for three to four half-lives on the
           low background counter.
           (ABSFY) Fission rate and disintegration rate were
           measured.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The overall systematic error in the
           determination of the absolute disintegration rate.
           (ERR-2,,1.) Maximum statistical uncertainty due to
           fission rate determination(1%)
           (ERR-3,,2.) Maximum systematic uncertainty due to
           fission rate determination (2%)
           (ERR-S,3.,4.) Random uncertainty in the determination
            of the absolute didintegration rate.
           (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors based on four irradiation
