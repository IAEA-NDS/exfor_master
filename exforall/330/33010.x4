DETECTOR   (GELI)The products were analyzed by gamma spectrometry
           at a fixed geometry of an energy- and efficiency-
           calibratED with 60-cm3 Ge-Li detectorcoupled to a
           4096 channel analyzer.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay equation for fission products
METHOD     (ACTIV,RCHEM) The absolute fission yields of various
           fission products were determined using radiochemical
           and gamma spectrometric techniques in combination with
           the track-etch method.

FACILITY   (REAC)The target and polypropylene tubes were
           wrapped in aluminium foil sand irradiated either in aps
           or cirus for a known length of time
SAMPLE     The target was prepared by evaporating a known aliquot
           of a stock solution on aluminium foil.A dilute solution
           of the stock was taken in polypropylene tubes containin
           a mica detector strip.The target and the polypropylene
           tubes were wrapped in aluminium foil .The target was
           dissolved in dilute Hcl containing trace amounts of
           copper or cadmium salt.
