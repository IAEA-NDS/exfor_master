SAMPLE     Ilford nuclear plates with Manganese Acetate
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford 200 microns plate nuclear emulsions
METHOD     Scanning was accomplished by a Zeiss opton microscope
           having a magnification of (8 x 100), as usual;
           processing was done by the usual temperature method
           using low PH 6.6 amidol developer. For the hot stage
           20 min and 17 degree celsius were selected as the
           suitable time and temperature.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 200 keV deuteron beam on ZrT
FACILITY   (CCW,3INDSAH)
ADD-RES    (ANGD) Angular distribution plotted in Fig.3 is not
           suitable for digitization due to bad quality.
           (E-DIS) Energy distribution plotted in Fig.6 is not
           suitable for digitization due to bad quality.
