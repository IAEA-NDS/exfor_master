ANALYSIS   All of the fission yields must, however, be expressed
           as upper limits for the following reasons: (a) no
           firm evidence for 42Ar or for 56 Co was found; the
           method of analyses used merely assumed that some was
           present, and (b) 37Ar, 39Ar, and 41Ar could have been
           formed by reactions of neutrons with trace impurities
           in the sample, such as (n,gamma) reactions with argon,
            (n,p) reactions with potassium, and (n,alpha)
           reactions with calcium. A reasonable upper limit to
           assign each yield is the sum of the calculated yield
           and its standard deviation.

SAMPLE     The irradiated uranium sample, a part of a reactor
           fuel plate containing approximately 2.5 mg of 235U
           and 125 mg of aluminum.
METHOD     (CHSEP,RELFY) The sample was irradiated for 3.85 yr.
           The sample was dissolved in the presence of measured
           amounts of argon, krypton, and xenon carriers with 6N
           hydrochloric acid containing a trace of platinic
           chloride as a catalyst. The recovery of each rare gas
           was measured; chemical yields were always more than
           95%. The difference of activities of the argon
           counted through a thin window (39Ar) and internally in
           a gas counter was taken as the 37Ar activity.

           counter.

DETECTOR   (GEMUC) A low-level G.M. gas counter (30 mm x4 mm,
           background 0.026+-0.002 counts/min) was filled with the
            argon.
SAMPLE     The irradiated uranium sample, a part of a reactor
           fuel plate containing approximately 2.5 mg of 235U
           and 125 mg of aluminum.
METHOD     (CHSEP,RELFY) The sample was irradiated for 3.85 yr.
           The sample was dissolved in the presence of measured
           amounts of argon, krypton, and xenon carriers with 6N
           hydrochloric acid containing a trace of platinic
           chloride as a catalyst. The recovery of each rare gas
           was measured; chemical yields were always more than
           95%. 42K was allowed to grow in, the argon was removed,
            and  then the 42K was counted.  No evidence for 42K
           activity  was  observed. An upper limit for 42K
           activity was determined by two methods:
            (1) the difference between a long count of the sample
           and of the background was taken as the number of
           atoms of 42K at the beginning of the count, and
            (2) a least-squares decay-curve analysis was
           performed assuming the presence of 42K and background.
           The fission yields obtained from the two methods are
            (1.1+-1.7)x10**-11% and (0.6+-0.8)x10**-11%,
           respectively.

SAMPLE     A sample of 12 mg of 235U as uranyl sulfate wrapped
           in sufficient aluminum to stop all fission recoil.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 76 mm x 76 mm NaI(Tl) detector.
METHOD     (CHSEP,FPGAM) The sample was irradiated for 19.9
           days. Gamma spectra were measured with a NaI(Tl)
           detector. After subtraction of a standard 60Co
           background gamma spectrum from the gamma spectrum of
           the sample, no firm evidence was found for 56Co.
