FACILITY   (CCW,1USAOHO) The experiment was performed at the
           Ohio University Accelerator Laboratory using a beam
           swinger - the Swinger Spectrometer
SAMPLE     EJ-200 scintillator with diameter of 1.5cm and
           height of 4.5 cm was used as active sample, placed
           20 cm from the neutron source.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) EJ-200 scintillator with diameter of 1.5cm and
           height of 4.5 cm was used as active sample - a
           scatter detector. Detector was used as time of flight
           stop detector with threshold of a constant fraction
           discriminator fixed at 60 keV electron energy. The
           swinger magnet was rotated around scatter detector
           to provide different scattering angles.
           (SCIN) Three liquid-scintillation neutron detectors
            (NE213, D = 12.7 cm, H = 5.08 cm, PMT RCA 4522) were
           placed at a flight path of 4.108m from the
           scatter-detector.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Neutron energy was determined by time of
           flight
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons of 14.9MeV were generated with a
           0.53MeV deuteron beam on a tritiated titanium target
           though the T(d,n)4He reaction.
