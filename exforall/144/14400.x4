TITLE      A Study of the Spectrum of the Neutrons of Low Energy
           from the Fission of 235U

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Los Alamos fast reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The beam of thermal neutrons had a flux of
           5x10**5 neutrons/cm2/sec at a distance of 6 ft from
           the face of the reactor pile, where the 235U foil was
           placed.
DETECTOR   The cloud chamber.
SAMPLE     The 235U foil was 3 cm by 10 cm by 0.010 inches thick,
           making the source strength of fission neutrons of
           3.7x10**7 neutrons/sec.
METHOD     (REC) In order to get longer proton tracks for a
           given energy in the cloud chamber, hydrogen gas was
           used at a pressure of 1/3 of an atmosphere; and water
           vapor was used in place of alcohol, reducing the
           stopping power of vapor by a factor of about three.
           The cloud chamber was placed well outside the beam of
           neutrons, at a distance of 35 cm from the 235U
           sample. Under the experimental conditions outlined
           above, from 5 to 15 recoil protons were obtained each
           time the cloud chamber expanded. 2800 pairs of
           stereoscopic pictures were taken with the apparatus
           and approximately 25000 recoil protons were observed.
ANALYSIS   To convert from the number of proton recoils to the
           number of primary neutrons one must take into account
           the varying cross sections for neutron-proton
           scattering. As a final correction one must multiply
           by the geometrical correction factor for the
           probability of measuring tracks of different lengths
           to deduce the relative number of neutrons with
           different energies.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details are given.
