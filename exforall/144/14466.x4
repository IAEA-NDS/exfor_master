FACILITY   (VDG,1USAKTY) Experiments were performed at the
           University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory using
           protons from the 7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator
SAMPLE     (32-GE-76,ENR=0.84) Enriched GeO2 sample with weight of
           19.56 g, contained in a cylindrical polyethylene vial
           of 1.1-cm radius and 3.0-cm height.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-ray spectra were detected with a high-
           purity germanium detector of 50% relative efficiency
           and an energy resolution of 2.2 keV(FWHM)at 1333 keV
           surrounded by a bismuth germanate annulus, which
           served as a Compton suppressor and active shield.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to select prompt gamma
           rays to reduce background.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Nearly monoenergetic neutrons were produced by
           the 3H(p,n)3He reaction. Protons from the 7-MV Van de
           Graaff accelerator were incident upon a tritium gas
           cell at a tritium pressure of approximately 1 atm.
           The gas cell was separated from the beamline by a 3.6
           mu-m molybdenum foil. Proton beam was pulsed with a
           pulse width of approx. 1 ns.
