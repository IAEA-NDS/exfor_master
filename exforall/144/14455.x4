FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Experiment performed at white neutron
           source of the Lujan Center, based on spallation
           reactions on a tungsten target using a pulsed 800-MeV
           proton beam, accumulated and compressed in a proton
           storage ring.
SAMPLE     (71-LU-176,ENR=0.9995) 176Lu target was prepared by
           176Lu ion deposition onto a 1 mu-m thin aluminized
           mylar foil. Target thickness was 0.5mg/cm2 and
           diameter 7 mm.
DETECTOR   (BAF2) 4PI gamma-detector array DANCE, composed of
           160 BaF2 scintillators. DANCE provides the total
           g-ray calorimetry and the multiplicity information
           of the g-cascade following neutron capture.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy determined by time of
           flight. Proton beam was compressed to a 250 ns pulse
           and delivered into tungsten spallation target at a
           repetition rate of 20 Hz. DANCE array was located on
           a 20.25 m long flight path.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed 800-MeV proton beam impinging on W
           target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties
