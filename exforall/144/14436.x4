FACILITY   (OLMS,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at TRIUMF-ISAC
           facility
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The 20 Compton-suppressed high-purity
           germanium gamma-ray detectors were used to detect
           gamma rays from decay of 102Rb.
           (SCIN) Ten plastic scintillators in half hemisphere
           configuration was used for beta-tagging
           (SCIN) A single fast-timing-response plastic
           scintillator located at 0deg to the beam axis was used
           for time reference.
METHOD     The Rb nuclei were surface ionized, extracted from the
           target, and mass- separated before being delivered to
           he Mylar tape at the center of the 8Pi spectrometer
INC-SOURCE The isotope 102Rb was produced by reactions of a
           500-MeV, 9.7 mu-A proton beam impinging on a
           multilayered UCx target at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility

DECAY-DATA (37-RB-102,37.0MSEC) Uncertainty 5ms.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is dominated by the unknown
           feeding to the ground state of the daughter nuclei.
