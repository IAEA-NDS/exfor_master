FACILITY   (VDG,1USAKTY) 7 MV electrostatic accelerator at the
           University of Kentucky was used in experiment
SAMPLE     (56-BA-136,ENR=0.9247) Enriched 136BaCO3 powder sample
           sealed in a polyethylene cylinder of height 2.4 cm
           and radius 1.4 cm, and weighing 8.49 g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using a 55% HPGe
           detector, which has a resolution of 2.2 keV full
           width at half maximum (FWHM) for the 1333-keV gamma ray
METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons were produced by proton beam pulsed at
           1.875 MHz.
INC-SOURCE (P-T) Neutrons produced by the 3H(p,n)3He reaction
           were almost monoenergetic  (dE=60 keV).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Origin of uncertainties unknown
HISTORY    (20160712C) Compiled by S.H.
