SAMPLE     (32-GE-76,ENR=0.86)
           (32-GE-74,ENR=0.14)
           A metallic germanium slab 10mm x 10mm in area and
           with a thickness of 2 mm (resulting in a mass of
           about 1.5 g) with the same isotopic composition as
           that of the enriched high-purity germanium detectors
           was used as target. The germanium slab was sandwiched
           between either indium or gold foils of the same area
           and thickness of 0.125mm and 0.01mm, respectively.
           detector material with isotopic abundance of
           approximately 86% 76Ge and 14% 74Ge.The isotopic
           composition is the same as that of the enriched HPGe
           detectors used by the GERDA and Majorana
           Collaborations.
