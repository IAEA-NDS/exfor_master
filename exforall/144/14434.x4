FACILITY   (FNS,1USALRL) Experiment performed at the National
           Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore
           National Laboratory loaded with fuels that produce
           approximately mono-energetic neutron energies of 14.1
           MeV from D-T fusion.
SAMPLE     Depleted uranium with 238U/235U ratio of approx 500.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector was used to quantify
           abundances of short-lived isotopes of Xe.
METHOD     (JET) Gaseous debris generated in the target chamber
           were pumped through an automated processing line for
           the radioactive analysis of gaseous samples (RAGS).
           Network of three 2000 L/s turbo pumps transports
           gases from the target chamber through 60 meters of 200
           stainless steel vacuum tubing to the gas purification
           and collection hardware. The purified gas is pumped
           over a cryogenically cooled Cu foam that is maintained
           at 60 K and which removes Xe from the gas phase. HPGe
           detector is located above the collection foam.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) All shots featured cryogenically cooled, glow
           discharge polymer (GDP,D-T) capsules loaded with
           deuterium-tritium fuel (atom ratio 1:1). The D-T
           fusion neutron yields varied by a factor of
           approximately seven, from 1.1E+15 to 7.6E+15 neutrons
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
