FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment perfomed at the TUNL tandem
           accelerator facility.
SAMPLE     The thulium samples consisted of 11.1 mm diameter
           disks of 0.1 mm thickness. They were positioned at a
           distance of 2.5 cm from the neutron source.The
           thulium disks were sandwiched between two monitor
           foils of 197Au of the same diameter as the thulium
           disks and 0.025 mm thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) the thulium and monitor foils were gamma ray
           counted in TUNL's Low-Background Counting Facility
           using 25%, 55%, or 60% relative efficiency
           high-purity germanium detectors
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. Irradiation times
           varied between 2 and 8 h, depending on neutron source
           reaction and energy.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196-G,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (79-AU-196-G,6.1669D,DG,355.73,0.87)
INC-SOURCE (D-D) The 2H(d,n) 3H reaction was employed to produce
           mono-energetic neutrons in 0.5-MeV energy steps
           between 8.5 and 14 MeV.
           (D-T) To extend the energy range to higher energies,
           the 3H(d,n) 4H reaction was used at 14.8 MeV.
