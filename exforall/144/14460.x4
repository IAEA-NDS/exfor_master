FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the Manuel
           Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center at the Los Alamos
           Neutron Science Center.
SAMPLE     (54-XE-136,ENR=0.999) Gaseous 136Xe sample was 3 cm
           thick sample pressurized to an average of 26 psi. The
           xenon gas was contained in an aluminum cell with 2.9
           cm diameter, 0.003 inch thick kapton windows allowing
           the neutron beam to pass through. The beam diameter
           was smaller than 2 cm at the target, the full flux of
           neutrons was incident upon xenon.
DETECTOR   (BAF2) Capture gamma rays were registered using array
           DANCE, consisting of 160 BaF2 crystals arranged
           spherically around the target. Each crystal is 15 cm
           long, has a volume of 734 cm3. The DANCE array covers
           solid angle of approx. 3.5 Pi steradians.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy was determined by time
           of flight. DANCE was located on Flight Path 14.This
           flight path is exposed to neutrons that pass through
           a room-temperature water moderator. The target sample,
           centered within the detector, is 20.25 m downstream
           of the moderator. The data was collected by two
           digitizers each recording a 256 ms long window. These
           time windows were set to a delay relative to the
           initial neutron beam trigger to select specific
           neutron energies based on time of flight. The first
           time window was set to look at the high neutron
           energy events, including the 2.154 keV 136Xe capture
           resonance, the second was delayed by 9.15 ms to look
           at the thermal neutron energy range of 0.0243 to
           0.0256 eV.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons were produced by spallation reaction
           of 800 MeV protons on tungsten target, Neutrons were
           moderated using room temperature water moderator.
