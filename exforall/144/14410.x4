FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at flight path
           FP14 at the LANSCE- Lujan Center at Los Alamos
           National Laboratory using DANCE array.
SAMPLE     The 173Lu target was produced using successively,
           proton irradiation of Hf sample at the Isotope
           Production Facility.A 49.12 g natural Hf sample was
           irradiated by a 93 MeV energy proton beam for 14
           days. The irradiated sample was treated chemically to
           separate Lu from Hf and beta decays products. The
           final target isotopic composition was
           Isotope       Mass(mu-g)
             173Lu          54.10
             174Lu           3.06
             175Lu         165.05
           The Lu solution was finally deposited by electro-
           deposition on a 2.5 mu-m thick titanium foil. A
           140 mu-g/cm2 relatively pure target of 173Lu was
           obtained containing a fraction of 175Lu used in the
           data analysis as a reference.
DETECTOR   (BAF2)Gamma rays were detected by DANCE - a 4Pi
           calorimetric gamma-ray detector. It consists of 160
           BaF2 crystals, each about 0.75 l in volume and 15 cm
           long. The face of each crystal is 17 cm from the
           sample center.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to determine incident
           neutron energy
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons were produced by spallation reaction
           of 800 MeV protons on moderated tungsten target
