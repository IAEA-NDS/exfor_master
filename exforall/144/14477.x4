SAMPLE     (98-CF-249,ENR=0.1082)
           (98-CF-250,ENR=0.1368)
           (98-CF-251,ENR=0.0476)
           (98-CF-252,ENR=0.7964) 18.4 ng of Cf sample resulted
           in a 9000 fission per second count rate with 99.7%
           being from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) 252Cf fission chamber was designed and
           fabricated containing 18.4 ng of Cf. This fission
           chamber was used to compare the spectrum obtained
           with the fission chamber signal to that from the
           gamma tagging method and was shown that both spectra
           show good agreement validating the gamma tagging method
           (BAF2) Four BaF2 gamma detectors were used to detect
           gamma rays. BaF2 gamma detectors are hexagonal prisms
           measuring 5 inches long and 2 inches across. The face
           of each detector was located 10 cm from the center of
           the fission sample in a square configuration with the
           detector centers located 10 inches apart.
           (SCIN) Two EJ-301 liquid scintillation detectors were
           used to detect neutrons. They were 3-inch thick by
           5-inch diameter and were placed 50 cm away from the
           center of the fission sample. This detector was used
           to measure the high energy portion of the PFNS, from
           0.5 to 7 MeV.
           (SCIN) The EJ-204 detector was a 0.5-inch thick by 5-
           inch diameter detector and was located 48 cm away
           from the center of the fission sample. This detector
           was used to measure the low energy portion of the
           prompt fission neutron spectrum, from 50 keV to 2 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy spectra were measured by time-of-
           flight using gamma ray tagging with BaF2 start
           detectors. Coincidence of two out of four BaF2
           detectors was required with a timing window of 3 ns
           between the events.
           (PSD) Pulse shape discrimination was used to reduce
           gamma ray background in neutron detectors
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty obtained by adding
           uncertainties in
             - detector efficiences
             - background contribution
           in quadrature
