SAMPLE     (32-GE-76,ENR=0.86)
           (32-GE-74,ENR=0.14) Enriched germanium slab of size
           10 x 10 x 6 mm3 with mass of approximately 3.2 g
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector located outside of the
           irradiation room with a 60% relative efficiency was
           used for gamma ray measurement.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. 76Ge was
           irradiated for 120s, then transported within 30 sec
           to HPGe detector and counted for 120 sec. A total of
           110 individual irradiations were performed.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Unpulsed deuterium beam with current 1.7mu-A
           was used
CORRECTION Correction for summing effects and HPGe efficiency
           were applied.
