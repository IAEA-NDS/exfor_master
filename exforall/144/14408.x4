FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORU) Experiment performed at TRIGA reactor
           at the Oregon State University
SAMPLE     194Hg is radioactive nucleus with half-life of 520y.
           The 194Hg activity was produced at the Los Alamos
           Meson Physics Facility by 800-MeV proton spallation
           reactions on a Pb target and was obtained in the form
           of HNO3 solution after the Hg activity was separated
           by ion exchange. The proton irradiation was done in
           the early 1980s and the separation in 1996, so there
           should be no activities present in the sample with
           half-lives less than a few years. The specific
           activity of the 194Hg was approximately 1 mu-Ci/ml.
           Samples for neutron irradiation were prepared either
           in the liquid form or dried on aluminum foil and
           typically amounted to 0.1 - 0.2 mu-Ci of the 194Hg
           activity.
DETECTOR   (GE) The gamma rays were observed with high-
           resolution Ge detectors (efficiency 35-40% compared
           with NaI at 1332 keV, resolution 1.68 keV at 1332 keV)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Several locations in reactor were used for
            samples iradiations, these included
            - central core(nominal thermal and epithermal flux
              respectively 1.0E+13 and 3.0E+11 n/cm2/s
            -Cd-lined central core(0 and 1.2E+12 n/cm2/s)
            -thermal column (6.4E+10 and 1.8E+8 n/cm2/s)
            -fast pneumatic transfer system (1.0E+13 and
             3.5E+11 n/cm2/s)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty includes contributions from
            branching ratios, detector efficiencies and flux
            determination, added in quadrature.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty from uncertainty in 194Hg target
            nucleus half life.
ANALYSIS    Final data determined as average values of results
            obtained for different irradiation places
