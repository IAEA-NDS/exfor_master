FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment was carried at the 10-MV FN
           Tandem Accelerator of the Triangle Universities
           Nuclear Laboratory
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.9997) A total of six 1.27 cm diameter
           depleted 238U targets were used. They were mounted
           normal to the incident beam at a distance of 2.54 cm
           downstream from the end of the deuterium gas cell when
           the  2H(d,n)3He reaction was employed. At 14 MeV the
           238U  target was positioned at a distance of 2.54 cm
           from the 0.4 mm thick Cu backing of the tritiated
           titanium foil.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The targets were gamma-ray counted in TUNL's
           low-background counting facility, using a set of high
           efficient standard HPGe and HPGe Clover detectors.
           The dead time of the counting system was less than
           1%. Over a period of 1 - 2 months, the targets were
           measured using a number of different counting cycles,
           depending on the half-lives of the product nuclei.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used

INC-SOURCE (D-D,D-T) Quasi-monoenergetic neutron beams were
           produced via the 2H(d,n)3He and 3H(d,n)4He
           reactions.Deuterium gas was contained in a 3-cm- long
           cylindrical cell with pressures adjusted in the 2 to
           4 atm range to keep the neutron energy spread below +-
           200 keV (FWHM). The cell was sealed from the beam
           line vacuum by a 6.35 mu-m thin Havar foil.
           (D-T)For the measurements with the 3H(d,n)4He
           reaction the tritiated target was used to produce
           14.8 MeV neutrons at 0deg, and 13.6 MeV neutrons
           at 135deg.
