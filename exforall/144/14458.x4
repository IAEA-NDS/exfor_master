DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) scintillation counters: The
           counters were biased to accept all pulses
           corresponding to gamma ray energies >30 keV.

           (62-SM-154,ENR=0.0180) The sample material used in
           these measurements contained >98% samarium. The main
           contaminants were Cd (<0.1%), Pb (<0.l%), Zr (<0.1%),
           Ce (<O.5%), Ir (<0.2%), and Eu (~0.1%). The samarium
           was deposited as samarium oxide (Sm2O3) on a 0.0025
           cm thick sheet of spectroscopically pure aluminum by
           painting on a thin coat of lacquer containing about 8
           microg/cm2 of samarium. The gold target material was
           prepared by vacuum evaporation of pure gold onto
           spectroscopically pure aluminum foils. Average
           deposit thicknesses were determined by weighing the
           backing foil before and after deposition. Six gold
           targets were cut; four of these were 1 cm by 1 cm
           square foils, ~450 microg/cm2 gold thickness, and the
           other two were disks, ~210 microg/cm2 gold thickness
           and the same diameter as the samarium foils.
METHOD     (CADMB,ACTIV) Cadmium ratio measurements have been
           made in similar lattice positions in ZEEP with thin
           foils of Sm152 and gold. For the cadmium ratio
           measurements the foils were placed in aluminum and
           cadmium capsules having 0.076 cm thick walls. These
           capsules were mounted on thin aluminum channels which
           were, in turn, inserted into aluminum thimbles
           attached to the ZEEP reactor lid.

           (ERR-1) The error in the ratio.
           (ERR-2) The error in the self-shielding factor of
           152Sm.
           (ERR-3) The error in the self-shielding factor of
           197Au.
           (ERR-4) The uncertainty in the correction for the
           fact that the flux is not exactly 1/E.
           (ERR-5) Errors due to uncertainties in the physical
           quantities are all negligible.

REL-REF    (R,20638001,R.B.Tattersall+,J,JNE/A,12,32,1960) Thermal
            neutron cross section values.
ANALYSIS   From the measured cadmium ratio and two recent
           thermal cross section measurements averaged at
           212+-12 barns the resonance integral was calculated.
           The Atlas of Neutron Resonances 2006 thermal cross
           section value of 206+-6 barns would produce a
           slightly different resonance integral.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error is predominantly due to the
           uncertainty in the 2200 m/sec cross section.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) For the 8-eV resonance in Sm152 the small
           terms in resonance integral (I') and sigma (s0) are
           about 0.20% and 0.l0%, respectively, of the first
           term, so that for the ratio I'/s0 the error in
           neglecting the small terms is about O.1%.
