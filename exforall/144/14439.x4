FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment performed using TUNL's
           atomic beam polarized ion source and FN-tandem
           accelerator
SAMPLE     Deuterated liquid scintillator, equivalent to NE232
           was used as an active target. Scintillator was in a
           glass cylinder of 4.2 cm in diameter and 6.4 cm high.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Six pairs of NE213 liquid scintillation
           detectors surrounded the central deuterated active
           target detector. Side detectors scintillator diameter
           was 12.7cm and thickness of either 5.1 or 6.1 cm.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF,PSD) For each elastic scattering event a
           coincidence between central detector and side
           detector was required. Analysing power was determined
           from the asymmetry between the left and right
           detectors. In order to cancel instrumental asymmetries,
           the ion source flipped the deuteron spin orientation
           between up and down at a rate of 10 Hz.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,D-D) Polarized neutrons were produced via the
           D(d,n)3He source reaction at 0deg. The deuteron beam
           current reaching the gas cell was typically 1.1 mu-A
           and the energy spread was +-0.28 MeV.
           The beam polarization, was monitored with a
           polarimeter constructed of an active gas cell filled
           to 100 atm with a mixture of 95% 4He gas and 5% xenon
           gas, and two neutron side detectors placed at theta
           lab 112 deg.
