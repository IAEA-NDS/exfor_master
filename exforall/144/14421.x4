INSTITUTE  (1USARPI,1USAKAP,1USAORL)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,92,024601,2015)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USARPI)
SAMPLE     (42-MO-95,ENR=0.965) Cylinder sample with diameter
           5.01 cm and nominal thickness of 0.381 cm, 0.03857 +-
           0.00007 95Mo atoms/barn with total weight of 127.96 g
           in Al case.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)6Li-glass scintillation detector with total
           area of 910 cm2 and thickness of 1.27 cm. Glass
           surface was perpendicular to neutron beam.
           Detector consisting of 4 identical rectangular
           segments was read out using 8 photomultipliers,
           located out of neutron beam. Detector was placed at
           the distance of 88 m from the Mo sample
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutrons were produced by 55 MeV electron
           beam impinging on tantalum target. Repetition frequency
           was 225 Hz and pulse width 12 ns. Water moderator
           with diameter of 22.54 cm and thickness of 2.54 cm
           was used. Nominal beam power was 1200 W.
METHOD     (TRN,TOF) Transmission method was used to determine
                      total cross sections.
CORRECTION Data corrected for dead time (< 5%) and for
           transmission enhancement of the energy-averaged
           transmission.
