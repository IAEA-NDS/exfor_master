TITLE      Measurement of the 209Bi(n,4n)206Bi and
           169Tm(n,3n)167Tm cross sections between 23.5 and 30.5
           MeV relevant to reaction-in-flight neutron studies at

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL)The measurements were performed using
           the 10 MV FN tandem Van De Graaff accelerator at the
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory
SAMPLE     The bismuth targets were 0.9525mm in diameter and 1mm
           thick, while the thulium foils were the same diameter
           but 0.1 mm thick. The foils were stacked (Tm/Bi) and
           placed approx. 16 mm from the outer flange of the
           gas-cell assembly, with the thulium foil nearest the
           neutron production target. Following foils were used
           in measurement

DETECTOR   (HPGE)After irradiation, the foils were mounted in
           front of lead-shielded high-purity germanium (HPGe)
           detectors for gamma-ray counting for approx. 24 h. The
           bismuth foils were counted at 2.5 cm from the face of
           one HPGe detector, while the Tm foils were counted at
           5 cm on a separate, but nearly identical, HPGe
           detector.
           (HPGE)Due to the long half-life of the reference
           reaction used (31.55 yr), the bismuth samples were
           returned to LANL and counted on the Compton
           suppressed dual-clover HPGe detector system, which
           has significantly higher efficiency than the other
           HPGe detectors.

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Quasimonoenergetic neutrons were produced with
           the 3H(d,n)4He reaction. Accelerated deuterons were
           incident onto a neutron production target consisting
           of 2.1 Ci tritium absorbed onto a 19 mm diameter
           deposit of titanium on a 0.4 mm thick Cu backing.
           Neutron energy was measured using neutron
           time-of-flight. Neutron spectrum showed main peak and
           a group of low energy off-energy neutrons.
CORRECTION Corrected for contribution of off-energy neutrons.
           Corrections ranged from 0.1% for 23 MeV neutrons and
           almost 50% for 30 MeV neutrons
