FACILITY   (CRASS,1USALRL) The samples were irradiated in the
           Godiva critical assembly at the Nevada National
           Security Site.The assembly was operated in burst mode
           to minimize the effects of isotope grow-in and decay
           during irradiation.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9944) Two small samples of enriched
           235U in oxide form were sealed in quartz ampules to
           contain fission product gasses after irradiation.
           Masses of two samples were 8.6+-0.65 mg and
                                        63+-7.2 mg
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Detector setup consisted of two broad-energy
           germanium (BEGe) detectors each with approximately
           65 % relative efficiency.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used
MONITOR    High purity wires of Fe, Ti, Au and Co were
           used to determine neutron flux at the saample)
INC-SOURCE Critical 235U assembly.
CORRECTION Data corrected for - dead time
