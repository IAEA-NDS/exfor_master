COMMENT    -By authors:. The production yield is defined here as
           the measured intensity of the mass-separated beams in
           the collector tank. The yields were determined by
           in-beam beta-decay measurements at saturation for the
           very short-lived products. For the long-lived products,
           collection ans successive singles counting or
           multiscaling of the beta activity were used in order to
           determine the correct component from the complex decay
           curves. The most abundant radioactive ion beams were
           measured directly in a faraday cup. In order to average
           short-time variation in the bombarding particle flux
           and in the separation and detector efficiency, it was
           found necessary to determine the intensity ratio
           between two adjacent masses rather than the absolute
           value. See entry o0515.

REACTION   (82-PB-0(HE3,F)ELEM/MASS,,PY,,REL)   Figure 18.
SAMPLE     Molten lead,thickness 170 g/cm**2, was used.
DETECTOR   (D4PI).A 4-pi plastic scintillator to count beta-
            particle.  It was used to measure yield of masses
            186-205
           (SIBAR).Silicon surface barrier detectors for the
            detection of alpha-particles. It was used to measure
            yield of masses 177-185.
