FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) Two cyclotron were used:
           1. Compact cyclotron CV-28 (20.5 MeV)
           2. Injector of the Cooler Synchrotron (45.5 MeV)
METHOD     (STTA) Each stack containing a number of samples as
           well as 10 mumeters thick copper and 20 mumeters thick
           titanium foils for monitoring proton flux and degradati
           on of proton energy.
           (ACTIV) The time of irradiation was 30 min and the beam
           current about 100 nanoampere.

HISTORY    (20000325C)
           (20040416A) First subentry is corrected. Update.
           (20040419U) Last checking has been done.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in the proton beam
           current was estimated to be 13%.  The uncertainty in
           counting statistics and peak area analysis was 5%,
           detector efficiency uncertainty was estimated to be
           5%,  chemical yield uncertainty was estimated to be 5%,
           target thickness -2 %.
           All the uncertainties were combined in quadrature.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty is given in authors' tables.
           The energy scale error was estimated to be +/- 0.2 MeV
           at the primary proton energy, increasing up to +/- 0.6
           MeV along the degradation due to the error propagation.

REACTION   (30-ZN-70(P,A)29-CU-67,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Enriched Zn-70 on gold foil. Isotopic composition:
           Zn-64 - 5.83%, Zn-66 - 3.78%, Zn-67 - 0.71%,
           Zn-68 - 4.65%, Zn-70 - 85.03%
DECAY-DATA (29-CU-67,61.9HR,DG,184.6,0.487)
COMMENT    - By authors - to confirm that no Ga-67 was present in
           the separated sample, the 300.2 KeV gamma-ray was
           carefully checked.  Its intensity in the Ga-67 decay
           is 16.7%, but in Cu-67 decay only 0.8%.
