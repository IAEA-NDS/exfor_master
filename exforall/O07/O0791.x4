SAMPLE     A Metallic Foil of Pb-208,Enriched to 99.9%, were Used.
           A Target Foil of 8.3 Mg/Cm**2 Thickness was Prepared by
           Electrodeposition. A Thicker One Used For the Life-Time
           Measurement at 44 MeV was Made by Rolling and was
            12.8 Mg/Cm**2 Thick.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The Ge(LI) Detector Used was 40 Cm**3 in
           Effective Volume.  The Energy Resolution was 2.5-KeV
            (FWHM) At 1.33-MeV.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2JPNTOK)
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) The Average Beam Current was About 1 Na.
           (EDEG) The Incident Proton Energy was Adjusted by
           Carbon Plate Absorber.

COMMENT    - By Authors - The Delayed 802.9 KeV Gamma-Rays Counted
           For 0.299 Ms Starting 0.053 Ms After the End of the
           Beam Pulse.  The Prompt Gamma-Rays have Completely
           Decayed Out Earlier Than 0.053 Ms.  The Cross Section
           For Formation of the 0.12 Ms 7- Isomer at 2.2 MeV in
           Pb-206 was Calculated from the Intensity of the 802.9
           KeV Gamma-Rays.
