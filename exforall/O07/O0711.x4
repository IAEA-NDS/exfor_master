SAMPLE     Thin Target U-238 were Used. The Average Thickness was
           To be 6.42+/- 0.27 E+17 nuc/cm**2.  Target Thickness
           Was Measured Before Begin of the Experiment by Alpha
           Spectroscopic Methods.  After End of Experiment the
           Thickness was Measured by Spectrophotometric Method.
