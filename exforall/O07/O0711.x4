SAMPLE     Thin target U-238 were used. The average thickness was
           to be (6.42+/- 0.27) x 10**17 nucl/cm**2. The number of
           nuclei in the beam path in the thin uranium target was
           found by the method of alpha spectroscopy before the
           beginning of the experiment and by spectrophotometry
           after completion of the experiment.
