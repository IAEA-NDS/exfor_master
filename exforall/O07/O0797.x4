INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Radio-frequency source. To measure polarization
           of the beam elastic scattering on He-4 and C-12 was
           used.
SAMPLE     The liquid hydrogen target was cooled to 15.7 K. The
           target was operated at a pressure of 0.2 bar.  The low
           target pressure allowed us to use Havar windows only
           2-5 mumeter thick.  The energy loss of the deuterons in
           the target was 0.39 MeV, leading to a mean deuteron
           energy of 44.56 MeV at the target center. The target
           thickness has heen chosen as thin as possible to keep
           the multiple scattering of the product 3-He small.
PART-DET   (G,HE3)
DETECTOR   (CSICR,NAICR) Photons, with energies of 17 to 23 MeV,
           were detected by four large CsI(pure)/ NaI(Tl)
           cylindrical crystal detectors (20 X 20 cm) mounted at
           several angles around the scattering chamber cit a
           distance of 80 cm from the target  center.   Csl(pure),
           though producing less light than nal(Ti), has a
           considerably shorter pulse duration, hence it
           significantly improves the time-of-flight rejection of
           background.
           (SCIN) The He-3 nuclei were detected using two very
           thin plastic detectors made out of Pilot-U
           scintillation plastic.  This material was chosen
           because of its short pulse fall time to reduce pileup.
           To discriminate against the elastically scattered
           deuterons the plastic detectors were just thick enough
           to stop the He-3 ions, but not the deuterons.
