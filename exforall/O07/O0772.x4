SAMPLE     Isotopically Enriched W-186, 99.79% was Used. The
           W-186-O(3) Was Pressed Into a Pellet, 10 or 13 mm,
           At 680 Kg/Cm**2, Then Baked in Air at 900 Degree For 24
           Hour.
ADD-RES    (THEO).The Alice Code was Used Without Incorporating
           Precompound Nuclear Emission to Estimate the Features
           Of the 186-W(P,A)183-Ta Excitation Function.
COMMENT    - By Authors -.The Radiochemical Yield of Ta-183 After
           Separation of the Re-186 Radionuclide from the W-186
           Target Ranged from 90 to 95%. The Ta-183 was Assayed
           After the W-187 had Decayed. The Ta-183 Could be
           Separated from W with the Highly Selective
           Chromatographic Separation Utilized For the
           W-178/Ta-178 Generator.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A Ge Detector Having a Resolution of 0.7 KeV
           For 122-KeV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNJAE) The Tiara Cyclotron.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           (ACTIV) Irradiaton Time 3 - 9.8 Hours.

SAMPLE     W-186-O(3) Targets of 550-729 Mg/Cm**2 Thickness,were
           Used.
COMMENT    - By Authors - The Thick Target Production Yields were
           Determined from Four Irradiation Tungsten Oxide Targets
           Of 550-729 Mgramm/Cm**2.
           The Experimental Variation in Ta-183 Yields is Probably
           Due to Uncertainty in the Measurement of the Proton
           Fluxes Since a Monitor Nuclear Reaction was not Used
           During the Radioisotope Production Runs, Variations in
           Energy Spread of 0.5% Fwhm in the Incident 20 MeV Beam
           Energy and the Degradation of Beam in the Al-Absorbers.
STATUS     (TABLE) In Text of the Paper.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The Uncertainty is Reported by Authors.
           (EN-ERR). Proton Beam Energy Uncertainty.
