SAMPLE     The gas cell had a 4 cm diameter, a 20 cm length, and
           an entrance window consisting of a 5 mumeters thick Ni
           foil, which could sustain a 4He gas pressure of 150
           mbar (cleanliness of the 4He gas = 99.9999%).
PART-DET   (N)
DETECTOR   (D4PI)The neutron detection was carried out with a 4-pi
           detector consisting of 12 3He-filled proportional
           counters embedded in a polyethylene moderator.
           The detector efficiency was adopted according to MONTE
           CARLO calculations.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYLNS) 15 MV tandem provided a 7-Li beam of
            Elab = 24.6 MeV with a current of about 100 pnA.
METHOD     (SITA) See SAMPLE
           (EXTB) The beam was focused onto a deuterium solid
           target, where 8-Li nuclides were produced via the
           reaction D(7Li,p)8Li.
           The 8-Li nuclides were then momentum-filtered from the
           intense 7-Li primary beam by a magnet and focused onto
           a 4-He gas cell.
           (PLSED) The neutrons were moderated and adsorbed in the
           detector with an adsorbed "die-away" time of 86 +/- 2
           microseconds.

COMMENT    - By authors.  The present work with an enhancement
           factor of 12 compared to the results of the inverse
           reaction strengthens the calculations of inhomogeneous
            Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
