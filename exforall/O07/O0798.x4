SAMPLE     A 35.0 mg/cm2 CD2 target. Since previous test runs
           have indicated that deuterium vanishes during
           measurements, the deuterium content of the CD2 target
           was continously monitored during the runs by a
           deuterium monitor. However, the observed deuterium
           deterioration was small, in fact less than the
           uncertainty in target thickness.
REL-REF    (I,,B.Hoeistad+,J,NIM/A,295,172,1990) A comprehensive
           description of PACMAN spectrometer.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2SWDUPP) Gustav Werner cyclotron.
METHOD     (EXTB) The beam was focused to a 5 mm diam. beam spot.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The experimental set-up consists of ihe magnetic
           pair spectrometer PACMAN, a beam monitoring system
           including two threefold scintillation telescopes aimed
           at the target and two ion chambers placed in the beam
           behind the scattering chamber.
COMMENT    -By authors.  The electron-positron pair resulting from
           the virtual photon enter the spectrometer directly
           while the real photons are converted into
           electron-positron pairs in a 12 X 20.6 cm2 converter
           foil located in the fringe field, 58.5 cm from the
           target.  The magnetic field bends the electron and
           positron pair 180 degr., where they reach the
           detectors that give the event trigger and the track
           coordinates.  The detectors are arranged in two
           identical groups that are positioned symmetrically
           above and below the scattering centre.  Each detector
           group consists of three drift chamber packages and
           three planes of trigger scintillators, where each
           scintillator plane consists of four separate detectors.
           An event trigger is generated by a simultaneous signal
           in all three scintillator planes above and below the
           scattering centre. The measurement of the (p,e+e-)
           reaction cross section is made by simply removing the
           converter at the spectrometer entrance.
