SAMPLE     The Target Assembly Consisted Essentially of a 1 mm
           Platinum foil target, plated on one side with a narrow
           strip of fissionable material about 0.4 mg/cm**2 thick
           and placed at the center of a 3.5-Inch. radius
           semicircle, Along the circumference of which is placed
           a 1 mm aluminium foil.
           After the bombardment,the foil is removed and cut into
           several pieces and each piece is radiochemically
           processed for various fission products.
