ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY) The Measurements were Repeated Several Times
           To Follow Decay of the Radioactive Products and Thereby
           To Identify the Possible Interferring Nuckides.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) Two Julich Cyclotrons were Used:
           1. Compact Cyclotron Cv-28,
           2. Injector of Cooler Synchrotron.
           (ISOCY,2BLGLVN) Cyclone.
METHOD     (STTA) A Total of Five Stacks, Each Consisting of Four
           To Six Samples of Mo-100 and About the Same Number of
           Trioxide of Mo-98, As Well As Several Copper Monitor
           Foils and Some Copper and Aluminium Foils As Energy
           Degraders.

           (EXTB)
           (BCINT) At the Two Cyclotrons in Julich the Beam
           Current was Measured Also Via a Faraday Cup Within an
           Uncertainty of About 10%. The Twoindependent
           Measurements Agreed Within the Limits of Errors.
HISTORY    (20000320C)
           (20000328U) Last checking has been done.
           (20000427A) DATE is corrected
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Total Uncertainty in the Proton Beam
           Current was Estimated to be 5-12%. The Uncertainty in
           The Peak Area Analysis was < 5%, Detector Efficiency
           Uncertainty was Estimated to be <5%.  The Uncertainty
           Of Target Thickness was <2%.
           All the Uncertainties were Combined in Quadrature.
           (EN-ERR) The Uncertainty is Given in Authors' Tables.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C)
CORRECTION Correction For Interfering Processes were Included.
           Correction For Random Pile-Up and Coincidence Loss were
           Negligible.
