SAMPLE     Three Circular Targets of Natural Ti, 73.94% Ti-48,
           Were Used.For the Boron Measurements a Boron Carbide
           Target was Used.The Mass and Area of Each Target were
           Measured and Areal Densities were Determined to an
           Accuracy of About 2%.
CORRECTION *by Authors* Elastic Correction, Charge Particle
           Reaction Products, Large Angle Correction and Small
           Angle Correction, Correction For Reactions in the
           Stopping Detector, Correction For Reaction in Light
           Giude were Made.

DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) The Stopping Detector Telescope,
           Composed of the Small Plastic Disc Detector and the
           CsI(Na) Stopping Detector
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANMNA) 50-MeV Sector Focused Cyclotron.
METHOD     (SITA)
ERR-ANALYS (MISC-ERR).'Misc' Uncertainty.
           (ERR-1) The Uncertainty of Target Thickness.
           (ERR-T) The Uncertainties Associated with the
           Uncorrected Cross Sections are Due to the Statistical
           Fluctuations in the Measurements of the Reaction Rates
           With Target-In and Target-Out, and the Error Associated
           With the Measurements of the Target Thickness.
           Reproducibility of the Data was Checked by Taking Three
           Measurements For Each Target at Every Energy During the
           Experiment.  The Corrections to Uncorrected Sigma were
           Calculated and the Total Error in Sigma Obtained  by
           Adding All Errors in Quadrature.

SAMPLE     Boron Carbide.
COMMENT    - By Authors - The Uncorrected Cross Section For Boron
           Was Calculated Using the Formula:  Uncorrected Cross
           Section= 0.25(S1-S2), Where S1 and S2 are the Corrected
           Values For the Reaction Cross Section of Boron Carbide
           And Carbon, Respectively.
