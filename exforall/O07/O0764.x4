TITLE      Isomeric yield ratios of I-134 and I-136 in the proton,
           C-12 and F-19-induced fission of U-235,Np-237 and
           U-238.

ADD-RES    (COMP).The spin-dependent statistical model.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A coaxial high purity germanium detector with
           an active volume of 92 cm**2 and an energy resolution
           of 1.73 KeV at 1.33-MeV gamma-ray.

METHOD     (CHSEP) An on-line chemical separation system,

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Overall uncertainties of the isomeric yield
           ratios are estimated from the errors propagated through
           the gamma- ray activities measured, the detection
           efficiencies of the detector and half-lives and
           gamma-ray intensities of the iodine nuclides.Because
           the absolute yields of the iodine nuclides were not
           measured, the uncertainties of the amounts of the
           targets do not affect the isomeric yield ratios.
