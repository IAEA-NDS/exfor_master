HISTORY    (20000406C)
           (20021204U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting targets, thickness several Mg/cm**2,
           were used. Thinner targets (used in the measurements of
           internal conversion electrons) were obtained by
           evaporation onto alumimium backings.
           The metallic enriched silver (97% Ag-109) was used.
ADD-RES    (DECAY)
           (STRUC)
           (G-SPC)  The gamma-spectrum and the conversion electron
           spectrum of Cs-123 were observed.  Gamma singles
           spectrum of the Ba-124-->Cs-124-->Xe-124 decay chain
           was reported. Single and coincidence gamma-ray spectra
           of the 4.2 min isomer in Cs-122 was reported.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           (NAICR)
           (MAGSP) A magnetic beta-ray spectrometer for
           measurements the internal conversion electrons.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-300 heavy-ion cyclotron
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV) In the study of short-lived activities a
           pulsed ion beam was used. The activation period and
           repetition rate could be adequately varied within wide
           limits according to the half-lives.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
           (EN-ERR).Data-point reader uncertainty.

           The half-life has been measured by author with accuracy
           +/- 0.2 sec.
COMMENT    - By authors - the identification of observed product
           were made by excitation function measurement.

           the half-life has been measured by authors with
           accuracy +/- 6 sec.
COMMENT    - By compiler - according ENSDF, Cs-122-g has half-life
           of 21.2 sec, Cs-122-m1 - 3.70 min and Cs-122-m2 - 0.36
           sec. Therefore compiler change Cs-122-m1 for Cs-122-g.
