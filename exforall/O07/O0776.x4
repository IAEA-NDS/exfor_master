DETECTOR   (SCIN) The Beam is Defined and Counted Before the
           Target by Two Detectors, Counter and Active Collimator.
           After the Target the Outgoing Particles are Detected by
           A Mosaic (WHELL) Of 19 Counters. The Function of the
           Mosaic is to Identify and to Count the Residual Beam
           And the Elastically Scattered Particles. This 'Wheel'
           Is Made Up of a Central Detector Placed in the Beam
           Surrounded by Two Concentric Rongs of 6 and 12 Counters
           Respectively.  All 21 Detectors are Plastic
           Scintillators Optically Coupled to Fast Phototubes.The
           Atomic Charge of Scattered Particles Detected After the
           Target is Identified by Measuring the Time of Flight
           Between Counter 1 (START) And any Counter of the Mosaic
            (STOP) And the Corresponding Light Output Produced by
           Energy Loss (DEL'TA E) In the Stop Detectors.
