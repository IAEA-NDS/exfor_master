COMMENT    -By authors- the experimental points are not corrected
           for decay according to the actual delay time
           distribution and rrepresent simply the isotopic yields
            (in atoms/s) at the detection position.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.

           g/cm**2, where the amount of uranium constitutes
           approximately 10% of the atoms in the target matrix.
DETECTOR   (D4PI)

           resolution of the decay curves.

COMMENT    -By compiler. According to ENSDF 2.2 seconds activity
           of Br-70 is isomer state activity.  Needed correction
           is included in data table.
