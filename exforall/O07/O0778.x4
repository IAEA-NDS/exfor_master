SAMPLE     Zinc targets of regular thickness, in which the
           deuteron energy loss was of the order of some 100 KeV
           at higher energy, were irradiated.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation of 3 stacks of 6 thin Zn
           targets each, were carried out.

COMMENT    -By authors.  64-Cu emits a single gamma emission at
           1346 KeV with very low intensity of 0.473%.  For
           high Compton background of high-energy gamma-rays of
           66-Ga.  Moreover, the 1346 KeV emission of 64-Cu was
           close to two gamma emissions of 66-Ga at 1333 and 1357
           KeV respectively.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The bad statistics of each measurement was
           improved significantly by the weighted decay fitting
           of the activity.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Any analysis is not given. The uncertainty
           is shown on figure.
