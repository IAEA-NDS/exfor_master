            no-carrier-added 64-Cu and 66-,67-Ga production by
           deuteron induced nuclear reactions on natural zinc
           target, for radiometabolic therapy and for PET.

METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB) Beam intensity:  100 nanoampere,
           irradiation time:  30 min,
           (SITA)
SAMPLE     Natural Zn target, purity:  99.9999%, thickness:  730
           mumeters (total energy absorption).
COMMENT    -By authors. Negligible amounts of Co were identified
           also (probably coming from Zn contaminants!).

SAMPLE     Zinc targets of regular thickness, in which the
           deuteron energy loss was of the order of some 100 KeV
           at higher energy, were irradiated.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation of 3 stacks of 6 thin Zn
           targets each, were carried out.

COMMENT    -By authors.  64-Cu emits a single gamma emission at
           1346 KeV with very low intensity of 0.473%.  For
           high Compton background of high-energy gamma-rays of
           66-Ga.  Moreover, the 1346 KeV emission of 64-Cu was
           close to two gamma emissions of 66-Ga at 1333 and 1357
           KeV respectively.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The bad statistics of each measurement was
           improved significantly by the weighted decay fitting
           of the activity.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Any analysis is not given. The uncertainty
           is shown on figure.
STATUS     (CURVE) By CAJAD.
