SAMPLE     The three Lead foils, 80 mg/cm**2 thickness each, were
           mounted in a stack with three Aluminium foils on each
           side, the middle ones were 10 Mum and the others 30 Mum
           thick.
ADD-RES    (DECAY).Hg-206 Decay Properties were investigated.
           The Half-Life of Hg-206 was determined, Gamma, Beta and
           Conversion Electron Spectra were measured.
DETECTOR   (PROPC).Methane-Flow Proportional Counter For Beta
           Measurements.
           (NAICR).A 7.6 cm*7.6 cm NaI(Tl) Crystal For Gamma
           Spectra.
           (GELI).A 30 cm**3 Coaxial Ge(Li) Detector For Gamma
           Spectra.
           (SILI).A 15.2 cm*10.2 cm NaI(Tl) Crystal in Combination
           With a 5 mm Si(LI) Detector For Beta-Gamma Coincidence
           Measurements.
           (NAICR).Two 3.8 cm NaI(Tl) Crystal For Gamma-Gamma
           Coincidence Measurements.
           (SILI).A Si(LI) Detector with an Area of 50 mm**2
            (2 MM THICK) For Conversion Electrons.
ERR-ANALYS The Overall Yield For the Different Experiments
           Corrected For Losses by Decay was 0.1-0.2%.
