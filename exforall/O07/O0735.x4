SAMPLE     The Four 15.0 Mg/Cm**2 Uranium-238 Target were Used.
           A Curved Foil is Used to Separate the Targets from the
           Stopping Volume.The O.9 Mg/Cm**2 Ni-Foil Around the
           Four Uranium Targets Shields the Beam Produced Plasma
           From the External Gas Volume Used to Thermalize and
           Transport Radioactive Ions.Helium As a Transport Gas
           Enters from the Left and Exits with Ions to the Right
           Was Used.
ADD-RES    (COMP).A Monte Carlo Method.
COMMENT    /by Authors/. The Measured Effective Delay Time
           Distribution Shows That the Fission Ion Duide is Also
           Well Applicable to Separation of Activities with Ms
           Half-Lives.This is Further Confirmed by the Observation
           Of the 18(2) Ms Pd-117-M Isomeric State Directly
           Populated in Fission.
           The Main Reason For the Low Efficiency of About 10E-03
           Results from the Inadequate Stopping of Fission
           Fragments in a Low Pressure (100 MBAR) Helium.At this
           Pressure Diffusion is Observed to be the Dominant
           Mechanism of Loss of Thermalized Ions.At Higher
           Pressures and with the Presence of Strongly Ionizing
           Beam Particles, Such As Heavy Ions, Recombination is
           Expected to Lead to Severe Losses.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)
DETECTOR   Gamma Detectors were Used.Another Information is
           Absent.
METHOD     (OLMS) The on-Line Mass Separator Igisol, Which is
           Based on the Thermalization of Fission Fragments in
           High Pressure Gas As Singly Charged Ions.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Cumulative Yield of the Given Rh-
           Isotopes were Extracted from the Saturation Activities
           By Correcting For the Absolute Efficiency of the Gamma-
           Detectors As Well As For the Branching Ratios.
