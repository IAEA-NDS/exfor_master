           Reference data for Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction at proton
           energy at 1.985 MeV. The data were used to determine
           number of Li-7 nuclei in used targets.
DECAY-DATA (4-BE-7,53.29D,DG,478.,0.1052)
SAMPLE     Circular targets of Li-F of 2 mm diameter, evaporated
           on Al and Pt foils.  A liquid nitrogen cold cryofinger
           is placed close to the target area to protect the
           target surface from contamination.  The vacuum in the
           chamber was 8.E-7 Torr.
METHOD     (EXTB) A deutron beam (D2+) was raster scanned over a
           rectangle of 7 mm X 6 mm.  The purpose of the scan is
           to obtain a beam of uniform areal density.
           (BCINT)
           (ACTIV) The time sequence of the complete cycle is:
           1.  1.5 s beam-on-target;
           2.  100 ms rotation;
           3.  1.5 s of target in the counting position;
           4.  100 ms rotation.
PART-DET   (A) Delayed alphas following the beta-decay of Li-8.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A 40 micron surface barrier detector.
           The detector was surrounded by a shroud to prevent
           scattered beam panicles from reaching the detector.
FACILITY   (VDG,3ISLWZI) 3 MV accelrator.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty of final result is determined
           by uncertainties:
           (ERR-1) Of monitor cross section,
           (ERR-2) Absolute efficiency of gamma counting,
           (ERR-3) Systematic error in gamma counting,
           (ERR-4) Statistic of gamma counting. There is, in
           addition, a 1% systematic error in the gamma counting
           due to uncertainty in the background subtraction
           procedure.
           (ERR-5) Statistic of alpha counting,
           (ERR-6) Solid angle of alpha detector,
           (ERR-7) Gamma branch for Be-7  decay,
           (ERR-8) Timing of the rotation cycle.
CORRECTION On backscattering of product nuclei.

COMMENT    -  By  authors.  As the final result we have adopted an
           average of the two aluminum-backed targets believed to
           be free from backscattering loss.
ERR-ANALYS (MONIT-ERR) The uncertainty is given by authors.
