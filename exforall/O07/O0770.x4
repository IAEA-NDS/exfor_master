FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV) A 40.1-MeV proton beam of the K-130
           Cyclotron for the thin target.
           (CYCLO,2SF ABA) A 17-MeV proton beam 103-Cm Avf
           Cyclotron for the thick targets.
SAMPLE     Targets of neptunium oxide (NpO(2)) were prepared by
           multiple thermal decomposition of neptunium nitrate
           cellulose painted on 10 mum and 50 mum thick aluminum
           backings. The average thickness of the Np-237O(2) layer
           was 120 mug/cm**2 for the thin targets and 2 mg/cm**2
           for the thick targets. The thickness variations were
           within 3% for both types of targets.  The average
           thicknesses were determined by weighing.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The alpha-activity of Pu-236 was measured with
           surface-barrier silicon detectors with sensitive areas
           of 200-mm**2 and an energy resolution of 30-keV at
            5767-keV.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current on the thin target was
           approximatelly 1 muA.  For the thick target the beam
           current was 7 muA.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation time was about 5 hours for thin
           target and 10 hours for thick target.
           (CHSEP)
           (STTA) Eight pairs of 237-Np oxide targets of 120 mu-g
           and aluminium foils of different thicknesses were
           mounted in a multiple target system.
