TITLE      Activation cross sections for proton-induced reactions
           on calcium isotopes up to 5.6-MeV.

HISTORY    (20050203C)
           (20050217U) Last checking has been done.
SAMPLE     Enriched isotopes of calcium were obtained.
           The targets of calcium fluoride in which the calcium
           was either of natural isotopic composition or enriched
           in a particular isotope were prepared by distilling the
           heated material in vacuum onto tantalum discs, 0.25-mm
           thick. The thickness of each target was determined by
           weighing. The uniformity of the target was determined
           by autoradiography.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 20-cm**3 Ge(Li)-detector.
           (NAICR) The detectors were shielded from beta-particles
           and bremsstrahlung radiation.
FACILITY   (VDG,3SAFSUN)
METHOD     (SITA) Up to 12 sample discs could be mounted on a
           rotating sample holder, which rotated at about 100
           rev/minute.
           (EDEG) Aluminium foils of different thicknesses were
           placed in front of each target thereby enabling data
           to be obtained simultaneously at 12 different proton
           energies.  The results were useful to obtain cross
           section values.
           (EXTB) Proton beams of between 1 and 10 microampreres.
           (ACTIV) Irradiation and cooling times are not given.
           (BCINT) Accurate flux measyrements were obtained when
           single targets were irradiated in a  Faraday cup at
           different bombarding energies.
COMMENT    -By  authors.  Sets of relative cross sections obtained
           from the multiple irradiations were normalized to all
           the absolute values obtained from the single
           irradiations.
ANALYSIS   (AREA,DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Each error value listed in the table is the
           root mean square error calculated from all the relevant
           experimental conditions pertaining to the measurement.
           The errors includes:
           (ERR-1) The relative accuracy of the absolute
           calibration of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-2) The error in determining of average thickness.
           (ERR-3) The thickness variations.
           Statistical uncertainties of the number of events
           counted and the relative importance of the subtracted
           background.
           (EN-ERR). The uncertainty in the energy of the proton
           beam. For targets of 200-mug/cm**2 the energy spread
           within the target would be +-11-KeV at 2-MeV and
            +-5-KeV at 5.5-MeV, which is negligible.
