SAMPLE     The Uranium foils of normal isotopic distribution
           having a superficial density of about 140 mg/cm**2.
           Prior to irradiation the Uranium target foil was
           cleaned with nitric acid to remove the oxide layer.The
           foils was then sandwiched between two similarly treated
           foils to compensate for recoil losses.A Copper monitor
           foil (21.44 MG/CM**2), similarly guarded with two other
           Copper foils, was properly aligned with the target
           stack.

MONITOR    ((MONIT)29-CU-65(P,X)29-CU-64,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A Low-Background B- Proportional Counter with
           A Background of Less Than 1 Count Per Minute. The
           Efficiency of the Beta Counter was Obtained For All
           Nuclides, Except Fo Ga-68 and Ga-70, by Calibration
           Against a 4-Pi Counter. The Efficiency For Ga-68 and
           Ga-70 was Taken to be the Same As That Ga-73.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
           (ACTIV) Irradiation Time Varied from 2-Min. To 60 Min.,
           Depending on the Activity and Bombarding Energy
           Desired.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS The limits shown in the Cross Section values determined
           in the present work were compounded from the
           uncertainties in the Decay Curve analysis,
           determination of Chemical Yields, Target Thicknesses
           And Counter Efficiencies and were estimated to be 20%
           for Ni-66, Cu-67, Zn-72, Ga-72 and Ga-73. Because of
           the large uncertainty in the determination of the
           activities of Ga-68 and Ga-70, no limits have been
           quoted for these nuclides.  Cross Sections for Ga-68
           and Ga-70 appear to be relatively high.  Because of the
           short half-Lives these have been obtained by quick
           chemical separation of Gallium samples, probably
           without sufficient purification and these discrepancies
           are undoubtedly due to the presence of interfering
           nuclides.

COMMENT    - By Authors - Ga-73 Decays (100%) To the Isomeric
           State of Ge-73.  This Isomeric Transition is Highly
           Internally Converted (~100%) And these Conversion
           Electrons would Also be Detected Along with the
           Activities of the Ga Isotopes to a Varying Degree
           Depending on the Thickness of the Sources.
           In Order to Stop All Conversion Electrons Uniformly For
           All Sources, the Same 200 mg/cm**2 Thick Aluminum
           Absorber was Used While the Activities of Gallium
           Isotopes were Measured.
           - By Compiler - According to ENSDF-99, Ge-73 has not an
           Isomeric State.
