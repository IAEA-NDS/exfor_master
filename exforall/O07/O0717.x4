SAMPLE     The target,a Uranium filament with a diameter of 0.13mm
           was adjusted by optical means at the centre of a
           cylinder (R=65 mm). The target can be moved in two
           perpendicular directions at the two points where it
           was fastened to the cylinder.
           The fragments emitted from the target were collected in
           TEN polyethylene foils mounted around the cylinder.
           The thickness of the catcher foils was 9.2 mg/cm**2,
           that is a few times the maximum range of fission
           fragments. By adding a second foil behind each catcher
           foil, it was checked that the only activity produced
           in the plastic foils is C-11.

METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV). All activities followed for at least 20 hours.
           C-11 formed was allowed to decay before the foils were
           counted.
CORRECTION Correction on Centre-Of-Mass System motion were
           included.  It is assumed that the preferred direction
           of the Centre-Of-Mass motion is in the direction of the
           incident protons and further that the angular
           distribution is symmetric about 90 degrees in the
           Centre-Of-Mass System.

           Experiments.
PART-DET   (FF)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T). The Error is the Mean Deviation.
           The Considerable Spread of Values is Due to the Poor
           Counting Statistics and Probably Also to the Very
           Different Duration of Bombardments, from About 2 to 13
           Hours, Which Gives Different Composition of the
           Activity. Comment by the Authors.
