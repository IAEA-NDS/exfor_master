SAMPLE     The 55Mn and 51V targets of thickness ~500 +/-10 ug/cm2
            and ~600 +/-13 ug/cm2 respectively.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two silicon surface barrier
           telescopes, T1 and T2, were positioned at 20 degree
           and 30 degree relative to the beam direction to
           detect particle-like fragments. The delta E and E
           detectors in both telescopes had thicknesses of 100 um
           and 2000 um, respectively.
           (TELES,SISD,SISD) Two silicon strip telescopes (S1, S2)
           at 125 degree and 155 degree were used to detect
           evaporated particles, with delta E detector of
           thicknesses 57 um and 58 um, and E detector of
           thicknesses 1550 um and 1556 um, respectively.
