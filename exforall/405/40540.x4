            Neutron fluence at the sample position ~3.E+14 n/cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method, chemical separation
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation detector was used for beta-
           detection and golden foils were used for fluence
           measurement
ANALYSIS   Least-square method for cross-section determination
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,TOT),,SIG,,FIS)
            Effective activation cross section for Au was used
            for neutron flux

REACTION   (94-PU-242(N,G)94-PU-243,,SIG,,FIS)
SAMPLE     PLutonium film on platinum, Pu-242 content is
           99.7 per-cent
DECAY-DATA (94-PU-243,4.958HR,B-) Half-life for beta- decay was
           measured also in the experiment to be 5.1+-0.2 hr,
           stable final nucleus is Am-243.
COMMENT    Cross-section was measured for fast-reactor neutron
           spectrum which is similar to fission-spectrum
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of error is not explained in article.
