SAMPLE     PLUTONIUM FILM ON PLATINUM, PU-242 CONTENT IS
           99.7 PER-CENT
HALF-LIFE  (HL,94-PU-243) HALF-LIFE FOR BETA- DECAY WAS MEASURED
           IN THE EXPERIMENT, STABLE FINAL NUCLEUS IS AM-243
COMMENT    CROSS-SECTION WAS MEASURED FOR FAST-REACTOR NEUTRON
           SPECTRUM WICH IS SIMILAR TO FISSION-SPECTRUM
