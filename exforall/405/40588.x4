CORRECTION  Corrections on multiple scattering and background
            were made
            For neutron attenuation in sample.
STATUS     (APRVD) Murzin, 1982-12-09
COMMENT     Of compiler. M.M. 2006.06.06.
            - In text of reference the c-s data values are
             7.54 +- 0.17 b for U-233,
             6.19 +- 0.12 b for U-235.
            But STATUS is APRVD of author 1982.12.09.
            Probably, data were revised by the author.
           - There are values of systematical uncertainties in
           INDC(CCP)-118,(2),252,1977, Table 1, 2 ;
           they were not inserted in this Entry, because data were
           probably revised by authors and uncertainties values
           could been changed after revision.
