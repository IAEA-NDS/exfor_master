           (P-T)   FOR NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE 0.024-0.320 MEV
                   WERE USED.
           (D-D)   DEUTERON-DEITERIUM REACTION FOR NEUTRON ENERGY
                   RANGE 0.320-7.4 MEV WAS USED.
SAMPLE     PU-239 TARGET CONTAINES 99.891 PER-CENT OF PU-239,
           0.109 PER-CENT OF PU-240.
           U-235 TARGET  CONTAINS 99.9955 PER-CENT OF U-235,
           0.0010 PER-CENT OF U-234,0.0035 PER-CENT OF U-236
           AND LESS 0.0005 PER-CENT OF U-238.
           IN MEASUREMENTS BY MEANS OF GLASS DETECTORS
           U-235 TARGET  CONTAINS 91.2326 PER-CENT OF U-235,
           1.1003 PER-CENT OF U-234,0.0036 PER-CENT OF U-236,
           7.6635 PER-CENT OF U-238.
CORRECTION IN MEASUREMENTS WITH GLASS DETECTORS FOLLOWING
           CORRECTIONS WERE INTRODUCED
           1.DIFFERENCE OF NEUTRON FLUX IN PU-239,U-235 TARGETS,
           2.CORRECTION ON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF FISSION
             FRAGMENTS,
           3.CORRECTION FOR FISSION OF DIFFERENT ISOTOPES,
           4.BACKGROUND OF NEUTRONS OF EXPERIMENTAL ROOM  AND
             SCATTERING ON TARGET CONSTRUCTION,
           5.BACKGROUND OF NEUTRONS ASSOCIATING (P-N) REACTION.
ERR-ANALYS IN DATA TABLES A TOTAL ERROR IS REPRESENTED AND
           IT IS DETERMINED  BY MEAN-SQUARE ERROR,CONSISTING
           OF FOLLOWING VALUES
           1.ERROR THE ENERGETIC DEPENDENCE OF FISSION CROSS
             SECTION RATIO FOR PU-239 AND U-235 (0.5-1.5 PER-CENT)
           2.AVERAGE ERROR OF ABSOLUTE VALUE,OBTAINED BY GLASS
             METHOD (1.3 PER-CENT),
           3.ERROR OF NORMALIZATION ON ABSOLUTE VALUES OF FISSION
             CROSS-SECTION RATIO (0.22 PER-CENT),
           4.ERROR AT THE FISSION THE OTHER ISOTORES (0.1PER-CENT)
           5.ERROR OF BACKGROUND THE ASSOCIATING (D-N) REACTIONS
             (0.54 PER-CENT),
           6.ERROR OF REGISTRATION EFFICIENCY BY FISSION CHAMBER
             (0.3 PER-CENT).
ANALYSIS   CALIBRATION OF ENERGETIC DEPENDENCE THE FISSION CROSS
           SECTION RATIO BY MEANS OF GLASS METHOD WAS MADE.
           QUANTITY OF FISSIBLE NUCLEI WAS DEFINED BY TWO METHODS
           NAMELY BY MEANS OF ALPHA-ACTIVITY OF TARGETS AND
           BY MEASUREMENTS IN THERMAL COLUMN OF REACTOR.
