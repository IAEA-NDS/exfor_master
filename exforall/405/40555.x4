TITLE      Prompt neutrons angular spectra for Cf-252 ternary
           fission
SAMPLE      Sample of Cf-252 (diameter is 5. mm) on Al backing of
           3 mg/cm**2 thickness.
METHOD     (TOF)  Base is 80. cm
DETECTOR    Layer of Zn - S(Ag) for alpha-particles and fission
            fragments . Layer diameter 7 mm. Placed on FEU-36
           photomultiplier - for FFs, FEU-97 - for alphas.

           (19840518U) EN-DUMMY introduced
           (20130227A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           BIB information was updated.
           Authors' names were corrected.
           INC-SOURCE, INC-SPECT were deleted - data for
           spontaneous fission.
