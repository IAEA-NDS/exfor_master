           The 238U/235U atom number ratios were determined by
            four calibrations (B/A, C/A, D/A and E/A) by
            irradiation of slow neutrons from Li(p,n) and T(p,n)
METHOD     Threshold method for absolute measurement.
           Measurements were performed twice with Li(p,n) and
            T(p,n) sources at each of four calibration energies.
