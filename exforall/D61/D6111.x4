SAMPLE     A target with WO3 of oxygen content equivalent of 36.2
           ug/cm**2 was used. The WO3 film was sandwiched between
           the Au film of 230 ug/cm**2 as a backing and
           50 ug/cm**2 layer on the other side.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)Two deltaE-E detector telescopes
           were placed coplanar on either side of the beam
           direction at 41. deg and 45. deg. The solid angles of
           the monitor and the telescope detectors were 24.24
           microSr and 4.42 mSr, respectively.
           (SI)A monitor detector was also placed at 16. deg
METHOD     (COINC)The two 12C particles were detected in
           coincidence. A start signal for the time-to-amplitude
           convertor is provided from one of the E detectors and
           the stop signal is provided by the other E detector.
           The data were recorded in an event by event mode.
INC-SOURCE C-12. 118.8 MeV beam of current 2.5 pnA
ANALYSIS   The data were analyzed in the off-line mode. In the
           summed energy spectrum two prominent broad peaks marked
           by arrows separated by ~ 4 MeV, are identified. The
           higher (E1 + E2) peak corresponds to the two correlated
           12C s emitted in their ground state, and the second
           peak corresponds to the decayed 4.44 MeV excited state
           of one 12C in coincidence with the other 12C in its
           ground state.
