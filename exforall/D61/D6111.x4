TITLE      Heavy cluster knockout reaction 16O(12C,2 12C)4He and
            the nature of the 12C-12C interaction potential

SAMPLE     A target with WO3 of oxygen content equivalent of
            36.2 ug/cm2.
           The WO3 film was sandwiched between the Au film of
            230 ug/cm2 as a backing and 50 ug/cm2 layer on the
            other side.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR)
            Two deltaE-E detector telescopes placed coplanar on
             either side of the beam direction at 41 deg and
             45 deg.
            The solid angles of the monitor and the telescope
             detectors were 24.24 uSr and 4.42 mSr, respectively.
           (SI) A monitor detector placed at 16 deg
METHOD     (COINC) Two 12C particles detected in coincidence.
ANALYSIS   The data were analyzed in the off-line mode.
           In the summed energy spectrum two prominent broad
            peaks marked by arrows separated by ~4 MeV, are
            identified.
           The higher (E1 + E2) peak corresponds to the two
            correlated 12C s emitted in their ground state, and
            the second peak corresponds to the decayed 4.44 MeV
            excited state of one 12C in coincidence with the
            other 12C in its ground state.
