SAMPLE     Natural rubidium target.
           About 1 mg/cm2 rubidium targets were prepared by
            vacuum evaporation of natural rubidium chloride on
            7 mg/cm2 superpure Al backing.
           The target material was covered with a thin layer
            (100 ug/cm2) of Al coating to prevent the target from
            flaking out from the backing material.
           The target assembly consisted of a number of Rb
            targets sandwiched between Al degrader foils.
           The thickness of the degraders were adjusted so as to
            get the desired energy on different targets.
           The energy degradations were calculated using the
            stopping power data of Willlamson et al.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector resolution was found to be 2 keV
            at the 1333 keV 60Co peak.
           The detector efficiency was obtained from a set of
            calibration gamma-sources covering the region 122 to
            1408 keV.
           Counting periods were varied between 100 sec and
            several hours depending on the activities and the
            half-lives of the isotopes being studied.
METHOD     (STTA) The duration of irradiations were between 10
            and 45 min and were adjusted according to the half-
            life of the nuclide of interest.
           The beam currents used in bombardments were around
            700-800 nA.
           The flux of the beam passing through the target stack
            was measured in a Faraday cup.
           This was cross checked by using an aluminium monitor
            foil along with the target assembly.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(A,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           The flux was cross checked by using an aluminium
            monitor foil along with the target assembly.
           The cross section for the production of 24Na from 27Al
            as a function of alpha-energy were taken from the
            tables of Martens and Schweimer
