FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     Stacks of natural uranium target foils (0.075 mm thick)
            and aluminium catcher foil (0.025 mm) thick
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector coupled to a 4 K multichannel
             analyser in live time mode.
            The resolution of the detector system was 2.0 keV at
             1332.0 keV gamma line of 60-Co and the dead time
             during the counting was always less than 10% to
             avoid the pile-up effect.
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC) After the irradiations the aluminium
             catcher foil for each uranium metal foil facing the
             beam was dissolved and iodine was separated
             radiochemically within 30 to 35 minutes from the end
             of the irradiation.
            Standard aliquots of the purified iodine samples were
             counted as a function of time at a fixed geometry on
             an efficiency calibrated 90 c.c. HPGe-detector
             coupled to a 4 K multichannel analyser in live time
             mode.
INC-SOURCE The beam current of 1-2 uA during irradiation was
            measured using a Faraday cup.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) From the observed activities of 772.6 keV
             composite gamma lines of 132-I-m,g, separation time
             activities of the metastable (m) and ground (g)
             states were calculated using standard decay-growth
             equations.
            The independent isomeric yield ratios of 132-I
             isomers obtained from the separation time activities
             after correcting for the precursor contributions.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted errors including
            - counting statistics;
            - absolute abundances of the gamma lines;
            - detector efficiencies;
            - cumulative yield of the precursor;
            - the least-square analysis.
