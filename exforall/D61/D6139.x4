SAMPLE     210 ug/cm2 184-W target with 110 ug/cm2 carbon backing
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SI,HPGE)
METHOD     (COINC,TOF)
           Evaporation residues (ER) were separated from intense
            primary beam background by the Heavy-Ion Reaction
            Analyzer (HIRA) and were transported to its focal
            plane (FP).
           Time of flight (TOF) of the slowly moving ERs over the
            flight path of the HIRA (8.82 m) was recorded for
            further cleaning of the background.
           Characteristic gamma-rays from ERs were recorded in
            singles and in coincidence with ERs at Elab=99.2 MeV.
