SAMPLE     Pure 181Ta sample of thickness 150 microgram/cm2 has
            been deposited by the electro-deposition technique on
            Al foils of thickness 1.1-1.5 mg/cm2.
           The samples have been pasted on rectangular Al holders
            having concentric holes of 1.0 cm diameter.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activities produced in each Al catcher
            foils of the stacks were counted separately using a
            high-purity germanium spectrometer of 100 cc active
            volume coupled with the CAMAC based FREEDOM software.
METHOD     (GSPEC,ACTIV)
           (REC) The evaporation residues populated via CF and/or
            ICF are trapped at different catcher foil thicknesses.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The gamma ray spectra of each foil have been
            recorded so that the decay curve analysis can be done
            to verify the half-lives and the identification of
            the residues.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Incomplete fusion  contribution cross section
            corresponding to the  fusion of 12C with 181Ta.

CRITIQUE   By Compilers (2012-12-03):
            The uncertainty (15%) coded under ERR-S was declared
            by B.P.Singh as statistical. However their 2009
            article mentions that the overall error is estimated
            to be <15%, including the statistical errors
            (p14601-3 of Phys.Rev.C80(2009)014601). Therefore
            application of the heading ERR-S to this entry is
            suspicious.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) See Phys.Rev.C80(2009)014601 for details of
            uncertainties.
