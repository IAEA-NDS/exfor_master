            residues from the natPr + 12C reaction: A comparative
           study on the production of 149Tb

SAMPLE     Nonhygroscopic praseodymium oxide, Pr(6)O(11), was used
            as the target material.
           Targets of 2.5-3.0 mg/cm2 thickness were prepared by
            centrifugation technique on Al foil backing
            1.5 mg/cm2 thick was used.
           The target assembly was prepared by placing three such
            Pr(6)O(11) targets each time and was bombarded with
            12C beams.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) resolution of 2.13 keV at 1332 keV
METHOD     (STTA) A total of six target stacks were irradiated
            separately, varying the incident energy, with an
            overlap between them.
           (BCINT) Integrated charge recorded for each
            irradiation by an electron-suppressed Faraday cup
           (ACTIV) At the end of bombardment (EOB), an off-line
            gamma spectrometric study was carried out in each foil
            at a regular time interval up to 7 days
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties considered in the cross-
            section measurement are:
                 * uncertainty in the counting statistics,
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in calibration of the detector(2%)
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in target thickness           (5%)
           (ERR-3) uncertainty in beam current propagated to
            the cross-section data                          (10%)
