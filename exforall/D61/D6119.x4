SAMPLE     (49-IN-115,NAT=0.957)
           A self supporting natural indium target with 95.7%
            isotopic abundance of 115In was used. The target
            thickness was measured by alpha energy loss method to
            be 220 ug/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Two telescopes with surface
             barrier silicon detectors were set up two movable
             arms inside a 1 m diam. scattering chamber for
             determination of charge, mass and energy of the
             ejectiles.
            The telescopes employed 15-30 um thick dE detectors
             and 300 um thick E detectors.
           (SI) Another silicon detector of 300 um thickness was
            placed at a forward angle to monitor the target.
ANALYSIS   (INTED) The excitation energy integrated cross
            sections for various channels were obtained over the
            entire excitation energy range.
