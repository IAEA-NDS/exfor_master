SAMPLE     A self supporting 1.8 mg/cm**2 thick 232Th target
DETECTOR   (PS,MWPC) Two low pressure X-Y position sensitive
            multiwire avalanche counters of Breskin-type, having
            active dimensions of 6.5 cm x 5.0 cm and 15 cm x
            3.5 cm, were mounted on either side of the fissile
            target for detecting the complementary fission
            fragments in coincidence.
           The position sensitive detectors were kept at 14 cm
            and 12 cm, respectively, from the target subtending
            the in-plane angles of about 26 deg and 63 deg,
            respectively, at the target.
           The detectors were moved to different specified angles
            (33 deg, 200 deg), (75 deg, 253 deg) with respect to
            beam direction to carry out the measurements over a
            large angular range.
           The detectors were operated with isobutane gas at torr
            pressure.                   D6125  1   30
           (SI) A 500 micron-thick semiconductor detector was
            placed at 25 deg at a distance of 40 cm from the
            target to monitor the elastically scattered heavy
            ions for normalization purposes.
METHOD     (COINC) Fusion-fission and transfer fission events
            were separated by folding angle technique and the
            fission cross sections have been measured employing
            the kinematic coincidence.
           The time of arrival of the fragments at the two
            position sensitive detectors and the X and Y position
            pulses from the two detectors were recorded event by
            event in list mode.
PART-DET   (FF)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD) The angle calibration of the fission fragment
            detectors was achieved from the observed dips in the
            fragment yields in the detectors due to the shadowing
            caused by the wires used to support the thin windows
            of the PSDs.
           This calibration was done using a 252Cf source mounted
            at the point of the target location.
           The coincidence timing information from the two
            fission fragment detectors was recorded as one of the
            parameters to select the genuine fission events time
            difference between the two FFs <20 ns and thus helped
            to reject random coincidences.
           From the event-by-event information on the position of
            the two complementary fragments in the two detectors,
            their angles of emission were calculated.
           The measured folding angle distributions at different
            bombarding energies were fitted with three
            Gaussian peaks corresponding to fusion-fission,
            transfer fission and low momentum transfer fission
            events.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error consists of statistical error
            and errors on solid angle.
