METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method
FACILITY   (VDG,4RUSFEI)   Electrostatic accelerator 'KG-2,5',
                   target current is 30 microAmpere
INC-SOURCE (P-T)  Tritium targets were molybdenum  disks with
                  tritium adsorbent as a foils of scandium
                  and titanium
           (P-LI7)  Lithium targets were in the shape of foils
                    of the lithium-fluoride, Li-F, on copper plate
PART-DET   (G)  For activation measurements
DETECTOR   (GELI) Volume 70 cm3, resolution 2.3 keV at 122.keV
           (BF3)  For neutron flux monitoring
SAMPLE      Gold samples have mass 1.15 gram, chemical purity
            is 99.99 percent. Uranium sample have mass 1 gram
            and consisted of the uranium oxide, thickness 0.075
            cm, chemical purity 99.85 percent

CORRECTION  Corrections were made on the background neutron
            scattering, mutual influence of the samples,
            neutron source anisotropy
