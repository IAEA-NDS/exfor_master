TITLE      Measurement of the characteristics of spontaneous
           fission of U-238 and U-236.
SAMPLE     Small grainy powder of  U(3)O(8)
DETECTOR   (PROPC)Filled by He3 and placed in hydrogenous
            moderator. 24 counters.
           Detector efficiency was measured by Cf-252 source to be
           0.490+-0.003, for U - it was multiplied by coefficient
           1.032+-0.005 to take into account difference of prompt
           neutron spectra.
ANALYSIS   Multiplicity for n=1 was not used in analysis of
           distribution due to uncertainty in yields of (alpha,n)
           reaction and delayed neutrons. Data For samples with
           square > or = 87.5 cm**2 were used in analysis.
           Extrapolation to zero thickness was done.
MONITOR    No information.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
HISTORY    (19840322C)
           (20130802A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
           Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
           INC-SOURCE line was deleted (spontaneous fission).
           BIB information was updated.
           Ref. of Engl.translation was added.
           Units of DATA were changed NO-DIM -> PRT/FIS.
           PR was added in SF4 in REACTION.
           Subent 004 was added.
