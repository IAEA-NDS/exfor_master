TITLE      Measurement of the characteristics of spontaneous
           fission of U-238 and U-236
SAMPLE     Small grainy powder of  U(3)O(8)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Filled by He3 and placed in hydrogenous
            moderator. 24 counters.
           Detector efficiency was measured by Cf-252 source to be
           0.490+-0.003, for U - it was multiplied by coefficient
           1.032+-0.005 to take into account difference of prompt
           neutron spectra.
ANALYSIS   Multiplicity for n=1 was not used in analysis of
           distribution due to uncertainty in yields of (alpha,n)
           reaction and delayed neutrons. Data For samples with
           square > or = 87.5 cm**2 were used in analysis.
           Extrapolation to zero thickness was done.
MONITOR    No information.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Not specified.
