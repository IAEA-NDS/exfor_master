AUTHOR     (V.I.Sukhanov,V.G.Rukavishnikov)
TITLE      The inelastic scattering of 14 MeV neutrons by sodium,
           iron, nickel, and lead nuclei
METHOD     (TOF)   Flight base is 6. m.
                   Time resolution (half-width) 3.E-8 sec.
            Inelastically scattered neutrons spectra were measured
           in the energy range 0.6 - 4.0 MeV. Spectra were not
           corrected for contribution from (N,2N) reaction.
DETECTOR   (STANK) Liquid scintillator of 150 cm3 volume with
           FEU-33 photomultiplier.
COMMENT     Of compiler. It is not explained in the article, how
            cross-sections were derived from measured spectra -
            full energy range was used or only energy rage of
            measurement 0.6 - 4.0 MeV. These cross sections are
            explained by authors as "cross section of non-elastic
            neutron scattering leading to residual nucleus in
            higher (10-14 MeV) excited states".
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of uncertainty is not explained in the
            article.
