EXP-YEAR   (1954)
DETECTOR   (BF3)  BF3 counter in graphite prism.
            Ratio of detector sensitivities to 14 MeV neutrons and
            to neutrons from nonelastic processes - 0.874+-0.030.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
            Neutron beam was measured by alphas counting in
           T(d,n)He-4 reaction.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Type of error is not explained in the
            article.
