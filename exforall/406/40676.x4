TITLE      Determination of the cross section of the reaction
           27Al(n,p)27Mg with neutrons of energy 14.8 MeV
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium
SAMPLE      Disks of separately pure aluminum ,diameter 30.mm,
            thickness .5-1.0mm
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation gamma-spectrometer
MONITOR     No information
PART-DET   (G)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error
           (ERR-1) Neutron flux density
           (ERR-2) Number of nuclei in sample
           (ERR-3) Measurement of time intervals
CORRECTION Alterations of flux density along  sample thickness,
           during time by long irradiation,geometrical factor
           were taken into account
