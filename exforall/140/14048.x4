COMMENT    Allan Carlson (2017-05-23):
            EXFOR 10987.002 and 14048.002 are from the same
            experiment. The preliminary and digitized data set
            (14048.002) is normalized to an ENDF evaluation while
            the final data set (10987.002) is absolute and do not
            require normalization.
