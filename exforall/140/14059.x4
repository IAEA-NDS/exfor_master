TITLE      Neutron resonance spectroscopy of 107Ag and 109Ag
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) 800-MeV protons from the Los Alamos
            Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) linac
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) 800 MeV protons to a proton storage ring
            (PSR) and compressed to pulses of short length.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The neutrons were detected by a system of 55
            10B liquid scintillators located at 56 m from the
            neutron source.
SAMPLE     The natural silver (2986 g, 99.999% chemical purity)
            target was formed by combining two cylinders, each
            10.5 cm in diameter and of length 4.3 cm. The silver
            sample was located at the exit of the neutron spin
            rotation device, approximately 9.7 from the neutron
            source. The target was cooled to liquid nitrogen
            temperature (77 K) to reduce Doppler broadening of
            the resonance.
           An additional measurement was performed on a highly
            enriched (98.29% 107Ag) sample obtained from the Oak
            Ridge National Laboratory Isotopes Distribution
            Office. The enriched sample was 49.813 g of silver
            powder. The powder was uniformly distributed within an
            aluminum cylinder of diameter 8.9 cm with walls 0.05
            cm thick.
