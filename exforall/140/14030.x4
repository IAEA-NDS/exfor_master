TITLE      Neutron Scattering from elemental uranium and thorium
FACILITY   Argonne multi-detecttor system
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Deuterium gas target in a cell 2 cm long
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     Solid metal cylinders 2cm in dimater, 2 cm long at 16cm
            from the neutron source, at 0 degree source-reaction
            angle. Targets 99.9 % pure.
CORRECTION About 0.75 % contribution of the minor isotopes in the
            uranium sample was ignored throughout it would have
            distorted the measured results by amounts less than
            the experimental uncertainties.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Cylindrical liquid hydrogenous scintillators,
            12 cm diameter, 2 cm thick
