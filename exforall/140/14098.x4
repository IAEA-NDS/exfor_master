TITLE      Note on the prompt fission neutron spectra of uranium
            235 and plutonium 239
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL)
INC-SOURCE Neutron energies of 35 +/- 12 or 400 +/- 25 keV were
            incident on the fissile samples in bursts of about 1
            nsec duration
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Proton recoil scintillation detectors were
            placed about 200 cm from the fission sample
REL-REF    (M,,A.Smith,J,NIM,50,277,1967)
MONITOR    Neutron sensitivity of each detector was calibrated to
            energies of 1.6 MeV relative to the differential
            elastic scattering of carbon
SAMPLE     The fissile samples were right cylinders 2 cm  high and
            2 cm in diameter fabricated from material of more than
            94 % isotopic purity.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron attenuation and multiple
            scattering within the samples and for finite angular
            definition of the apparatus
