TITLE      Note on the prompt fission neutron spectra of uranium
            235 and plutonium 239
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL)
INC-SOURCE Neutron energies of 35 +/- 12 or 400 +/- 25 keV were
            incident on the fissile samples in bursts of about 1
            nsec duration
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Proton recoil scintillation detectors were
            placed about 200 cm from the fission sample
MONITOR    Neutron sensitivity of each detector was calibrated to
            energies of 1.6 MeV relative to the differential
            elastic scattering of carbon
SAMPLE     The fissile samples were right cylinders 2 cm  high and
            2 cm in diameter fabricated from material of more than
            94 % isotopic purity.
CORRECTION Correction for neutron attenuation and multiple
            scattering within the samples and for finite angular
            definition of the apparatus
