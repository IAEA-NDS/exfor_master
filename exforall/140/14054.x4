TITLE      Spontaneous fission properties of 252,254No and
            256,258[104] and the disappearance of the outer
            fission barrier
FACILITY   (PRJFS,1USALRL) MAD (Multiple Alpha Detector) System
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) Thirty-two detectors above and 32 below
            the wheel are situated on the same radius as the films
            and measure the energy deposited by the coincident
            fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) MAD (Multiple Alpha Detector) system was used.
            (Thirty-two pairs of surface-barrier detectors.)
           The first five detector pairs and pairs 27 to 32 were
           activated for fission counting, while detector pair 6
           recorded a spectra that could be later analyzed for
           residual 252No and other reaction products from the
            bombardment.

DECAY-DATA (102-NO-254,55.SEC)
SAMPLE     No-254 was produced  by two different reactions:
           246Cm(12C,4n) at an energy of 72.5 MeV, and
           245Cm (13C,4n) reaction at 71.5 MeV, in order to
           eliminate an spontaneous fission (SF) background caused
           by a gradual release of the 246Cm target material,
           which has an SF branch of 0.026%.

REACTION   (102-NO-254(0,F),SEC,FY/DE,LF+HF,REL)
            Data are number of events/ 5 MeV
DECAY-DATA (102-NO-254,55.SEC)
SAMPLE     No-254 was produced  by two different reactions:
           246Cm(12C,4n) at an energy of 72.5 MeV, and
           245Cm (13C,4n) reaction at 71.5 MeV, in order to
           eliminate an spontaneous fission (SF) background caused
           by a gradual release of the 246Cm target material,
           which has an SF branch of 0.026%.
EN-SEC     E is the total kinetic energy
ERR-ANALYS No details
STATUS     (CURVE) Data taken from Fig. 5 of JALC,213-214,86,1994
HISTORY    (20120810A) SD: In REACTION code: 1)SF7=LF+HF was added
            2) SF5=CHN changed to SEC assuming that the TKE is for
            secondary fragments; 3) SF4=MASS deleted.
            MASS-MIN and MASS MAX deleted from COMMON section.
