INSTITUTE  (1USAMHG)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMHG) Nuclear Reactor at Phoenix Lab.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The neutron flux was 2*10**12 neutron/cm2/sec.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.90) Uranyl Nitrate + organic Liquid.
           Uranyl nitrate was irradiated either "suspended" in
           n-C5H12 or dissolved in pure tertiary butyl alcohol
            (henceforth TBA) or in a mixture of TBA+CH30H (3:1).
           The amount of uranyl nitrate irradiated was
           determined by weight. Irradiations were run using
           both natural uranyl nitrate (0.715% U-235) and
           enriched (90% U-235). For the former 10-30 mg uranyl
           nitrate were irradiated for 3-5 min., and for the
           latter 1-3 mg for 5-10 sec. The samples were
           irradiated in a small (1.4 ml) polyethylene snap-cap
           vial.
DETECTOR   (NAICR,GELI) Gamma-ray spectra were obtained by using
           either a 3"x3" NaI detector, or a Ge-Li detector.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Research has been done to determine the
           independent fission yields of short-lived fission
           nuclides or of fission nuclides with short-lived
           precursors. By irradiating uranium in the presence of
           an organic liquid the recoil fission nuclides should
           react with the organic molecules to form stable
           organic products. Because a fission product recoil
           energy is typically about 70-100 MeV, it would be
           expected to react with the organic liquid to the same
           extent and result in the same organic products as
           nuclides of the same element activated by the
            (n,gamma) process. The recoil atoms formed by beta
           decay, on the other hand, should be less reactive in
           forming organic products due to the significantly
           smaller recoil energy which typically would be about
           1-2 eV. What is of importance is that the chemical
           reaction would take place during the neutron
           irradiation. Thus, the typical post-irradiation
           chemical separation, and the time it would take to
           perform such an operation, would be avoided
           completely. However, following the irradiation, the
           organically bound fission products must still be
           separated from the precursor nuclides. But the
           separation method to be used can instead be based on
           physical rather than chemical properties of the
           chemically bound nuclides. Specifically, gas
           chromatography separations should be feasible. This
           type of separation method has a number of
           particularly important advantages. Consider the case
           where it is of interest to examine specific fission
           bromine nuclides. In this case the hot atom reactions
           which would occur in organic liquids would probably
           be experimentally favorable in that a larger
           percentage of the bromine nuclides would form.
           organic compounds than would selenium nuclides.
           Further, any bromine formed from selenium beta-decay
           would react to form organically-bound bromides. To
           inhibit these latter reactions it is desirable to
           separate the organic bromides from the selenium as
           quickly as possible. Described in this thesis is a
           semi-automatic injection method devised to permit
           separation of the inorganic and organic fractions
           within a few seconds after the end of the neutron
           irradiation. The organic fraction is then carried by
           helium flow gas to the gas chromatography column
           where separation of the organic compounds begins to
           occur. This latter separation procedure permits the
           isolation of individual chemical compounds containing
           in each compound all fission nuclides of the element
           characterizing the compound.
