TITLE      Calibration of fission product yields for Xe-136 and
            Kr-85
FACILITY   Underground nuclear explosion
INC-SOURCE (EXPLO) Fission spectrum energies (1-2 MeV) and
                   14 MeV neutrons
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     No information
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty was calculated on the basis of
           the analytical precision of the data. The standard
           deviation of calculated 136Xe fission yields agrees
           with refractory element data to about 3.7%, indicating
           that assignment of analytical errors is correct
           and no other source of deviation is present.
