TITLE      Measurements of neutron spectra from fission
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAINL) the M.T.R. reactor in Idaho.
INC-SOURCE The foils were placed in a beam of predominately
            thermal neutrons
METHOD     Sphere-counter method
ANALYSIS   Neutron energy derived from fission fragment kinetic
            energy measurement
DETECTOR   (TELES) Sphere moderated neutron spectrometer. The
            sphere-counter was placed 2.8 m above the top shield
            of the reactor.
MONITOR    The DE and E silicon detectors were calibrated using a
            226Ra a source.
SAMPLE     The samples to be observed were foils of U 235, U 233,
            and Pu 239 with a thickness from 0.025 to 0.050 cm and
            an area of about 20 cm2. The samples were placed
            35 cm from the centre of the counter
CORRECTION Background counts were made with a cadmium shutter
            covering the port in the reactor so that effects due
            to all but thermal neutrons were eliminated. A small
            correction has been made to subtract the counts due to
            delayed neutrons whose relative abundance as compared
            to prompt neutrons amounts to 0.64 %, 0.26 %, and
            0.22 % respectively or U 235, U 233 and Pu 239.
            The average energy of the delayed neutrons used in
            this calculation was 0.45 MeV.
