TITLE      Cross-section measurements for neutron-induced
            reactions in copper at neutron energies of 70.7 and
            110.8 MeV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAHRV) k = 200 split sector cyclotron
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) Quasi-monoenergetic neutron beams of 70.7 MeV
            and 110.8 MeV, respectively were produced by directing
            79.4 and 118 MeV pulsed proton beams (4-10 microA)
            onto a 10 mm thick Beryllium target.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) High purity Ge detectors plus pulse height
             analyzers with computer data acquisition systems
             located at iTL and the Northeast Proton Therapy
            Center (NPTC) were used to measure non-destructively
            the yields of the short-lived products produced in the
            Cu monitor foils.
SAMPLE     SiO2 target, (50 x 50 mm) be 9 mm thick; Cu foils
PART-DET   (N)
           (G)
METHOD     (ACTIV) The yields of relatively short-lived
            radionuclides produced in the targets and monitor
            foils were measured using non-destructive gamma-ray
            spectroscopy.
           (TOF) Neutron time-of-flight spectra measured (for the
            same monitor count) at 0 degree and 16 degree,
            respectively were compared in order to determine the
            factors required for this normalization.
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils, 15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick
            (Good fellow Corp. purity 99.99+%) were placed
            immediately downstream of the SiO2 target, together
            with aluminum, nickel and gold monitor foils and, for
            stability, the entire target stackwas wrapped in Al
            foil.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error in the cross-section
            measurement was obtained by adding in quadrature, the
            following individual errors: 2% for the number of
            target atoms; the estimated error in the measurement
            of the neutron fluence, about 7%; 5% for the error in
            the Ge detector efficiency; and the statistical
            counting error
