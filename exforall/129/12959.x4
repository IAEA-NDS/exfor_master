TITLE      CROSS SECTION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 108M-AG
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAUCS)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
SAMPLE     ENRICHED 107-AG POWDER ENCLOSED IN A POLYPROPYLENE
            CYLINDER 5 MM IN DIAMETER AND 10 MM IN LENGTH WITH
            98.22 PERCENT 107-AG AND 1.78 PERCENT 109-AG. THERE
            WERE TWO SAMPLES WITH MASSES OF 10.125 MILLIGRAMS
            AND 19,771 MILLIGRAMS.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
            VALUE USED FOR CO FLUX MONITOR NOT GIVEN
DETECTOR   (GELI) GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH AN ACTIVE AREA OF
            10.7 CM**2. THE RESOLUTION WAS 3.2 KEV FWHM AND
            THE EFFICIENCY WES 4 PERCENT RELATIVE TO A 3 X 3
            INCH NA(TL) DETECTOR FOR THE 1.332 MEV PHOTON FROM
            60-CO. SAMPLES WERE PLACED 2 CM FROM THE DETECTOR
            FOR COUNTING. ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE EFFICIENCY
            WAS DETERMINED USING CALIBRATED PHOTON SOURCES.
ANALYSIS   THE SAMPLE GAMMA DECAY SPECTRUM WAS ANALYZED FOR
            EACH PEAK BY STRIPPING OFF BACKGROUND AND OVER
            LAP FROM NEIGHBORING PEAKS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY OBTAINED BY
             PROPAGATION OF THE ERRORS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
             MEASUREMENTS.
