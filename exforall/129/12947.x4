TITLE      Capture in the 1.15-keV iron resonance
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) ORELA
DETECTOR   (STANK) C6F6 liquid scintillators 10 cm in diam. and
            4-cm thick, were used as the gamma-ray detectors.
           (IOCH) A 10B overlap filter was used and NaF and
           S filters were permanently in the beam. The relative
           flux was measured with a parallel plate 10B pulse
           ionization chamberl2 placed 26 cm in front of the
           iron sample. This chamber covered the complete neutron
           beam and contained 56 mu-g/cm2 of 10B.
SAMPLE     Natural iron, 5.08 by 6.35 by 0.051 cm.
