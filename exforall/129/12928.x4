CORRECTION Corrected for multiple scattering. The data are NOT
           corrected for the finite angular resolution of
           typically +- 5 degree.
ERR-ANALYS The final error given with each data point of
           the secondary neutron spectra consists of the
           counting statistics of the individual spectra plus
           contributions of various corrections.
           (ERR-2,,1.)  Target mass error includes weight and
           purity.
           (ERR-3,,1.5) Monitor cross section.
           (ERR-4,,0.5) Normalization: calibration of the
           experimental set-up using a detector with a given
           efficiency curve in a given geometry; it depends on the
            evaluation of the monitor counts and the beam charge
           collection.
           (ERR-5) Geometry: difference in the positioning of the
           sample with regard to the neutron source and the
           detector; within one angular distribution this
           uncertainty is uncorrelated, but not for the reference
           measurement.
           (ERR-6) The Monte Carlo simulation corrects for flux
           attenuation,multiple scattering and finite sample size.
           (ERR-S) consists of the combined statistical errors,
           the error in the deadtime correction and in the
           background subtraction.
COMMENT    Manfred Drosg (2018-01-09): From the high energy
           tailing of all neutron spectra it can be concluded that
           the 14.1 MeV neutron source was contaminated with
           higher energy neutrons. The origin of these neutrons is
           traced back to angular straggling of the deuterons of
           the beam lowering the emission angle of the neutrons
           resulting in higher energy neutrons.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The final error given with each data point of
           the secondary neutron spectra consists of the

STATUS     (TABLE) Table VII, page 17 of the R,LA-(11367),1988.
CORRECTION In most cases the worse time resolution at higher
           energies did not allow the separation of scattering
           from the low-lying excited states. Therefore, Table
           VII gives the differential laboratory cross section
           of the highest energy peak rather than elastic cross
           sections. In 6Li case, inelastic cross sections of
           the first excited state at 2.186 MeV was subtracted.

SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.9905) The 6Li sample had 0.573 moles

ANALYSIS   (INTED) These data contain extrapolations to zero
           neutron energy. To account for events below the
           neutron detection bias, the following simple
           procedure was set forth: It was assumed that the
           spectrum below the cutoff of 0.35 MeV was in the
           average as intense as the spectrum between 0.35 MeV
           and 2.0 MeV. We assigned an error of 50% to this
           extrapolation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The final error given with each data point of

           4 cm high, 1.5 cm diameter).
ANALYSIS   Legendre coefficients were constructed using the
           results of fitting the elastic and the nonelastic
           portions of the spectra under the following
           constraints: A0 was fixed to the sum of the first
           coefficient of the elastic and of the nonelastic
           distribution, and the zero-degree and the 180-degree
           cross section were taken to be the sum of the
           corresponding (extrapolated) values of the partial
           fits.
