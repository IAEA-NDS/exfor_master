TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE SE-76(N,G) CAPTURE CROSS SECTION
            AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL S-PROCESS STUDIES. THE WEAK COM-
            PONENT.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE KARLSRUHE 500 KHZ PULSED 3.75 MV VAN DE
            GRAAFF ACCELERATOR WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS COLLIMATED.
SAMPLE     .THE SE-76 AND AU-197 SAMPLES CONSISTED OF METAL FOILS,
            25 MM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHING 4.9509 GRAMS AND 4.642
            GRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SE SAMPLE HAD THE FOLLOWING
            ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION

            THE AU SAMPLE HAD A NATURAL ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION. THE
            GRAPHITE SAMPLE WAS A DISK WITH THE SAME DIAMETER,
            HAVING A WEIGHT OF 1.036 GRAMS AND A NATURAL ISOTOPIC
            COMPOSITION. THE SAMPLES WERE POSITIONED ALTERNATIVELY
            INTO THE NEUTRON BEAM TO AVERAGE OVER INTENSITY FLUC-
            TUATIONS.
METHOD     (TOF  ) NEUTRON ENERGIES WERE MEASURED BY TIME-OF-
            FLIGHT. CAPTURE EVENTS WERE REGISTERED BY DETECTING
            THE GAMMA-RAY CASCADES OF THE EXCITED COMPOUND NUC-
            LEUS. THE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF SE-76 WAS MEASURED
            RELATIVE TO AU-197.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) THE GAMMA-RAY CASCADES OF THE EXCITED COMPOUND
            NUCLEUI WERE DETECTED WITH TWO C6D6 LIQUID SCINTIL-
            LATION COUNTERS, WELL SHIELDED TO REDUCE THE BACK-
            GROUND COUNT RATE. FOUR DIFFERENT TOF SPECTRA WERE
            RECORDED, /1/ SE-76, /2/ AU-197, /3/ A SPECTRUM WITH-
            OUT SAMPLE TO OBTAIN THE SAMPLE INDEPENDENT BACK-
            GROUND, AND /4/ A GRAPHITE SPECTRUM TO SIMULATE THE
            BACKGROUND SPECTRUM FROM SAMPLE SCATTERED NEUTRONS.
            AS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTORS WERE A NON-LINEAR
            FUNCTION OF GAMMA-RAY ENERGY, A GAMMA-RAY WEIGHTING
            TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED.
           .A NEUTRON COUNTER, USED TO MONITOR THE FLUX, WAS
            PLACED AT 90 DEGREES TO THE BEAM AXIS.
PART-DET   (G    )
ANALYSIS   .THE DATUM GIVEN WAS OBTAINED BY INTEGRATING THE
            MEASURED EXCITATION FUNCTION OVER A MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN
            DISTRIBUTION WITH TEMPERATURE KT. THE EXPERIMENTAL
            DATA WERE EXTRAPOLATED BEYOND 200 KEV ASSUMING A 1/E
            DEPENDENCE. THE LOWER INTEGRATION LIMIT WAS EXTENDED
            FROM 3 KEV TO THERMAL ENERGY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
            THE CONTRIBUTION FROM RESOLVED RESONANCES QUOTED BY
            MUGHABGAB ET AL.

CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON MULTIPLE SCATTER-

            TION IN THE SAMPLES.
