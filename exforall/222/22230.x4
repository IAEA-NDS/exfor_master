REACTION   (2-HE-3(N,G)2-HE-4,,SIG,,MXW)
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE HORIZONTAL BEAM-TUBE HB11, WHICH HAS A SYS-
            TEM OF FOCUSING NEUTRON MIRRORS NEAR THE REACTOR CORE,
            WAS USED. TRANSMISSION OF NEUTRONS CAN ONLY TAKE PLACE
            BY TOTAL REFLECTION AT THE NICKEL MIRROR SURFACES,
            WHICH THUS ACT AS A LOW-PASS NEUTRON FILTER. THE 6 CM
            DIAMETER NEUTRON BEAM WAS SHAPED WITH AN ADDITIONAL
            BORON PLASTIC AND LIF DIAPHRAGM NEAR THE TARGET.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM EAS DETERMINED BY IRRADIATING TWO
            STACKS OF TWENTY 400 MG/CM2 THICK 2.5 X 2.5 CM2 GOLD
            FOILS, ONE BEFORE AND ONE AFTER THE TARGET GAS CELL.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE 20.5 MEV CAPTURE GAMMA RAYS WERE DETECTED
            BY TWO 25 CM DIAMETER BY 25 CM LONG NAI-TL DETECTORS,
            BOTH PLACED 32.6 CM FROM THE TARGET CELL AND AT 90
            DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE NEUTRON BEAM. THE DETEC-
            TORS WERE SHIELDED AGAINST SCATTERED NEUTRONS AND
            GAMMA-RAYS NOT ORIGINATING FROM THE TARGET. THE RES-
            PONSE FUNCTION WAS CALCULATED WITH A MONTE CARLO CODE.
SAMPLE     .THE TARGET CELL CONSISTED OF AN ALUMINUM CYLINDRICAL
            CONTAINER, 9 CM IN LENGTH AND 8 CM IN DIAMETER, WITH
            40 MICROMETER THICK ARAMID FOILS AS ENTRANCE AND EXIT
            WINDOWS. THE TARGET GAS WAS HIGH PURITY, RESEARCH
            GRADE HELIUM-3 GAS. THE GAS PRESSURE WAS 700-750 TORR.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G,,SIG) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS
            DETERMINED BY IRRADIATION OF 100 MG/CM2 THICK GOLD
            FOILS.

INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE FILTERED BEAM FACILITY HB12, WHICH CONTAINS
            24 CM OF IRON, 36 CM OF ALUMINUM AND 6 CM OF SULPHUR,
            WAS USED. BY TAPERED SOLLER-SLIT COLLIMATORS, A BEAM
            DIMENSION OF 4 X 10 CM2 WAS OBTAINED.
INC-SPECT  .QUASI-MONOENERGETIC BEAM OF 24.5 KEV.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) THE 20.5 MEV CAPTURE GAMMA RAYS WERE DETECTED
            BY A 25 CM DIAMETER BY 25 CM LONG NAI-TL DETECTOR,
            PLACED AT 25 CM FROM THE TARGET CELL AND AT 90 DEGREES
            WITH RESPECT TO THE NEUTRON BEAM. THE DETECTOR WAS
            SHIELDED AGAINST SCATTERED NEUTRONS AND GAMMA-RAYS NOT
            ORIGINATING FROM THE TARGET. THE RESPONSE FUNCTION WAS
            CALCULATED WITH A MONTE CARLO CODE.
SAMPLE     .A CRYOGENIC LIQUID 3HE TARGET, OPERATING AT A TEMPE-
            RATURE OF 1.28+/-0.02 K WAS USED.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198-G,,SIG) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS
            DETERMINED BY IRRADIATION OF A 350 MG/CM2 THICK GOLD
            FOIL, SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO 600 MG/CM2 GOLD PLATES
            AND 1 MM CADMIUM SHEETS.
