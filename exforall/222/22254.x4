TITLE      -A MEASUREMENT OF THE 14-C(N,G)15-C CROSS SECTION AT A
            STELLAR TEMPERATURE OF KT = 23.3 KEV.

FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE KARLSRUHE PULSED 3.75 MV VAN DE GRAAFF
            ACCELERATOR WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED NEAR THE THRESHOLD.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS SIMILAR TO A MAXWELLIAN
            SPECTRUM WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 25 KEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVATION OF TARGET MATERIAL AND
            STANDARD AU FOILS. A FAST CYCLIC ACTIVATION SYSTEM
            WITH A FAST SAMPLE CHANGER WAS USED. BOTH THE
            IRRADIATION AND COUNTING PHASES WERE CHOSEN TO BE 10
            SEC. THE AU ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED AFTER THE CYCLIC
            ACTIVATION.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE ACTIVITY OF C-15 WAS MEASURED WITH A HPGE
            DETECTOR WITH A RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF 35 PERCENT AND
            AN ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 1.72 KEV AT 1.33 MEV. THE
            EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTOR WAS MEASURED WITH CALIBRA-
            TED SOURCES UP TO 1.84 MEV, AND THE RANGE UP TO 11 MEV
            WAS COVERED WITH THE GAMMA-RAY LINES OF THE 992 KEV
            RESONANCE OF THE RADIATIVE PROTON CAPTURE REACTION ON
            AL-27. ALSO A PU-238+C-13 SOURCE WITH A LINE AT 6.13
            MEV WAS USED. TO OBTAIN A FAST CYCLIC TIME, THE DETEC-
            TOR WAS PLACED CLOSE TO THE NEUTRON GENERATION. IT WAS
            THEREFORE WELL SHIELDED. DURING THE ACTIVITY COUNTING
            PHASE THE NEUTRON GENERATION WAS STOPPED BY A PROTON
            BEAM STOP IN THE BEAM LINE. TO REDUCE PILE-UP FROM THE
            ACTIVATED NICKEL CONTAINER, A LEAD SHIELDING OF 28 MM
            WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND THE DETECTOR. IN
            THIS WAY THE BACKGROUND COUNT RATE BETWEEN 200 KEV AND
            6.1 MEV WAS REDUCED TO 10 KHZ FOR A SAMPLE-DETECTOR
            DISTANCE OF 50 MM. THIS COULD BE FURTHER REDUCED TO
            35 MM BY REPLACING THE PB SHIELD BY 15 MM TUNGSTEN.
           (GLASD) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED BY A LI-6 GLASS
            SCINTILLATION COUNTER.

SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF C-14 POWDER WITH AN ENRICHMENT
            OF 89 PERCENT, PACKED IN A 0.0508 MM THICK ELECTRO-
            FORMED NICKEL CONTAINER WITH A POROUS CH2 PLUG GLUED
            INTO THE OPEN END. THE CONTAINER HAD A VOLUME OF
            2.97 CM X 1.20 CM X 0.5 CM. THE EFFECTIVE AREA TO BE
            IRRADIATED WAS 2.97 CM X 1.20 CM = 3.56 CM2. BECAUSE
            OF A PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT WITH 500 MEV PROTONS, THE
            NICKEL CONTAINER WAS HIGHLY ACTIVATED. THE SAMPLE WAS
            SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO GOLD FOILS OF THE SAME AREA,
            HAVING WEIGHTS OF 70 - 77 MG. FIVE INDIVIDUAL RUNS OF
            THE C-14 SAMPLE, EACH BEING ABOUT 5 DAYS, WERE PER-
            FORMED.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND AND DEAD-TIME,
            AND FOR GAIN SHIFTS DURING THE MEASUREMENTS.
