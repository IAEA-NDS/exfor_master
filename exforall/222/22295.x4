INSTITUTE  (2JPNPNC) H.H., S.N.   'JNC' was renamed to 'PNC'
              after appearance of this work, so extinct code JNC
              seems to be more relevant

           (2JPNYOK) EXPERIMENTAL SITE.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNYOK) THE TRIGA MARK II reactor at Rikkyo
            University.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .Sample irradiated in the reflector surrounding the
            core of the reactor, giving a thermal N-flux 5.0E+11
            n/cm2/s and an epithermal index in the Westcott con-
            vention of 0.033.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 2 min. irradiations were per-
            formed with and without cadmium shielding. the delay
            time from end of irradiation to start of activity
            measurement was typically 1 min.
           .the monitor wires were irradiated for 10 min.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) The activities were measured with a HPGE detec-
            tor, having a relative efficiency of 90 percent and a
            resolution of 2.1 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV. the distance
            from the centre of the sample to the front end of the
            detector was 100 mm. The peak efficiency was measured
            with a calibrated multi-gamma source, containing
            Sn-118, Sr-85, Cs-137, Y-88 and Co-60.

SAMPLE     .The Tc-99 was contained in 0.01 molar ammonium
            hydroxide as ammonium pertechnotate. the specific
            activity was determined to 461 +/- 7 KBq per gram in
            a liquid scintillation counter. the solution was put
            into for 4 polyethylene tubes, 10 mm in outer diameter
            and 45 mm in outer length, with 1 mm thick walls. the
            weight of each target was determined to within 0.1
            percent, and the activity ranged from 371 to 375 KBq.
            the polyethylene tubes were located in an outer poly-
            ethylene bottle. in some of the irradiations, a cad-
            mium shield, 1 mm in thickness and 22 mm in outer dia-
            meter and 63 mm in outer length, was inserted between
            the pulyethylene tube and the bottle.
           .flux monitor wires of co-al and au-al alloys were
            used. they had diameters of 0.38 and 0.51 mm, respec-
            tively, and were inserted into the polyethylene tubes
            shaped as spirales.

           .The half-life was determined as an average of four
            values to 15.5 +/- 0.1 sec.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for sum-coincidence loss,
            pile-up and self-absorption.
