FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOK) THE SF CYCLOTRON OF THE INSTITUTE FOR
            NUCLEAR STUDY WAS USED FOR THE NEUTRON IRRADIATION.
           (VDGT,2JPNTOK) THE TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF OF THE RESEARCH
            CENTER FOR NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WAS USED FOR
            ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 1 MM
            THICK BERYLLIUM TARGET WITH 3 - 5 MICROAMP PROTON
            BEAMS OF ENERGIES 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5 AND
            37.5 MEV. THE TARGET WAS BACKED BY A WATER COOLANT,
            WHICH FULLY STOPPED THE PROTONS.
INC-SPECT  .THE SEMI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON SPECTRA AT 0 DEGREES
            WERE MEASURED WITH A NE213 SCINTILLATOR PLACED 1.3 M
            FROM THE BE TARGET. N-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS USED
            AND THE PULSE-HEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS WERE UNFOLDED INTO
            ENERGY SPECTRA WITH A REVISED FERDO CODE. ROOM-SCAT-
            TERED NEUTRONS WERE ALSO MEASURED BY SHIELDING THE
            DIRECT TARGET FLUX WITH A 10 CM BY 10 CM BY 50 CM LONG
            SHADOW BAR.
METHOD     (ASEP ) THE 26-AL/27-AL RATIO WAS DETERMINED BY ACCELE-
            RATOR MASS SEPARATION TECHNIQUES. A STANDARD SAMPLE OF
            ALUMINUM-CHLORIDE FROM NBS WITH A CERTIFIED ACTIVITY
            OF 38.79 DECAYS/SEC/GRAM +/- 1.1 PER-CENT WAS USED FOR
            CALIBRATION.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) A 51 MM DIAMETER BY 51 MM LONG NE213 LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR WITH N-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS USED TO
            DETERMINE THE INCOMING NEUTRON SPECTRA.
PART-DET   (13-AL-26-G) DETECTED IN ACCELERATOR MASS SEPARATION.
SAMPLE     .THE ALUMINUM SAMPLES WERE OF MARZ GRADE, 5 MM BY 5 MM
            IN SIZE AND 50 MU THICK, WITH PURITY 99.999 PER-CENT.
            THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED AT TWO POSITIONS OF 5 AND
            10 CM FROM THE BE TARGET FOR ABOUT 15 HR.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) INCLUDES STATISTICAL ERRORS AS WELL AS THE
            UNCERTAINTIES IN THE NEUTRON SPECTRA AND THE UNFOLDING
            PROCEDURE.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED BY UNFOLDING
            TECHNIQUES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MEASURED INCIDENT
            NEUTRON SPECTRA AT EACH PROTON ENERGY. THE UNFOLDING
            WAS PERFORMED USING THE NEUPAC CODE. A CALCULATION
            WITH ALICE GAVE START VALUES FOR THE UNFOLDING.
