TITLE      -The Cf-252(sf) neutron spectrum in the 5 to 20 MeV
            energy range-
METHOD     (TOF)   The neutron energies were determined with
                   time-of-flight techniques.
           (PSD)  Pulse-shape discrimination
PART-DET   (N,FF)
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for neutron attenuation in air
            and wall materials of the chamber and the neutron de-
            tectors. Furthermore, corrections were applied for
            gamma peak position shifts, tof-channel-dependent
            background due to noncorrelated stop signals, influ-
            ence of scattered neutrons, time resolution, and frag-
            ment detection efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainties.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties, due to neutron
            efficiency, energy scale, bin width, light-output
            calibration, uncertainties of all corrections, etc.
           (ERR-T) Total errors.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)  A miniature ionization chamber with a Cf-252
            source (70.000 fissions/sec) was used for fast
            fission fragment detection. The total fragment
            detection efficiency was 0.992+/-0.002.
