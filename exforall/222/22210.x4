TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF PRODUCTION CROSS SECTIONS OF 14-C AND
            26-AL WITH HIGH-ENERGY NEUTRONS UP TO EN=38 MEV BY

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOK) THE AVF CYCLOTRON OF THE INSTITUTE FOR
            NUCLEAR STUDY WAS USED FOR THE NEUTRON IRRADIATION.
           (VDGT,2JPNTOK) THE 4 MV TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF OF THE
            RESEARCH CENTER FOR NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WAS
            USED FOR ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 1 MM
            THICK BERYLLIUM TARGET WITH SEVERAL MICROAMP PROTON
            BEAMS OF ENERGIES 22.5, 27.5, 30, 32.5 AND 37.5 MEV.
            AT 40 MEV THE BE TARGET THICKNESS WAS 2 MM. THE TARGET
            WAS BACKED BY A 10 - 11 MM THICK WATER COOLANT, WHICH
            FULLY STOPPED THE PROTONS.
           (P-LI7) NEUTRONS WERE ALSO PRODUCED WITH 30 AND 35 MEV
            PROTONS ON A 2.1 MM THICK LITIUM TARGET ON A STOPPING
            GRAPHITE BACKING.
INC-SPECT  .THE SEMI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON SPECTRA AT 0 DEGREES
            WERE MEASURED WITH A NE213 SCINTILLATOR PLACED 1.3 M
            FROM THE TARGET.
METHOD     (STTA ) TARGET STACKS, INCLUDING AL AND AU MONITOR
            FOILS, WERE USED.
           (ASEP ) THE 14-C/12-C AND 26-AL/27-AL RATIOS WERE DE-
            TERMINED BY ACCELERATOR MASS SEPARATION TECHNIQUES.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) A 51 MM DIAMETER BY 51 MM LONG NE213 LIQUID
            SCINTILLATOR WITH N-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS USED TO
            DETERMINE THE INCOMING NEUTRON SPECTRA.
PART-DET   (13-AL-26-G) AND
           (6-C-14) DETECTED IN ACCELERATOR MASS SEPARATION.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24-G,,SIG)
           (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196-G,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .HIGH-PURITY FUSED QUARTZ PLATES, SIO2, WITH 1 MM
            THICKNESS, WERE USED AS OXYGEN AND SILICON SAMPLES.
            THE SIO2 PLATES WERE WRAPPED WITH AL FOILS TO PREVENT
            14-C CONTAMINATION OF TARGETS FROM AIR. HIGH-PURITY
            SILICON IN THE FORM OF THIN PLATES AND FLAKES WERE
            ALSO USED AS SILICON SAMPLES. THE IRRADIATION TIMES
            WERE TYPICALLY 2 - 3 HR.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR LOW-ENERGY NEUTRONS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) INCLUDES EXPERIMENTAL UNCERTAINTIES IN THE
            MASS SEPARATION AND NEUTRON SPECTRA, AND PROPAGATED
            ERRORS IN THE CORRECTION FOR LOW-ENERGY NEUTRONS.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE OBTAINED USING A SIMPLE
            ITERATIVE UNFOLDING TECHNIQUE.
