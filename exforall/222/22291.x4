           measured (only relative measurements were carried out).
TITLE       Excitation functions of neutron threshold reactions

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich CV28 variable-energy compact
            cyclotron delivered deuteron beams in the energy range
            4.6 - 9.3 MeV, giving neutrons in the 6.3 to 11.7 MeV
            range.
           (CCW,2GERDRE) The pulsed neutron generator at
            Technische Universitat Dresden. 130 keV deuteron
            energy with currents of 20 to 30 microAmps were used
            for 14.68 MeV neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Zero-degree neutrons from the d + d reaction
            were used for 6.3 to 11.7 MeV neutron range
           (D-T) Zero-degree neutrons from the d + t reaction
            were used for 14.68 MeV neutrons
INC-SPECT  .Quasi-monoenergetic.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Gamma counters were used to measure induced
            activity.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 36 cm3 Ge-Li detector was used for the
            monitor foils in the d-d experiment and all the d-t
            measurements.
           (HPGE) A 65 cm3 HPGe detector was used for the
            samples in the d-d experiment.
           (SILI) Surface barrier Si(Li) detector used for
            monitoring the neutron flux in the d-t experiment by
            counting the associated alpha particles at 165 deg
            (with respect to the deuteron direction) with a thus
            allowing corrections for small variations in flux
            during the irradiations.
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The peak ares were determined by simple summing
            with linear background subtraction.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for interfering nuclear
            reactions. For the Se-76(n,p)As-76 and
            Ge-72,73(n,p)Ga-72,73 reactions, contributions
            from (n,d) + (n,np ) + (n,pn) reactions were subtract
            for the 14.7 MeV data only, assuming summed cross sec-
            tions of 4.5, 4 and 3 mb, resp. The cross sections of
            the Ge-76(n,g)Ge-75 reaction were corrected for
            contributions from the Ge-74(n,g)Ge-75 reaction using
            neutron transport calculations.

SAMPLE     .For the d-d experiments, GeO2, 5 g, 99.999%, of
            natural isotopic composition was filled into a
            1.3 cm diam x 3.1 cm polyethylene tube with 0.05 cm
            thick walls. Aluminium, iron and nickel monitor foils
            were attached at the front and the back of the
            sample. The GeO2 samples were covered with 1 mm
            cadmium plates to eliminate thermal neutrons.
           . For the d-t experiments, germanium, 2.5 g, 99.99%, of
             natural isotopic composition was pressed into 0.9 or
            1.3 cm diameter x 0.5 cm thick pellets. Aluminium
            monitor foils were attached at the front and the back
            of the sample. The germanium samples were covered with
            1 mm cadmium plates to eliminate thermal neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1)  This uncertainty includes:
             * Uncertainty in sample weight   < 1.%

             * Uncertainty in efficiency of the gamma-
             detectors for sample counting   - 7.%

             * Uncertainty in coincidence summing
            correction   < 2.%
             * Uncertainty in averaging of neutron flux   ~5.%
             * uncertainties in correction for  activity induced
              by background neutrons:
             * gas-in/gas-out,          (1.-10.)%
             * breakup at D2 and scattering (MNCP)   (1.-11.)%;
             ERR-1 are not included uncertainties in the decay
            data, in the corrections for contributions from other
            nuclear reactions, or in the excitation function of

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)    Total error includes:
           (ERR-S,,22.) Statistical uncertainty due to relatively
           low count rates were rather large (up to 22%);
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty in the efficiency of the
            detector (~ 5 %, including self-absorption correction)
            and the uncertainties in the decay constants were
            considered as correlated errors.
            .The errors in isomeric cross-section ratios should
            generally be smaller than those in absolute cross
            sections, since uncertainties in monitor reaction
            cross sections and background neutron contributions
            have not to be taken into account.
