           (CYCLO,3HUNKOS) At 14.5MeV - MGC-20 in Debrecen
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energy between
            8.7 MeV and 10.7 MeV were produced by bombarding a
            deuterium gas target with deuterons of Energy between
            6 and 8 MeV.
INC-SPECT   The average neutron energy effective at the sample was
            calculated using a Monte Carlo program.
            The neutron flux densities in front and at the back of
            the sample were determined via the Al-27(n,alpha)
            monitor reaction whose cross section was taken from
            the literature. The average neutron flux density
            effective at the sample was then obtained taking into
            account the flux distribution inside the sample. The
            relative flux distribution inside the sample was
            calculated both by Monte Carlo and numerical integrat.
            techniques. The calculated flux distribution was
            finally normalised to the value from the front of
            the Al monitor foil and the resulting absolute
            distribution was averaged. Each flux density was
            weighted with respect to its irradiation time.
SAMPLE     Al monitor foils of 200 micro-m thickness were attached
            at the front and at the back of the tube. Each sample
            was irradiated several times, each time with a fresh
            Al monitor. Each sample was irradiated at
            zero degree direction for between 7 to 10 hrs and 10
            to 20 hrs, respectively. Measurements were carried out
            several months after irradiations and took about 3
            days for each sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron activation technique was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 140 cm3 3 HPGe detector.
           (GELI) The gamma activity of the irradiated samples
            was measured using a Ge(Li) detector.
           Also, it used for measurement the radioactivity of the
           monitor reaction product (24Na). The peak area
            analysis was done using the program Maestro. Due to
            the large dimensions of the sample, the inhomogeneous
            distribution of the activity and the low count rates,
            the detection efficiency was determined following a
            procedure which makes use of counting in various
            geometry arrangements gamma-rays from a standard
            source and from the samples. Self-absorption
            was measured by placing an unirradiated absorbent
            of material and geometry similar to the those of the
            samples between the source and the detector.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) The monitor cross
            sections were taken from IRDF,1990.
DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,15.0HR,DG,1368.,1.)
CORRECTION  The activity of the monitor product was corrected
            for background contributions. The correction due to
            breakup of deuterons on D2 gas was negligible.
            Corrections for background neutrons and for coinciden-
            ce were applied. The latter was estimated from the
            decay scheme and the effective detector efficiency.
