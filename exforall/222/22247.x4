TITLE      -Cross Sections of Eu-151(N,2N) And Tb-159(N,2N)
            Reactions Near Their Thresholds.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Variable Energy Compact CV28
                     Cyclotron at the Institut FOR Chemistry,
                           Yulich, was Used.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) Quasi-Monoenergetic Neutrons of Energy Between
            8.7 MeV and 10.7 MeV were Produced by Bombarding a
            Deuterium Gas Target with Deuterons of Energy Between
            6 and 8 MeV.
INC-SPECT  .The Average Neutron Energy Effective at the Sample was
            Calculated Using a Monte Carlo Programme.
            The Neutron Flux Densities in Front and at the Back of
            The Sample were Determined Via the Al-27(N,A) Monitor
            Reaction Whoo Secross Section was Taken from the
            Literature. The Average Neutron Flux Density Effectve
            At the Sample was Then Obtained Taking Into Account
            The Flux Distribution Inside the Sample. The Relative
            Flux Distribution Inside the Sample was Calculated
            Both by Monte Carlo and Numerical Integration
            Techniques. The Calculated Flux Distribution was
            Finally Normamalised to the Value from the Front of
            The Al Monitor Foil and the Resulting Absolute
            Distribution was Averaged. Each Flux Density was
            Weighted with Respect to Its Irradiation Time.
SAMPLE     .Samples were Made of High Purity Tb4o7 (99.999
            PERCENT (PC) AND 10 G) Or Eu2o3 (99.99PC,4.5G)
            Contained in a Polythene Tube of 1.6 Cm Diameter,
            4.3 Cm Length and 0.1 Cm in Thickness.
            Al Monitor Foils of 200 Micro-M Thicness were Attached
            At the Front and at the Back of the Tube. Each Sample
            Was Irradiated Several Times, Each Time with a Fresh
            Al Monitor. Each Eu and Tb Sample was Irradiated at
            Zero Degree Direction For Between 7 to 10 Hrs and 10
            To 20 Hrs, Respectively. Measurements were Carried Out
            Several Months After Irradiations and Took About 3
            Days For Each Sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Neutron Activation Technique was Used.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) The Gamma Activity of the Irradiated Samples
            Was Measured Using a Ge(LI) Detector. The Peak Area
            Analysis was done Using the Programme Maestro. Due to
            The Large Dimensions of the Sample, the Inhomogeneous
            Distribution of the Activity and the Low Count Rates,
            The Detection Efficiency was Determined Following a
            Procedure Which Makes Use of Counting in Various
            Geometry Arrangements Gamma-Rays from a Standard
            Source and from the Samples. Self-Absorption
            Was Measured by Placing an Unirradiated Absorbent
            Of Material and Geometry Similar to the Those of the
            Samples Between the Source and the Detector.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24-G,,SIG) The Monitor Cross
            Sections were Taken from Irdf,1990.
CORRECTION .The Activity of the Monitor Product was Corrected
            For Background Contributions. The Correction Due to
            Breakup of Deutrons on D2 Gas was Negligible.
            Corrections For Background Neutrons and For Coinciden-
            Ce were Applied.The Latter was Estimated from the
            Decay Scheme and the Effective Detector Efficiency.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error on the Experimental Values was Derived
            Taking Into Account -
           (ERR-1) The Error on the Neutron Flux Density About 8%
           (ERR-2) Error of the Absolute Activity of the Products
                   Counted About 10%. Individual Errors
            Are Combined in Quadrature to Yield a Total Error For
            Each Cross Section Measured. Principle Sources of
            Errors and Their Magnitudes in Such Activation
            Measurements are Described by Quaim Et Al. In Nucl.
            Sci. Eng. 88,143. No Details are Given in Present
            Paper.
