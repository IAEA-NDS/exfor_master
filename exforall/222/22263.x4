FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT)  3.2 MV Pelletron accelerator of the

INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  The machine is pulsed with a pulse width of
            1.5 ns FWHM and a repetition rate of 2 MHz. The
            average beam currents were 7 and 12 uA at and off
            resonance, respectively.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum was measured by time-of-flight,
            using a Li-6 glass detector.
SAMPLE      The target consisted of beryllium-oxide powder,
            contained in a case made of acrylic acid resin. The
            sample diameter was 5.9 cm and the thickness was
            1.5 cm in the resonance experiment and 2.7 cm in the
            off-resonance experiment. The sample was placed at a
            distance of 15.6 cm from the neutron source.
            The absolute number of source neutrons were determined
            using a gold sample, 5.5 cm in diameter and 0.17 cm
            thick.
METHOD     (GSPEC,TOF) Three kinds of measurements were performed:
           capture gamma-ray measurements with the BeO-sample and
           with a standard Au-sample, and neutron-spectrum
           measurements without sample
DETECTOR   (GLASD) Two Li-6 glass scintillator, one located at
            3 m from the neutron source and at 7 degrees to the
            proton beam direction, was used to measure
            the relative average neutron spectrum.
                   A second Li-6 glass detector, located at 1 m
            from the source and at 45 degrees to the proton beam
            direction, was used to monitor the number of neutrons
            emitted from the source.
           (NAICR) Capture gamma-rays were detected with a well-
            shielded anti-Compton NaI-Tl detector, placed at 80 cm
            from the sample and at 125 degrees to the proton beam
            direction. A Li-6-hydride shield was inserted in the
            collimator.
CORRECTION  Corrections were applied to neutron attenuation in
            air, for neutron self-shielding in the samples, for
            neutron multiple scattering in the samples, for gamma-
            ray absorption in the samples, and for the dependence
            of the gamma-ray detection efficiency on the gamma-ray
            source position.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given contain the statistical
                 error, the error of the gamma-ray spectrometer
            efficiency, the error of the relative efficiency of
            the Li-6 glass detectors, the error of the weighting
            function of the gamma-ray spectrometer, the error of
            the standard capture cross section of Au-197, and the
            errors of the resonance parameters of the 434 keV
            resonance.

ANALYSIS   (4PI1A) The capture cross sections were obtained by
           multiplying the 125 degrees differential cross
           sections with 4 pi.
