TITLE      -ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC DIPOLE TRANSITIONS FROM BROAD
            S-WAVE NEUTRON RESONANCE IN VEN-EVEN SD-SHELL NUCLEI.

INSTITUTE  (2JPNTIT)
FACILITY   (VDG  )THE 3.2MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR OF THE RESEARCH
            LAB FOR NUCL REACTORS IN THE TOKYO INSTITUT OF
            TECKNOLOGY WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7 ) PULSED NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED FROM LI(P,N)
            REACTION BY BOMBARDING LI-EVAPORATED CU DISK WITH
            1.5  NS BUNCHED PROTON BEAM (10MICRO-A AND 20HZ)
METHOD     (TOF  )USING A NEUTRON TOF TECHNIQUE GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA
            FROM NEUTRON CAPTURE ON THE S-WAVE RESONANCES IN MG24
            SI28 AND S32 WERE MEASURED (658,180,103 KEV
            RESONANCES RESPECTIVELY). AU197 SAMPLES WERE
            ALTERNATELY USED TO NORMALISE THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAY
            YIELDS IN EACH NUCLEUS AND THUS DETERMINE THEIR
            CAPTURE CROSS-SECTIONS.THE YIELD OF AU197 WAS RELATED
            TO THE ENDFB-V CROSS-SECTIONS BY MEANS OF A PULSE
            HEIGHT WEIGHING TECHNIQUE.
SAMPLE     .CAPTURE SAMPLES WERE DISKS OF NATURAL MG, SI AND S
            WHICH WERE PLACED AT 156 MM FROM THE N-SOURCE AT RIGHT
            ANGLES TO THE P-BEAM DIRECTION. THICKNESS WAS DETERMI-
            NED AS TO GIVE 70PERCENT TRANSMISSION AT EACH
            RESONANCE PEAK
                MG (6.8E-2 AT/B)
                SI (4.61E-2 AT/B)
                S  (3.63E-2 AT/B)
            AU197 SAMPLES WERE USED FOR NORMALISATION OF THE
            CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,NAICR) CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE DETECTED WITH A
            NAI(TI) ANTI-COMPTON DETECFOR (76BY125MM), PLACED AT
            80 CM FROM THE SAMPLE WITH ITS AXIS AT 125 DEGREES TO
            THE P-BEAM DIRECTION. THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS OF THE
            GAMMA-RAY DETETCTOR WAS DETERMINED USING CALIBRATED
            RADIOACTIVE SOURCES, AND AM/BE NEUTRON SOURCE AND THE
            FE19(P,AG) AND AL27(P,G) REACTIONS. LI6H POWDER WAS
            INSERTED IN FRONT OF THE DTECTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE
            NEUTRONS STRONGLY SCATTERED BY THE SAMPLE INTO THE
            DETECTOR.A 102 BY6.4MM LI6-GLASS SCINTIL. DETECTOR,
            POSITIONED AT 7 DEGREES ANGLE AND 1.5 M FROM N-SOURCE,
            WAS USED TO MEASURE THE INCIDENT N-SPECTRA BY MEANS
            OF TOF WITHOUT THE SAMPLE. A 2ND LI6-GLASS SCINT.
            DETECTOR PLACED AT 45 DEGREES WAS USED TO NORMALISE
            NEUTRON COUNTS.
PART-DET   (G    )CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE STORED AS TWO-DIM DATA
            ON TOF AND PULSE HEIGHT.
           (N    )
CORRECTION .CORRECTION WERE MADE FOR NEUTRON MULTIPLE SCATTERING,
            NEUTRON SELF-SHIELDING AND FOR GAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION
            IN THE SAMPLE.
