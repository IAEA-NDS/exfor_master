TITLE      -NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS OF TE-122, TE-123, AND TE-124
            BETWEEN 1 AND 60 KEV.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE KARLSRUHE PULSED 3.7 MV VAN DE GRAAFF
            ACCELERATOR. THE PULSE WIDTH WAS 0.7 NS, THE REPETI-
            TION RATE WAS 1 MHZ, AND THE AVERAGE PROTON BEAM
            CURRENT WAS 6 MICROAMPS.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 0.5
            MG/CM2 METALLIC LITHIUM TARGET ON A 0.2 MM THICK
            COPPER BACKING. THE PROTON ENERGY WAS 1.912 MEV.
            THE NEUTRON FLUX AT THE SAMPLE POSITION WAS 3.0E+07
            NEUTRONS/SEC.
INC-SPECT  .A CONTINUOUS NEUTRON SPECTRUM WITH A MAXIMUM ENERGY
            OF AROUND 106 KEV. THE NEUTRONS WERE KINEMATICALLY
            COLLIMATED WITHIN A CONE OF 120 DEGREES OPENING ANGLE.
SAMPLE     .A 368.7 MG METAL GOLD SAMPLE, 0.25 MM THICK, WAS USED
            FOR MEASURING THE NEUTRON FLUX.
           .THE BACKGROUND WAS DETERMINED BY MEASUREMENTS WITHOUT
            SAMPLE, AND WITH A 87.3 MG GRAPHITE SAMPLE, 0.6 MM
            THICK, FOR THE STUDY OF SCATTERING EFFECTS.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE NEUTRON ENERGIES WERE DETERMINED WITH TIME-
            OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
           (GSPEC) IN-BEAM GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY.
DETECTOR   (MOXR ) THE CAPTURE EVENTS WERE DETECTED BY THREE
            MOXON-RAE DETECTORS WITH DIFFERENT CONVERTERS. THEY
            WERE POSITIONED 70 MM FROM THE SAMPLE AND AT AN ANGLE
            OF 120 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE PROTON BEAM.
            BISMUTH, GRAPHITE AND A BISMUTH-GRAPHITE MIXTURE WERE
            USED AS CONVERTERS. THE INTRINSIC TIME RESOLUTION WAS
            600 PS, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL TIME RESOLUTION OF
            BETTER THAN 1 NS IN THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT SPECTRA.
           (GLASD) A LI-6 GLASS DETECTOR, LOCATED AT 0 DEGREES AND
            AT 26 CM DOWNSTREAM OF THE NEUTRON TARGET, WAS USED TO
            MONITOR THE NEUTRON SPECTRA. IT WAS ALSO USED FOR THE
            TOTAL CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENTS.
PART-DET   (G    )
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,MACKLIN,W,MACKLIN,82) THE STANDARD GOLD CAPTURE
            CROSS SECTION AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY WAS TAKEN FROM
            MACKLIN, AND
           (,RATYNSKI+,J,PR/C,37,595,88) NORMALIZED TO THE MORE
            PRECISE CROSS SECTION DATA POINT AT KT = 25 KEV FROM
            RATYNSKI AND KAEPPELER.
CORRECTION .THE TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS WERE CORRECTED FOR A TIME-
            DEPENDENT BACKGROUND.
           .THE CAPTURE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR THE VARIOUS TRANS-
            MISSIONS THROUGH THE SAMPLES TO THE MONITOR. THE DATA
            WERE FURTHER CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND, MEASURED WITH
            AN EMPTY SAMPLE FRAME, AND FOR SAMPLE-SCATTERED NEU-
            TRONS, STUDIED WITH THE GRAPHITE SAMPLE. CORRECTIONS
            WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING, NEUTRON
            SELF-SHIELDING, GAMMA-RAY SELF-SHIELDING, ISOTOPIC
            IMPURITIES, AND DETECTOR EFFICIENCY.
