TITLE      -ACTIVATION CROSS SECTION FOR THE GENERATION OF
           LONG-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES OF IMPORTANCE IN FUSION
           REACTION TECHNOLOGY.
FACILITY   .THE NEUTRON GENERATOR, RTNS-II, OF THE LAWRENCE
            LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY WAS USED FOR THE
            IRRADIATION OF THE SAMPLES.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) A 14 MEV INTENCE NEUTRON SOURCE WAS PRODUCED
            BY BOMBARDING A TRITIUM TARGET WITH  360 KEV
            DEUTERONS GIVING A MAXIMUM NEUTRON ENERGY OF 15.6 MEV.
INC-SPECT  .A PACKAGE OF VARIOUS MATERIALS WAS SUBJECTED TO A
            NEUTRON FLUENCE OF 10E18 N/CM2 OVER A PERIOD OF
            TEN DAYS.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES CONSISTED OF ONE 15 MM DIAMETER FOIL EACH
            OF HAFNIUM, TANTALUM, TUNGTEN, TITANIUM AND LOW
            ACTIVATION STAINLESS STEEL, TOGETHER WITH NEUTRON
            FLUENCE MONITOR FOILS OF NICKEL, COBALT, MANGANESE
            AND COPPER. ALL FOILS WERE PACHAGED TOGETHER AND
            WRAPPED IN THIN ALUMIUNIUM FOIL, FORMING A 6 MM THICK
            PACHAGE. THERE HENCE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FLUX GRADIANT
            BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK. THE PACKAGE WAS SHIPPED
            TO THE UK FOR THE ACTIVATION ANALYSIS MEASUREMENTS.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE NEUTRON ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE GAMMA ACTIVITY OF THE IRRADIATED SAMPLES
            WAS MEASURED USING A GELI DETECTOR CONNECTED TO A 4K
            MCA CONNECTED TO A VAX COMPUTER. THE ENERGY AND EFFI-
            CIENCY CALIBRATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT USING STANDARD
            SOURCES.

            SO FAR ONLY THE NICKEL MONITOR FOILS HAVE BEEN USED
            IN THE ANALYSIS
CORRECTION .DEAD TIME CORRECTIONS WERE AUTOMATICALLY CARRIED OUT
            DURING COUNTING.
