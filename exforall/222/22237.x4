TITLE       -NEUTRON TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS OF PU-239 FROM TRANSMIS-
            SION MEASUREMENTS IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 1 TO 500 KEV.
AUTHOR     (H.DERRIEN)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNJAE)
FACILITY   (LINAC) THE OAK RIDGE ELECTRON LINAC (ORELA) WAS USED
            AS A PULSED NEUTRON SOURCE IN A HIGH RESOLUTION TRANS-
            MISSION EXPERIMENT BY HARVEY ET AL.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 0.5EV TO 500 EV
            WERE PRODUCED BY SPALLATION REACTION USING ORELA.
            THE ACCELERATOR PULSE WIDTH WAS 16NS.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY TOF TECHNIQUES.
            THE FLIGHT PATH LENGTH 80.394M AND THE TOF CHANNEL
            WIDTH 8 TO 64NS.
METHOD     .HIGH RESOLUTION TRANSMISSION MEASUREMNENTS WERE
            CARRIED OUT BY HARVEY ET AL. ANALYSIS AND CORRECTIONS
            FOR RESONANCE SELF-SHIELDING TO YIELD AVERAGE
            CORRECTED TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR PU239 WERE CARRIED
            OUT BY DERRIEN USING DATA OBTAINED WITH VARIOUS SAMPLE
            THICKNESSES. MONTE CARLO METHOD WAS USED OBTAIN
            RESONANCE PARAMETERS AND THUS SIMULATE THE TRUE AND
            EFFECTIVE X-SECTIONS. CALCULATIONS, INCLUDING DOPPLER
            AND RESOLUTION BROADENING WERE DONE USING THE CODE
            SAMMY.
SAMPLE     .THREE PU239 SAMPLES OF THICKNESS 0.00646, 0.01825 AND
            0.07471 AT/B WERE USED. THE SAMPLE EFFECTIVE
            TEMPERATURE WAS 106(5)K.

CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.
            1) BACKGROUND
            2) SELF-SHIELDING
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS.
           THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ON THE TRANSMISSION DATA
             WERE  AS FOLLOWS
             1 PERCENT FROM NORMALISATION FACTOR
             0.3 PERCENT ON TRANSMISSION BETWEEN RESONANCES
             FROM BACKGROUND EVALUATION.
COMMENT    .HERE DERRIEN CORRECTS AND EXTRAPOLATES RESULTS OF
            TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT BY HARVEY ET AL.
