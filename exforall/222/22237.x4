TITLE       -Neutron total cross sections of Pu-239 from transmis-
            sion measurements in the energy range of 1 to 500 keV.

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) The Oak Ridge electron linac (ORELA)
            was used as a pulsed neutron source in a high
            resolution transmission experiment by Harvey et al.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons in the energy range 0.5eV to 500 eV
            were produced by spallation reaction using ORELA.
            The accelerator pulse width was 16ns.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum was measured by TOF techniques.
METHOD     (TOF) The flight path length 80.394m and the TOF
            channel width 8 to 64ns.
           (TRN) High resolution transmission measurements were
            carried out by Harvey et Al. Analysis and corrections
            for resonance self-shielding to yield average
            corrected total cross sections for Pu239 were carried
            out by Derrien using data obtained with various sample
            thicknesses. MONTE CARLO method was used to obtain
            resonance parameters and thus simulate the true and
            effective X-sections. Calculations, including Doppler
            and resolution broadening were done using the code
            SAMMY.
SAMPLE      Three Pu239 samples of thickness 0.00646, 0.01825 and
            0.07471 at/B were used. The sample effective
            temperature was 106(5)K.

CORRECTION  The data were corrected for the following effects.
            1) background
            2) self-shielding
ERR-ANALYS  Statistical uncertainties and systematic errors.
            The systematic errors on the transmission data
             of Harvey were  as follows
                   -1 % from normalization factor
                   -0.3 % on transmission between resonances
             from background evaluation.
                   -Error due to self-shielding correction.
                  -Cross section error due to systematic error on
            transmission measurements.
             Statistical error was negligible.
             -Absolute total error due to extrapolation (including
            systematic error on transmission measurement).
COMMENT     Here Derrien corrects and extrapolates results of
            transmission measurements carried out by Harvey et al.
            at Oak Ridge and presented by Harvey et al at
            proceedings  of the international Conf. for Nucl.Data
            for Science and Technol., Mito 1988,page 115, JAERI.
ANALYSIS    Resonance parameters from REL-REF were used to test
            method by calculation of average effective cross
            sections of three samples and total cross section in
             8 energy intervals (Table2 of reference).
             To derive extrapolated to zero-thickness cross
             sections in energy range 1.-10.keV the average exp.
            effective cross sections from three samples
            transmissions were used.In energy range 10. - 500.keV
            the average effective cross sections from thick sample
            transmission were used.
