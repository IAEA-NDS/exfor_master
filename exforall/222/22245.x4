TITLE       Gamma-ray and delayed neutron branching data for the
           new or little known isotopes Ge-84,85 and As-84,85

FACILITY    Mass separation of fission products was obtained
            using the OSIRIS facility located in Studsvik. The ion
            source was run in a high temperature plasma mode.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
           (BSPEC)
DETECTOR    Beta and gamma-ray detectors were used to measure
            the absolute intensities in a series of dual multi-
            spectrum scaling experiments. No details are given
            in this short note.
PART-DET   (DG)
           (B)
SAMPLE      Isobars a equal 84 and 85 which consist of Ge, As, Se
            and Br samples were obtained by mass separation of
            fission products
CORRECTION  The beta-detection was corrected for its gamma-ray
            response.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) A possible 10% systematic on
            calibration uncertainty is included in DATA-ERR.
