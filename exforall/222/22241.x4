TITLE      -INTERACTION OF SLOW NEUTRONS WITH NUCLIDES OF SC, TI,
            V AND MN.
FACILITY   (REAC ) OPEN POOL REACTOR WITH THERMAL POWER OF 4MW,FRM
INC-SOURCE (REAC )SLOW NEUTRONS (0.57MEV) WERE SCATTERED AT SMALL
             ANGLES BY CHRISTIENSON FILTERS.
            A SET OF CONTINUOUSLY ROTATING DISKS OF RESONANCE
            ACTIVATION DETECTORS (RU AND AG) SELECTED
            THE 1.26 EV AND 5.19EV NEUTRONS. THE MONO-ENERGETIC
            NEUTRONS OF 18.6 EV AND 128 EV WERE SEPARATED IN A
            TANGENTIAL BEAM TUBE BY THE RESONANCE SCATTERING TECH-
            NIQUE USING W AND CO FOILS. A 1970 EV NEUTRON BEAM
            WAS PRODUCED BY A RESONANCE SCATTER OF CU63 IN
            COMBINATION WITH SE80 TARGET AND OTHER FILTERS.
SAMPLE     .NATURAL AND ISOTOPICALLY ENRICHED TI, V AND MN AND SC
            COMPOUNDS WERE USED. FOR TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS,
            SOLID SAMPLES WERE USED. THE SOLID SAMPLES OF TI AND
            V HAD A METALLIC PURITY OF 99.95 PERCENT (PC) AND
            99.97 PC, RESPECTIVELY. THE TYPICAL HIGH IMPURITIES
            OF SC SAMPLES WERE 3.3 WEIGHT PC W AND 2.2 PC
            TA (FROM CONTAINERS). OTHER METAL IMPURITIES WERE LESS
            THAN 1PC, LESS THAN 0.1PC FOR RARE EARTHS.
            SAMPLES WERE HEATED TO 1700 K IN ULTRA HIGH VACUUM.
            FOR CHRISTIANSEN MEASUREMENTS POWDER SAMPLES (OXIDES
            OR OTHER COMPOUNDS) WITH METALLIC PURITIES MORE THAN
            99.7 PC WERE USED.
METHOD     (CHRFL) CHRISTIANSEN FILTERS CONSISTING OF POWDERED
            SAMPLE WITHIN VARIOUS MIXTURES OF LIQUIDS WITH WELL
            KNOWN SCATTERING DENSITY WERE USED. TRANSMISSION
            MEASUREMENTS WERE ALSO CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE
            TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN )BF3 DETECTORS USED. NO DETAILS GIVEN.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
