TITLE       Longitudinal asymmetry and gamma-ray angular distribu-
            tion in neutron radiative capture reactions
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNKTO) The KENS (KEK spallation neutron
            source) facility was used.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) A pulsed (20 Hz) 500 MeV proton beam
            bombarded U target to produce neutrons by spallation.
            A dynamically polarized proton filter  was placed at
            5.2 m from the neutron source. Incident neutrons were
            transversely polarized (70% at En=1 eV) upon
            transmission through filter. The neutron polarization
            was determined by measuring the neutron transmittance
            of the filter. The neutron spin was reversed every
            4 sec by reversing the magnetic field. The neutron
            beam was collimated to 1.8 cm diam.  The intensity was
            monitored by counting the capture gamma-rays from an
            annular indium foil. The neutron energy was determined
            by TOF technique.
SAMPLE      La-139 target was a metal column 2.5 cm in diam.
            and 3 cm in height. As the bromine target, carbon
            tetrabromide of the same size was used. All Cd-111,
            Nb-93, Pd-108 and Sn-124 targets were metal disks with
            thickness 1.15,2.5,0.7 and 3 cm respectively.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) For the 1st type of measurements (see method)
            3 sets of BaF2 gamma-ray counters were used
            covering 85% of 4pi steradians.
            B4C was used to absorb neutrons scattered from target.
            In the 2nd and 3rd types of measurements, BGO scin.
            crystals were used.
            In all measurements, the neutron energy spectrum was
            measured using a B-10 loaded liquid scin. placed at
            9.4 m from the neutron source (0 degree angle)

REACTION   (57-LA-139(N,G)57-LA-140,LON,POL,,DSP/ASY/MSC)
             Polarization asymmetry for longitudinal polarization
             at resonance
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectrometry methods were used
            whereby capture gamma-rays were recorded. Three
            different types of measurements were used for the
            determination of the asymmetry Al
             1) Al was measured in a large solid angle.
                The capture gamma-rays were counted by a multi-
                channel-scaler against the neutron TOF which
                determined the neutron energy.
             2) The angular distribution of gamma-rays was
                measured from which were extracted all parameters
                making up Al. Thus Al was extracted
