FACILITY   .THE KENS (KEK SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE) FACILITY WAS
            USED.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) A PULSED (20 HZ) 500 MEV PROTON BEAM BEAM
            BOMBARDED U TARGET TO PRODUCE NEUTRONS BY SPALLATION.
            A DYNAMICALLY POLARISED PROTON FILTER  WAS PLACED AT
            5.2 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE. INCIDENT NEUTRONS WERE
            TRANSVERSELY POLARISED (70PERCENT AT EN=1 EV) UPON
            TRANSMISSION THROUGH FILTER. THE NEUTRON POLARISATION
            WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE NEUTRON TRANSMITTANCE
            OF THE FILTER. THE NEUTRON SPIN WAS REVERSED EVERY 4 S
            BY REVERSING THE MAGNETIC FIELD. THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS
            COLLIMATED TO 1.8 CM DIAMTER.  THE INTENSITY WAS MONI-
            TORED BY COUNTING THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS FROM AN ANNU-
            LAR INDIUM FOIL. THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY
            TOF TECHNIQUE.
METHOD     (GSPEC) GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY METHODS WERE USED
            WHEREBY CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE RECORDED. THREE
            DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS WERE USED FOR THE
            DETERMINATION OF THE ASYMMETRY AL
             1) AL WAS MEASURED IN A LARGE SOLID ANGLE.
                THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE COUNTED BY A MULTI-
                CHANNEL-SCALER AGAINST THE NEUTRON TOF WHICH
                DETERMINED THE NEUTRON ENERGY.
             2) THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF GAMMA-RAYS WAS
                MEASURED FROM WHICH WERE EXTRACTED ALL PARAMATERS
                MAKING UP AL . THUS AL WAS EXTRACTED
             3) AL WAS MEASURED IN TWO SPECIFIC ANGLES SUCH THAT
                COS2(THETA)-1/3=0
FLAG       (1.) 1ST TYPE OF MEASUREMENT (SEE METHOD FOR DETAILS)
           (2.) 2ND TYPE
           (3.) 3RD TYPE
SAMPLE     .LA 139 TARGET WAS A METAL COLUMN 2.5 CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 3 CM IN HEIGHT. AS THE BROMINE TARGET, CARBON
            TETRABROMIDE OF THE SAME SIZE WAS USED. ALL CD111,
            NB93, PD108 AND SN124 TARGETS WERE METAL DISKS WITH
            THICKNESS 1.15,2.5,0.7 AND 3 CM RESPECTIVELY.
DETECTOR   (SCIN )FOR THE 1ST TYPE OF MEASUREMENTS (SEE METHOD)
            3 SETS OF BAF2 GAMMA-RAY COUNTERS WERE USED
            COVERING 85PERCENT OF 4PI STERADIANS. B4C WAS USED TO
            ABSORB NEUTRONS SCATTERED FROM TARGET.
            IN THE 2ND AND 3RD TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS, BGO SCIN
            CRYSTALS WERE USED.
            IN ALL MEASUREMENTS, THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM WAS
            MEASURED USING A B10 LOADED LIQUID SCIN PLACED AT 9.4
            M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE (0 DEGREE ANGLE)
PART-DET   (G    )TOF SPECTRA OF CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE STORED.
