TITLE      -LONGITUDINAL ASYMMETRY AND GAMMA-RAY ANGULAR DISTRIBU-
            TION IN NEUTRON RADIATIVE CAPTURE REACTIONS.
FACILITY   .THE KENS (KEK SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE) FACILITY WAS
            USED.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) A PULSED (20 HZ) 500 MEV PROTON BEAM BEAM
            BOMBARDED U TARGET TO PRODUCE NEUTRONS BY SPALLATION.
            A DYNAMICALLY POLARISED PROTON FILTER  WAS PLACED AT
            5.2 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE. INCIDENT NEUTRONS WERE
            TRANSVERSELY POLARISED (70% AT EN=1 EV) UPON
            TRANSMISSION THROUGH FILTER. THE NEUTRON POLARISATION
            WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE NEUTRON TRANSMITTANCE
            OF THE FILTER. THE NEUTRON SPIN WAS REVERSED EVERY 4 S
            BY REVERSING THE MAGNETIC FIELD. THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS
            COLLIMATED TO 1.8 CM DIAMTER.  THE INTENSITY WAS MONI-
            TORED BY COUNTING THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS FROM AN ANNU-
            LAR INDIUM FOIL. THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY
            TOF TECHNIQUE.
SAMPLE     .LA 139 TARGET WAS A METAL COLUMN 2.5 CM IN DIAMETER
            AND 3 CM IN HEIGHT. AS THE BROMINE TARGET, CARBON
            TETRABROMIDE OF THE SAME SIZE WAS USED. ALL CD111,
            NB93, PD108 AND SN124 TARGETS WERE METAL DISKS WITH
            THICKNESS 1.15,2.5,0.7 AND 3 CM RESPECTIVELY.
DETECTOR   (SCIN )FOR THE 1ST TYPE OF MEASUREMENTS (SEE METHOD)
            3 SETS OF BAF2 GAMMA-RAY COUNTERS WERE USED
            COVERING 85% OF 4PI STERADIANS. B4C WAS USED TO
            ABSORB NEUTRONS SCATTERED FROM TARGET.
            IN THE 2ND AND 3RD TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS, BGO SCIN
            CRYSTALS WERE USED.
            IN ALL MEASUREMENTS, THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM WAS
            MEASURED USING A B10 LOADED LIQUID SCIN PLACED AT 9.4
            M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE (0 DEGREE ANGLE)
