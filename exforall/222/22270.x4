                            compact cyclotron CV28.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) Quasimonoenergetic neutron were produced at
            0 degr. with the D-D reaction, using a D2 gas target.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A conventional GeLi detector was used for
            activity measurements from Sc-50.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for contributions from back-
            ground neutrons, e.g. gas-out/gas-in and breakup of
            deuterons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T   ) Total error. The major uncertainties
                      and their correlations are given below.
