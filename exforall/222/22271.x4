TITLE      -Neutron capture cross sections of light nuclei in
            primordial nucleosynthesis.

FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2 MV PELLETRON accelerator of the
            research laboratory for nuclear reactors at the Tokyo
            Institute of Technology.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a natural
            Li sample, evaporated onto a copper disk, with a
            pulsed 1.898 MeV proton beam. The beam pulse width was
            1.5 ns and the proton beam current 6 - 9 microamps.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum had a most probable energy of 30
            keV. Thermal neutrons were discriminated by time-of-
            flight.
SAMPLE     .The samples were made from natural carbon and natural
            lithium, shaped as disks with a diameter of 5.4 cm by
            1.5 cm thick and 6.0 cm diameter by 2.6 cm thick, res-
            pectively. The lithium sample was wrapped in a Vinyl
            film. A gold sample was used for cross section
            normalization. The samples were placed on the beam
            axis at a distance of 8.1 cm from the neutron target,
            which was sufficient to discriminate gamma-rays from
            the latter with time-of-flight techniques. The mea-
            surements were done cyclically, using the gold and
            carbon or lithium samples, and a blank background.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy.
           (TOF)   Time-of-flight techniques used to discriminate
            background.
           (SITA)  Intermittent sample-monitor-blank irradiation
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Prompt gamma-rays from neutron capture were
            detected with an anti-compton NaI detector, located
            80 cm from the sample at an angle of 125 degrees with
            respect to the proton beam. It consisted of a 7.6 cm
            diameter by 15.2 cm thick central NaI detector,
            surrounded by an annular NaI detector with a diameter
            of 25.4 cm and a thickness of 28.0 cm. The detector
            was shielded with Li, Pb, Cd and borated paraffin.
            The energy scale was calibrated using known gamma-rays
            from Na-22, K-40 and Fe-57. The response functions
            were determined experimentally by calibrated gamma-
            ray sources.
           .The gamma-ray events were stored as two-dimensional
            spectra of time-of-flight versus pulse-height.
           (GLASD) The neutron spectrum was measured with a 6-Li
            glass detector, operated in time-of-flight mode, and
            located at an angle of 14 degrees with respect to the
            proton beam. This detector was also used to normalize
            the different runs to each other.

MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) No cross section
            value given.
CORRECTION .The spectra were corrected for background by subtrac-
            ting a spectrum with a time-of-flight gate outside the
            neutron peak.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
