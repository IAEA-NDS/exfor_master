TITLE      -NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTIONS OF LIGHT NUCLEI IN PRE-
            MORDIAL NUCLEOSYNTHESIS.
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) THE 3.2 MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR OF THE
            RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS AT THE TOKYO
            INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A NATURAL
            LI SAMPLE, EVAPORATED ONTO A COPPER DISK, WITH A
            PULSED 1.898 MEV PROTON BEAM. THE BEAM PULSE WIDTH WAS
            1.5 NS AND THE PROTON BEAM CURRENT 6 - 9 MICROAMPS.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM HAD A MOST PROBABLE ENERGY OF 30
            KEV. THERMAL NEUTRONS WERE DISCRIMINATED BY TIME-OF-
            FLIGHT.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLES WERE MADE FROM NATURAL CARBON AND NATURAL
            LITHIUM, SHAPED AS DISKS WITH A DIAMETER OF 5.4 CM BY
            1.5 CM THICK AND 6.0 CM DIAMETER BY 2.6 CM THICK, RES-
            PECTIVELY. THE LITHIUM SAMPLE WAS WRAPPED IN A VINYL
            FILM. A GOLD SAMPLE WAS USED FOR CROSS SECTION
            NORMALIZATION. THE SAMPLES WERE PLACED ON THE BEAM
            AXIS AT A DISTANCE OF 8.1 CM FROM THE NEUTRON TARGET,
            WHICH WAS SUFFICIENT TO DISCRIMINATE GAMMA-RAYS FROM
            THE LATTER WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES. THE MEA-
            SUREMENTS WERE DONE CYCLICALLY, USING THE GOLD AND
            CARBON OR LITHIUM SAMPLES, AND A BLANK BACKGROUND.
METHOD     (GSPEC) PROMPT GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY.
           (TOF  ) TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES USED TO DISCRIMINATE
            BACKGROUND.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) PROMPT GAMMA-RAYS FROM NEUTRON CAPTURE WERE
            DETECTED WITH AN ANTI-COMPTON NAI DETECTOR, LOCATED
            80 CM FROM THE SAMPLE AT AN ANGLE OF 125 DEGREES WITH
            RESPECT TO THE PROTON BEAM. IT CONSISTED OF A 7.6 CM
            DIAMETER BY 15.2 CM THICK CENTRAL NAI DETECTOR,
            SURROUNDED BY AN ANNULAR NAI DETECTOR WITH A DIAMETER
            OF 25.4 CM AND A THICKNESS OF 28.0 CM. THE DETECTOR
            WAS SHIELDED WITH LIH, PB, CD AND BORATED PARAFFIN.
            THE ENERGY SCALE WAS CALIBRATED USING KNOWN GAMMA-RAYS
            FROM NA-22, K-40 AND FE-57. THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS
            WERE DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY BY CALIBRATED GAMMA-
            RAY SOURCES.
           .THE GAMMA-RAY EVENTS WERE STORED AS TWO-DIMENSIONAL
            SPECTRA OF TIME-OF-FLIGHT VERSUS PULSE-HEIGHT.
           (GLASD) THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED WITH A 6-LI
            GLASS DETECTOR, OPERATED IN TIME-OF-FLIGHT MODE, AND
            LOCATED AT AN ANGLE OF 14 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE
            PROTON BEAM. THIS DETECTOR WAS ALSO USED TO NORMALIZE
            THE DIFFERENT RUNS TO EACH OTHER.
PART-DET   (G    )
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) NO CROSS SECTION
            VALUE GIVEN.
CORRECTION .THE SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND BY SUBTRAC-
            TING A SPECTRUM WITH A TIME-OF-FLIGHT GATE OUTSIDE THE
            NEUTRON PEAK.
