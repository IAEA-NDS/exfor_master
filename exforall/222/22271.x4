FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNTIT) 3.2 MV Pelletron
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Protons (Ep=1.898 MeV, ~9 uA at a repetition
            rate of 2 MHz, pulse width of 1.5 ns) on natLi
            metallic layers evaporated on to a Cu disk
INC-SPECT  Most probable energy of 30 keV. Thermal neutron
            captures were discriminated by time-of-flight.
SAMPLE     Natural reactor grade carbon disk (5.4 cm in diam.,
            1.5 cm in thick)
           Standard Au sample (5.5 cm in diam., 0.17 cm in thick).
           The samples were placed on the beam axis at a distance
            of 8.6 cm away from the neutron production target.
           C, Au and blank runs were done cyclically.
METHOD     (TOF,PHD,PHWT)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 cm (diam.) and 15.2 cm thick NaI(Tl)
            detector surrounded by 25.4 cm (diam.) and 28.0 cm
            thick annular NaI(Tl) detector. Set at 125 deg with
            respect to the proton beam direction and 80 cm away
            from the capture sample.
           (GLASD) 4.5 x 4.5 x 0.1 cm3 6Li glass time-of-flight
            detector. Set at 14 deg with respect to the proton
            beam.
CORRECTION Corrected for
            - gamma-ray absorption in the sample
            - sample position dependence of gamma-ray detection
              efficiency
            - Neutron self-shielding and multiple scattering
