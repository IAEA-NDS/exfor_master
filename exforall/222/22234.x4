TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF THERMAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS OF
            V,CO,IN,DY AND AU USING NEUTRON SELF ABSORPTION
            PROPERTIES
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) A 5 CI PU238-BE NEUTRON SOURCE IMMERSED IN A
           WATER TANK WAS USED. THE THERMAL FLUX IS ABOUT 1.E4
           N/CM2/S AT THE IRRADIATION POSITION.
INC-SPECT   THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM
SAMPLE     .PURE FOILS OF CO,CU,IN,DY AND AU, OF PURITY GT 99 PC
            WERE ACTIVATED IN THE CONVENTIONAL (SINGLE-ACTIVATION
            AND SINGLE-COUNTING) WAY. THE V FOILS WERE IRRADIATED
            FOR 8MIN, TRANSFERED TO COUNTING IN 1 MIN, COUNTED FOR
            8 MIN AND RETURNED TO THE IRRADIATION POSITION IN 1
            MIN. THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED 5 TIMES- I.E. WITH THE
            CYCLIC ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE. ALL FOILS WERE IRRADIATED
            WITH AND WITHOUT CD COVERS AND THE EPITHERMAL
            CONTRIBUTION WAS SUBTRACTED.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE NEUTRON ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE COMBINED
            WITH A NEUTRON SELF-ABSORPTION METHOD WAS USED.
            FOR EACH ELEMENT, FOILS OF DIFFERENT THICKNESSES WERE
            ACTIVATED WITH THERMAL NEUTRONS AND THE INDUCED GAMMA-
            ACTIVITY MEASURED.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE GAMMA ACTIVITY WAS COUNTED USING A HIGH
            PURITY GE DETECTOR WHICH HAS AN EFFICIENCY OF 12.45
            PC RELATIVE TO A 3BY3 INCH NAI DETECTOR, A FWHM OF 2
            KEV AT 1332 KEV ANS A PEAK TO COMPTON RATION OF 42.
PART-DET   (DG   )
ANALYSIS   .THE GAMMA-PHOTOPEAK AREAS AS A FUNCTION OF FOIL
            THICKNESS WERE MODEL FITTED TO YIELD THE TOTAL THERMAL
            NEUTRON MACROSCOPIC CROSS SECTION, FROM WHICH THE
            MICROSCOPIC CROSS-SECTION WAS CALCULATED DEVIDING
            THE MACROSCOPIC CROSS SECTION BY THE NUMBER OF NUCLEI
            PER CM3.
CORRECTION .CORRECTION FOR GAMMA-SELF ABSORPTION WAS MADE ON THE
            BASIS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHOTOPEAK AREAS BY USING THE
            LINEAR ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS DETERMINED USING
            FOILS OF DIFFERENT THICKNESSES FOR EACH ELEMENT.
            FOR THE V FOILS,NO GAMMA-SELF-ABSORPTION WAS OBSERVED.
