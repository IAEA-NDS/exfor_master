TITLE       Measurement of macroscopic and microscopic thermal
            neutron cross sections of V,Co,In,Dy and Au using
            neutron self absorption properties

INSTITUTE  (2TUKANR)
INC-SOURCE (PU-BE) A 5 Ci Pu238-Be neutron source immersed in a
           water tank was used. The thermal flux is about 1.e4
           n/cm2/S at the irradiation position.
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron spectrum
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron activation technique combined
            with a neutron self-absorption method was used.
            For each element, foils of different thicknesses were
            activated with thermal neutrons and the induced gamma-
            activity measured.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma activity was counted using a high
            purity Ge detector which has an efficiency of 12.45%
            relative to a 3by3 inch NaI detector, a FWHM of 2 keV
             at 1332 keV and a peak to compton ration of 42.
ANALYSIS    The gamma-photopeak areas as a function of foil
            thickness were model fitted to yield the total thermal
            neutron macroscopic cross section, from which the
            microscopic cross-section was calculated dividing
            the macroscopic cross section by the number of nuclei
            per cm3.
CORRECTION  Correction for gamma-self absorption was made on the
            basis of experimental photopeak areas by using the
            linear attenuation coefficients determined using
            foils of different thicknesses for each element.
            For the V foils,no gamma-self-absorption was observed.

SAMPLE     The V foils were irradiated for 8 min, transferred to
           counting in 1 min, counted for 8 min and returned to
           the irradiation position in 1 min. The process was
           repeated 5 times- i.e. with the cyclic activation
           technique. All foils were irradiated with and without
           Cd covers and the epithermal contribution was
           subtracted.
