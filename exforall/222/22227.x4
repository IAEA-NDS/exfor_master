TITLE      -SI-31(2.6H)(N,G)SI-32 CROSS SECTION MEASURED BY ACCE-
            LERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY.
FACILITY   (REAC,2DENRIS) THE DR-3 REACTOR AT RISOE WAS USED
            FOR IRRADIATION OF THE SAMPLES DURING 23 DAYS.
           (VDGT,2DENAAU) THE EN-TANDEM ACCELERATOR AT AARHUS
            WAS USED FOR ACCELERATOR MASS SEPARATION.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL REACTOR SPECTRUM WITH THERMAL AND EPITHERMAL
            FLUXES OF 1.35E+14 AND 0.12E+14 NEUTRONS/CM-2/S, RES-
            PECTIVELY.
SAMPLE     .TWO DISKS OF A SILICON CRYSTAL, 6 MM IN DIAMETER AND
            1 MM THICK, WITH NATURAL ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCE, WERE
            USED. COBALT FLUX MONITORS WERE IRRADIATED SIMUL-
            TANEOUSLY.
METHOD     (ASEP ) THE CROSS SECTION OF THE SI-31(N,G) REACTION
            WAS MEASURED BY DOUBLE NEUTRON CAPTURE IN SI-30, I.E.
            BY THE REACTION CHAIN
            SI-30(N,G)SI-31(2.622H)(N,G)SI-32. THE FRACTION OF
            SI-32 TO SI-30 IONS WAS DETERMINED BY ACCELERATOR MASS
            SEPARATION TECHNIQUES TO (4.57+/-0.27)E-12.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A CALIBRATED GELI DETECTOR WAS USED TO DETER-
            MINE THE ACTIVITY OF THE CO MONITOR SAMPLES.
ANALYSIS   .THE CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED BY USING THE WELL
            ESTABLISHED HALF-LIFE OF SI-31 OF 2.622 H AND A THER-
            MAL NEUTRON-CAPTURE CROSS SECTION IN SI-30 OF
            0.107+/-0.002 B.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60-G,,SIG,,SPA) THERMAL AND EPI-
            THERMAL CROSS SECTIONS OF 37 AND 74 B, RESPECTIVELY,
            WERE USED.
CORRECTION .THE SI-32 TO SI-30 FRACTION WAS CORRECTED FOR ISOTOPIC
            FRACTIONATION OF THE IONS IN THE STRIPPING PROCESS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
