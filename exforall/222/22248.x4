FACILITY   (VDG,2BLGBLG) THE CN-TYPE VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
                   AT THE IRMM IN GEEL WAS USED FOR IRRADIATION.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )
            THE IRRADIATION AND THE NEUTRON FLUX MEASUREMENTS
            HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY LISKIEN IN APPL. RAD. ISO.
            41,83,1990.
SAMPLE     .A 5 G TI METAL POWDER (GT 99.9 PC KOCH-LIGHT UK) WAS
            PRESSED TO A DISC (DIAM 2 CM, THICKN 0.5 CM).
            15 SUCH SAMPLES WERE MADE, EACH OF THEM SANDWITCHED
            BETWEEN PAIRS OF AL SHEETS. FOR THE STUDY OF TI48(N,A)
            REACTION, A CHEMICAL SEPARATION WAS PERFORMED SINCE
            THE PRODUCT IS A LONG LIVED SOFT BETA- EMITTER.
            IRRADIATION WERE MADE AT 8 N ENERGIES FROM 12.6 TO
            19.6 MEV.THE LATTER WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
            DEUTERON BEAM. FOR THE REST 2 SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED,
            PLACED AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AROUND THE SYMMETRY AXIS
            AND THE RESULTS AVERAGED. ONLY 1 SAMPLE WAS DONE FOR
            EACH ENERGY FOR THE TI48(N,A) REACTION.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE NEUTRON ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE GAMMA ACTIVITY FLOLLOWING TI-50(N,A)CA-47
            REACTION WAS MEASURED USING A WELL CALIBRATED GE(LI)
            DETECTOR WITH A 6 PERCENT UNCERTINTY ON THE ABSOLUTE
            ACTIVITY THE ACTIVITY OF THE CA-45CO-3 WAS MEASURED
            VIA LOW LEVEL ANTICOINCIDENCE BETA- COUNTING USING A
            BETA-DETECTOR (NOT SPECIFIED) WHOSE EFFICIENCY WAS
            DETERMINED USING A STANDARD CA45 SOURCE WITH A 12
            PERCENT UNCERTAINTY.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24-G,,SIG) THIS RECTION AND A
            PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE
            NEUTRON FLUX DENSITY. THE TOTAL FLUENCE UNCERTAINTY
            IS ABOUT 3 PERCENT (PC).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) ERROR ON THE EXPERIMENTAL VALUES WAS DERIVED
            TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ERROR (IN PERCENT) ON
            -THE TOTAL NEUTRON FLUX (ABOUT 3PERCENT)
            -THE ABSOLUTE GAMMA ACTIVITY OF THE PRODUCTS
             COUNTED (6PC)                      FOR THE CA47 SAMPL
            -CHEMICAL YIELD AT SEPARATION (8PC) FOR THE CA45 SAMPL
            -COUNTING STATISTICS (LT. 2.5PC)    FOR THE CA45 SAMPL
            -BETA- DETECTION EFFICIENCY (12PC)  FOR THE CA45 SAMPL
