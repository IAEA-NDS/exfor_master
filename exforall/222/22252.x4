TITLE       Measurement of production cross sections of short
            lived nuclei by cyclic activation using a pulsed
            neutron source

INSTITUTE  (2JPNOSA)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2JPNOSA) The Osaka University Accelerator used.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A pulsed 14 MeV neutron source was produced
            by bombarding a tritium target with a D+ beam.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron activation was made cyclic. The duration
            of the bursts was controlled by the D+ beam pulsing.
            The beam controller was interlocked with the activity
            counting system and was designed as to continuously
            change the neutron burst time and the period between
            bursts from 0.3ms to 54.3 ms and 0.6 ms to 108.6 ms,
            respectively.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron (cyclic) activation technique was
            used to measure the cross-sections.
           (TOF) The neutron energy spectrum of the irradiating
            source was analysed by TOF technique using an NE213
            scintillation detector as a monitor.
COMMENT    .At present, the technique is applicable only to
            isotopes that emit gamma-rays.
SAMPLE     .Samples of natural lead were used, positioned at 15 cm
            from the neutron source and at 75 cm from the Ge
            detector. They were either disks of 45 mm diameter and
            2 mm in thickness or hollow cylinders of dimensions,
            28 mm inner diameter, 30 mm in outer diameter, 70 mm
            length and 1 mm thickness.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The gamma activity of the irradiated samples
            was measured using a Ge detector. The detector
            was shielded against direct neutrons from the source
            using iron, concrete, polythene and lead.
           (SCIN) A NE213 liquid scintillation detector was
            positioned at 75 cm from the Ge detector in order
            to monitor the neutron energy spectrum.

            contributions which are expected to be significant.
