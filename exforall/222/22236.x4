TITLE      -THE WEIGHTING FUNCTION OF A NEUTRON CAPTURE DETECTION
            SYSTEM.
FACILITY   (VDG,2ZZZGEL)THE PROTON AND THE NEUTRON BEAMS WERE
            PRODUCED BY THE IRMM (EX-CBNM) 7 MV CN-TYPE VAN DE
            GRAAFF,GEEL, ACCELERATOE. BESIDES (P,G) RESONANCES,
            CALIBRATED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES WERE ALSO MEASURED
            FOR LOW ENERGY POINTS.
INC-SOURCE . THE NEUTRON BEAM HAS 7 CM IN DIAMETER.
SAMPLE     .THE TARGET WAS AN 8 MM DIAMETER METALLIC SAMPLE OF
            IRON ON SILVER 0.05 OR 0.02 CM THICK.
METHOD     (COINC) EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSE FUNCTIONS FOR GAMMA-
            RAYS WERE DETERMINED VIA (P,GAMMA) COINCIDENCE METHOD
            FOR THE NEUTRON DETECTION SETUP. A PULSE HEIGHT
            WEIGHTING FUNCTION IS DERIVED AND APPLIED TO THE
            MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRON CAPTURE IN THE 1.15 KEV
            RESONANCE OF FE56 RELATIVE TO CAPTURE IN THE 5.2 EV
            RESONANCE OF AG109. THE SATURATED RESONANCE TECHNIQUE
            WAS USED.
