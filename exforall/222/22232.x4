TITLE      -RATIO OF P ODD ASYMMETRY OF SEPARTION OF FISSION
            FRAGMENTS IN BINARY AND TERNARY FISSION OF PU-239
            BY POLARISED NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) HIGH FLUX REACTOR AT ILL, GRENOBLE
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) A PU239 TARGET WAS EXPOSED TO A POLARISED
            (DEGREE OF POLARISATION 0.96 PERC) THERMAL NEUTRON
            BEAM OF DENSITY 2E+8 N/CM2/S.
SAMPLE     .A PU239 OXIDE LAYER WAS VACUUM DEPOSITED ON ALUMINIUM
            OXIDE SUBSTRATES, 60 MICRO-G/CM2 THICKNESS. THE ACTIVE
            LAYER IS 24 MM IN DIAMETER AND 100 MICOR-G/CM2 THICK.
METHOD     (COIN,TOF) TERNARY AND BINARY FISSION FRAGMENTS PAR-
           TICLES ARE SINGLED OUT AS THEY ARE COLLECTED IN COIN-
           CIDENCE. SPECTRA OF TOF DIFFERENCE OF TERNARY AND BI-
           NARY FRAGMENTS ARE COLLECTED USING A TIME TO AMPLITUDE
           CONVERTER AND ANPULSE HEIGHT TO DIGITAL CONVERTER.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) MULTIWIRE LOW-PRESSURE PROPORTIONAL CHAMBERS
            (MLPPC) WERE USED TO DETECT FISSION FRAGMENTS WHILE
            A CYLINDRICAL AVALANCHE COUNTER (CAC) DETECTED
            PARTICLES FROM TERNARY FISSION. TOF DIFFERENCE METHOD
            WAS USED TO IDENTIFY LIGHT AND HEAVY FRAGMENTS.
            A COINCIDENCE CONFIGURATION WAS USED.
COMMENT    .THE ACCURACY OBTAINED ON THE RESULT IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH
            TO DETERMINE UNIMBIGUOUSLY WHETHER THE ASSYMETRIES OF
            THE BINARY AND TERNARY FISIIONS ARE EQUAL.
