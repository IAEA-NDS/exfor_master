TITLE      -Ratio Of P Odd Asymmetry Of Separation Of Fission
            Fragments In Binary And Ternary Fission Of Pu-239
            By Polarised Neutrons
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) High Flux Reactor At ILL, Grenoble
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) A Pu239 Target Was Exposed To A Polarised
            (Degree Of Polarization 0.96 Perc) Thermal Neutron
            Beam Of Density 2E+8 N/Cm2/S.
SAMPLE     .A Pu239 Oxide Layer Was Vacuum Deposited On Aluminium
            Oxide Substrates, 60 Micro-g/Cm2 Thickness. The Active
            Layer Is 24 Mm In Diameter And 100 Micor-g/Cm2 Thick.
METHOD     (COINC,TOF) Ternary And Binary Fission Fragments Par-
           ticles Are Singled Out As They Are Collected In Coin-
           cidence. Spectra Of Tof Difference Of Ternary And Bi-
           nary Fragments Are Collected Using A Time To Amplitude
           Converter And Anpulse Height To Digital Converter.
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Multiwire Low-pressure Proportional Chambers
            (MLPPC) Were Used To Detect Fission Fragments While
            A Cylindrical Avalanche Counter (CAC) Detected
            Particles From Ternary Fission. TOF Difference Method
            Was Used To Identify Light And Heavy Fragments.
            A Coincidence Configuration Was Used.
COMMENT    .The Accuracy Obtained On The Result Is Not High Enough
            To Determine Unimbiguously Whether The Assymetries Of
            The Binary And Ternary Fisiions Are Equal.
