TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF FAST NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION CROSS
            SECTION RATIOS OF PU-240 AND PU-242 RELATIVE TO U-235.
AUTHOR     (T.IWASAKI,F.MANABE,M.BABA,S.MATSUYAMA,H.KIMIYAMA,
            N.HIRAKAWA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOH)
FACILITY   (DYNAM) THE TOHOKU UNIVERSITY 4.5 MV DYNAMITRON ACCELE-
            RATOR WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 0.6 TO 1.4 MEV
            WERE PRODUCED USING A 720 MICROGRAM/CM2 LIF TARGET
            EVAPORATED ON A COPPER PLATE. A 840 MICROGRAM/CM2 LIF
            TARGET EVAPORATED ON A PLATINUM BACKING WAS USED TO
            PRODUCE NEUTRONS IN THE 1.4 - 1.8 MEV RANGE.
           (P-T  ) TWO TI-T TARGETS, 600 AND 2500 MICROGRAM/CM2,
            WERE USED TO PRODUCE NEUTRONS IN THE 0.9 - 2.2 AND
            1.8 - 2.7 MEV RANGES, RESPECTIVELY.
           (D-D  ) A D2 GAS TARGET WAS USED TO PRODUCE NEUTRONS
            IN THE 3.6 - 6.9 MEV RANGE. THE COPPER GAS CELL WAS
            10 MM IN DIAMETER AND 30 MM LONG, WITH A 2.2 MICRO-
            METER THICK HAVAR ENTRANCE FOIL. THE D2-GAS PRESSURE
            WAS 1.5 ATM.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY TOF TECHNIQUES.
            SINCE THE SOLID ANGLE FOR THE FISSION CHAMBER WAS
            LARGER, THE EFFECTIVE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS CALCULATED
            USING A MONTE CARLO CODE.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM WAS DETERMINED BY
            TOF TECHNIQUES.
           (FISCT) THE NUMBER OF FISSION EVENTS WAS COUNTED WITH
            A FISSION CHAMBER.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) THE FISSION EVENTS WERE DETECTED WITH A BACK-
            TO-BACK PARALLEL PLATE IONIZATION CHAMBER, PLACED
            ABOUT 3 CM FROM THE NEUTRON-PRODUCING TARGET. THE
            CHAMBER WAS A CYLINDER, 44 MM IN DIAMETER AND 32 MM IN
            HEIGHT. IT WAS FLOWED WITH A GAS MIXTURE OF 95 PERCENT
            AR AND 5 PERCENT CO2. THE SPACING BETWEEN THE ELEC-
            TRODE AND THE FISSION SAMPLE WAS 6 MM, YIELDING A TIME
            RESOLUTION OF 4 NS. THE CHAMBER HAD LOW MASS, WITH AN
            ENTRANCE WINDOW AND ELECTRODE THICKNESS OF 0.1 MM AND
            A WALL THICKNESS OF 1 MM. THE FISSION AND STANDARD
            SAMPLES WERE MOUNTED BACK-TO-BACK, AND ALTERNATE MEA-
            SUREMENTS WITH THE BACK OR FRONT SIDE FACING THE TAR-
            GET WERE PERFORMED. BOTH TIME-OF-FLIGHT AND PULSE-
            HEIGHT SIGNALS WERE RECORDED.
           (SCIN ) A 5.08 CM IN DIAMETER BY 5.08 CM THICK NE-213
            SCINTILLATOR, PLACED ON THE AXIS OF THE BEAM ABOUT 8 M
            FROM THE TARGET, WAS USED TO MEASURE THE NEUTRON ENER-
            GY SPECTRUM WITH THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT METHOD. THE DE-
            TECTOR WAS SHIELDED BY CONCRETE AND WATER.
           (BF3  ) A BF3 MONITOR WAS PLACED ABOUT 6 M FROM THE
            TARGET AT 90 DEGREES TO THE BEAM. IT WAS SURROUNDED BY
            PARAFFIN BLOCKS AND USED TO CHECK THE STABILITY OF THE
            NEUTRON GENERATION.
PART-DET   (FF   )
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
SAMPLE     .FOUR SAMPLES, TWO U-235, ONE PU-240 AND ONE PU-242,
            WAS USED. EACH SAMPLE WAS ELECTROPLATED ON A PLATINUM
            PLATE, 0.3 MM THICK AND 36 MM IN DIAMETER. THE DEPO-
            SITS, 10-90 MICROGRAMS/CM2, WERE SINTERED INTO OXIDES
            TO FIX TO THE PLATES. THE DIAMETER OF THE DEPOSITS WAS
            25 MM. THE NUMBER OF ATOMS WAS DETERMINED BY LOW GEO-
            METRY ALPHA-SPECTROMETRY. THE AMOUNT OF ISOTOPIC IM-
            PURITIES WAS DETERMINED BY MASS SPECTROSCOPY AT JAERI.
            THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION WAS FOUND TO BE (PERCENT)
