INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOH)
FACILITY   (DYNAM) The TOHOKU University 4.5 mv dynamitron accele-
            rator was used.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons in the energy range 0.6 to 1.4 MeV
            were produced using a 720 microgram/cm2 LiF target
            evaporated on a copper plate. A 840 microgram/cm2 LiF
            target evaporated on a platinum backing was used to
            produce neutrons in the 1.4 - 1.8 MeV range.
           (P-T)   Two Ti-T targets, 600 and 2500 microgram/cm2,
            were used to produce neutrons in the 0.9 - 2.2 and
            1.8 - 2.7 MeV ranges, respectively.
           (D-D)   A D2 gas target was used to produce neutrons
            in the 3.6 - 6.9 MeV range. The copper gas cell was
            10 mm in diameter and 30 mm long, with a 2.2 micro-
            meter thick havar entrance foil. The D2-gas pressure
            was 1.5 atm.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum was measured by TOF techniques.
            Since the solid angle for the fission chamber was
            larger, the effective neutron spectrum was calculated
            using a MONTE CARLO code.
METHOD     (TOF)   The neutron energy spectrum was determined by
            TOF techniques.
           (FISCT) The number of fission events was counted with
            a fission chamber.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) The fission events were detected with a back-
            to-back parallel plate ionization chamber, placed
            about 3 cm from the neutron-producing target. The
            chamber was a cylinder, 44 mm in diameter and 32 mm in
            height. It was flowed with a gas mixture of 95 percent
            Ar and 5 percent Co2. The spacing between the elec-
            trode and the fission sample was 6 mm, yielding a time
            resolution of 4 ns. The chamber had low mass, with an
            entrance window and electrode thickness of 0.1 mm and
            a wall thickness of 1 mm. The fission and standard
            samples were mounted back-to-back, and alternate mea-
            surements with the back or front side facing the tar-
            get were performed. Both time-of-flight and pulse-
            height signals were recorded.
           (SCIN)  A 5.08 cm in diameter by 5.08 cm thick Ne-213
            scintillator, placed on the axis of the beam about 8 m
            from the target, was used to measure the neutron ener-
            gy spectrum with the time-of-flight method. The de-
            tector was shielded by concrete and water.
           (BF3)   A bf3 monitor was placed about 6 m from the
            target at 90 degrees to the beam. It was surrounded by
            paraffin blocks and used to check the stability of the
            neutron generation.

CORRECTION .The data were corrected for the following effects.
            1) background due to spontaneous fissions and fis-
            sions by room-scattered neutrons, 2) fission counts
            obscured by alpha-pulses, 3) self-absorption of
            fission fragments in sample foil, 4) non-uniformity
            of fission sample thickness, 5) impurity nuclides in
            fission sample, 6) parasitic neutrons and scattered
            neutrons.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given include contributions from
            number of atoms, the fission reaction rate, and the
            corrections.

SAMPLE     .Three samples, two U-235, one Pu-240 were used. Each
            sample was electroplated on a platinum plate, 0.3 mm
            thick and 36 mm in diameter. The deposits, 10-90
            micrograms/cm2, were sintered into oxides to fix
            to the plates. The diameter of the deposits was 25 mm.
            The number of atoms was determined by low geometry
            alpha-spectrometry. The amount of isotopic impurities
            were determined by mass spectroscopy at JAERI.
            The isotopic composition was found to be:
