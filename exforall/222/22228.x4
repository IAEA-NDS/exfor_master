TITLE      -SOME ASPECTS OF THE CD-111 LEVEL SCHEME.
FACILITY   (REAC ) THE HIGH FLUX REACTOR AT ILL, GRENOBLE.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE NEUTRON FLUX AT THE TARGET POSITION, 120 M
            FROM THE REACTOR CORE, WAS 7.8E+08 NEUTRONS/CM2/SEC.
SAMPLE     .TWO DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE USED, ONE OF NATURAL CD
            CONTAINING 12.5 PERCENT CD-110, AND ONE ENRICHED TO
            95.6 PERCENT IN CD-110. IN BOTH CASES THE PRODUCTION
            OF CD-114 WAS THE DOMINATING PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE
            LARGE CAPTURE CROSS SECTION IN CD-113 (19800 B, COM-
            PARED TO 11 B IN CD-110).
METHOD     (GSPEC) THE DATA WERE COLLECTED DURING 3.1 DAYS IN THE
           (COINC) EVENT-BY-EVENT MODE. IN THIS WAY BOTH SINGLES
            AND COINCIDENT GAMMA-RAYS COULD BE RECORDED.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE DETECTED WITH TWO
            COAXIAL GE(LI) DETECTORS OF 20 PERCENT EFFICIENCY AND
            2.1 KEV RESOLUTION AT 1.33 MEV. THE ENRGY CALIBRATION,
            LINE SHAPES AND EFFICIENCY CURVE FOR THE DETECTORS
            WERE DETERMINED FROM THE KNOWN GAMMA LINES OF CD-114.
PART-DET   (G    )
CORRECTION .THE INTENSITY OF THE 151 KEV GAMMA-RAY WAS CORRECTED
            FOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF A SIMILAR GAMMA-RAY IN CD-114.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
