TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF TH-232(N,2N)TH-231 REACTION CROSS
            SECTION WITH 14.5 MEV NEUTRONS.
AUTHOR     (H.CHATANI,I.KIMURA)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO)
FACILITY   (CCW  ) NEUTRON GENERATOR AT THE KYOTO UNIVERSITY CRI-
              TICAL ASSEMBLIES, KUCA.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A
            CUPPER BASED TI-T TARGET WITH A 212 KEV BEAM OF 20
            MICROAMPS AVERAGE BEAM CURRENT.
INC-SPECT  .THE AVERAGE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY THE REAC-
            TION RATIO OF ZR-90(N,2N) AND NB-93(N,2N), USING 2
            ZR AND 2 NB FOILS AT A DISTANCE OF 1.5 CM FROM THE
            TI-T TARGET. THE REACTION RATIO FOR THIS POSITION WAS
            1.57 FROM WHICH THE CORRESPONDING AVERAGE NEUTRON
            ENERGY OF 14.5+/-0.2 MEV WAS OBTAINED. THE FLUX
            DISTRIBUTION AND ENERGY SPECTRUM OF THE NEUTRONS ABOVE
            6.5 MEV IN THE THORIUM SAMPLES WERE CALCULATED WITH
            THE MONTE CARLO CODE MCNP IN WHICH THE SOURCE NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM, WHICH HAD BEEN MEASURED WITH A SILICUN
            SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR WAS USED AS INPUT.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED WITH CALIBRATED
            SMALL AND LARGE PURE GERMANIUM DETECTORS. THEIR RE-
            LATIVE EFFICIENCIES FOR A 3X3 INC NAI SCIN ARE 10 AND
            30PERCENT RESPECTIVELY. THE ABSOLUTE TH-231 ACTIVITY
            WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARISON WITH THE ACTIVITY FROM
            A 90 PERCENT ENRICHED URANIUM-ALUMINUM ALLOY WHICH
            CONTAINS TH-231.
            THE TIME DEPENDENCE OF THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED
            USING A MODERATOR TYPE NEUTRON DOSE RATE METER LOCATED
            ABOUT 2 M FROM THE TI-T TARGET.

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24-G,,SIG) THE MONITOR CROSS SEC-
            TION WAS THE EVALUATED VALUE AT 14.5 MEV IN ENDF/B-VI
SAMPLE     .THREE POLYETHYLENE PACKS OF THORIUM NITRATE POWDER OF
           ABOUT 500 MG WEIGHT WERE USED. THE THORIUM SAMPLES
           WERE SANDWICHED WITH 0.5 MM THICK ALUMINUM FOILS FOR
           NEUTRON FLUENCE MONITORING. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE
           TI-T TARGET AND THE FRONT SURFACE OF THE SAMPLES WAS
           1.6 CM. THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED FOR ABOUT 7.5 HRS.
           AFTER IRRADIATION THE SAMPLES WERE CHEMICALLY PURIFIED
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR RANDOM, CHANCE AND SUM-
            MING COINCIDENCES. CORRECTIONS WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR
            GAMMA SELF ABSORPTION AND GEOMETRICAL EFFECTS.
