TITLE       Measurements of long-lived activation cross sections
            by 14 MeV neutrons at FNS
FACILITY   (CCW,2JPNJAE) Fusion neutron source facility at JAERI.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  The activity measurements were performed more
            than 1.5 years after the irradiation, using a high
            efficiency Ge detector (115% relative to a 3 by
            3 inch NaI detector). The gamma-ray spectra were ana-
            lyzed using the genie code system. The detector effi-
            ciency was calibrated to a precision of about 3%
            using standard gamma-ray sources.

MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
CORRECTION  The activity measurements were corrected for the decay
            constant, cooling time, collection time, detector ef-
            ficiency, isotopic abundance, gamma-ray branching ra-
            tio, sample weight, self-absorption of gamma-rays,
            neutron flux fluctuation during irradiation and so
            forth.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty of detector efficiency
COMMENT     Preliminary results. Reliable results for the
            Eu-153(n,2n)Eu-152 reaction could not be determined
            because of a too large Eu-151(n,gamma) contribution.

SAMPLE     .Four sets of foil packages, placed at 0, 45, 90 and
            135 degrees with respect to the d-beam, at a distance
            of 30 mm from the T-target. Multiple thin Nb foils
            were inserted in the packages for flux monitoring. The
            neutron fluence was estimated to 1-2. x 10**15/cm2.

SAMPLE      Two sample packages were placed at 7 cm from the d-t
            source. The nominal fluence was about 2.x10**14/cm2.
            The fluence in the sample packages was monitored by
            foils of Ni, Ti and Fe. For absolute fluence
            determination, Nb foils were attached on both front
            and rear surfaces of the packages.

STATUS     (SPSDD,22658008) final data are given with corrected
           half-life (127.yr -> 438.yr). In final publication
            (INDC(NDS-342,19) authors mentioned:" After revising
           half-life of 127 yr to 418 yr, the experimental data
           becomes very consistent with the evaluation at IRK".
