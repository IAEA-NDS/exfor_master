TITLE      -MEASUREMENYS OF LONG-LIVED ACTIVATION CROSS SECTIONS
            BY 14 MEV NEUTRONS AT FNS.
FACILITY   .FNS FACILITY AT JAERI.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  )
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED MORE
            THAN 1.5 YEARS AFTER THE IRRADIATION, USING A HIGH
            EFFICIENCY GE DETECTOR (115 PERCENT RELATIVE TO A 3 BY
            3 INCH NAI DETECTOR). THE GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA WERE ANA-
            LYZED USING THE GENIE CODE SYSTEM. THE DETECTOR EFFI-
            CIENCY WAS CALIBRATED TO A PRECISION OF ABOUT 3 PER-
            CENT USING STANDARD GAMMA-RAY SOURCES.

COMMENT    .PRELIMINARY RESULTS. RELIABLE RESULTS FOR THE
            EU-153(N,2N)EU-152 REACTION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
            BECAUSE OF A TOO LARGE EU-151(N,G) CONTRIBUTION.

SAMPLE     .FOUR SETS OF FOIL PACKAGES, PLACED AT 0, 45, 90 AND
            135 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE D-BEAM, AT A DISTANCE
            OF 30 MM FROM THE T-TARGET. MULTIPLE THIN NB FOILS
            WERE INSERTED IN THE PACKAGES FOR FLUX MONITORING. THE
            NEUTRON FLUENCE WAS ESTIMATED TO 1-2E+15/CM2.
