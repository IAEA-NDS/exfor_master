TITLE      -Measurements of long-lived activation cross sections
            by 14 MeV neutrons at FNS.
FACILITY   (FNS,2JPNJAE) Fusion neutron source facility at JAERI.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  The activity measurements were performed more
            than 1.5 years after the irradiation, using a high
            efficiency Ge detector (115 percent relative to a 3 by
            3 inch NaI detector). The gamma-ray spectra were ana-
            lyzed using the genie code system. The detector effi-
            ciency was calibrated to a precision of about 3 per-
            cent using standard gamma-ray sources.

MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
CORRECTION .The activity measurements were corrected for the decay
            constant, cooling time, collection time, detector ef-
            ficiency, isotopic abundance, gamma-ray branching Ra-
            tio, sample weight, self-absorption of gamma-rays,
            neutron flux fluctuation during irradiation and so
            forth.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
COMMENT    .Preliminary results. Reliable results for the
            Eu-153(N,2N)Eu-152 reaction could not be determined
            because of a too large Eu-151(N,g) contribution.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from the Table in main ref.
           .There are dicrepancies between data given in the text
            and the table of results. The compiled data were taken
            from the table.

REACTION   (13-AL-27(N,2N)13-AL-26-G,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .Four sets of foil packages, placed at 0, 45, 90 and
            135 degrees with respect to the d-beam, at a distance
            of 30 mm from the T-target. Multiple thin Nb foils
            were inserted in the packages for flux monitoring. The
            neutron fluence was estimated to 1-2e+15/cm2.

SAMPLE     .Two sample packages were placed at 7 cm from the d-t
            source. The nominal fluence was about 2e+14/cm2. The
            fluence in the sample packages was monitored by foils
            of Ni, Ti and Fe. For absolute fluence determination,
            Nb foils were attaced on both front and rear surfaces
            of the packages.
