FACILITY   (VDG,2GERPTB) The PTB Van De Graaff generator was used
              for 13 to 19 MeV neutron energies.
           (ISOCY,2GERPTB) The PTB isochronous cyclotron was used
               for 11.5 to 13.5 MeV neutron energies.

INC-SOURCE (D-T)   Monoenergetic neutrons of energy between
            13 and 19 MeV were produced by bombarding a titanium-
            tritium target with deuterons. Neutrons of 14.8, 17
            and 19 MeV were produced at zero degree with respect
            to the incident beam direction. And neutron with other
            energies were produced making use of the energy
            distribution of the reaction.
           . Targets of different thicknesses were used to obtain
            optimum neutron yields.
           . The incident deuteron energy could be specified
            within +/- 2 keV. Using TOF techniques and Monte Carlo
            calculations it was deduced that a negligible amount
            of neutrons were produced between 9.5 and 1 MeV below
            the nominal energy.
           . The neutron energy width was determined from the
            energy loss of the deuterons within the gas and the
            neutron energy distribution was assumed to be
            rectangular.

           (D-D)   Monoenergetic neutrons of energy between
            11.5 and 13.5 MeV were produced with the D-D reaction,
            using a deuterium gas target and the pulsed deuteron
            beam of the energy variable cyclotron. The mean
            deuteron energy within the gas was implicitly deter-
            mined by neutron time of flight measurements using an
            NE213 detector. An uncertainty of 30 keV was achieved.
            The neutron energy width was determined from the
            energy loss of the deuterons within the gas and the
            neutron energy distribution was again assumed to be
            rectangular.
            The D-N and the deuteron breakup reactions on
            molybdenum entrance foil and the gold beam stop
            yielded (15%)  neutrons with energies distributed
            equally over a 6 MeV region below the nominal energy.

INC-SPECT  .The neutron fluence applied in the irradiation of the
            emulsions was determined using a proton recoil
            telescope in a geometry similar to that used during
            exposure of the emulsions. The signals from 2 prop.
            counters and a surface barrier detector were analyzed
            in coincidence to distinguish the recoil proton events
            from the neutron interaction in a 10.085mg/cm2 thick
            tristearine radiator.
            The detection efficiency was calculated taking into
            account the actual irradiation geometry and the
            evaluated N-P scattering cross section. Two moderating
            neutron detectors were used to monitor the fluence
            during irradiation of the emulsions.
            For the cyclotron measurements, the fluence was
            determined using the NE213 liquid scintillator.
            The well known hydrogen content of the scintillator
            was used to normalize to the N-P scattering cross
            section. The total uncertainty was about 3 %, was
            estimated from the fitting procedure, the basic cross
            sections and the hydrogen content.
SAMPLE     .ILFORD C2 nuclear emulsions were used as samples and
            detectors to study the C-12(N,N+3ALPHA).The emulsions
            with a carbon content of 0.277g/cm3 and a thickness
            of 200 micro-meter were exposed at an angle of 13.8
            adeg to monoenergetic neutrons of energies 11.9, 12.9,
            14.0, 17.0 and 19.0 MeV.
           .The scintillator which has a well known carbon content
            is used as a carbon target as well as an alpha
            detector.
METHOD     (ASSOP) The nuclear emulsion technique was used to
            investigate C-12(N,N+3ALPHA) reaction for neutron
            energies of 11.9 to 19.0 MeV. The total and various
            partial cross sections from the N-3ALPHA breakup
            were determined.
           (TOF)  The total cross sections of all reactions with
            charged particles (except carbon recoil protons) in
            the exit channel were determined W.R.T the N-P
            scattering cross section using an NE213 scintillator
            with TOF technique.
           (PHD)   The pulse shape discrimination technique was
            used with the NE213 detector.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) The nuclear emulsions which contain carbon
            as a main constituent are used both as a carbon target
            and as a alpha-particle detector. The simultaneous
            detection of all charged particles of such an event
            yields a kinematically complete measurement. The
            emulsions were developed  by a 2-temperature technique
            after which they were scanned for 3-pronged events
            using a Leitz Ortholux binocular microscope.The
            reaction kinematics was determined by measuring the
            spatial orientations and ranges of each of the 3
            prongs of a star .
           (SCIN) The NE213 scintillation detector also served
            both as the carbon target and the alpha particle
            detector. It was used in assessing reactions with
            very low statistical uncertainties. The response
            of this detector, 2.54 cm in height by 10.16 cm in
            diameter, was measured for monoenergetic neutrons
            applying 'TOF' techniques and compared with Monte-
            Carlo simulations. Elastic and inelastic cross
            sections were taken from ENDF/B-V.

CORRECTION .In the emulsion measurements, corrections were made
            for dead time losses,flux attenuation in air,
            construction materials and radiator backing and for
            a small background peak under the proton recoil peak.
