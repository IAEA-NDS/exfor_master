FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  The high flux reactor at ILL.
           (OLMS,2FR ILL)  The recoil spectrometer lohengrin
            at ILL, which has a resolving power in A/Q of 800.
            a 3 mm wide slit corresponding to this resolving
            power, allows a full transmission.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron spectrum, with a flux of 5.0E+14
            neutrons/cm2/sec.
SAMPLE      A 0.10 mg/cm2 target of Pu-239, enriched to 99.99%
            was used. It was covered with a 0.25 mg/cm2
            nickel foil to reduce Pu sputtering.
METHOD     (OLMS) The fission fragments were focused on lines of
            a given A/Q ratio.
           (REC)
           (RELFY) The mass and elemental yields were determined
            with reference to the well-known A=82 mass yield.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The energy of the fission fragments were
            measured with a two-stage ionization chamber with a
            1% accuracy, providing unambiguously the ionic
            charge and mass number. In the first stage of the
            chamber an energy-loss measurement gave the atomic
            number of the fragments.
           (SI) At the end of the fragment trajectories the
            fragments were implanted into one of eight planar
            Si-detectors of 10 x 10 x 0.5 mm3, where the residual
            energy of the fragments and the energy-loss signals of
            the subsequent beta-decay were measured. From this the
            half-lives could Be determined.
