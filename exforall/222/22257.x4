TITLE      -DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON-RICH CO AND FE ISOTOPES IN
            PU-239(N,F), YIELDS AND HALF-LIVES.
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL)  THE HIGH FLUX REACTOR AT ILL.
           (OLMS,2FR ILL)  THE RECOIL SPECTROMETER LOHENGRIN
            AT ILL, WHICH HAS A RESOLVING POWER IN A/Q OF 800.
            A 3 MM WIDE SLIT CORRESPONDING TO THIS RESOLVING
            POWER, ALLOWS A FULL TRANSMISSION.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRON SPECTRUM, WITH A FLUX OF 5.0E+14
            NEUTRONS/CM2/SEC.
SAMPLE     .A 0.10 MG/CM2 TARGET OF PU-239, ENRICHED TO 99.99 PER-
            CENT, WAS USED. IT WAS COVERED WITH A 0.25 MG/CM2
            NICKEL FOIL TO REDUCE PU SPUTTERING.
METHOD     (OLMS ) THE FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE FOCUSED ON LINES OF
            A GIVEN A/Q RATIO.
           (REC  )
           (RELFY) THE MASS AND ELEMENTAL YIELDS WERE DETERMINED
            WITH REFERENCE TO THE WELL-KNOWN A=82 MASS YIELD.
DETECTOR   (IOCH ) THE ENERGY OF THE FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE MEA-
            SURED WITH A TWO-STAGE IONIZATION CHAMBER WITH A
            1 PER-CENT ACCURACY, PROVIDING UNAMBIGUOUSLY THE IONIC
            CHARGE AND MASS NUMBER. IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE
            CHAMBER AN ENERGY-LOSS MEASUREMENT GAVE THE ATOMIC
            NUMBER OF THE FRAGMENTS.
           (SOLST) AT THE END OF THE FRAGMENT TRAJECTORIES THE
            FRAGMENTS WERE IMPLANTED INTO ONE OF EIGHT PLANAR SI-
            DETECTORS OF 10 X 10 X 0.5 MM3, WHERE THE RESIDUAL
            ENERGY OF THE FRAGMENTS AND THE ENERGY-LOSS SIGNALS OF
            THE SUBSEQUENT BETA-DECAY WERE MEASURED. FROM THIS THE
            HALF-LIVES COULD BE DETERMINED.
