TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF TH-232(N,2N)TH-231 REACTION CROSS SEC-
            TION WITH 14 MEV NEUTRONS.
FACILITY   (CCW  ) NEUTRON GENERATOR AT THE KYOTO UNIVERSITY CRI-
            TICAL ASSEMBLIES, KUCA.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) THE NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A TI-T
            TARGET WITH A 212 KEV BEAM OF 20 MICROAMPS AVERAGE
            BEAM CURRENT.
INC-SPECT  .THE AVERAGE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY THE REAC-
            TION RATIO OF ZR-90(N,2N) AND NB-93(N,2N), USING FOUR
            ZR AND FIVE NB FOILS AT A DISTANCE OF 4.4 CM FROM THE
            TI-T TARGET. FROM THE OBTAINED REACTION RATIO 1.67+/-
            0.04, THE AVERAGE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED TO
            14.7+/-0.1 MEV. THE FLUX DISTRIBUTION AND ENERGY
            SPECTRUM OF THE NEUTRONS IN THE THORIUM SAMPLES WERE
            CALCULATED WITH THE MONTE CARLO CODE MCNP, USING THE
            OKTAVIAN SOURCE NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .THREE POLYETHYLENE PACKS OF THORIUM NITRATE POWDER OF
            ABOUT 500 MG WEIGHT WERE USED. THE THORIUM SAMPLES
            WERE SANDWICHED WITH 0.5 MM THICK ALUMINUM FOILS FOR
            NEUTRON FLUENCE MONITORING. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE
            TI-T TARGET AND THE FRONT SURFACE OF THE SAMPLES WAS
            1.6 CM. THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED FOR ABOUT 7.5 HRS.
            AFTER IRRADIATION THE SAMPLES WERE CHEMICALLY PURI-
            FIED.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED WITH A CALIBRATED
            PURE GERMANIUM DETECTOR. THE ABSOLUTE TH-231 ACTIVITY
            WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARISON WITH THE ACTIVITY FROM
            A 90 PERCENT ENRICHED URANIUM-ALUMINUM ALLOY WHICH
            CONTAINS TH-231.
           .THE TIME DEPENDENCE OF THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED
            USING A MODERATOR TYPE NEUTRON DOSE RATE METER LOCATED
            ABOUT 2 M FROM THE TI-T TARGET.
PART-DET   (DG   )
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24-G,,SIG) THE MONITOR CROSS SEC-
            TION WAS DETERMINED BY INTERPOLATION OF ENDF/B-V.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR RANDOM, CHANCE AND SUM-
            MING COINCIDENCES. CORRECTIONS WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR
            GAMMA SELF ABSORPTION AND GEOMETRICAL EFFECTS.
