TITLE      -Determination of the excitation function of the (n,xt)
            process on beryllium via activation in diverse neutron
            fields and unfolding code calculations.
AUTHOR     (R.Woelfle,A.Suhaimi,S.M.Qaim)
INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Julich Isochronous Cyclotron
            delivered deuteron beams of 17.5, 20.0, 22.5, 25.0,
            27.5 and 30.0 MeV, with beam currents in the range
            0.4 - 3 micro-Amps.
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) Break-up neutron spectra from the d + Be reac-
            tion were used.
INC-SPECT  .Continuous neutron spectra from the thick Be target.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Tritium counting techniques. Tritium was sepa-
            rated from the irradiated samples, after addition of
            H2 carrier, by repeated vacuum extraction at 1150 deg
            Celsius.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) The tritium activities were counted in a
            proportional gas counting tube in an anticoincidence
            arrangement.
           .The monitor activities were determined via gamma-ray
            spectrometry.
SAMPLE     .The beryllium sample, 99.8% purity, consisted
            of two parts, each having the dimensions 1 by 1 by
            0.15 cm, between which a set of 12 flux monitor foils
            was inserted. Additional aluminum and cobalt monitor
            foils were placed at the front and back of the beryl-
            lium sample. The distance between the front of the
            sample and the back of the neutron source was 4.5 cm.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for triton loss via the recoil
            process, using a Monte Carlo code. Corrections were
            also applied for tritons entering the beryllium sample
            from the aluminum cover foils. These corrections
            amounted to 2.5 - 7.5%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total errors.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from Tbl. II of NSE,115,71.

ANALYSIS  1(UNFLD) Cross sections for different energy bins were
            obtained with unfolding techniques, using the infor-
            mation from the runs at the 6 different deuteron ener-
            gies. The SAND-II iterative code was used.
          2(LEAST) Generalized Least-Squares Method, were used.
