TITLE       Average cross section measurement for several
            dosimetry reactions in thick target Li(d,n) neutron
            field

INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOH)  Tohoku University Sendai, Japan
FACILITY   (DYNAM,2JPNTOH) The Tohuku University 4.5 MV dynamitron
            accelerator was used.
INC-SOURCE (D-LI) Intense neutron fields of energy from a few
           hundred keV to 18 MeV were produced by bombarding a
           1 mm thick Li target with a 10 micro-A deuteron beam.
           The targets were made from Li metal melted and
           flattened under vacuum on copper disks.
           Five kinds of samples, AI, Ti, Fe, Ni and Co, were
           placed at 50 mm from neutron source. Irradiation of two
           runs, 10 and 24 hours were performed according to the
           half lives of residual nuclei of the reactions.
           (D-T) For normalisation of the Li+d neutron fluence,
           and was done with the same experimental arrangement to
           the above. The samples of Al, Zr and Nb were
           irradiated for 15 hours.
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum was determined by TOF technique
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron activation technique was used
            to measure the cross-sections.
           (TOF) The neutron spectra were measured by TOF.
            The neutron flux was normalised at 14 MeV by
            measurement of the standard Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24
            reaction rate in the t-d neutron field under the same
            experimental arrangement.The Monte Carlo code, O5S.
            technique.
SAMPLE     .Samples of Al,Ti,Fe,Ni and Co, 19 mm in diameter and
            0.1 mm in thickness, were placed at 50 mm from the
            Li+d neutron source.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma activity of the irradiated samples
            was measured using a 80 cc hyperpure Ge detector.
           (SCIN) A 2 x 2 inch NE213 liquid scintillation detector
            was used as a main counter in the TOF measurement of
            the neutron spectra. A second NE213 detector, of size
            1 x 1 inch, was used as a monitor. Their relative
            neutron detection efficiencies were determined using
            the spontaneous fission neutrons from a Cf-252
            source and a Monte Carlo code.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error on the experimental values was derived
            taking into account the error on the following:
             * neutron fluence;
             * statistical error;
             * neutron energy of time TOF measurement;
             * efficiency of neutron detector;
             * error on normalising by Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24;
             * reaction rate.
