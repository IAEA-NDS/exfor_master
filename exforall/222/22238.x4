TITLE      -AVERAGE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT FOR SEVERAL
            DOSIMETRY REACTIONS IN THICK TARGET LI(D,N) NEUTRON
            FIELD.
AUTHOR     (J.R.DUMAIS,S.TANAKA,N.ODANO,S.IWASAKI)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNTOH)  TOHOKU UNIVERSITY SENDAI, JAPAN
FACILITY   (DYNAM) THE TOHUKU UNIVERSITY 4.5 MV DYNAMITRON
            ACCELERATOR WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (D-LI ) INTENSE NEUTRON FIELDS OF ENERGY FROM A FEW
            KEV TO 18 MEV WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 1 MM THICK
            LI TARGET WITH A 10 MICRO-A DEUTERON BEAM. THE TERGETS
            WERE MADE FROM LI METAL MELTED AND FLATTENED UNDER
            VACUUM ON CUPPER DISKS.
                   FOR NORMALISATION OF THE LI+D NEUTRON FLUENCE,
            NEUTRONS WERE ALSO PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A TRITIUM
            TARGET WITH DEUTERONS.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS DETERMINED BY TOF TECHNIQUE
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE NEUTRON ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED
            TO MEASURE THE CROSS-SECTIONS.
           (TOF  ) THE NEUTRON SPECTRA WERE MEASURED BY TOF
            THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS NORMALISED AT 14 MEV BY
            MEASUREMENT OF THE STANDARD AL-27(N,A)NA-24 REACTION
            RATE IN THE T-D NEUTRON FIELD UNDER THE SAME
            EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT.THE MONTE CARLO CODE, O5S.
            TECHNIQUE.
SAMPLE     .SAMPLES OF AL,TI,FE,NI AND CO, 19 MM IN DIAMETER AND
            0.1 MM IN THICKNESS, WERE PLACED AT 50 MM FROM THE
            LI+D NEUTRON SOURCE. THEY WERE IRRADIATED IN TWO RUNS,
            10 AND 24 HRS, ACCORDING TO THE HALF LIVES OF THE
            RESIDUAL NUCLEI OF THE REACTIONS. FOR NORMALISATION,
            SAMPLES OF AL,ZR AND NB WERE IRRADIATED FOR 15 HRS,
            UNDER THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, WITH A T+D
            NEUTRON SOURCE.
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) THE GAMMA ACTIVITY OF THE IRRADIATED SAMPLES
            WAS MEASURED USING A 80 CC HYPERPURE GE DETECTOR.
           (SCIN ) A 2BY2 INCH NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTOR
            WAS USED AS A MAIN COUNTER IN THE TOF MEAUSUREMENT OF
            THE NEUTRON SPECTRA. A SECOND NE213 DETECTOR, OF SIZE
            1BY1 INC, WAS USED AS A MONITOR. THEIR RELATIVE
            NEUTRON DETECTION EFFICIENCIES WERE DETERMINED USING
            THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION NEUTRONS FROM A CF-252
            SOURCE AND THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF
PART-DET   (DG   )
           (N    )
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) ERROR ON THE EXPERIMENTAL VALUES WAS DERIVED
