TITLE      -Measurement of the Thermal Neutron Cross Section of
            The 90-Sr(N,G)91-Sr Reaction.
FACILITY   (REAC,2JPNJAE) The JRR-4 Reactor at Jaeri.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .Thermal reactor spectrum.
SAMPLE     .90Sr/85Sr mixture target. Gamma-ray emitter 85Sr added
            as a tracer of 90Sr. Sample prepared by evaporating a
            small amount of SrCl2 solution containing 2.8 MBq of
            90Sr and 5.4 KBq of 85Sr in a polyethylene bottle.
            The bottle was sealed and housed in a polyethylene
            capsule together with flux monitor wires of Co/Al and
            Au/Al alloys. The target was irradiated in the reactor
            for 10 minutes. After irradiation, it was purified by
            a cation exchange method.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) Gamma-ray spectrum of the Sr sample measured
            with a HPGE detector having 90% effiCiency. A 5 mm
            thick Lucite sheet was placed Between the sample and
            detector to absorb beta-rays from 90Y. In addition,
            a 4 mm thick lead sheet was inserted to absorb low-
            energy Bremsstrahlung.
