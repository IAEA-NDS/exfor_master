TITLE      -TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE H(N,D)G REACTION AT 39,
            61, AND 76 MEV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO) CYCLOTRON, GIVING 10 MICROAMPS OF PROTONS OF
            42, 65 OR 80 MEV IN BEAM BURSTS OF 1 NS.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 0.5 OR 1 CM THICK NATURAL LITHIUM TARGETS. THE
            PROTON BEAM WAS BENT BY A MAGNET AND STOPPED IN A
            WELL-SHIELDED GRAPHITE BLOCK. THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS
            SHAPED BY A SYSTEM OF THREE IRON OR BRASS COLLIMATORS.
            THE FIRST WAS 1.6 M LONG WITH AN INITIAL DIAMETER OF
            10 MM, THE SECOND WAS 60 CM LONG AND STARTED 4.7 M
            FROM THE LI TARGET, AND HAD A FINAL DIAMETER OF 17.1
            MM, THE THIRD WAS 80 CM LONG AND SERVED AS A HALO
            COLLIMATOR. AT THE EXPERIMENTAL POSITION, 6.7 M FROM
            THE LI TARGET, THE BEAM DIAMETER WAS 20 MM.
SAMPLE     .A LIQUID HYDROGEN TARGET, LIMITED BY TWO 35 MM DIA-
            METER BY 6 MICROMETER THICK ALUMINIZED MYLAR WINDOWS.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE DEUTERONS, PRODUCED IN A NARROW FORWARD
           (COINC) CONE, WERE DETECTED AND IDENTIFIED USING A
            PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR TELESCOPE AND TIME-OF-FLIGHT
            TECHNIQUES.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) CHARGED PARTICLES WERE DETECTED BY TWO NE102
            PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS. THE FIRST, 0.2 MM THICK AND 16
            CM IN DIAMETER, WITH A 3 CM HOLE IN ITS CENTER FOR
            PASSAGE OF THE NEUTRON BEAM, WAS LOCATED AT 50 CM FROM
            THE HYDROGEN TARGET. THE SECOND, 1.5 CM THICK AND
            68 X 64 CM2 IN AREA, WITH A 5 CM HOLE, WAS LOCATED AT
            1.57 M FROM THE FIRST DETECTOR. A 0.1 MM THICK PLASTIC
            SCINTILLATOR, PLACED BEFORE THE HYDROGEN TARGET,
            VETOED CHARGED PARTICLES CONTAMINATING THE BEAM. IN
            ADDITION, A 12 X 3 CM2 AND 4 MM THICK PLASTIC SCIN-
            TILLATOR WAS USED TO DETECT PROTONS SCATTERED AT 7
            DEGREES LAB ANGLE. THE LATTER INFORMATION WAS USED
            FOR CROSS SECTION NORMALIZATION.

MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,SCT)1-H-1,,DA,P) DIFFERENTIAL N-P SCATTERING
            CROSS SECTION AT 7 DEGREES LAB ANGLE.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND BY SUBTRACTING
            EMPTY-TARGET RUNS. CORRECTIONS WERE ALSO APPLIED FOR
            DEUTERON REACTIONS IN THE SECOND SCINTILLATOR AND FOR
            THE DEUTERON LOSS THROUGH THE DETECTOR HOLES.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S   ) ONLY STATISTICAL ERRORS. THE ADDITIONAL
            NORMALIZATION UNCERTAINTY IS LESS THAN 5 PERCENT.
