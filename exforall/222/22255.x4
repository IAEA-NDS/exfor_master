TITLE      -A MEASUREMENT OF THE 22-NE(N,G)23-NE CAPTURE CROSS
            SECTION AT A STELLAR TEMPERATURE OF KT = 25 KEV.
AUTHOR     (H.BEER,G.RUPP,F.VOSS,F.KAEPPELER)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKFK)
FACILITY   (VDG  ) THE KARLSRUHE PULSED 3.75 MV VAN DE GRAAFF
            ACCELERATOR WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED NEAR THE THRESHOLD.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS SIMILAR TO A MAXWELLIAN
            SPECTRUM WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 25 KEV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION TECHNIQUES. THE NE-22 CAPTURE CROSS
            SECTION WAS DETERMINED RELATIVE TO THE WELL-KNOWN
            AU-197 CROSS SECTION IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP
            THE NE-22 ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED RELATIVE TO FIVE
            DIFFERENT NEUTRON CAPTURE REACTIONS ON KR. IN THE
            SECOND STEP THE SAME KR-REACTIONS WERE MEASURED
            RELATVE TO AU.
           .A FAST CYCLIC ACTIVATION SYSTEM WITH A FAST SAMPLE
            CHANGER WAS USED. BOTH THE IRRADIATION AND COUNTING
            PHASES WERE ADJUSTED TO BE 38 SEC.
DETECTOR   (GELI ) THE ACTIVITY WAS COUNTED WITH A GELI-DETECTOR,
            WITH A RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF 28 PERCENT AND AN ENERGY
            RESOLUTION OF 2.4 KEV AT 1.33 MEV. TO OBTAIN A FAST
            CYCLIC TIME, THE DETECTOR WAS PLACED CLOSE TO THE
            NEUTRON GENERATION. IT WAS THEREFORE HEAVILY SHIELDED.
            DURING THE ACTIVITY COUNTING PHASE THE NEUTRON
            GENERATION WAS STOPPED BY A PROTON BEAM STOP IN THE
            BEAM LINE.
           (GLASD) THE NEUTRON FLUX WAS MONITORED BY A LI-6 GLASS
            SCINTILLATION COUNTER.

SAMPLE     .IN THE FIRST STEP, FOUR PRESSURIZED GAS SAMPLES WITH
            DIFFERENT MIXTURES AND WEIGHTS OF NEON GAS, ENRICHED
            TO 99.9 PERCENT IN NE-22, AND NATURAL KRYPTON GAS WERE
            USED. THE GAS CONTENT OF THE FOUR SAMPLES WAS

                      NE-22, MG             NAT KR, MG

                       193.76                 127.38

                       136.10                 155.51

            THE CONTAINERS WERE STAINLESS STEEL SPHERES, 20 MM IN
            DIAMETER, 0.5 MM WALL THICKNESS. FOR BACKGROUND
            DETERMINATION, AN EMPTY STAINLESS STEEL SPHERE WAS
            USED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE KR REACTIONS WERE
            MEASURED RELATIVE TO AU USING ZEOLITE TABLETS, 6 MM
            IN DIAMETER, LOADED WITH 52.7 CM3 KR PER GRAM OF
            SAMPLE, SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO AU FOILS OF THE SAME
            DIAMETER OR AN AU FOIL BETWEEN TWO ZEOLITE TABLETS.
            THE AU FOILS HAD A WEIGHT OF 5 - 10 MG. SIXTEEN
            INDIVIDUAL RUNS OF THE VARIOUS SAMPLES WERE PERFORMED.
CORRECTION .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERROR INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
            STATISTICS, GELI-DETECTOR EFFICIENCY, THE AU-197
            STANDARD, GAS SAMPLE WEIGHT, KR WEIGHT IN THE ZEOLITE,
            GAMMA-RAY LINE INTENSITIES, GAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION, AND
            NEUTRON MULTIPLE SCATTERING.
COMMENT    .THE DATUM GIVEN IS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FROM THE
            COMPARISONS WITH THE DIFFERENT KR-REACTIONS.
