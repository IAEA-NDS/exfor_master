TITLE      -CORE POLARIZATION IN THE 203 KEV P-1/2-WAVE NEUTRON
            RESONANCE CAPTURE BY S-32.
FACILITY   (VDGT ) THE 3.2 MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR AT THE TOKYO
            INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. THE MACHINE IS PULSED WITH A
            PULSE WIDTH OF 1.5 NS FWHM AND A REPETITION RATE OF
            2 MHZ. THE AVERAGE BEAM CURRENT WAS 10 MICROAMPS.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) KEV NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A
            LITHIUM-EVAPORATED COPPER DISK WITH PROTONS FROM THE
            PELLETRON. THE COPPER DISK WAS COOLED BY SPRAYING
            WATER FROM THE OUTSIDE.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT,
            USING A LI-6 GLASS DETECTOR.
SAMPLE     .THE TARGET CONSISTED OF A NATURAL SULFUR DISK WITH A
            WEIGHT OF 57 GRAMS AND HAVING A DIAMETER OF 58 MM AND
            A THICKNESS OF 11 MM. THE THICKNESS ALLOWED A NEUTRON
            TRANSMISSION OF ABOUT 70 PERCENT AT THE RESONANCE.
           .THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF SOURCE NEUTRONS WERE DETERMINED
            USING A GOLD SAMPLE.
METHOD     (GSPEC) IN-BEAM GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY.
           (TOF  ) NEUTRON-GAMMA SEPARATION WAS OBTAINED WITH
            TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
DETECTOR   (GLASD) A 102 MM DIAMETER BY 6.4 MM THICK LI-6 GLASS
            SCINTILLATOR, LOCATED AT 3 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE
            AND IN THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION, WAS USED TO MEASURE
            THE INCIDENT NEUTRON SPECTRUM. THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE
            OF THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS CALCULATED USING A
            MONTE CARLO METHOD.
           (GLASD) A SECOND LI-6 GLASS DETECTOR, LOCATED AT AN
            ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES TO THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION, WAS
            USED TO MONITOR THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS EMITTED FROM
            THE SOURCE.
           (NAICR) CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE DETECTED WITH A NAI-TL
            DETECTOR, 76 MM IN DIAMETER BY 152 MM LONG, CENTERED
            IN A 254 MM DIAMETER BY 280 MM LONG NAI-TL HOLLOW
            ANTI-COMPTON DETECTOR, SURROUNDED BY A HEAVY SHIELD.
            THE DETECTOR WAS PLACED AT 80 CM FROM THE SAMPLE AND
            AT 125 DEGREES TO THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION. A LI-6-
            HYDRIDE SHIELD WAS INSERTED IN THE COLLIMATOR. THE
            RESPONSE FUNCTION OF THE DETECTOR WAS DETERMINED WITH
            THE AID OF CALIBRATED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES, AN AM-BE
            NEUTRON SOURCE AND A FEW NUCLEAR REACTIONS. THE OVER-
            ALL TIME RESOLUTION FOR GAMMA-RAYS ABOVE 0.5 MEV WAS
            3.8 NS FWHM.
PART-DET   (G    )
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,PAR,DA) THE STANDARD AU-197
            CAPTURE CROSS SECTION FROM ENDF/B-V WAS USED.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR NEUTRON SELF-SHIELDING
            AND NEUTRON MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN THE SAMPLES.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS GIVEN CONTAIN THE STAT. ERROR,
            THE ERROR OF THE GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETER EFFICIENCY,
            THE ERROR OF THE TOTAL CAPTURE YIELD OF GOLD, AND THE
            ERROR OF THE STANDARD CAPTURE CROSS SECTION OF AU-197.
