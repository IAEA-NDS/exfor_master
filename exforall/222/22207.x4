TITLE       Backward angle np differential cross sections from
            22 to 50 MeV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERKFK) The Karlsruhe cyclotron and the
            polarized neutron facility POLKA. The beam was pulsed
            at a rate of 11 MHz.

INC-SOURCE (POLNS) Polarized neutron facility POLKA.
INC-SPECT  .Continuous neutron spectrum, distributed from 20 to
            50 MeV. The neutron flux was monitored by a set of
            proton recoil telescopes.
SAMPLE     .The sample was a 30 mg/cm2 polyethylene foil. The
            background was measured using a carbon target.
METHOD     (TOF) The neutron energy bins were determined by TOF
            techniques.
           (COINC) The recoil protons were detected with delta-E-E
            detectors.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,NAICR) The np scattering took place at the
            center of an evacuated 80 cm diameter scattering cham-
            ber, placed at about 6 m from the neutron source. The
            collimated 20 mm diameter neutron beam entered and
            left the chamber through 25 micrometer thick stainless
            steel windows. The recoil protons were detected with 5
            delta-E-E telescopes at various angles. The 12 mm by
            42 mm delta-E detectors, 500 micrometers thick, were
            of the passivated ion implanted silicon type. The E
            detectors were 2.5 cm thick NaI crystals. The protons
            were measured in the lab angle range 7.5 to 52.5 deg.
PART-DET   (P)
ANALYSIS   .The measured relative np scattering cross sections
            were normalized by an iterative procedure, involving
            phase-shift analyses and predictions from the Paris
            potential.
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for cyclotron phase instabili-
            ties, gain changes in the electronics and various
            background effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total  errors given include uncertainties
            from the corrections, systematic differences of the
            detectors and statistical uncertainties, which are
            dominating.
           (ERR-1) In addition, there is a 1% normalization
             uncertainty for the absolute cross section scale.
CRITIQUE   Manfred Drosg (2014-12-03): The measurements of all
           energies were done at the same angle (white spectrum)
           and the center-of-mass angles are the same for all
           energies. This is not possible at these energies, in
           particular for this light target nucleus.
