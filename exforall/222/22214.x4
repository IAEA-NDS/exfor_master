TITLE      -Calibrated fission and fusion neutron fields at the
            Kyoto University Reactor.
AUTHOR     (I.Kimura, K.Kobayashi)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO)
FACILITY   (REAC) Kyoto University Reactor, KUR, with the heavy-
            water neutron facility. Fission and Li-6-D converters
            were mounted in cubic concrete-shielded room, 2.4 M
            from the reactor core. The space in between was occu-
            pied by a large heavy water tank and a bismuth window.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Foils of different isotopes were activated
            using large fission plate or Li-6-D converter fields.

            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and
            1 cm thick aluminum case. Neutrons were produced by
            the D-T and Li-6(T,N) Reactions, using the 2.73 MeV
            tritons generated by the Li-6(N,A)T reaction.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
           Conversion factor - 1.7E-04 .
            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-

            neutrons were evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations,

            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and

INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.

            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-

INC-SOURCE .Thermal neutrons on a pair of Li-6-D converters. Each
            converter consisted of 75 g of Li-6-D powder, enriched
            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and
            1 cm thick aluminum case. Neutrons were produced by
            the D-T and Li-6(T,N) Reactions, using the 2.73 MeV
            tritons generated by the Li-6(N,A)T reaction.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
           Conversion factor - 1.7E-04 .
            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-
            0.07 MeV by using the Zr/Nb method. The scattered
            neutrons were evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations,
            using MCNP code. MCNP calculated spectrum agrees
            satisfactorily with spectrum unfolded by NEUPAC code
            by using variance and covariance data together with

INC-SOURCE .Thermal neutrons on a pair of Li-6-D converters. Each
            converter consisted of 75 g of Li-6-D powder, enriched
            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and
            1 cm thick aluminum case. Neutrons were produced by
            the D-T and Li-6(T,N) Reactions, using the 2.73 MeV
            tritons generated by the Li-6(N,A)T reaction.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
           Conversion factor - 1.7E-04 .
            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-
            0.07 MeV by using the Zr/Nb method. The scattered
            neutrons were evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations,
            using MCNP code. MCNP calculated  spectrum agrees
            satisfactorily with spectrum unfolded by NEUPAC code
            by using variance and covariance data together with

INC-SOURCE .Thermal neutrons on a pair of Li-6-D converters. Each
            converter consisted of 75 g of Li-6-D powder, enriched
            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and
            1 cm thick aluminum case. Neutrons were produced by
            the D-T and Li-6(T,N) Reactions, using the 2.73 MeV
            tritons generated by the Li-6(N,A)T reaction.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
           Conversion factor - 1.7E-04 .
            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-
            0.07 MeV by using the Zr/Nb method. The scattered
            neutrons were evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations,
            using MCNP code. MCNP calculated  spectrum agrees
            satisfactorily with spectrum unfolded by NEUPAC code
            by using variance and covariance data together with
            reaction rates, summerized in Table II.
             Calculated (NEUPAC, MCNP) incident neutron spectra
            are given on Fig.5. NEUPAC spectrum digitized is given

REACTION   (82-PB-204(N,INL)82-PB-204-M,,SIG,,SPA)
INC-SOURCE .Thermal neutrons on a pair of Li-6-D converters. Each
            converter consisted of 75 g of Li-6-D powder, enriched
            to 95.5 % Li-6, and packed in a 10 cm square and
            1 cm thick aluminum case. Neutrons were produced by
            the D-T and Li-6(T,N) Reactions, using the 2.73 MeV
            tritons generated by the Li-6(N,A)T reaction.
INC-SPECT   Fast neutron flux between two Li-6-D converters was
           measured by Al-27(n,a) reaction to be 2.5E+5 n/cm**2/s.
           Conversion factor - 1.7E-04 .
            The average neutron energy was measured to be 14.05+/-
            0.07 MeV by using the Zr/Nb method. The scattered
            neutrons were evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations,
            using MCNP code. MCNP calculated spectrum agrees
            satisfactorily with spectrum unfolded by NEUPAC code
            by using variance and covariance data together with
            reaction rates, summerized in Table II.
             Calculated (NEUPAC, MCNP) incident neutron spectra
            are given on Fig.5. NEUPAC spectrum digitized is given
            in  Subent 007.
SAMPLE     .The samples were sandwiched between two plates of
            Li-6-D converters.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Relative error 5.17 %.
            EN-ERR=0.07 MeV - error of measured neutron energy
            14.05 MeV is mainly due to statistical uncertainty and
            uncertainty in the detection efficiency.
