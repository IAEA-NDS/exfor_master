TITLE      -CALIBRATED FISSION AND FUSION NEUTRON FIELDS AT THE
            KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR.
AUTHOR     (I.KIMURA,K.KOBAYASHI)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNKTO)
FACILITY   (REAC ) KYOTO UNIVERSITY REACTOR, KUR, WITH THE HEAVY-
            WATER NEUTRON FACILITY. THE FISSION AND LID CONVERTERS
            WERE MOUNTED IN CUBIC CONCRETE-SHIELDED ROOM, 2.4 M
            FROM THE REACTOR CORE. THE SPACE IN BETWEEN WAS OCCU-
            PIED BY A LARGE HEAVY WATER TANK AND A BISMUTH WINDOW.
METHOD     (ACTIV) FOILS OF DIFFERENT ISOTOPES WERE ACTIVATED IN
            FISSION AND LID CONVERTER FIELDS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
