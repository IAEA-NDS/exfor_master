INC-SOURCE .AN 80 MEV 10 MICROAMP PROTON BEAM BOMBARDED A
            1 CM THICK NATURAL LITHIUM TARGET. NEUTRONS PRODUCED
            AT 0 DEGREES WERE SELECTED BY A 1.6 M LONG CONICAL
            IRON COLLIMATOR OF 11 - 20 MM ENTRANCE - EXIT DIAME-
            TER. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE TWO HALO COLLIMATORS, 20
            CM LONG AND 25 AND 28 MM IN DIAMETER. THE NEUTRON IN-
            TENSITY AT 2.6 M FROM TARGET WAS ABOUT 6E+6 PER SEC.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE ENERGIES OF THE NEUTRONS WERE DETERMINED
            WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT.
           (COINC) A SCINTILLATOR TELESCOPE WAS USED TO DETECT
            THE PROTONS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) A THIN 0.1 MM SCINTILLATOR OF 3 CM DIAMETER UP-
            STREAM TO THE SAMPLE VETOED ON CHARGED PARTICLES IN
            THE NEUTRON BEAM. 27 CM BEYOND THE TARGET A 12 CM DIA-
            METER BY 0.2 MM THICK SCINTILLATOR, WITH A 34 MM DIA-
            METER HOLE TO PROVIDE PASSAGE FOR THE NEUTRON BEAM,
            FIRED ON CHARGED PARTICLES. 1.25 M FROM THE HYDROGEN
            TARGET A 40 X 40 CM2 SCINTILLATOR OF 1 CM THICKNESS
            ACTED AS A PROTON ENERGY DETECTOR. PROTONS OF ENERGY
            LARGER THAN 33 MEV WERE VETOED BY ANOTHER 40 X 40 CM2
            SCINTILLATOR OF 0.5 CM THICKNESS, PLACED IMMEDIATELY
            AFTER THE E DETECTOR. THE NEUTRON DETECTOR WAS A
            40 X 40 CM2 PIECE OF SCINTILLATOR OF 5 CM THICKNESS.
            A 56 MM HOLE WAS CUT IN EACH DETECTOR FOR THE PASSAGE
            OF THE NEUTRON BEAM.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG)
SAMPLE     .A LIQUID HYDROGEN TARGET WITH A VOLUME OF 35 MM DIA-
            METER AND 5 MM THICKNESS WAS PLACED 2.6 M FROM THE
            NEUTRON SOURCE. THE TARGET VOLUME WAS LIMITED BY 6
            MICROMETER THICK ALUMINIZED MYLAR WINDOWS.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR NEUTRON REACTIONS IN THE
            PROTON DETECTORS AND FOR THE FINITE EFFICIENCY OF THE
            NEUTRON DETECTOR.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)
ANALYSIS   .THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE DETECTOR SYSTEM AND THE EFFICI-
            ENCY OF THE NEUTRON DETECTOR WERE CALCULATED WITH MON-
            TE CARLO CODES.
COMMENT    .ALSO DIFFERENTIAL DATA, WITH RESPECT TO THE AZIMUTHAL
            ANGLE BETWEEN THE NEUTRON AND THE PROTON WERE TAKEN,
            AND IS PRESENTED IN A FIGURE.
