INC-SOURCE .An 80 MeV 10 microAmp proton beam bombarded a
            1 cm thick natural lithium target. Neutrons produced
            at 0 degrees were selected by a 1.6 m long conical
            iron collimator of 11 - 20 mm entrance - exit diame-
            ter. In addition, there were two halo collimators, 20
            cm long and 25 and 28 mm in diameter. The neutron in-
            tensity at 2.6 m from target was about 6.E+6 per sec.
METHOD     (TOF) The energies of the neutrons were determined
            with time-of-flight.
           (COINC) A scintillator telescope was used to detect
            the protons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A thin 0.1 mm scintillator of 3 cm diameter up-
            stream to the sample vetoed on charged particles in
            the neutron beam. 27 cm beyond the target a 12 cm dia-
            meter by 0.2 mm thick scintillator, with a 34 mm dia-
            meter hole to provide passage for the neutron beam,
            fired on charged particles. 1.25 m from the hydrogen
            target a 40 x 40 cm2 scintillator of 1 cm thickness
            acted as a proton energy detector. Protons of energy
            larger than 33 MeV were vetoed by another 40 x 40 cm2
            scintillator of 0.5 cm thickness, placed immediately
            after the E detector. The neutron detector was a
            40 x 40 cm2 piece of scintillator of 5 cm thickness.
            A 56 mm hole was cut in each detector for the passage
            of the neutron beam.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,G)1-H-2,,SIG)
            The np capture absolute cross section (14.2+-0.2 mu-b)
            was taken from current measurements in this Lab
COMMENT     From compiler: Later data are published at
            J,FBS,8,1,1990; but not at the same energy.
             See 22229: 76.2 +- 2.1 MeV => 14.130 +- 0.19 mu-b
SAMPLE     .A liquid hydrogen target with a volume of 35 mm dia-
            meter and 5 mm thickness was placed 2.6 m from the
            neutron source. The target volume was limited by 6
            micrometer thick aluminized mylar windows.
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for neutron reactions in the
            proton detectors and for the finite efficiency of the
            neutron detector.
PART-DET   (N,P)
ANALYSIS   .The acceptance of the detector system and the effici-
            ency of the neutron detector were calculated with
            Monte Carlo codes.
ADD-RES    .Also differential data, with respect to the azimuthal
            angle between the neutron and the proton were taken,
            and is presented in a figure.
