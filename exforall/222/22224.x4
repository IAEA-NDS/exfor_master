TITLE      -ANALYZING POWER IN N + D ELASTIC SCATTERING AT 67 MEV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWTPSI) THE PSI PHILIPS INJECTOR CYCLOTRON
             WAS USED. IT DELIVERES A 0.7-1.0 MICROAMP POLARIZED
             PROTON BEAM OF 72.2 MEV, WITH A POLARIZATION OF 0.90,
             AND AT A REPETITION FREQUENCY OF 17 MHZ, GIVING BEAM
             BURSTS OF 2.5 NS.
INC-SOURCE (POLNS,P-D  ) THE POLARIZED NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY
            THE P-D REACTION AT 0 DEGREES, WHERE THE POLARIZATION
            TRANSFER IS 0.407+/-0.016 AT 67 MEV, THUS GIVING NEU-
            TRONS WITH A POLARIZATION OF 0.37+/-0.015. THE NEU-
            TRONS WERE PRODUCED IN A 1 CM THICK LIQUID DEUTERIUM
            TARGET. THE PROTONS WERE BENT BY A MAGNET INTO A FARA-
            DAY CUP. THE COLLECTED CHARGE WAS USED FOR NORMALIZA-
            TION. THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS SHAPED WITH AN 1.5 M LONG
            0.07 MSR COLLIMATOR. THE POLARIZATION OF THE PROTON
            BEAM WAS CHECKED WITH A POLARIMETER BY OBSERVING ELAS-
            TIC SCATTERING FROM A 200 MICROGRAM/CM2 CARBON FOIL.
            THE SCATTERED PROTONS WERE DETECTED AT +/-44 DEGREES
            WITH TWO NAI DETECTORS. THE POLARIZATION DIRECTION WAS
            REVERSED EVERY 4 SECONDS.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE WAS A DEUTERATED NE213D LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
            CONTAINED IN A GLASS CYLINDER, 4.9 CM IN DIAMETER AND
            6.0 CM HIGH, PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF 2.1 M FROM THE
            COLLIMATOR EXIT.
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE ENERGY OF SCATTERED NEUTRONS WAS DETERMINED
                   WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.
           (PSD  ) NEUTRON-GAMMA PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION WAS
                   UTILIZED.
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) A DEUTERATED NE213D LIQUID SCINTILLATOR WAS
            USED BOTH AS SAMPLE AND AS START DETECTOR FOR THE TOF.
            DEUTERON RECOILS DOWN TO 4 MEV COULD BE DETECTED. THE
            SCATTERED NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN EIGHT NE213 SCIN-
            TILLATION DETECTORS, PLACED SYMMETRICALLY WITH RESPECT
            TO THE BEAM DIRECTION. SIX OF THEM WERE 14 CM IN DIA-
            METER BY 6 CM THICK, WHILE THE TWO BACKWARD DETECTORS
            WERE 10 CM IN DIAMETER BY 7.5 CM THICK. THE FLIGHT
            PATHS VARIED FROM 3.05 M AT FORWARD ANGLES TO 1.10 M
            AT BACKWARD ANGLES. AN ADDITIONAL TOF DETECTOR, NE213,
            5.1 CM IN DIAMETER AND 2.5 CM THICK, WAS PLACED IN THE
            NEUTRON BEAM DIRECTON 5 M FROM THE SAMPLE, SERVING AS
            AN INCIDENT NEUTRON FLUX MONITOR.

CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND AND FOR FINITE
            GEOMETRY EFFECTS.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T   ) TOTAL ERRORS, DOMINATED BY STATISTICAL UN-
            CERTAINTIES. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A NORMALIZATION UN-
