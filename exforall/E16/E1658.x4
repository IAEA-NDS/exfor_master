DETECTOR   (SOLST)to measure alpha-particles, 150 mm2 silicon
                  detector located 135 deg to the beam direction
                  and 11 cm from the target
COMMENT    Absolute cross-section normalization was deduced by
           the known Rutherford cross section and the ratio
           between the solid angles of the two detectors,
           measured with a point alpha-source positioned at the
           target site.
