DECAY-DATA (87-FR-213,34.3SEC,A,6800.)
SAMPLE     - Target-thickness is 0.370 mg/cm**2.
           - Backing: Kapton foil, in order to stop all of the
             recoil evaporation residues produced by the
             reaction.
           - Backing-thickness is 2.0 mg/cm**2.

DETECTOR   (SI) to measure alpha-particles, 150 mm2 silicon
                detector located 135 deg to the beam direction
                and 11 cm from the target
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
COMMENT    Absolute cross-section normalization was deduced by
           the known Rutherford cross section and the ratio
           between the solid angles of the two detectors,
           measured with a point alpha-source positioned at the
           target site.
