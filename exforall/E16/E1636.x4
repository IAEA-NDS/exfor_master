INC-SOURCE Beam intensity: The number of polarized protons
           circulating in the main ring was about 1.0e+9.
           Charge of incident ion is -1. (The H- beam was
           converted into a proton beam by passage through a thin
           carbon stripping foil.)
           (POLIS)Optically pumped polarized-ion source
                  POL-BM: The beam polarization at 500 MeV was
                  0.450 with statistical error about 0.0001. The
                  polarization of the H- beam at the source was
                  about 60+-5% throughout the experiment. It was
                  monitored by a
INC-SPECT  EN-RSL: The momentum spread (delta-p/p) within the
                   main ring was about 0.5 %
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target is CH2.
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Target is self supported.
METHOD     (COINC)Detect positive pion and deuteron in
                  coincidence.
           (TOF)To identify the pp -> pi+ d events
FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNLEP)
DETECTOR   Calibration: The effective analyzing power for the
           polarimeter had been calibrated earlier with asummetry
           measurements in pp elastic scattering. The beam energy
           was automatically calibrated at two energies, 2.333
           and 2.725 GeV.
           (SCIN)A left-right symmetric four-arm detector system
           (SCIN)A monitor scintillation counter located 80 cm
                 from the target at angle 75 deg. was used to
                 monitor the beam conditions (polarization,
                 intensity etc.) throughout the experiment.
ERR-ANALYS The uncertainty in the overall normalization of the
           data comes mainly from the uncertainty in the absolute
           value of the beam polarization, which arises from the
           uncertainty in the effective analyzing power of the
           injection polarimeter, estimated to be about
           plus-minus 0.025.
