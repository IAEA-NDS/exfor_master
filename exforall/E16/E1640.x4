           Detailed description of the system is given
PART-DET   evaporation residues
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target: Fe2O3
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Backing is carbon.
           - Backing-thickness is 0.020 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNTIT) Heavy Ion Linac System
DETECTOR   - Detector resolution: The mass separation of the
             spectrometer has been mainly determined by the
             energy resolution to be delta A = 4 in the A-region
             around 70.
           - Calibration: The beam energy analyzing magnet has
             been calibrated by measuring the sharp peak observed
             at 6.42 MeV in the 1H(19F,alpha gamma)16O reaction.
           (TELES) The t.o.f. counter telescope has two timing
                   detectors which define a flight path of 50 cm.
           (SIBAR) A 100 mm**2 surface-barrier detector (SBD)
                   provides the kinetic energy (E) signal of
                   particles.
