           Detailed description of the system is given
MONITOR    As a beam monitor a surface-barrier detector (SBD) was
           installed at 165 degrees with respect to the beam
           direction.
PART-DET   evaporation residues
SAMPLE     - Chemical-form of target: Fe2O3
           - Physical-form of target is solid.
           - Backing is carbon.
           - Backing-thickness is 0.020 mg/cm**2.
METHOD     (TOF)
FACILITY   (LINAC,2JPNTIT)Heavy Ion Linac System
DETECTOR   Detector resolution: The mass separation of the
           spectrometer has been mainly determined by the energy
           resolution to be delta A = 4 in the A-region around
           70.
           Calibration: The beam energy analyzing magnet has been
           calibrated by measuring the sharp peak observed at
           6.42 MeV in the 1H(19F,alpha gamma)16O reaction.
           (TELES)The t.o.f. counter telescope has two timing
                  detectors which define a flight path of 50 cm.
           (SIBAR)A 100 mm2 surface-barrier detector (SBD)
                  provides the kinetic energy (E) signal of
                  particles.
