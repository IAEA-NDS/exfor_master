           Resonance energies are given.

           The next experiment for resonances at higher energies.
FACILITY   (VDG,3AULAML) 5U Pelletron accelerator.
INC-SOURCE For absolute strength measurements beam current was
           1-1.5 mu-A for 591 keV resonance.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two detectors with 12.7 cm diameter x 15.2 cm
           NaI(Tl) crystals were used.
SAMPLE     (12-MG-25,ENR=0.987) Targets were prepared by
           evaporation of MgO onto either tantalum (for relative
           measurements) or nickel (for absolute measurements)
           substrates.
METHOD     (BCINT,GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   Two types of measurements were made. Absolute
           strength measurements were made for 317, 387, 433,
           591 keV resonances. Relative strength measurements
           were made for all resonances from 591 keV down to
           317 keV.
ADD-RES    (RRATE)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No source of uncertainty is given.
