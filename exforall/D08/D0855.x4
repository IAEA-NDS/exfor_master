FACILITY   (VDG,3AULAML) 5U Pelletron.
INC-SOURCE Beam current was about 1 mu-A.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-rays were detected using an unshielded
           128cm3 detector positioned at 55 degr to the beam
           direction with its front face about 8 mm from the
           target spot.
SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.95) The target consisted of a 2cm x 1.5
           cm section from a 2.8 mm thick sheet of sintered LiF
           was coated with a flashing of gold (about 2 mu-g/cm2).
METHOD     (BCINT,GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   Resonance strength was determined from measurements
           of the 718 keV gamma due to the 1175 keV resonance.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error is calculated by addition in
           quadrature the following errors:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in stopping power.
           (ERR-2) Error of detector efficiency.
           (ERR-3) Error of branching correction.
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in determination of 718 keV gamma
           due to the 1175 keV resonance.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 2 from Nucl.Phys.A318,21(1979).
