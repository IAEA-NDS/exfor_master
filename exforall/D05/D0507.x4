REFERENCE  (J,KPS,53,1181,2008)  preliminary results from Conf.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3KORKRM) MC50 cyclotron of the Korea Institute
           of Radiological and Medical Sciences (KIRAMS).
SAMPLE     A high-purity (>99.99 %) tin foil (50-mu-m thick)
           with a natural isotopic composition (112Sn (0.97%),
           114Sn (0.65%), 115Sn (034 %), 116Sn (14.53%), 117Sn
           (7.68%), 118Sn (24.23%), 119Sn (8.59%), 120Sn
           (32.59%), 122Sn (4.63%) and 124Sn (5.79%)) was used
           as the target for irradiation. Monitor foils of
           copper (100-mu-m and 50-mu- m thick)and aluminum
            (100-mu-m thick) with known cross-sections were also
           included in the stack. The aluminum and the copper
           foils were used to monitor the beam intensity and to
           degrade the beam energy, respectively. A natural
           cadmium foil (100-mu-m thick) was inserted into the
           stack, together with the tin target, to do additional
           experiment in the same irradiation.
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-62,,SIG)
           (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-24,,SIG)
           (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) The monitor foils were
           considered to have been irradiated simultaneously and
           were measured with the same detector and in a
           rcompaable geometry as the tin target.

MONIT-REF  (,F.TARKANYI+,R,IAEA-TECDOC-1211,2001) Chapter 4
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC) Each sample was recounted
           5-6 times to avoid disturbances caused by overlapping
           gamma-lines from undesired sources and to more
           accurately evaluate the longer-lived radioisotopes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) a high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray
           spectrometer. The HPGe-detector (EG&G Ortec.) was
           coupled to a 4096 multi-channel analyzer (MCA)
           with the associated electronics to determine
           the photo peak area of the gamma-ray spectrum.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main sources of total uncetainty are:
           Statistical error 0.5 10 Error due to the beam ux 7
           Error due to the detection e ciency estimation 4
           Error due to the sample thickness 1.5 Error due to
           the -ray intensity 1
           (EN-ERR) The possible uncertainty of a point in the
           excitation function ranged from +- 3 up to +-1.1 MeV
