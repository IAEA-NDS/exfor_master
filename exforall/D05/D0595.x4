FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) Cyclotron Research Center (CRC), the
           radioactive beam facility in Louvain-la-Neuve
INC-SOURCE The 16.8MeV 6He+ beam was produced by the
           Isotope-Separation-on-Line technique using two
           coupled cyclotrons. The average intensity of the beam
           on the Betarget was about 10**7 pps for a total
           irradiation time of about five days
SAMPLE     The target used was a 400 mu-g/cm2 thick
           self-supporting foil of 9Be. For calibration and
           normalisation purposes, an Au target 200 mu-g/cm2
           thick was also used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) 224 silicon strip detectors
           arranged in the two large detector arrays. The
           forward-angle detector array (LEDA, Louvain-Edinburgh
           Detector Array) consisted of 8 segments each
           containing 16 strips, 300 mu-m thick. The polar
           angles covered were 4.-12.degr. and the azimuthal
           range was 0.-360.degr. The second detector array
            (called LAMP because of its lampshade geometry) had
           6 segments of LEDA-type detectors (each segment was
           inclined 45.degr.) and was placed closer to the
           target to cover larger polar angles (22.-72.degr.)
           and also the full azimuthal range. The energy
           calibration of detectors was performed with the
           three-peaks-alphasource and elastic scattering of 6He
           on the gold target.
METHOD     (TOF,BCINT) Particle identification was performed by
           the time of flight (ToF) method.
           The total collected charge was monitored by a Faraday
           cup -its reading was normalised with a measurement of
           elastic scattering of 6He on the thin gold target
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were received from Dr. M.Milin
