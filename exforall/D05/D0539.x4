FACILITY   (CYCLO,3EGYCAI) The compact cyclotron MGC-20 at

METHOD     (STTA)
           (EXTB) Beam current 100-200 nano-amperes.
           (ACTIV) The irradiation time was 1 hour.
           (GSPEC)
           The activity of short-lived zinc isotopes was measured
           2-10 hr after bombardment, while the activities of
           124Sb and 65Zn are measured several days after
           bombardment to allow the short-lived isotopes to decay.
DECAY-DATA (51-SB-124,60.11D,DG,602.7,0.978,DG,1691.2,0.485)
SAMPLE     A few milligrams of (highly enriched) 124Sn isotope
           were evaporated using an "EDWARDS E306A" vacuum
           coating unit equipped with a molybdenum boat heater
           on 20. mu-m thick pure aluminum foils of 11.0 mm
           diam. supported in a target holder. After
           evaporation, each sample is covered by a 12. mu-m
           thick Al foil in order to prevent scratching of the
           evaporated Sn film. Two natural tin foils are
           enclosed in the stack, and the foils are encapsulated
           from both sides with 12.0 mu-m thick Al foils.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) A standard hyper-pure germanium (HPGe)
           detector that is coupled to a Canberra AccuSpec/A
           plug-in multichannel analyzer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainties include:
               * detected peak count uncertainty,
               * beam current integration,
               * uncertainty in weight,
               * uncertainty in irradiation,
               * cooling and measurement times,
               * uncertainty of the geometry correction factors.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The theoretical interpretations of the measured
           excitation functions were done by EMPIRE-II code.
           (TTY-C) Thick target yield was calculated from an
           integration of excitation function.
