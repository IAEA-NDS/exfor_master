FACILITY   (CYCTM,2FR GAN) GANIL (France) using the SPIRAL
           facility based on the Isotope Separation on Line
            (ISOL) technique of beam production.
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 8He at 15.4A MeV, with an
           intensity of ~ 10**4 pps, was produced from a
           primary 13C beam on a thick 12C target.
SAMPLE     A isobutane (C4H10) gas target. In the present
           experiment, the isobutane was at a pressure of 30 mbar,
           which corresponds to a target thickness of
           3.2 x 10**19 12C/cm2.
METHOD     From the collisions of the 8He with the 12C of the
           gas, the 7H system was studied via 12C(8He, 7H -> 3H
           + 4n)13N, whereas the 6H resonance was produced in
           the 12C(8He, 6H -> 3H + 3n)14N transfer reaction.
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,CSICR) A 5 x 5 matrix of CsI detectors
           is placed at the back side for detecting light
           particles. A segmented wall of twenty cesium-iodide
            (CsI) crystals placed at forward angles detects
           those particles that do not stop inside the gas
           volume. The detection of a charged particle in any
           CsI detector is used for triggering the data
           acquisition system during the experiment. The detector
           works as a time-charge projection chamber where the
           detection gas plays also the role of reaction target,
           and the trajectory and energy loss of the particles
           are determined.
           (DRFTC) Two drift chambers located before MAYA are
           used as beam monitors.
ANALYSIS   The production cross sections of 6H and 7H were
           determined as the number of detected events normalized
           to the number of incident projectiles and target nuclei
           Finally, a mean differential cross section was
           obtained withinthe detection limits of MAYA, which
           explores different angular coverages in the
           center of mass system depending on the reaction.
