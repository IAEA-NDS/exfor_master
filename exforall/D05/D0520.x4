SAMPLE     Thin targets were used in order to reduce the
           scattering ions from the substrates. Aluminium
           containing natrual oxygen was deposited on a self-
           supporting carbon film (40 nm), and then coated with
           a layer of 10 nm Ag. Targets of different thickness
           were used for the scans over narrow resonances and
           over slowly varying portions, with an energy loss of
           4 keV and 8 keV,respectively, in an Al2O3 layer for
           3MeV alpha particles.
MONITOR    (47-AG-107(A,EL)47-AG-107,,DA,,RTH)Because the elastic
           scattering cross section for Ag is expected to be
           essentially  Rutherford even at 9 MeV, the Ag film
           can be used as a standard.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Annular surface barrier detector with an
           energy resolution of 25 keV.
           (SI)Another Au-Si surface barrier detector with a
           sensitive area of 28mm2 was used.
METHOD     (BCINT) Beam current monitor, which is a Faraday cup
           of 100 cm long and 4 cm in diameter.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-T) total uncertainty is less that 3%
