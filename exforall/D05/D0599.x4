DETECTOR   (MAGSP,PLATE) Experiment carried out using Enge
           split-pole magnetic spectrograph of McMaster University
           and data are recorded on plhotographic plates at the
           anglos 7., 11. and (15-60) degr. in steps of 6.degr.
           (SIBAR) target was continuously monitored during the
           runs by a 1 mm Si surface barrier detector at 30 degr.
                                               to the beam.
           In addition to the monitor data, as many as five sets
           of data on the eleastic cross-section were recorded
           on plates at 30 degrees.
METHOD     Since the elastic cross-section at 17 MeV is not
           available, to get the absolute cross-section the
           elastic cross-section at 17 MeV was obtained from
           that at 18 MeV accurately measured at the KATTENBORN
           et al. by assuming that the two cross-sections at 30
           degrees at these slightly different beam energies
           were in the ratio of the Rutherford values.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute cross-section is believed to
           be accurate to ~20%.
