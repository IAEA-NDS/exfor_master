TITLE      Cross-section for D(p,p)D elastic scattering from
           1.8 to 3.2 MeV at the laboratory angles of 155. and
           165. degrees

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) the NEC 9SDH-2 2x3 MV tandem
           accelerator at Fudan University.
SAMPLE     A sample consisting of three layers of metal films
           for cross section measurement was made by means of a
           DC magnetron sputtering method. A layer of ~5 nm
           tantalum film was first sputtered on a piece of 7 mu-m
           Al foil substrate, which was taken as the internal ion
           dose reference, and a layer of titanium film with
           ~50 nm thickness was deposited onto the Ta film
           subsequently as the deuterium storage layer, and then
           about 5 nm nickel was deposited onto the Ti film as
           the anti-oxidation layer.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The scattered protons were detected at two
           angles in laboratory frame, 155. and 165. degr.,
           respectively, and the Au/Si surface barrier detector
           was put on a movable frame, which could be shifted
           along a circle orbit, so that the detection angle
           can be changed in the experiment process.
