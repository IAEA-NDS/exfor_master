INC-SOURCE secondary beam of 14B was produced at 40.8 MeV/A by
           fragmentation of a 63 MeV/A 18O primary beam on a
           rotating 9Be target. At the same time, a secondary
           parasitic beam of 16C was produced at ~3% of beam
           purity with an energy of 46 MeV/A and intensity on
           the order of 300 particles per second. Particle
           identification was achieved via time-of-flight
           through the LISE spectrometer.
SAMPLE     The beam was tracked onto a 275 mg/cm2 carbon target
           using two drift chambers
DETECTOR   (CSICR) A zero degree telescope, consisting of two
           orthogonal strip detectors and a close packed array
           of 16 CsI detectors, was used to detect the beam and
           reaction products.
           (SCIN) Neutrons produced in the reactions were
           detected using the DeMoN array, which consists of
           ~100 liquid scintillators
METHOD     (EDE,TOF,COINC) Particle identification (PI) of
           reaction products was achieved using the EdE
           technique Rejection of particles resulting from the
           breakup of the 14B beam was achieved in software by
           gating on the 16C peak in the time-of-flight spectrum.
           The xLi+yBe, xHe+yBe, xLi+yLi, xHe+yLi, and xHe+yHe
           channels were measured by coincident detection of the
           two charged fragments, while the cross sections for
           the xC+1n channels were measured by detecting the
           fragment and the single neutron in coincidence.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties quoted are purely
           statistical.
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic errors in the determination of
           the cross section come from the uncertainty in the
           nature of the angular distributions used in the Monte
           Carlo simulations. These are estimated to be ~20%.
