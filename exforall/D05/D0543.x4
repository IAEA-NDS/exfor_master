SAMPLE     A SrCO3 thick layer was deposited on the elliptical
           copper substrate (11.69cm2 surface area)by means of
           a sedimentation method
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Identification and assay of gamma-ray-
           emitting radionuclides was carried out using
           gamma-ray spectroscopy with a high-purity
           germanium(HPGe) detector.
METHOD     (GSPEC)
ANALYSIS   Yttrium-86 was mainly identified by the following
           gamma-peaks: 1076.7keV(82.5%),627.8keV(32.6%) and
           1153.2keV(30.5%).Other radionuclides identified were
           88Y [T1/2 = 106.6d,898.1 keV(92.7%) and 1836.1
           keV(99.35%)], 87Y [T1/2 = 3.35d,484.9keV(92.2%)] and
           radio-zinc measured at EOB.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) uncertainty in cross-sections
           (EN-ERR) uncertainty in energy
