SAMPLE     (42-MO-100,ENR=0.9765) a target was approximately
           100 mu-g/cm2 thick. The isotopic composition of the
           target was 92Mo-1.30%, 94Mo-0.32%, 95Mo-0.20%,
           96Mo-0.09%, 98Mo-0.20%, 99Mo-0.24%, 100Mo- 97.65%.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction products were magnetically
           momentum analysed using the multiangle spectrograph.
           The instrument consists of 24 broad-range magnetic
           spectrographs of the Browne-Buechner type and is
           arranged to have a common magnetic circuit.
