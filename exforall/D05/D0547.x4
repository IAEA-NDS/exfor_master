TITLE      Study of the excitation function for the deuteron
            induced reaction on 64Ni(d,2n) for the production of
            the medical radioisotope 64Cu

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGVUB) External beam of VUB-Cyclotron CGR-560
SAMPLE     Two stacks each containing 8 foils of enriched 64Ni
            obtained from Isoflex USA).
           The nickel targets were prepared in 2 series by
            electrodeposition of enriched 64Ni on Au backing
            (99.95%) and were respectively 23.57 um and 24 um
            thick.

MONITOR    (22-TI-0(D,X)23-V-48,,SIG)
           Monitor foils (12 um thick natTi, 99% purity) were
            interleaved with the targets and one 100 um thick Al
            degrader foil was inserted in front of the first Ni
            foil in the second stack.
           The foils were stacked together in the Faraday-cup
            target holder.

           The initial beam parameters were estimated from the
            accelerator settings and from current beam
            measurements by taking into account the remeasured
            cross section for the monitor reaction natTi(d,x)48V
            over the whole energy range and comparison with the
            recommended data in IAEA-TECDOC (Tarkanyi et al.,2001)
            corrections were introduced.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Production of 64Cu was assessed shortly after
            the end of the bombardment (EOB) based on the weak
            gamma-line of 1345.84 keV with an intensity of 0.473%,
            using an HPGe detector coupled with the
            acquisition/analysis software GENIE 2000
            (CANBERRA,USA).
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty of the cross-section
            values was evaluated to approximately 10-12%.
           The uncertainty on each cross-section was
            estimated by taking the square root of the sum of all
            individual contributions into quadrature:
           (ERR-1) absolute abundance of the gamma-ray from NUDAT2
                                                              (5%)
           (ERR-2) number of target nuclei including non-
            uniformity                                        (5%)
           (ERR-3) detector efficiency                        (5%)
           (ERR-4) incident particle intensity                (5%)
           (ERR-5,2.,8.) determination of the peak areas
            including statistical errors                    (2-8%)
