           Copper foils of 10.6-mu-m thickness (99.99%,Goodfellow)
           were used as monitor foils and irradiated immediately
           before irradiation of protactinium targets in
           identical positions using identical beam parameters.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-resolution gamma-spectrometry (HRGS) of
           activated monitor foils was performed using a
           gamma-spectrometer equipped with a HPGe detector
            (GMX45-Plus, FWHM 2.04 at 1332.5 keV, amplifier 671,
           ADC TRUMP-8K-IN LINE, multichannel analyzer
           TRUMP-8K, software Maestro for Windows; Ortec). The
           spectrometer was calibrated for absolute counting
           efficiency with a set of gamma-ray standards (152Eu,
           137Cs, 60Co, 133Ba, and 241Am, uncertainty of the
           activities <1%, Czech Institute for Metrology,
           Department of Ioniz. Radia-n) for various geometries.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) There are several major contributions to the
           overall uncertainty of the determined cross
           sections:
           (ERR-1)  uncertainty in normalization;
           (ERR-2)  uncertainty in the thickness of the
                    monitoring foil;
           (ERR-3)  uncertainty in the determination of the
                    activity of 230U, 62Zn, 63Zn, and 65Zn,
                    including the uncertainty of their decay data
           (ERR-4)  uncertainty in the thickness of the
                    irradiated 231Pa layer  and
           (ERR-5)  uncertainty in the determination of 230U
                    activity .
           The overall uncertainty in the determination of
           the 230U cross sections was thus <16%.

SAMPLE     Thin targets of 231Pa were prepared by
           electrodeposition on silver disks (99.99%, Alfa
           Aesar) of 0.25-mm thickness and 20- mm diameter used
           as cathode. Aliquots of 231Pa in 0.4 M ammonium
           oxalate were added to the electrolysis cell
           containing 8.9 mL of 4% ammonium chloride/4%
           ammonium oxalate solution and 10 mu-L of
           concentrated hydrofluoric acid.
           Targets were contained 10.4-19.1 mu-g of 231Pa.
           Subsequently the silver disks were covered with
           aluminum foils (34.9-mu-m thick., 99.99%, Alfa Aesar)
           acting as catcher foils to avoid any losses of
           activity by recoil processes.

SAMPLE     Thick targets for production runs were prepared from
           protactinium pentoxide. The resulting oxide was
           ground in a mortar together with 2 mg of zinc
           stearate and aliquots of 235 mg of protactinium
           pentoxide, corresponding to 200 mg of 231Pa, were
           pressed into circular pellets with a diameter of 6
           mm at a pressure of 5 tons/cm2.
           The final pellets had a diameter of 4.9 mm and a
           thickness of 1.3-1.4 mm. Subsequently, the pellets
           were enclosed in silver capsules made from silver
           disks (30-mm diameter, 0.25-mm thickness), which were
           welded gastight.
