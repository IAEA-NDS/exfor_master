DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-resolution gamma-spectrometry (HRGS) of
           activated monitor foils was performed using a
           gamma-spectrometer equipped with a HPGe detector
            (GMX45-Plus, FWHM 2.04 at 1332.5 keV, amplifier 671,
           ADC TRUMP-8K-IN LINE, multichannel analyzer
           TRUMP-8K, software Maestro for Windows; Ortec). The
           spectrometer was calibrated for absolute counting
           efficiency with a set of gamma-ray standards (152Eu,
           137Cs, 60Co, 133Ba, and 241Am, uncertainty of the
           activities <1%, Czech Institute for Metrology,
           Department of Ioniz. Radia-n) for various geometries.
ERR-ANALYS  The overall uncertainty in the determination of
            the 230U cross sections was <16%.
            There are several major contributions to the overall
            uncertainty of the determined cross sections:
           (ERR-1)  uncertainty in normalization;
           (ERR-2)  uncertainty in the thickness of the
                    monitoring foil;
           (ERR-3)  uncertainty in the determination of the
                    activity of 230U, 62Zn, 63Zn, and 65Zn,
                    including the uncertainty of their decay data
           (ERR-4)  uncertainty in the thickness of the
                    irradiated 231Pa layer  and
           (ERR-5)  uncertainty in the determination of 230U
                    activity .

REACTION   (91-PA-231(P,2N)92-U-230,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Thin targets of 231Pa were prepared by
           electrodeposition on silver disks (99.99%, Alfa
           Aesar) of 0.25-mm thickness and 20- mm diameter used
           as cathode. Aliquots of 231Pa in 0.4 M ammonium
           oxalate were added to the electrolysis cell
           containing 8.9 mL of 4% ammonium chloride/4%
           ammonium oxalate solution and 10 mu-L of
           concentrated hydrofluoric acid.
           Targets were contained 10.4-19.1 mu-g of 231Pa.
           Subsequently the silver disks were covered with
           aluminum foils (34.9-mu-m thick., 99.99%, Alfa Aesar)
           acting as catcher foils to avoid any losses of
           activity by recoil processes.

REACTION   (91-PA-OXI(P,X)92-U-230,,TTY,,(PHY))
SAMPLE     Thick targets for production runs were prepared from
           protactinium pentoxide. The resulting oxide was
           ground in a mortar together with 2 mg of zinc
           stearate and aliquots of 235 mg of protactinium
           pentoxide, corresponding to 200 mg of 231Pa, were
           pressed into circular pellets with a diameter of 6
           mm at a pressure of 5 tons/cm2.
           The final pellets had a diameter of 4.9 mm and a
           thickness of 1.3-1.4 mm. Subsequently, the pellets
           were enclosed in silver capsules made from silver
           disks (30-mm diameter, 0.25-mm thickness), which were
           welded gastight.
COMMENT    From N.Otsuka: 'Oxide target was used. Not clear if
           the given yield value was corrected for the target '
