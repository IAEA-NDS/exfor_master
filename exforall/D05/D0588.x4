SAMPLE     The enriched 192Os (99%) targets were prepared via
           electro-deposition onto 50 mu-m thick Cu foils. The
           thickness of the deposited layers varied between 2.94
           and 6.78 mg/cm2. The diameter of the osmium samples
           was 10 mm. One stack containing 15 pieces of 192Os
           foils together with thick Al degraders.
           The Cu backings and the Al degraders served
           also as monitors
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT,CHSEP) The current measurement was
                              done using a Faraday-cup

DETECTOR   (HPGE)The activities were measured using HPGe detectors

ANALYSIS   The cross-sections were calculated using the
           activation equation.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainty of the energy was estimated
           from the following components: energy of the primary
           incident beam and target thickness taking into account
           the well known energy straggling effect.
           (DATA-ERR) For estimation of the uncertainties of the
           cross-sections, the linearly contributing processes
           were taken into account with equal sensitivities.
           The errors of nonlinear parameters (time, etc.) were
           not considered but their contribution is negligible
           compared to the linear parameters.
           The typical cross-section uncertainty was around +-16%
