FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP) This facility is installed at the
           Pelletron Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo and
           extends the capabilities of the original Pelletron
           Tandem Accelerator of 8 MV terminal voltage (8 UD)
           by producing secondary beams of unstable nuclei.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) using two dE-E Si telescopes, with
           detector thicknesses of 22-150 mu-m and 50-150 mu-m
           respectively, with antiscattering collimators
           separated by 4 cm in front of the dE detectors.
METHOD     (EDE)
ERR-ANALYS (ANG-ERR) The error in the scattering angles were
           calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error

REACTION   (23-V-51(4-BE-7,EL)23-V-51,,DA,,RTH)
SAMPLE      51V was 1.95mg/cm2 thick and 99.75% purity.
INC-SOURCE Two reactions were used to produce the 7Be beam both
           using a 3He gas target. 3He(7Li,7Be)T Q = -0.88 MeV
           and 3He(6Li,7Be)D Q = +0.11 MeV. There is a factor 2
           in the production rate between these two reactions
           the 3He(6Li,7Be)d being the higher. The proton rich
           7Be secondary beam has clearly more contaminants
           compared to the neutron rich 6He and 8Li and this is
           due to the fact that the proton rich beams normally
           have lower magnetic rigidity compared to the neutron
           rich beams and in general lower than the primary.

REACTION   (28-NI-58(3-LI-8,EL)28-NI-58,,DA,,RTH)
SAMPLE     58Ni has 2.0 mg/cm2 thickness and 99.90% purity.
INC-SOURCE The 6He secondary beam was produced by 9Be(7Li,8Li)8Be
           reaction with Q=+0.3674 MeV, by impinging about 300 nAe
           primary beam of 7Li on the 16 mu-m thick 9Be production
           target. The primary 7Li beam is produced by the NEC
           multi-cathode snics ion source with an intensity of
           typically 100 pnA (particle nano-Amperes).
