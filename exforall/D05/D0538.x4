FACILITY   (VDG,3CHLSAN) KN3750 Van de Graff of the University
                         of Chile.
SAMPLE     The targets were preparated by physical vapour
           deposition at highvacuum conditions using zinc wires
           provided by GoodFellow with a 99.95% of purity.The
           zinc wires were evaporated over microscope glass
           coated with layer of BaCl2. Thickness of the targets
           was 2.5+-0.2 mu-m, approximately.
DETECTOR   (SILI) Canberra Si(Li) criogenic detector having 220 eV
           FWHM resolution at 5.9 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Low average uncertainties is about 7% due
                      to method.
