SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched tin targets having 3.95%
           116Sn, 90% 117Sn, 3.81% 118Sn, 1.71% 119Sn, and
           0.53% 120Sn in the form of self-supporting foils of
           ~4.5 mg/cm2 were used in this experiment. The highly
           enriched 117Sn targets were prepared via mechanical
           rolling. The 117Sn foils were mounted on circular Al
           holders with a hole diameter of 12 mm. A stack was
           prepared having three 117Sn targets alternating with
           aluminum foils of thickness ~5.5 mg/cm2. A titanium
           foil of 3 mg/cm2 was placed at the end of the stack.
           The aluminum foils served as incident alpha-beam
           energy degraders and as catchers for recoil nuclei
           from the 117Sn foils to estimate the recoil
           fraction. In the first experiment,a stack of three
           117Sn foils interspaced by two aluminum foils ended
           with a Ti foil were irradiated with a 15 MeV 4He2+
           beam.In the second experiment a stack consisting of a
           117Sn foil followed by a Ti one was irradiated with a
           15.6MeV 4He2+ beam.

           The stack was mounted in a Faraday cup, isolated from
           the rest of the beamline, and bombarded with a 4He2+
           beam from the IFIN-HH tandem accelerator.
