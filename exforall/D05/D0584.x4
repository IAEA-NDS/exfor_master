TITLE      Proton induced reactions on 89Y with particular
           reference to the production of the medically
           interesting radionuclide 89Zr

REFERENCE  (J,RCA,97,467,2009)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3EGYCAI) Several stacks were irradiated by a
           proton beam of current 200 nA and energy 18MeV at
           the MGC-20 cyclotron in Inshas, Egypt.
METHOD     (STTA) the conventional stacked-foil technique
SAMPLE     Very high-purity natural Y2O3 (99.9999%) and high-
           purity Al and Cu foils (99.999%) were used in
           stacks. Each stack contained several properly
           prepared samples of natural Y2O3 (89Y = 100%) as
           well as aluminium and copper foils as absorbers and
           monitors, respectively.
           The thickness of the prepared Y2O3 layers ranged
           between 2 and 5 mg/cm2. They were homogeneous and
           mechanically stable. Each target was covered by a
           10 mu-m thick and 16 mm in diam. Al foil. Thus each
           sample consisted of an Al-Y2O3-Al sandwich.
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils were included in the stack to
           calculate the actual beam current during the
           irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector, Canberra 3106D high voltage
           power supply and Canberra 2026 spectroscopy
           amplifier coupled to a (TRUMP-8192) multichannel
           analyzer. The measured energy resolution was 2.0 keV
           for the gamma-ray of energy 1332.5 keV. To reduce
           the background, the detector was surrounded by a
           cylindrical lead shield with an inner layer of Cu to
           prevent gamma ray scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in the measured cross
           section was in the range of 10% - 14%, depending on:
             * the detector efficiency,
             * counting statistics and
             * beam current
