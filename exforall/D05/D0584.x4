TITLE      Proton induced reactions on 89Y with particular
            reference to the production of the medically
            interesting radionuclide 89Zr

METHOD     (STTA) Several stacks were irradiated by a proton beam
             of current 200 nA and energy 18 MeV
SAMPLE     Very high-purity natural Y2O3 (99.9999%) and high-
            purity Al and Cu foils (99.999%) were used in stacks.
           Each stack contained several properly prepared samples
            of natural Y2O3 (89Y = 100%) as well as aluminium and
            copper foils as absorbers and monitors, respectively.
           The thickness of the prepared Y2O3 layers ranged
            between 2 and 5 mg/cm2. They were homogeneous and
            mechanically stable.
           Each target was covered by a 10 um thick and 16 mm in
            diam. Al foil.
           Thus each sample consisted of an Al-Y2O3-Al sandwich.
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils were included in the stack to
            calculate the actual beam current during the
            irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector, Canberra 3106D high voltage
             power supply and Canberra 2026 spectroscopy amplifier
             coupled to a (TRUMP-8192) multichannel analyzer.
            The measured energy resolution was 2.0 keV for the
             gamma-ray of energy 1332.5 keV.
            To reduce the background, the detector was surrounded
             by a cylindrical lead shield with an inner layer of
             Cu to prevent gamma ray scattering.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in the measured cross
             section was in the range of 10% - 14%, depending on:
             * the detector efficiency,
             * counting statistics and
             * beam current
