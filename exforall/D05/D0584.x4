TITLE      Proton induced reactions on 89Y with particular
            reference to the production of the medically
            interesting radionuclide 89Zr

SAMPLE     Very high-purity natural Y2O3 (99.9999%) and high-
            purity Al and Cu foils (99.999%) were used in stacks.
           Each stack contained several properly prepared samples
            of natural Y2O3 (89Y = 100%) as well as aluminum and
            copper foils as absorbers and monitors, respectively.
           The thickness of the prepared Y2O3 layers ranged
            between 2 and 5 mg/cm2. They were homogeneous and
            mechanically stable.
           Each target was covered by a 10 um thick and 16 mm in
            diam. Al foil.
           Thus each sample consisted of an Al-Y2O3-Al sandwich.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Canberra 3106D high voltage power supply and
           Canberra 2026 spectroscopy amplifier coupled to a
            (TRUMP-8192) multichannel analyzer. The measured
           energy resolution was 2.0 keV for the gamma-ray of
           energy 1332.5 keV. To reduce the background, the
           detector was surrounded by a cylindrical lead shield
           with an inner layer of Cu to prevent gamma ray
           scattering.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Several stacks were irradiated by a
           proton beam of current 200 nA and energy 18 MeV.
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils were included in the stack to
            calculate the actual beam current during the
            irradiation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainty in the measured cross
             section was in the range of 10% - 14%, depending on:
             * the detector efficiency,
             * counting statistics and
             * beam current
