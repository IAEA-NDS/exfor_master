           around the Coulomb Barrier

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) TWINSOL radioactive nuclear beam
           facility at the University of Notre Dame. The main
           components of the TWINSOL facility are a couple of
           big superconducting solenoids, six teslas each one,
           used to collect, transport, and analyze the
           secondary RNB that can be focused on a secondary
           target.
INC-SOURCE To produce the 8B RNB, a 6Li primary beam was used,
           incident on a 3He gas target at a pressure of 1 atm.
           The secondary beam flux was calibrated by inserting
           a Si dE-E telescope at the secondary target position
           and reducing the intensity of the primary beam by
           three orders of magnitude so that the 8B ions could
           be directly counted, while at the same time the
           primary beam current was measured in a Faraday cup.
SAMPLE     The secondary target was a 58Ni high-purity foil,
           with a thickness of 0.924 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Breakup events were detected with two
           silicon dE-E telescopes placed at angle 45 degr.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE)
ADD-RES    Continuum-discretized coupled channel
           calculations are performed and compared to the data.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Nothing said about uncertainties
