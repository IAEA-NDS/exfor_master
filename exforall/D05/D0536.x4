SAMPLE     carbon
METHOD     (EDE)
ANALYSIS   A method is developed in which pulse-height spectra
           from plastic scintillator are carefully analysed to
           give the total number of low pulse height events
           obtained with a mono-energetic incident beam.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The thin dE/dx crystal was chosen for each
           particular incident energy to give an energy loss of
           300 keV, which produced a spectrum resolution of
           about 25%. The material used was Nuclear Enterprise's
           NE 102 plastic scintillator. The crystal was mounted
           on an EMI 6097B photomultiplier.
           The full energy detector was also made of Ne 102,
           7.6 cm in diameter by 3.8 cm thick and this was mated
            to an EMI 6097F photomultiplier.
