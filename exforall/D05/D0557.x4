           helium at the laboratory angle of 165. degr.

FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRFUD) The NEC 9SDH-22x3MV tandem
           accelerator at Fudan University.
SAMPLE     A uniform Ti-He film with 5.3x10**17 atoms/cm2 Ti
           atoms and 1.87 x10**17 atoms/cm2 He atoms was
           sputtered onto a 7 mu-m Al foil. Following this an
           Ag overlayer of 3.3x10**16 atoms/cm2 was deposited
           on the Ti film in order to prepare an Ag/TiHex/Al
           target for the cross section measurements.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Au/Si surface barrier detector was placed at
           the laboratory backward angle of 165. degr. and
           subtended a solid angle of 1.87/10**3 sr, set by a
           defining aperture of 3x4 mm. The angular resolution
           of the detector was thus 1.degr.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total error associated with the measured
           cross section are included:
            * statistical errors and background subtraction
           uncertainties in the determination of Ag and He peak
           areas and they are typically +-2-3%.
            * The error in cross section of Ag,Ruth associated
            with uncertainties in the scattering angle(+- 1.degr.)
            * The error from measuring the areal density
            Ag Nt is less than 4%, and He Nt is less than 5%.
           (EN-ERR) uncertainty in the proton beam energy(+-6 keV)
           is less than +-1% in the measured energy region.
