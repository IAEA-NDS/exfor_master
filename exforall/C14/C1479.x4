TITLE      A new measurement of 7Be(p,y)8B cross section and its
            astrophysical meaning
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWAU) Tandem van de Graaf Accelerator at the
            University of Washington.
INC-SOURCE A monoenergetic proton beam
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A silicon surface barrier detector (alpha
            counting detector) with an active area of 450 mm2
            and a nominal thickness of 40 microm was used to
            count the alpha particles from the reaction.
SAMPLE     The 7Be (from TRIUMF) was separated from lithium with
            a glass filter in a pH 8 - 9 solution, and left in
            Be0 form. Then the 7Be underwent reductive vacuum
            evaporation onto a catcher crucible. The target
            backing was made from molybdenum consisting of a flat
            plate with a 4 mm-diameter, 1.4 mm-height post in the
            center.
MONITOR    A calibration detector was 47.42 mm away from the
            target, and a 0.700 inches-diameter collimator was
            placed in front of the calibration detector to
            determine precisely the geometrical solid angle of
            the CY counting detector. The solid angle ratio of
            the counting and calibration detectors was determined
            with the 7Li(d,p)8Li resonance at Ed = 770 keV.
