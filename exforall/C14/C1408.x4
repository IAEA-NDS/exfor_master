TITLE      Astrophysical S factor for the 7Li(d,n0)8Be and
            7Li(d,n1)8Be reactions
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USATNL) The Triangle Universities Nuclear
            Laboratory (TUNL)
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Atomic beam polarized-ion source produced
            unpolarized deuteron beams for measurements at three
            separate energies: Ed = 45, 60, and 80 keV.
            Beam currents averaged about 40 microA.
SAMPLE     The target was made in situ in the vacuum chamber.
            Enriched 99% 7Li was evaporated directly onto the
            3-mm-thick aluminum target chamber face. The deposited
            lithium layer was thick enough to stop the deuteron
            beam and was previously determined to be Li2O.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The emitted neutrons were detected using six
            12.7-cm diameter and three 11.4-cm-diameter organic
            liquid scintillators containing BC-501 fluid.
