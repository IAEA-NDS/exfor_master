STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab.1 of the main ARI reference
SAMPLE     Target was produced by pressing high purity PbF2 powder
           into a pellet which was then attached to a graphite
           plug. PbF2 target was thick enough to stop the beam.
INC-SPECT  Alpha beam up to 10 MeV
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Ten 3He-filled proportional counters of approx.
            2.5cm diameter and about 75 cm long in a graphite
            moderator with diameter of 1.5 m. The detectors were
            positioned above and perpendicular to the beam
            direction at approximately equal angular intervals
            from 5 degrees to 175 degrees relative to the beam
            direction.  The beam was stopped in the target and
            the outgoing neutrons were moderated first in a 5-cm
            inner diameter, 15-cm outer diameter iron shell
            immediately surrounding the target and in the
            graphite pile.
