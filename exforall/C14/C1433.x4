STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab.1 of the main ARI reference
SAMPLE     Target was produced by pressing high purity PbF2 powder
           into a pellet which was then attached to a graphite
           plug. PbF2 target was thick enough to stop the beam.
INC-SPECT  Alpha beam up to 10 MeV
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Ten 3He-filled proportional counters of approx.
            2.5cm diameter and about 75 cm long in a graphite
            moderator with diameter of 1.5 m. The detectors were
            positioned above and perpendicular to the beam
            direction at approximately equal angular intervals
            from 5 degrees to 175 degrees relative to the beam
            direction.  The beam was stopped in the target and
            the outgoing neutrons were moderated first in a 5-cm
            inner diameter, 15-cm outer diameter iron shell
            immediately surrounding the target and in the
            graphite pile.
ANALYSIS    Neutron yields from a thick Pb target were also
            measured at 9 and 10 MeV, and found to be negligible.

SAMPLE     Hypothetical F2 thick sample.
ANALYSIS   In Table I we report our thick-target neutron yields
           as measured from a PbF2 target. Stopping powers were
           used to convert these yields into those expected from
           alpha bombardments of thick F2 and UF6 targets.
COMMENT    Original data were adjusted because thick-target
           neutron yields from alpha-particle induced reactions
           were in units of neutrons per 10**6 alphas.
