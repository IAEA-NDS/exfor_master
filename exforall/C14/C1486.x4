TITLE      Spectroscopic factors measured in inclusive proton-
            knockout reactions on 8B and 9C at intermediate
            energies
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) A1900 fragment separator at the newly
            commissioned Coupled-Cyclotron Facility at the
            National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
            Michigan State University.
INC-SPECT  The beams have been produced by fragmentation of a 140
            MeV/nucleon 16O beam.
SAMPLE     A 146-mg/cm2-thick C target
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
           (SCIN) A position-sensitive Parallel-Plate Avalanche
            Counter (PPAC) detector in front of the stack allowed
            the incoming beam angles to be restricted, and a PIN
            diode and a scintillator at the back of the setup were
            used for initial beam characterization as well as the
            measurement of outgoing particles
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) To estimate the total uncertainty in the
            determination of the cross section, contributions from
            the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the
            cuts, statistical uncertainties, and an overall
            uncertainty of 5% for target thickness were taken into
            account. The contributions were added in quadrature.
            The analysis was done for runs with and without
            target.
