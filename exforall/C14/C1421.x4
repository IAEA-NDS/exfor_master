TITLE      Large-angle proton-nucleus scattering shows no evidence
            for intermediate Delta states
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANTMF) TRIUMF
INC-SPECT   Unpolarized proton beam
SAMPLE     Natural graphite targets of 100 and 300 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)  MRS spectrograph
           (MWPC) Multi wire proportional chamber
METHOD     (EDE,BCINT)
            The beam current was integrated using 1H(p,p)1H
           scattering in a thin polyethylene foil upstream from
           the carbon target, with the two outgoing protons
           observed in coincidence.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(P,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
           An absolute calibration of the measured cross section
           was achieved by replacing the graphite target by a
           polyethylene foil, thus relating the 11C(p,p)11C cross
           section to the known 1H(p,p)1H cross section. This was
           done for two different spectrograph angles; the two
           calibrations agreed.
