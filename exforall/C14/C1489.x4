TITLE      Absolute spectroscopic factors from neutron knockout
            on the halo nucleus 15C
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) the National Superconducting Cyclotron
            Laboratory (NSCL) at MSU.
INC-SPECT  A secondary beam of 103 MeV/nucleon 15C was produced
            by fragmentation of a 150 MeV/nucleon 17O primary
            beam on a thick beryllium target
SAMPLE     149 mg/cm2 beryllium target.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)
           (NAICR) Spectrograph in coincidence with prompt gamma
            emissions detected in an array of 11 position
            sensitive NaI detectors
MONITOR    A calibration run with stationary radioactive sources
            was carried out; for this, the simulated data agree
            in intensity with the actual data at an uncertainty
            level of 10%
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The time of flight was corrected for trajectory
            dependence yielding a very clean identification of the
            14C events with an error of 2.3% attributed to the
            selection of the residues. Other contributions to the
            error on the inclusive cross section are 1.5% from the
            normalization to the incident beam, 1% from the target
            thickness, 0.6% from the live time of the data
            recording, and 0.9% from counting statistics.
