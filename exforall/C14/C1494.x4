TITLE      Thick-target inverse-kinematics proton scattering from
            46Ar and the N =28 shell below 48Ca
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the
            National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
            Michigan State University.
INC-SPECT  A 110 MeV/nucleon 48Ca primary beam was fragmented
            on a 376 mg/cm2 9Be primary target at the
            midacceptance target position of the A1900 fragment
            separator
SAMPLE     A secondary beam of 46Ar fragments, with an energy of
            76.4MeV/nucleon, an intensity of 8300 pps, and a
            purity of about 99%, was incident on 191 mg/cm2
            polypropylene [(C3H6)n] and 211 mg/cm2 graphite
            secondary targets at the target position of the S800
            magnetic spectrograph, which was used to identify and
            determine the scattering angles of beam particles
            on an event-by-event basis.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Deexcitation gamma rays were detected by SeGA
            (segmented germanium array), an array of fifteen
            32-fold segmented coaxial HPGe detectors arranged
            in two rings centered at 37 degree and 90 degree
            relative to the beam axis.
