TITLE      Measurements of 17F scattering by 208Pb with a new type
            of large solid angle detector array
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) ATLAS superconducting linear
            accelerator
INC-SOURCE The 17F exotic beam is produced through the inverse
           reaction p(O-17,F-17)n with an intensity of about
           10**5 pps. The energy of the outcoming F-17 beam,
           measured with an Enge split pole magnetic spectrometer,
           was 90.4 MeV, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)
           of 1.4 MeV (corresponding to a resolution of
                                                    about 1.5%)
SAMPLE     The target was a self supporting 1-mg/cm2-thick 208Pb
            foil.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) EXODET array consists of 16 solid state
            silicon detectors arranged in eight two-stage
            telescopes to allow the Z identification of the
            particles passing through the first layer, by means
            of the usual dE-E technique
HISTORY    (20061221C) DR
           (20120618A) SD: Ref. was added. BIB update. Data at
           E= 98 MeV were deleted from Subent 2 (data are from
           PR/C,67,044603,2003; see C1484). Subent 3 deleted
            (data from PR/C,63,064606,2001; see S0051).
           REACTION code was corrected in Subent 2.

           Experimental energy resolution did not allow to
           separate the contributions coming from the first
           excited states both in 17F (at 0.4953 keV) and in
           208Pb (at 2.614 MeV). However, from distorted wave Born
           approximation (DWBA) calculations, these contributions
           were predicted to be very small in comparison with the
           pure elastic cross section
