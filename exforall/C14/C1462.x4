TITLE      Optimization of 124I production via 124Te(p,n)124I
            reaction
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USANYB) IBA Cyclone 30 cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE 8h of beam

SAMPLE     Tellurium dioxide (0.57 g) and Al2O3 (0.03 g) was mixed
            in a tube. The physical thickness of the target was
            154 mg/cm2. The enrichment of our target material as
            reported on the supplier's certificate of analysis
            was as follows: 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 128Te and
            130Te = 0.01%, 124Te = 99.86%, 125Te = 0.06%, and
            126Te = 0.03%.
CORRECTION 125Te(p,n)125I and 126Te(p,n)126I reactions may be the
            main contributors towards the 125I and 126I
            impurities.
