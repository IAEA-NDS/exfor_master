SAMPLE     Tellurium dioxide (0.57 g) and Al2O3 (0.03 g) was mixed
            in a tube. The physical thickness of the target was
            154 mg/cm2. The enrichment of our target material as
            reported on the supplier's certificate of analysis
            was as follows: 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 128Te and
            130Te = 0.01%, 124Te = 99.86%, 125Te = 0.06%, and
            126Te = 0.03%.
           (52-TE-124,ENR=0.9986)
           (52-TE-125,ENR=0.0006)
           (52-TE-126,ENR=0.0003)
           (52-TE-120,ENR=0.0001)
           (52-TE-122,ENR=0.0001)
           (52-TE-123,ENR=0.0001)
           (52-TE-128,ENR=0.0001)
           (52-TE-130,ENR=0.0001)
CORRECTION 125Te(p,n)125I and 126Te(p,n)126I reactions may be the
            main contributors towards the 125I and 126I
            impurities.
