TITLE      A study of alpha capture cross-sections of 112Sn
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
            at the University of Notre Dame, USA, in the energy
            range 8-12 MeV
INC-SPECT  112Sn targets were irradiated with an alpha beam in
            the energy range between 8 and 12 MeV in energy steps
            of 0.5 MeV. The typical current recorded was between
            100 and 250 nA
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detection system was composed of two Clover
            Ge detectors (Clover 1 and Clover 2), each detector
            having four HPGe crystals
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 112Sn targets in the form of
            thin self-supporting foils of 2.2mg=cm2 were used for
            the measurements. The highly enriched (99.60 %)
            112Sn targets were prepared at Argonne National
            Laboratory via mechanical rolling
ERR-ANALYS The total error of the measured cross-section values
             includes two components: statistical error based on
             counting statistics (<20%) and systematical error
             based on the errors in the procedural techniques
             such as the error in the efficiency measurement
             (10%), the error in the beam current integration
             (2%), and target thickness (5%). These components
             were added in quadrature.
