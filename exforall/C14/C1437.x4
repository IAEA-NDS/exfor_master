TITLE      Production of [17F]CH3F (t1/2=65s), an improved PET
            tracer for rCBF measurement
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWIS) CTI RDS 112 cyclotron
           (VDGT,2UK MAN) Electrostatic tandem (National
            Electrostatic Corp. 9SDH-2 Pelletron)
INC-SPECT  CYCLO: This accelerator delivers up to 50 mA of 11.4MeV
            protons on target.
           VDGT: 100 mA of 6 MeV protons or deuterons within a
           maximum 10 mm diameter beam spot.
SAMPLE     In the case of 20Ne(p,a)17F, targets were designed to
            couple to the standard CTI RDS 112 cyclotron helium
            cooled double foil system.
           Targets used for the 16O(d,n)17F reaction are a large
            aluminum cylindrical bore which are easily produced
            compared to those of conical design. The cylindrical
            target chamber was 19mm ID and 127mm in length. The
            target is mounted to the beamline on a KF-40
            stainless steel flange with a 19mm beam port. A
            single 25.4 mm aluminum vacuum window is used,
            supported by a water-cooled aluminum grid of 76 1.6mm
            holes in a hexagonal arrangement.
