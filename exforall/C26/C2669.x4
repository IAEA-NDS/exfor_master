DETECTOR   (GELI) A 2.5%-efficient Ge(Li) detector at
           approximately 125 degrees from the beam direction and
           at 5 cm from the target.
SAMPLE     (26-FE-56,ENR=0.994) The target was a 0.90-mg/cm2
           iron foil.
CORRECTION Dead-time and amplifier pileup corrections, and
           run-to-run normalizations.
ANALYSIS   Excitation functions for the first eight excited
           states of 56Co were taken at 125 degrees in order to
           minimize angular distribution effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors arise from uncertainties in three
           different quantities:
           1) the y-ray peak areas,
           2) the detector relative gamma-ray efficiency
           corrections,
           3) the run-to-run normalization.
           Error values taken from the figure. For data without
           given errors the errors are smaller than the data-point
           symbols (about 6%).
STATUS     (CURVE) Fig.8 (p.2392) in Phys.Rev.C,7,2379,1973 was
           digitized by GSYS2.4.7.

REACTION   (26-FE-56(P,N)27-CO-56,PAR,SIG)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 2.5%-efficient Ge(Li) detector was positioned
           with its face 12.7 cm from the center of the target
           and at 90 degrees to the beam.
SAMPLE     The 56Fe foil was placed at 55 degrees with respect to
           the beam direction. The 0.90+/-0.09-mg/cm2 target
           thickness was determined by measuring the energy loss
           of 5.48-MeV alpha particles from an 241Am source. The
           target was placed 15 cm in front of the Faraday cup.
CORRECTION Dead-time and amplifier pileup corrections.
ANALYSIS   The absolute normalization of the counting efficiency
           curve was determined for the geometry used by counting
           57Co, 137Cs, 54Mn, and 60Co intensity standards. The
           precision quoted for the standards was +/-5%.
           The neutron feeding to each state was determined from
           the absolute gamma-ray intensities.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties
           presented in the table.
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the target thickness (including
                   nonuniformities).
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in the the integrated charge (+5%).
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in the absolute normalization for
                   the efficiency curve (including uncertainty in
                   source positioning).
           (ERR-4,2.,7.) Uncertainty in the gamma-ray peak areas
                          (+/-2 to +/-7%).
           The total error associated with the measurement is
           approximately +/-15%.
