FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     9Be secondary target with thickness of 375 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   The particle identification for the incoming and
           outgoing ions was performed on an event-by-event
           basis using the standard A1900 and S800 focal-plane
           detectors
           (PPAC) A set of parallel-plate avalanche counters
           installed upstream of the reaction target was used to
           determine the momentum of the incoming ions.
           (HPGE) The reaction target was surrounded by the
           state-of-the-art array of gamma ray detectors, Gamma
           Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Array, GRETINA. The array
           consisted of seven modules, each housing four high
           purity germanium crystals and it was set up with four
           modules at 58 deg and the remaining three at 90 deg
           with respect to the beam axis.
CORRECTION Gamma ray energies were Doppler-corrected
INC-SOURCE A 48Ca beam with energy of 140 MeV/nucleon impinged
           on a 846 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target and produced
           secondary beams of 33Mg and 34Si. The purification of
           the projectile-like particles was achieved by a 300
           mg/cm2 thick aluminum wedge degrader in the A1900
           fragment separator. The beams of 33Mg and 34Si had
           average on-target intensities of 620 and 5.2E+5 s-1
           and purities of 15 and 66%, respectively.
