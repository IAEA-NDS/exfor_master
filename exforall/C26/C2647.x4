FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) Bevatron, a weak-focusing proton
           synchrotron.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CEREN) Plastic scintillator and Cherenkov
           counters.
METHOD     (TOF) The Bevatron proton beam impinges on a copper
           target and negative particles scattered in the
           forward direction with momentum 1.19 BeV/c. These
           particles are deflected 21 degrees by the field of
           the Bevatron, arid an additional 32 degrees by magnet
           M1. With the aid of the quadrupole focusing magnet Q1
            (consisting of 3 consecutive quadrupole magnets)
           these particles are brought to a focus at the first
           scintillation counter. For protons of our selected
           momentum the mass is measured to about 10 percent.
           The observed times of flight for antiprotons are made
           more meaningful by the fact that the electronic gate
           time is considerably longer than the spread of
           observed antiproton flight times. A very rough
           determination has been made of the dependence of
           antiproton production cross section on the energy of
           the Bevatron proton beam.
