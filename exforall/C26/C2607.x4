TITLE      Relative High Energy Neutron Yields from Targets
           Bombarded with Protons and Deuterons
AUTHOR     (W.J.Knox)

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 184-inch Berkeley cyclotron.
INC-SPECT  The deuterons produced by the cyclotron have
           a maximum energy of 190 MeV, and a beam of about
           10**-6-amp average current can be obtained. The
           protons have a maximum energy of 340 MeV and can be
           produced with an average beam current of the order of
           5*10**-7 amp.
DETECTOR   (FISCH,GEMUC) Bi fission chamber.
METHOD     Bismuth fission chambers were used to detect the high
           energy neutrons. Graphite monitors were used to
           determine the fluxes of protons or deuterons
           traversing the targets. The monitors were attached to
           the target so that the beam passed, simultaneously,
           through both target and monitor. At the end of the
           bombardment the monitor was removed and the counting
           rate of the C11 activity in it was determined on a
           Geiger-Mueller counter at a suitable later time.
           Sometimes decay curves were taken through an aluminum
           absorber so that the positron annihilation radiation
           of the C11 was counted instead of the positrons
           themselves.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative neutron yield from a given
           element was obtained by comparison of its corrected
           neutron yield to the yield from a standard carbon
           target. The estimated probable error of a single
           determination of such a ratio is about 10 percent.
           This error arises mainly in the determination of the
           flux of deuterons or protons traversing a target, but
           also has contributions from the neutron counting
           statistics and from the correction made for the
           production of neutrons in the carbon monitors. The
           errors in measurements of the thicknesses and
           densities of the targets are negligible.
CORRECTION For each of the four targets used in a given run, the
           neutron counting rate was determined and corrected
           for the neutrons produced in the monitors and the
           relative neutron yields for the four targets were
           calculated.
