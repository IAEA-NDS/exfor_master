FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU)
           (LINAC,1USAFSU) Experiment performed
           using a 9 MV FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
           followed by a linear accelerator booster at the John
           D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory at
           Florida State University
SAMPLE     A polyethylene (C2H4) target with thickness optimized
           for specific beam energy.
               Bem energy (MeV)   Target thickness (mg/cm2)

                    18.6             4.13 and 2.75
DETECTOR   (SISD) Two double sided annular silicon strip
           detectors of the S2 type installed downstream of the
           target were used to detect charged reaction products.
           SiSD consist of 48 rings on one sides and 16 segments
           on the other side. First SiSD had thicknes of 1000
           mu-m and was placed at a distance 7.6 cm downstream
           of C2H4 target. The second SiSD had thickness of 500
           mu-m and was placed 26.8 cm downstream of the target.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE A radioactive 8Li beam was produced using the
           2H(7Li,8Li) 1H reaction.Primary 7Li beam was
           accelerated and bombarded primary target - a
           liquid-nitrogen- cooled, 4 cm long deuterium gas cell
           with pressure of 400 Torr. The secondary 8Li beam
           produced via 2H(7Li,8Li) 1H reaction was momentum
           selected, bunched and separated from other
           contaminants by the superconducting resonator, and
           the quadrupole and dipole magnets of the RESOLUT
           separator. The beam purity was 95% 8Li and typical
           intesity 2E+4pps.
