FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was performed using
           IRIS facility in ISAC-II at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Thin windowless solid hydrogen (H2) reaction target
           built on a 4.3 mu-m thick Ag foil backing facing
           upstream of the H2 layer. The target cell with the
           foil was cooled to approx. 4 K before forming solid H2.
           The average H2 target thickness was 53 mu-m and.
           the target thickness between the first and last runs
           of data-taking period showed a change of 7%.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The radioactive beam of 59Cu was produced via
           spallation of a niobium target with 480 MeV protons.
           The 59Cu beam was re-accelerated using the ISACII
           superconducting LINAC to 8.5A MeV. The average beam
           intensity was approx. 3600 pps. Beam particles were
           identified on event by event basis by measurement
           in ionisation chamber.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Charged particles were detected
           using telescope consisting of annular arrays of
           100 mmu-m thick single-sided silicon strip detectors
           followed by a layer of 12 mm thick CsI(Tl) detectors
           placed 15 cm downstream of the target.
