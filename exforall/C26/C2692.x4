REFERENCE  (J,ARI,171,109647,2021)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Measurement performed at Lawrence
           Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron
SAMPLE     Stacked target intersparsed with natural Gd foils
           and Cu and Ti monitor foils. Target consisted of
           14 Gd foils with thickness between 9 and 12 mu-m
            9 Cu foils with thickness between 27 and 11 mu-m
            8 Ti foils with thickness between of 26 mu-m
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Ortec GEM-F8250P4 High-Purity Germanium detector
METHOD     (ACTIV)
ANALYSIS   The mean incident energy on each foil is reported as
           a flux-weighted average differential proton flux
           obtained from MCNP modeling. The cross section was
           obtained from the EOB activity

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty is a one-sigma
           uncertainty resulting from the systematic and
           statistical error propagation including
            - uncertainty in the mass, length, and width
                  measurements of each foil
            - uncertainty in irradiation time
            - uncertainty in decay constant
            - uncertainty in beam current for each Gd compartment
            - uncertainty in detection efficiency
            - uncertainty in detected counts
            - uncertainty in in the time between the end of
                 irradiation and the beginning of counting
            - uncertainty in the counting time (0.5 sec)
