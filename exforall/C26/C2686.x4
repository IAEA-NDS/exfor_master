FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconduction
           Cyclotron Laboratory
SAMPLE     Be target with thickness of 1 mm
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Forward-emitted charged particles
           were detected in the high resolution array located
           80-cm downstream of the target and covered scattering
           angles from 2.1 deg to 12.4 deg. The array contained
           14 dE-E telescopes each consisting of a 1.5 mm thick
           double-sided Si strip dE detector followed by a 4-cm-
           thick CsI(Tl) E detector. The dE detectors are 6.4 cm
           x 6.4 cm in area, with each face divided into 32
           strips. Each E detector consisted of four separate
           CsI(Tl) elements, each spanning a quadrant of the
           preceding Si detector.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE Secondary beam of 13-O was produced from primary 16-O
           beam on Be target at energy of 150 MeV/A. The beam
           was purified using the A1900 magnetic spectrometer
           and the radio frequency fragment separator and had an
           intensity of 10+3 pps with purity of 80%.

REACTION   (4-BE-9(8-O-13,X)9-F-13,,SIG,,MSC)
           Spin and parity of the observed state is 5/2+
ANALYSIS   Decay energy of 13F was determined from invariant mass
           of 3p+10C events.
