FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the ReA3
           accelerator facility at Michigan State University
INC-SOURCE Radioactive beams of K and Ar ions were produced by
           colliding 48Ca beams at 140A MeV with a Be production
           target at the coupled-cyclotron facility at MSU-NSCL.
           The resulting reaction products were filtered by the
           A1900 spectrometer and thermalized in a gas stopper.
           They were subsequently extracted from the gas stopper,
           charge bred to a high-charge state, and accelerated
           by the ReA3 linac. The intensities of the K and Ar
           beams incident on the target ranged between 1.0E+4
            (44Ar/s) and 4.5E+4 (39K/s).
SAMPLE     The 16-O target was produced by evaporating 28Si in a
           vacuum of 1E-6 Torr. The oxygen content in the target
           was measured by Rutherford backscattering. Oxygen
           thickness was of 98+-4 mu-g/cm2 along with a Si
           thickness of 258+-10 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (TELES,IOCH,MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detectors
           with two axial field ionization detectors were placed
           upstream of the target to identify incoming ions by
           dE-TOF method. The electron emission foil of the
           downstream MCP detector also served as the target in
           the experiment
           (SI) Evaporation residue were detected in an annular
           Si detectors that subtend the angular range 1.0 deg <
           Theta(lab) < 7.3 deg.
           (MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detectors were placed
           downstream of the target to measure time of flight of
           heavy reaction products.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) Particles were identified using dE-TOF method
ANALYSIS   The fusion cross section sigmaF is extracted from the
           measured yield of ERs through the relation sigmaF =
           NER/(epsilonER *t*NI ), where NI is the number of
           beam particles of a given type incident on the target,
           t is the target thickness, epsilonER is the detection
           efficiency, and NER is the number of evaporation
           residues detected. The number NI is determined by
           counting the particles with the appropriate time of
           flight between the two MCPs that have the correct
           identification in the E-TOF map. The measured target
           thickness was used. The number of detected residues,
           NER, is determined by summing the number of detected
           residues identified by the ETOF technique.
           Uncertainty in identifying an ER associated with
           fusion on 16O is reflected in the error bars
           presented. To obtain the detection efficiency,
           epsilonER, a statistical model was used to describe
           the deexcitation of the fusion product together with
           the geometric acceptance of the experimental setup.
           The detection efficiency varied between ~82% and 83%
           over the entire energy range.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The statistical uncertainties of the
           measurement dominate the error bars shown.
           (ERR-1) The second-largest contribution to the total
           uncertainty in the cross section is due to the target
           thickness and is 4%.
