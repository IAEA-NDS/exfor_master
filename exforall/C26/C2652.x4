ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors on both the "raw"
           numbers and the corrections have been combined to
           yield the errors stated.
CORRECTION The following corrections to the earlier works were
           significant: (a) the path length was measured
           accurately (it is now 3% shorter), (b) four
           antiprotons that scattered elastically and left. the
           chamber before annihilating were discovered, and (c)
           the cutoff-angle criterion was improved.
