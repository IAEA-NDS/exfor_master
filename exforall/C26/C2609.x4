TITLE      Ordinary and Exchange Scattering of Negative Pions by
           Hydrogen

INSTITUTE  (1USACHI)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The large Chicago cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The two scintillators had diameters 4 inches
           and 3 inches and were placed, respectively, 8 inches
           and 11 inches below the center of the scattering
           chamber.
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen.
METHOD     (COINC) The beam of pions enters the experimental
           space and is deflected by an analyzing magnet. After
           this, it is recorded by the coincidences of two
           1-inch-square crystals and falls on the liquid
           hydrogen scattering chamber. The scattered products
           are observed by quadruple coincidences of these two
           counters with another pair of scintillators located
           directly under the scattering chamber in a direction
           at 90 degrees to that of the incident pions. In order
           to increase the sensitivity of the scattering
           detectors to gamma-rays, a lead radiator 1/4 inch
           thick was interposed in front of the third counter. A
           standard measurement involved the observation of the
           ratio between scattered and incident particles with
           and without hydrogen in the scattering chamber, and
           with and without the lead converter of the
           gamma radiation.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

ANALYSIS   The conversion to a scattering cross section depends
           on the assumptions made as to the angular
           distribution. It also depends on the assumption that
           me have made in this paper that all neutral pions
           decay immediately into two photons. For example, if
           we assume that the angular distribution is fairly
           isotropic in the center-of-mass system and that the
           gamma-rays are produced in pairs by the decay of the
           neutral pions.

ANALYSIS   The cross section obtained for the charge exchange
           process is not very sensitive to the angular
           distribution adopted.
FLAG       (1.) cosine theta**2 gamma-ray distribution.
