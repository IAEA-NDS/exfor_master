TITLE      Measurement of the 230Th(p,2n)229Pa and 230Th(p,3n)

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USALRL) Experiment performed at the Center for
           Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at Lawrence Livermore
           National Laboratory using 10 MV tandem accelerator
SAMPLE     Thorium was separated from uranium ore. The final
           product was 91.32+-0.77 mg of thorium with a purity
           of 99.5+-1.2 wt%. Isotope ratio 230Th/232Th was
           determined by mass spectrometry to be 0.0922+-0.00150.
           In experiment a target stack  was used to degrade beam
           energy. Stack consisted of
             - thin tantalum cover foil 5 mu-m thick
             - ThO2 target with thickness ranging from
               921.710+-0.005 to 1913.309+-0.005 mu-g Th/cm2 on
               Ti backing (cover) 2 mu-m thick
             - Y monitor foil
             - spacer foil Ta (10 mu-m) or Pt (25 mu-m)
             - ThO2 target on Ti backing
             - spacer foil Ta (10 mu-m) or Pt (25 mu-m)
             - ThO2 target on Ti backing
             - Beam stop
           Together 8 target foils were irradiated. In first
           experiment stack with two target foils without spacers
           was used.

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma ray spectra were measured using GPGe
           detectorsaas well as low energy photon spectcrometer
            (LAPS) detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Column chromatography was used to
                         separate protactinium.

           Half-life was measured by authors as 19.5+-0.4 hr,
           which is different from the value used in literature.
