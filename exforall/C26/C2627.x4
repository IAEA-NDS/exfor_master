FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed using K500
           superconducting cyclotron and MARS Spectrometer at
           the Cyclotron Institute of Texas A+M University
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.95) Two isotopically enriched 208Pb
           foils with thickness of 2.37 mg/cm2, evaporated on a
           0.08 mg/cm2 thick carbon backing
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) Charged particles were detected
           using telescope consisting of two double-sided
           silicon strip detectors (DSSSD) was placed at forward
           angle. E detectcor was 128 x 128 DSSSD with active
           area of 97.2 x 97.2 mm2 and thickness of 500 mu-m. dE
           detector was 16 x 16 DSSSD with active area of 49.5 x
           49.5 mm2 and thickness of 38 mu-m. E and dE detectors
           were placed 100 mm and 50 mm away from target,
           respectivelly and covered laboratory theta angles
           between 15 deg and 89 deg.
           (SISD) Another identical DSSSD E detector was placed
           at a distance 100 mm from the target at backward
           angle, covering theta laboratoty angles between 87
           deg and 161 deg.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE The radioactive 10C beam was produced by the charge-
           exchange p(10B,10C)n reaction. The primary 10B beam
           with energy of 9.6MeV/u was delivered by the K500
           superconducting cyclotron and impinged on a cooled H2
           gas cell. The produced 10C ions were selected by the
           Momentum Achromatic Recoil Spectrometer.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties mainly due to solid
                     angles and the beam spot size at the target
