TITLE      The angular distribution of the isomeric ratio of the
           197Au(p,pn)196Au reaction with 400 MeV protons

FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACAR)
SAMPLE     The target was 50 mu-g/cm2 gold evaporated onto
           0.008 cm thick aluminum foil.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7.5 cm or a 2 mm NaI crystal
METHOD     (ACTIV) The (p,pn) reaction recoils were caught on a
           cylindrically shaped aluminum catcher foil placed above
           or below the proton beam.
           (CHSEP) The catcher foil was cut into strips
           corresponding to 10 degrees segments and the 196Au from
           each strip was separated, purified and mounted using
           standard radiochemical techniques.
           (INTB) The target was placed at 45 degrees in the
           internal beam of the Carnegie-Mellon University
           synchrocyclotron.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties were estimated using the
           standard deviation from the average value of the ratio
           at the point and include an estimate of the systematic
           errors ascribable to uncertainties in the decay schemes
           and counting efficiencies.
ADD-RES    Over the whole angular distribution the mean value of
           the isomeric ratio with its standard deviation is
           0.18 +/- 0.06.
