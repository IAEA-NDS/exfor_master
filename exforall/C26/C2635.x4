INSTITUTE  (1USACHI)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The Chicago synchrocyclotron.
INC-SOURCE The pions are produced by a 450-MeV proton beam
           striking a beryllium target inside the cyclotron.
           Negative pions emitted in the forward direction are
           bent outward by the cyclotron magnetic field and
           emerge through a thin aluminum window from the vacuum
           chamber of the machine. Positive pions are obtained
           by reversing the direction of both the cyclotron and
           the deflecting magnetic fields.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Liquid scintillation counters: The cell is
           made of clear Lucite 4-in. thick over all with
           1/16-in. thick Lucite windows. The liquid is
           phenyl cyclohexane with 3 grams per liter of terphenyl
           and 10 mg per liter of diphenyl hexatriene according
           to the prescription of Kallman. The end of the
           Lucite cell is shaped to fit the photocathode of a
           5819 tube and good optical contact is assured by a
           thin layer of clear silicone grease.
SAMPLE     Two different liquid hydrogen containers were used.

METHOD     (COINC) The pion beam is defined by passing through
           two 2-in. diameter liquid scintillation counters, and
           thereafter enters the hydrogen cell. The scattered
           particles are detected by a pair of scintillation
           counters, arranged on a table to pivot around the
           central axis of the hydrogen cell. A quadruple
           coincidence is recorded when a particle passes
           through the first two counters and is scattered so as
           to pass through the second pair. The double
           coincidences of the first pair are recorded at the
           same time. The fraction of the incident beam which is
           scattered is given by the ratio of the quadruple to
           double coincidences. The hydrogen cell was designed
           for rapid insertion and removal of the liquid
           hydrogen in order to distinguish the effect of the
           hydrogen from the scattering by surrounding
           materials. The mean path length of pions traversing
           the hydrogen in these experiments was 14.4 cm. When
           the cell was filled with liquid hydrogen, the number
           of atoms/cm2 was 4.2*10**22. When the cell was empty,
           it is  still contained gaseous hydrogen at liquid
           hydrogen temperature amounting to 0.07*10**22
           atoms/cm2. The difference, 4.13*10**22, multiplied by
           the effective length of the scattering cell, gives
           5.95*10**23 H atoms/cm2. The efficiency of counters
           No. 3 and No. 4 for counting a scattered pion that
           geometrically should be accepted by both counters was
           not 100 percent because the counter efficiency was
           not perfect (98 percent), and nuclear absorption in
           the first counter and in the hydrogen cell further
           reduced the efficiency to about 93 percent.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The probable errors are those due to
           statistics alone. Uncertainties in the beam energy
           and its pion content as well as in the estimates of
           the efficiency of detection all contribute to the
           inaccuracy of the experiment. These additional errors
           have not been added in this case because the
           statistical error was believed to be dominant.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors indicated in these two cross
           sections comprise only the statistical error. Other
           sources of error are, in order of importance, the
           uncertainty in the efficiencies in the actual pion
           content and energy of the beam, and geometrical
           errors. We have estimated that the overall effect of
           these errors may amount to 10 percent, and this error
           has been combined with the statistical error in the
           fina1 results.
