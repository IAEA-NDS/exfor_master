DETECTOR   (HPGE,SCIN) A coaxial n-type HPGe detector, of 109%
           relative efficiency. Additionally, a CeBr detector
           was fixed at a backward angle of -135 degree in order
           to provide a consistency check throughout the
           experiment and monitor for any drifting.
SAMPLE     Three different types of nitrogen implanted targets
           with backings of Mo, Ta, and W to reduce systematic
           uncertainties. The targets were produced with the 5
           MV Sta. Ana accelerator at the University of Notre
           Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory. The Ta, Mo, and W
           targets were found to have nitrogen contents of
           21.3+-1.3, 13.1+-0.7, and 13.4+-0.5*10**17 atoms/cm2,
           respectively.
METHOD     The lifetimes have been determined with the Doppler-
           Shift Attenuation Method (DSAM) with three separate,
           nitrogen-implanted targets with Mo, Ta, and W backing.

ANALYSIS   Authors obtained lifetimes from the weighted average
           of the three measurements, allowing us to account for
           systematic differences between the backing materials.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Authors indicate possible presence of
           systematic uncertainties, however no details are given.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Authors provided experimentally
           determined lifetime values (in fs). The compiler
           used listed in the article (page 045802-2) formula:
           Gamma=hbar/tau and hbar value of 6.5821810**-16 eV sec
           to deduce widths.
