SAMPLE     A thin-walled liquid hydrogen Dewar.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Scintillation counters. Counter No. 1 in these
           experiments was a liquid scintillator with an overall
           thickness of 1/4 in., and counter No. 2 was a
           plastic scintillator 1/8 in. thick.
METHOD     (COINC) A beam of pions of the desired energy passes
           through two scintillation counters and after that
           traverses a thin-walled liquid hydrogen Dewar. The
           scattered particles are detected by two other
           counters No. 3 and No. 4. The double coincidences of
           No. 1 and No. 2 give a measure of the number of
           primary particles. The, quadruple coincidences of the
           four counters give a measure of the number of
           scattered particles that are detected by the
           detecting counters No. 3 and No.4.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors listed in this table are
           compounded out of the statistical error plus a 10
           percent error that we estimate may be due to our
           imperfect knowledge of the sensitivity of the
           detecting equipment.
           (ERR-1) Imperfect knowledge of the detecting equipment.
