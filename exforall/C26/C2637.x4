DETECTOR   (SCIN) The use of scintillation counters ensured
           counting efficiencies of substantially 100 percent
           and also allowed a pulse-height investigation of beam
           homogeneity.
SAMPLE     The target is constructed of polystyrene foam. Liquid
           hydrogen, 2.8 g/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors shown include statistical and
           target-thickness uncertainties.

METHOD     (COINC) Attenuation of the external proton beam in
           liquid hydrogen was measured with standard counting
           techniques.
ANALYSIS   The counting rate of counters 1-2-3 in
           coincidence was subtracted from the 1-2 coincidence
           rate and divided by the latter to obtain the
           attenuation occurring between counters 2 and 3. The
           difference in this quantity for the target filled
           with liquid hydrogen and for the empty target is
           attributed to scattering of the beam through an angle
           greater than the average half-angle subtended by the
           rear counter (No. 3).
