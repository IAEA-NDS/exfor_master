FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed using the K150
           Cyclotron at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A+M
           University
SAMPLE     Texas Active Target scattering chamber is a gas-filled
           Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a gas mixture
           of 40Ar (95%) + CH4(5%)  at 150 Torr.
DETECTOR   Time projection chamber with a micromegas(Micro-MEsh
           GAseous Structures) detector with 1024 read-out
           channels on an active area of 224 x 240mm2.
INC-SOURCE The primary 6Li beam was accelerated via the K150
           Cyclotron to an energy of 9.9MeV/u and transported to
           the cryogenic gas target located at the entrance of
           Momentum Achromat Recoil Spectrometer (MARS) . The
           secondary 8B beam was produced in-flight using the
           6Li(3He,n) 8B reaction. The gas-cell target was
           filled with 3He at a pressure of 800 Torr and
           temperature of 77 K. A 97%- pure 5.1MeV/u 8B beam of
           103pps was produced with an energy spread of 1.2 MeV.
           Secondary beam was analyzed using MARS spectrometer.
