INSTITUTE  (1USANCS,1USATNL)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) The Triangle Universities Nuclear
           Laboratory (TUNL) Enge split-pole spectrograph.
SAMPLE     Targets were produced under vacuum by thermally
           evaporating NaBr powder onto 22 mu-g/cm2-thick
           natural carbon backing foils. The NaBr thickness, as
           measured with a thickness monitor during evaporation,
           was approximately 70 mu-g/cm2. The exact sodium
           concentration was not required for the experiment
           since the measurement was performed relative to the
           elastic scattering cross section.
METHOD     (EDE) The proton transfer experiment was performed at
           TUNL using the Enge split-pole spectrograph. The
           instrument is located at the end of the
           high-resolution beam line at the TUNL Tandem
           accelerator laboratory, where two 90-degree dipole
           analyzing magnets deliver beams of precisely
           controlled energies to the target. A 3He++ beam
           energy of 21 MeV was chosen to minimize the presence
           of contaminants in spectral areas. The NaBr targets
           were placed on a target ladder along with a natural
           carbon backing foil for background identification.
           The beam current was monitored with an
           electron-suppressed beam stop downstream from the
           targets. A silicon telescope was placed at 45 degree
           to monitor target degradation, and beam fluctuations,
           and to normalize the data. Reaction products from the
           target entered the Enge split-pole spectrograph
           through a 1 msr aperture and were momentum-analyzed
           with a magnetic field. Deuterons were clearly
           identified with a dE vs E cut. These spectra were
           internally calibrated using precisely known states in
           24Mg.
ANALYSIS   Over the entire focal plane, most states are in good
           agreement with the literature energies with an average
           deviation of 1.3-sigma.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
