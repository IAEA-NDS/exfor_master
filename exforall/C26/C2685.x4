FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the 88-inch
           cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
SAMPLE     The beam was incident on a 4"-diameter target wheel
           rotating at approx. 30 Hz, located upstream of the BGS.
           The target wheel contained four target segments - three
           segments of 209Bi with an average thickness of
           0.500 mg/cm2 for  the production of Md isotopes and
           a fourth segment  made of 165Ho with an average
           thickness of 0.365 mg/cm2 for the production of At
           isotopes.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SISD) Reaction products recoiled to the
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator, where they were
           separated according to ions A/q. At the BGS focal
           plane ions can be implanted into a retractable 32 x
           32 double-sided silicon strip detector or ions could
           pass through 2.1 mu-m thick Ti foil into FIONA setup.
           (SISD) After magnetic analysis in BGS, the beam
           entered the FIONA setup, which consisted of beam
           manipulation elements as RFQ cooler and trap,
           accelerating element with focusing, steering and
           diagnostic. The accelerated beam entered
           low-background area where the ions were separated by
           their A/q in a trochoidal spectrometer which utilizes
           crossed magnetic and electric fields, tuned to force
           the ions traveling through the spectrometer to take
           trochoidal trajectories. At the FIONA focal plane
           ions are implanted into 32 x 32 strip double sided Si
           strip detector.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Evaporation residue (EVR)-alpha-alpha
           correlations were searched for in data taken at the
           220 MeV beam energy with the BGS focal plane detector
           inserted and FIONE focal plane detector. Time windows
           were expanded up to 30 and 300 s for EVR-alpha1 and
           EVR-alpha1-alpha2, respectively. The 244Md was
           identified according to EVR mass and energies of
           series of decay alphas.
