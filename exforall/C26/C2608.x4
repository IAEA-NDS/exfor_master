FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The large Chicago cyclotron.
INC-SPECT  The negative pions are produced in the large Chicago
           cyclotron by protons of 450 MeV striking a target
           which in some of the experiments was copper and in
           others beryllium. A sharply collimated beam
           containing pions with energy defined within ~3
           percent. In addition to the pions this beam contains
           some muons and electrons of the same momentum. Their
           number has been determined from a range curve. The
           muons amount to between 5 percent and 10 percent. The
           electrons are present in negligible numbers for beams
           above 100 MeV. Below this energy the electron
           contamination increases rapidly. For this reason low
           energy measurements have been taken by reducing with
           a beryllium absorber the energy of the 122-MeV beam.
SAMPLE     A glass cylinder 3 inches in diameter and 7.5 inches
           long, closed by 0.005-inch copper windows. This
           chamber can be alternately filled with and emptied of
           liquid hydrogen.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two scintillation crystals of 1-inch-square
           cross section separated by a distance of about one
           meter. A pair of liquid scintillation counters.
METHOD     (COINC) The coincidences of these two scintillation
           counters indicate the number of particles entering
           the equipment. Beyond the second crystal the pions
           enter the scattering chamber. The particles which are
           not scattered out of the beam are recorded by the
           coincidences which they give in a pair of liquid
           scintillation counters. The double coincidence rate
           of the first two scintillators is recorded and at the
           same time the quadruple coincidence rate of all four
           scintillators. The attenuation of the beam is
           obtained from a comparison of the ratio of the
           quadruple to double coincidence counts with and
           without the hydrogen and is computed as a cross
           section.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION A number of corrections have been applied to the
           results on account of the following effects:
            (1) Background due to accidentals (usually 1 percent
           or less).
            (2) Angular spread of the beam due to geometry,
           diffraction scattering, and pi-mu decay. In some
           experiments the multiple scattering was compensated
           by means of an equivalent aluminum foil; in others it
           was computed. This correction is important only at
           low energies.
            (3) Muon and electron component in the original beam.
           It is assumed that muons and electrons suer only
           Coulomb scattering and have no specific nuclear
           interaction.
            (4) Correction for scattered particles
           recorded by the end counters. This correction was
           computed on the assumption of isotropic scattering in
           the center-of-mass system. It amounted to between 4
           percent and 2 percent depending on whether the recoil
           protons are or are not recorded. The correction would
           be larger if the scattering were predominately
           forward but smaller if charge exchange scattering
           were important.
