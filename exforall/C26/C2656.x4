SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 376 mg/cm2
           was located at the target position of S800
           spectrograph
METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Coincidence between focal plane
           detector and gamma ray array GRETINA was required.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Charged particle reaction products were
           momentum-analyzed in S800 spectrograph
           (TELES,DRFTC,IOCH,SCIN) Reaction residues were
           identified in focal plane detector, consisting of
           two drift chambers, ionization chamber and four
           plastic scintillation detectors.
           (HPGE) Prompt gamma radiation emitted in flight by
           the reaction products was detected using high-
           resolution GRETINA gamma-ray array. GRETINA detector
           consist of four 36-fold segmented high-purity
           germanium detectors, grouped into modules of four
           crystals each. The 11 GRETINA modules available at
           the time of the experiment were arranged in two
           rings with 4 modules located at 58deg and the other
           7 modules at 90deg with respect to the beam axis.
INC-SOURCE The secondary 68Co beam was produced by fragmentation
           of a 140-MeV/u 82Se stable beam impinging on a
           329 mg/cm2 9Be production target and was separated
           with a 300 mg/cm2 Al degrader in the A1900 fragment
           separator.The secondary beam contained 46% of 68Co,
           40% of 66Fe and 9.5% of 65Mn.

ANALYSIS   The inclusive cross section for 68Co to 68Fe charge
           exchange was determined from the number of 68 Fe
           products detected in the S800 focal plane relative
           to the number of7/858/5768 Co projectiles
