DETECTOR   (GEMUC) A thin-window, bell-jar type Geiger-Mueller
           counter under conditions of known counting
           efficiency. Conventional alpha-particle counters and
           an alpha-pulse analyzer were used for the
           alpha-emitters.
SAMPLE     The metallic uranium, 2-cm x 0.5-cm area and 0.1-cm
           thickness.

REACTION   (92-U-238(A,F),,SIG)
ANALYSIS   The total cross section for the fission reaction was
           estimated from the area under the fission part of
           the mass yield curve. This value must be considered to
           be a very rough one, because of the unknown intensity
           of the helium ion beam.

           (92-U-238(A,X)56-BA-140,,PY))
METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP) After each of the irradiations,
           amounting to some 25 in number, the metallic uranium
           was dissolved, and the yield in weighed chemical
           reactions of each of several isotopes was determined
           by means of counting experiments using a
           Geiger-Mueller counter. The yield for each isotope
           was determined relative to a standard isotope, the
           12.8-day Ba140, in order to compensate for the
           day-to-day variation in intensity of the helium ion
           beam.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for self-absorption, and for
           absorption by air and the mica window;
           back-scattering was insignificant in comparison with
           other factors.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors indicated on this curve are
           estimated probable errors, arising from counting
           statistics, chemical operations, and correction
           factors applied.
COMMENT    198,199Au and 236,238,239Np were shown as single data
           points, so maximum values were assigned to the nuclei.
