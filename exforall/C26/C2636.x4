REACTION   (1-H-1(P,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
ANALYSIS   Assume that we deal with p-p scattering of the
           impinging proton by an individual proton in the
           lithium nucleus. After the collision, the two protons
           escape without suffering any other collision;
           otherwise they would not be detected by the counter
           arrangement used. The protons in the lithium nucleus,
           however, are not at rest and in applying the
           conservation of energy and momentum to the system we
           shall take into account, by some admittedly crude
           assumptions, the internal motion of the protons and
           their binding energy.
