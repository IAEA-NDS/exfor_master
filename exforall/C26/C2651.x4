TITLE      Experiments on Antiprotons: Cross Sections of Complex
           Nuclei

FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) Bevatron, a weak-focusing proton
           synchrotron.
INC-SPECT  The Bevatron beam incident upon the antiproton
           production target was in the energy range 5.8 to 6.3
           GeV. The internal beam intensity was from 2*10**10 to
           3*10**10 protons per pulse, one pulse every 6 seconds.
           The production targets used were C or (CH2)n.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CEREN) The velocity was determined by the use
           of Cherenkov counters that discriminated against pions
           but were sensitive to antiprotons. These counters
           consisted of liquid styrene radiators (index of
           refraction 1.543) viewed by one RCA-6810
           photomultiplier tube. The annihilation events were
           separately detected in Counter C*, which was a
           Cherenkov counter containing methyl alcohol (index of
           refraction 1.33).
METHOD     (ASEP,COINC) The mass spectrograph, which gave a
           signal whenever an antiproton passed through it. The
           spectrograph contained several improvements that
           greatly increased the luminosity of the apparatus.
           This was accomplished by increasing the aperture of
           the spectroscope and, also, by accepting a momentum
           interval of 3% instead of only 1% as before. This
           relaxation of the momentum definition made the mass
           determination less precise, but once antiprotons had
           been identified, we could afford this uncertainty.
           Nuclear-emulsion studies of annihilations of
           antiprotons have shown that nearly all annihilations
           give rise to fast charged pions (fast enough to give
           detectable light in methyl alcohol) or neutral pions
            (whose gamma rays frequently are converted within
           Counter C* and give detectable Cherenkov radiation).
           Each antiproton indicated by the mass spectrograph
           was considered an annihilation if it was accompanied
           by a pulse in the C* counter, irrespective of whether
           counts were registered by other counters. If no pulse
           was seen in the C* counter, then the presence or
           absence of pulses in other counters indicated whether
           the antiproton in question passed through without
           scattering (actually, scattered to an angle smaller
           than 14.3 degrees), or scattered to an angle between
           14.3 and 20.5 degrees, or scattered to an angle
           greater than 20.5 degrees.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors in the determination
           of the cross sections are given by the formula dsigma
           thetac = (1/N)*[(1/(I thetac))-(1/(I0)) ]**0.5,
           where N is the thickness of the absorber in the slots
           in nuclei per square centimeter, I0 the number of
           incident particles, I thetac is the number of
           pass-through particles with a cutoff angle thetac.
           Some other systematic error will be shown by further
           experiments.
