COMMENT    The gamma-ray    spectra    from    the     reactions
            S-32(gamma,p+gamma')P-31                         and
            S-32(gamma,n+gamma')S-31 have been measured by means
            of   a   100-cm**3  Ge(Li)  detector;  the  incident
            gamma-quanta were from the bremsstrahlung beam  with
            a  end-point  energy of 32 MeV.  The detection angle
            was 140 degrees.  The partial angle dependent  cross
            section  integrals  were obtained for the population
            of separate states of  the  final  nuclei  P-31  and
            S-31.  On  the  basis  of  the  isospin  symmetry of
            nucleon decays the partial  and  total  photoneutron
            cross  sections  of  the  nucleus S-32 were obtained
            from the experimental data on the energy  dependence
            of   the   partial   photoproton   cross   sections.
            Semi-direct  components  were  singled  out  in  the
            photoproton  and  photoneutron  cross sections.  The
            photoabsorption cross sections  of  S-32  were  also
            extracted  and  the  probabilities of the semidirect
            mechanism are determined for the decay of the dipole
            giant   resonance   in   the   nucleus   to  various
            photodisintegration channels.
