TITLE      Study of the cross section of the reaction
            Cu-63(gamma,n) in the beam of quasimonochromatic
            annihilation photons in energy range from 12 to 25
            MeV.

ANALYSIS   Yield measurement. The cross section have been
           obtained from the yield by means of calculation of
           absolute efficacy of registration, effective flow of
           photons and density of target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given.
