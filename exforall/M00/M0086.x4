SAMPLE     Metallic thorium foil.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Mica detectors.
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The unfolding of the reaction cross section
            from  the  experimental reaction yield (presented in
            Fig. 1, bottom, circles) measured using the direct
            fission fragment counting using the iterational
            method of minimization of directed divergences.

            Method of cross section unfolding from the yield.
ERR-ANALYS No information
COMMENT    Yields and cross sections for photofission reaction
            Th-232(gamma,f) were measured at the range 4.5-7 MeV.
