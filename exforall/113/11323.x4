FACILITY   (CCW,1USALRL) Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The D(d,n)He3 reaction, with a gas target, was
           used to produce neutrons over a range from 9.7 to 14.5
           MeV.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 0.5-in. diam plastic spherical scintillator.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

REACTION   (6-C-0(N,NON),,SIG)
METHOD     (SHELT) Spherical shell transmission. Transmission
           measurements on carbon were made at a series of
           energies ranging from 5.8 to 12.9 MeV. Spherical
           shells 2 cm and 4 cm thick were used, and data were
           recorded at 10 detector biases simultaneously.
CORRECTION Not able to properly correct for multiple scattering.
STATUS     (TABLE) page 486.
