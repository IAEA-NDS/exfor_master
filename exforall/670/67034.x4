TITLE      HIGH RESOLUTION NEUTRON SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS AND THE
            ANALYSIS OF RESONANCE ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND PARITY.
FACILITY   (ISOCY) KARLSRUHE ISOCHRONOUS CYCLOTRON
INC-SOURCE DEUTERONS ON URANIUM
SAMPLE     5-CM DIAMETER BY 12-CM LENGTH CYLINDERS. SYMMETRY AXIS
            PERPENDICULAR TO REACTION PLANE.
METHOD     (TOF) 58-M FLIGHT PATH WITH 0.05 NANO-SEC/M RESOLUTION.
            SAMPLE SURROUNDED BY THREE DETECTORS OF 11.4 CM BY
            2.54-CM AT ANGLES OF 54, 90, AND 140 DEGREES.
            ADDITIONAL DETECTOR OF 2.54-CM BY 0.635-CM PLACED IN
            OPEN BEAM DIRECTION TO MONITOR NEUTRON FLUX.
            A 1-M LENGTH BY 7-CM DIAMETER AL COLLIMATOR WAS USED
            AT END OF FLIGHT PATH.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS WITH PHOTOMULTIPLIERS
            WITH SUBTENDED ANGLE OF 25 DEGREES
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) ANALYSIS OF DATA USES ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF
            RESONANCE SHAPES IN ELASTIC CROSS SECTION.
           CHARACTERISTIC RESONANCE SHAPES CALCULATED WITH
            LEGENDRE POLYNOMIAL EXPANSION AND R-MATRIX FORMALISM.
           ASSIGNMENT OF L AND J VALUES ARE REFERENCED TO
            PRECALCULATED SHAPES AND CALCULATED RESONANCE
            FEATURES OF S,P AND D WAVES.
CORRECTION NO CORRECTIONS MADE FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND ANGULAR
            RESOLUTION.
ERR-ANALYS STATISTICAL ERROR LESS THAN 2% AND DOES NOT EXCEED
             POINT SIZE.
