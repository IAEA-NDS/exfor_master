FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) The U-400M cyclotron of FLNR
           (PRJFS,4ZZZDUB)  6He ions were separated from the
           primary beam particles and majority of other reaction
           products using the doubly achromatic separator
           ACCULINNA.
INC-SOURCE The secondary beam of 6He ions was produced by the
           bombardment of a thick (350 mg/cm2) beryllium target
           with a 43 MeV/n 13C primary beam.
SAMPLE     A 400 mu-m CH2 foil was used as a hydrogen target.
           The data were collected in two runs.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) The reaction products of interest
           were detected by an array of two dE x dE x E telescopes
           mounted on two arms movable in the horizontal plane.
           Each telescope consisted of two silicon strip
           detectors (area of 60 x 60 mm2, thickness of 400 mu-m,
           29 identical 2 mm strips in each detector) and
           a 20 mm thick CsI(Tl) crystal 65 x 65 mm2 in area.
           The calibration of the strip detector was performed
           using a 226Ra source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include the contributions from
           statistical errors and the inaccuracy of the
           efficiency simulations (including, for ln-transfer
           data, also the small solid angle uncertainties caused
           by the two extreme assumptions made for the 5He decay).
           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the absolute cross section.
           The main contribution to this value is caused by the
           beam monitoring errors.

DETECTOR   (SCIN) For the elastic channel, the presently attained
            angular distribution data were supplemented by the
            experimental points obtained in a preliminary
            experiment, which was carried out earlier. In that
            experiment, the authors used two Si-detector
            telescopes.
