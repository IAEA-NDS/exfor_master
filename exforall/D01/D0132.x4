FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB) U-400M cyclotron of FLNR
           (PRJFS,4ZZZDUB) 6He separation by ACCULINNA separator
INC-SOURCE The secondary beam of 6He ions was produced by the
            bombardment of a thick (350 mg/cm2) beryllium target
            with a 43 MeV/n 13C primary beam.
SAMPLE     A 400 um CH2 foil was used as a hydrogen target.
           The data were collected in two runs.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR)
            The reaction products of interest were detected by
             an array of two dE x dE x E telescopes mounted on
             two arms movable in the horizontal plane.
            Each telescope consisted of two silicon strip
             detectors (area of 60 x 60 mm2, thickness of 400 um,
             29 identical 2 mm strips in each detector) and
             a 20 mm thick CsI(Tl) crystal 65 x 65 mm2 in area.
            The calibration of the strip detector was performed
             using a 226Ra source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors include the contributions from
             statistical errors and the inaccuracy of the
             efficiency simulations (including, for in-transfer
             data, also the small solid angle uncertainties
             caused by the two extreme assumptions made for the
             5He decay).
            Total uncertainty is about 30%, for which the main
             contribution to this value is caused by the beam
             monitoring errors.

            The presently attained angular distribution data were
             supplemented by the experimental points obtained in
             a preliminary experiment, which was carried out
             earlier.
            In that experiment, the authors used two Si-detector
             telescopes.
