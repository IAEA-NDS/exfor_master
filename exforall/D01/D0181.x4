FACILITY   (SYNCY)
INC-SOURCE (POLIS)
METHOD     (EXTB,EDE)
DETECTOR   (TELES) The polarimeter was turnable about a vertical
           axis through detector. The thickness of the scatterer
           in the polarimeter was 33.3 g/cm2.
           The beam was monitored by a scintillator telescope
           directed towards the target
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical error in the false asymmetry
           (ANG-ERR) The angular scale uncertain within a
           (ERR-SYS) The possible systematic error in the
           analyzing power was calculated taking into account
           the various possibilities of fitting the data of
           ref.((,Baldin+,J,PR,103,1502,1956) with smooth curves
           and the fact that the inelastic contributions may be
           different.
