           Nuclear Beams

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) The intense 6He beam is produced by
           the isotope-separation-on-line technique
INC-SOURCE LiF target, where the 6He nuclei are produced
           in the 7Li(p,2p)6He reaction.
SAMPLE     95 mu-g/cm2 thick polythene target
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) The experimental setup is consisted
           of three arrays of highly segmented, large solid
           angle Si strip detectors. The detectors used were 20
           sectors of the Louvain la Neuve-Edinburgh-detector-
           array (LEDA) with a total of 320 strips. The first
           array LEDA consisted of eight sectors, placed in an
           annular configuration with each sector normal to
           the beam direction. The other -LAMP - two arrays each
           consisted of six sectors at 45 degr. with respect to
           the beam axis.
STATUS     (CURVE) Data were digitized because there are no any
