           Targets from 9Be to 208Pb

SAMPLE     The thin circular targets, approximately 1 cm in diam.,
           were mounted in a target wheel accommodating
           13 targets and two empty space for target-out
           measurements.
METHOD     (EDE,EXTB,INTB) A series of target-in and target-out
           measurements, each consisting of about 5 x 10**6
           incident protons, was performed for each target.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) Two thin passing scintillator
           detectors worked in coincidence; two annular
           scintillator detectors.
           (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) Beyond the target wheel was the
           stopping detector telescope consisted:
            - a set of three plastic scintillator detectors.
           The first was circular with a diameter of 5.24 mm,
           while the second and third detectors were ring shaped
           with inner and outer diameters of 4.30 and 7.35mm and
           6.65 and 8.77 mm, respectively.
           - two CsI-detectors mounted together.
CORRECTION  * Various corrections were made on elastic
           scattering that did not registed by detectors used
           in the experiment (see the text of the paper).
            * The results were also corrected for the limited
           angular acceptance of the detector system.
            * Corrections due to finite target thickness and
           finite beam size were estimated to be negligible.
