SAMPLE     Two different targets of natural isotopic composition
           were used for proton cross section measurements. Sample
           no.1 comprising thin TiN and Au layers on Si substrate
           was prepared by TiN deposition (reactive magnetron
           sputtering in Ar + N2 atmosphere) and subsequent vacuum
           evaporation of thin gold layer which serves as an
           internal standard. The former technique was employed
           also for the preparation of sample no.2 comprising TiN
           layer on Be backing. Both samples were thoroughly
           investigated by the standard RBS method using 2 MeV
           alpha particles to determine their composition and
           thickness. The measured relative areal densities
           of relevant elements irt sample no.1 were
           N:Ti:Au = (9.5 :to.5): (8.4 :to.5): 1 and in
           sample no.2 Ti:N = (0.98 :t 0.05): 1. The measured
           thickness of TiN layers (in TiNlcm-2)on sample no. 1
           and no. 2 was 3.8 x 1017 and 6.0 x 1017, respectively.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The systematic error in non-resonant regions
           arising mainly from uncertain knowledge of target
           composition.
           (ERR-2) Around the narrow nitrogen resonance at 1742keV
           an additional error appears due to the finite target
           thickness, proton beam energy inhomogeneity, the system
           energy resolution.
