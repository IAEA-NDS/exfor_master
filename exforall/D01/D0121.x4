TITLE      Excitation function studies of alpha induced reactions
           for niobium and prequilibrium effects

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC) Variable energy cyclotron
METHOD     (STTA,GSPEC,ACTIV)
SAMPLE     The stack was made with spectroscopically pure niobium
           foils of thickness 10.5 mg/cm2. The niobium foil was
           cut into pieces of size 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, and each of
           them was glued to an aluminum frame, having a circular
           hole of diameter 1.2 cm in its center. Energy degrader
           aluminum foils of different thickness were sandwiched
           between the target foils, so as to get the desired
           a-particle energy incident on each foil.
           A copper foil of thickness 10.68 mg/cm2 was also used
           as a flux monitor for checking the flux, and good
           agreement was found with less than 10% discrepancy.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-S) Statistical error is the larger one of the
           internal and external errors. The reported value is
           the weighted average of the various cross-section
           values so obtained. In general errors are less that 31%
