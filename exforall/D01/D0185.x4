METHOD     (EDE,EXTB,INTB) A series of target-in and target-out
           measurements, each consisting of about 5 x 10**6
           incident 3He-particles, was performed target. The
           final results were obtained from two or three such
           measurements for each target and from the average of
           the measurements without target, which were repeated
           every six targets.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) Two thin passing scintillator
           detectors worked in coincidence; two annular
           scintillator detectors.
           (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) Beyond the target wheel was the
           stopping detector telescope consisted:
            - a set of three plastic scintillator detectors.
           The first was circular with a diameter of 5.24 mm,
           while the second and third detectors were ring shaped
           with inner and outer diameters of 4.30-7.35 mm and
           6.65-8.77 mm, respectively.
           - a CsI-detector of a specific thickness at each
           energy.
SAMPLE     The targets, approximately 1 cm in diameter and
           considerably larger than the diameter of the beam,
           were mounted in a target wheel accommodating 13
           targets and two empty spaces for target-out
           measurements. Target characteristics are given in
           every SUBENTs.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (ERR-T) Experimental error
CORRECTION  * Various corrections were made on elastic
           scattering that did not registed by detectors used
           in the experiment (see the text of the paper).
            * The results were also corrected for the limited
           angular acceptance of the detector system.
            * Corrections due to finite target thickness and
           finite beam size were estimated to be negligible.
