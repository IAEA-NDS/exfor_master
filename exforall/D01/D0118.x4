SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum evaporation of 99.9%
           reagent grade copper. The target consisted of
           500 mu-g/cm2 copper deposited on a 0.025 cm thick gold
           backing. Target thickness was determined from the mass
           change of the gold blank and also from the quartz
           crystal deposition monitor reading at the end of the
           evaporation. This target was mounted directly at the
           end of a stainless steel target chamber on a knife-edge
           seal at 55 degr. to the beam direction.
DETECTOR   (GELI) The gamma-ray yields were measured with a
           60 cm3 Ge(Li) detector positioned at 55 degr. relative
           to the beam direction.
ANALYSIS   The gamma-ray data have been normalized to the results
           of Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations.

SAMPLE     Thin copper films were prepared by vacuum evaporation
           of copper onto glass slides coated with a release
           agent. These films were floated off and picked up onto
           Ta frames. The self-supporting target that was selected
           for the runs had a thickness of 320 mu-g/cm2.

SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum evaporation of 99.9%
           reagent grade copper. The target consisted of
           500 mu-g/cm2 copper deposited on a 0.025 cm thick gold
           backing. Target thickness was determined from the mass
           change of the gold blank and also from the quartz
           crystal deposition monitor reading at the end of the
           evaporation. This target was mounted directly at the
           end of a stainless steel target chamber on a knife-edge
           seal at 55 degr. to the beam direction.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The neutron detector consisted of a conventional
           10BF3 counter imbedded in a paraffin moderator.
           The counter was mbunted at 0 degr. and close to the
           target which was the same as described above for the
            (p, y) measurements. It was expected that, for energie
           sufficiently above the n threshold, the (p,n) reaction
           would have an isotropic yield, so that the observed
           yield would be a reasonably accurate measure of the
           total (p, n) cross section.
MONIT-REF  (,Colle+,J,PR/C,9,1819,1974) Finally, the measured
           relative excitation function was normalized to the
           absolute data of Colle et al. whose experiment involved
           the measurement of the yield of delayed 65Zn activity.

REACTION   (29-CU-65(P,N)30-ZN-65,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum evaporation of 99.9%
           reagent grade copper. The target consisted of
           500 mu-g/cm2 copper deposited on a 0.025 cm thick gold
           backing. Target thickness was determined from the mass
           change of the gold blank and also from the quartz
           crystal deposition monitor reading at the end of the
           evaporation. This target was mounted directly at the
           end of a stainless steel target chamber on a knife-edge
           seal at 55 degr. to the beam direction.
DETECTOR   (BF3) The neutron detector consisted of a conventional
           10BF3 counter imbedded in a paraffin moderator.
           The counter was mbunted at 0 degr. and close to the
           target which was the same as described above for the
            (p, y) measurements. It was expected that, for energie
           sufficiently above the n threshold, the (p,n) reaction
           would have an isotropic yield, so that the observed
           yield would be a reasonably accurate measure of the
           total (p, n) cross section.
MONIT-REF  (,Colle+,J,PR/C,9,1819,1974) Finally, the measured
           relative excitation function was normalized to the
           absolute data of Colle et al. whose experiment involved
           the measurement of the yield of delayed 65Zn activity.
