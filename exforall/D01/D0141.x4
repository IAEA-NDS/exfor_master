TITLE      Proton nuclear reaction cross sections in carbon
           and the 12C(p,p'3a) reaction mechanism at 13 MeV

REFERENCE  (J,JP/A,5,1252,1972)
           Experiment details are given in J. Sci.Instr.,v.42,
           p.856,1965.
FACILITY   (SYNCH) electron synchrotron. This was derived by
           compiler from the other paper of these authors:
             Proc.Phys.Soc.,Vol.76, p.65, 1960
INC-SOURCE Beam of protons from the 3He(d,p)4He reaction
DETECTOR   (TRD) The cloud chamber was a volume defined Wilson
           chamber of dimensions 30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm deep,
           operated at a pressure of 1.5 atm. The expansion was
           controlled by a rubber diaphragm.
           (PROPC) The triggering system consists essentially of t
           thin gas proportional counters placed in front of the
           chamber entrance window
           (SCIN) and a large area plastic scintillator, which
           covered most of the inside of the back wall of the
           chamber.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Scale error
           (DATA-ERR) Nothing said about errors.
           The cross sections obtained from experiment are
           evaluated from the total number of incident protons,
           and the gas thickness (in mg/cm2) for each
           experimental run.
