INSTITUTE  (2SWDUPP,1USARDL,2SWDTLU)
REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,50,871,1994) Preliminary data
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWDTLU) Well-collimated alpha particle beam
           from the Gustaf Werner cyclotron at the Svedberg Lab.
SAMPLE     The targets were mounted on a wheel accommodating
           14 targets and an empty space for target-out
           measurements. They were remotely positioned to an
           accuracy of 0.1 mm.
