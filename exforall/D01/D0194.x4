FACILITY   (CYCLO,4ZZZDUB)the U-400M cyclotron of FLNR
           (PRJFS,4ZZZDUB) The beam of 6He ions was purified from
           both the primary beam and the main part of other react.
           products by using the doubly achromatic separator
           ACCULINNA.
INC-SOURCE Secondary 24.5A MeV beam of 6He nuclei
           was produced by the bombardment of a 185-mg/cm2
           beryllium target with a 43A MeV 13C primary beam.
METHOD     (TOF)
SAMPLE     Two experimental runs with CH2 targets of thicknesses
           of 30.1 and 53.3 mg/cm2 were carried out. These thin
           and thick targets were used to detect protons in the
           laboratory angular range of 500-700 and 400-600,
           respectively. For elastic scattering, these ranges
           correspond to the proton energies of 8-28 MeV and
           17-40 MeV, respectively. To see background conditions,
           a 44-mg/cm2 carbon target was irradiated by the
           6He beam.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) The detector array included two
           position sensitive telescopes. The first telescope
           served as a master. It detected protons recoiled
           elastically or inelastically from the CH2 target.
           This telescope was mounted on an arm movable in the
           horizontal plane. The telescope consisted of two
           400-mu-m 60 x 60 mm2 silicon strip dE detectors and a
           20 mm thick 65 x 65 mm2 CsI(Tl) E detector. The
           overall energy resolution of the telescope was
           estimated to be about 2%.
           (TELES,SISD,SI) The RIKEN detector telescope was
           used to register elastically scattered 6He nuclei and
           alpha-particles originated from the decay of excited
           6He. It involved one double-side 250-mu-m silicon
           strip detector with both radial and annular strips
            (DSD), six single-side 750-mu-u silicon detectors
           with radial strips, and one single-side 750-mu-m
           silicon detector without strips.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) The uncertainty of the measured absolute
           cross section values.
           (DATA-ERR2) Errors include the statistical spread in
           the number of measured events, errors due to the
           efficiency simulation and due to the carbon background
           subtraction.
