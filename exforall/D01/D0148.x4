SAMPLE     The irradiated substances consisted of red mercury
           oxide containing less than 1 ppm iron, and
           high-purity (99.999%) metallic mercury. The red oxide
           was deposited on a scored aluminium plate (grooves
           1mm wide, 1 mm deep and 0.5 mm apart). About 2 g of
           powder are packed onto a surface of 40 cm2 then
           covered with a 10 u-m thick aluminium film.
