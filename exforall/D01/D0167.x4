SAMPLE     The targets were prepared by melting bismuth metal
           pellets (>99.999 % Bi) onto a circular cavity with a
           diameter of 25.4mm and depth of 0.50mm on a 42x40x3 mm
           aluminium target backing. The targets were machined to
           obtain a uniform thickness of the Bi-layer of 0.2 mm.
           For measurements of the thick target yield, targets
           were  placed in an electrically isolated water-cooled
           target holder also acting as a Faraday cup.
DETECTOR   (GE) Gamma-ray spectra were measured with a Ge-detector
           which had about a 50% efficiency relative to a NaI(Tl)
           detector for the 1332 keV line from 60Co. The Ge-detect
           was coupled to a multi-channel analyser.
