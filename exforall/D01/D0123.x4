METHOD     (STTA,GSPEC)
SAMPLE     A sample of thc element was made from spectroscopically
           pure rhodium of thickness 1.24 mg/cm2, with purity
           better than 99.99%. All the targets and aluminium
           degrader foils werc chosen in such a way that the
           a-beam of a desired energy would be available on a
           particular foil.
           Copper foil of thickness 10.68 mg/cm2 was also used as
           a flux monitor.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector of 100 cm3
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) total energy spread associated with the
           energy of each incident a-particle
           (DATA-ERR) total estimated errors in the cross sections
STATUS     (TABLE) Table received from A.Agarwal.
