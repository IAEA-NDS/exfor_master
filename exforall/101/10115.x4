TITLE      The average number of neutrons emitted in the
            spontaneous fission of some even-even heavy nuclides
METHOD     Determined by counting neutrons and fissions separately
DETECTOR   Neutrons counted in eight B10-lined tubes embedded on
            an 8 in. diameter in a 16 in. diameter by 15 in. long
            cylinder of high density polyethylene. Tubes connected
            in parallel. With discriminator set above 60Co gammas,
            Efficiency for 252Cf spontaneous neutrons - 3.84%.
           (PROPC) Fissions counted with gas-flow proportional
            counters in 2 pi geometry, biased above alphas.
MONITOR    (98-CF-252(0,F),,NU)
CORRECTION Not corrected for delayed neutrons (considered
            negligible).
           Corrected for neutrons from (alpha,n) reactions.
ERR-ANALYS  No information.

ANALYSIS   7.5% of alphas from sample are due to 246Cm, therefore,
            calculated that more than 99.5% of spontaneous
            fissions due to 248Cm.
