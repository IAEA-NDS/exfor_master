TITLE      Effective neutron capture cross section and half-life
            of 155Eu
FACILITY   (REAC) NRU Reactor at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories
METHOD     (ACTIV) Amount of 155Eu depleted from a sample during
            irradiation determined by counting the 105.2-keV gamma
            ray before and after irradiation. The effective cross
            section was determined using the Westcott convention.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) planar diode (depletion depth = 2 mm).
MONITOR    ((MONIT1)27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG,,MXW)
           (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,RI) = 58 b.
            Used to deduce neutron flux.
CORRECTION Includes factor of=0.9935 to account for contributions
            from 152Sm chain.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data error given is standard deviation
            based on least squares fits to counting data and to
            the decay curves.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.
           Data taken from reference.
