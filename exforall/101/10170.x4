TITLE      The keV fission cross section of 235U measured with
            high resolution.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALRL)
STATUS     (UNOBT) Since the experiment was directed primarily to
            search for fine structure, no neutron flux measure-
            ments were made. No information on the absolute
            cross section can be obtained from the data. See
            article for curve and discussion of data.
