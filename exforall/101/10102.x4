TITLE      Precise measurement of neutron-proton total cross
            section from 25 to 60 MeV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO) Crocker isochronous cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Metallic Li target. 7Li(p,n) neutrons.
INC-SPECT  Roughly 60% source neutrons fall within well-defined
            high energy peak about 2 MeV wide. Rest spread over
            broad low energy tail. Peak selected by time-of-
            flight. Mean energy of beam determined to better than
            100 keV.
SAMPLE     Pure polyethylene and spectrogaphic grade graphite. H/C
            ratio of polyethylene sample chemically determined to
            about 0.2%. Samples 63 to 127 mm long.
METHOD     Transmission geometry, with counter telescopes
            before and after sample.
DETECTOR   (TELES) Three counter telescopes used, each containing
            a veto scintillator, CH2 converter, and two thin
            (1 mm) scintillators separated by a copper absorber.
            Telescopes insensitive to gammas. Neutron detection
            efficiency about 1%.
           One telescope before sample, two following. Distance
            from 7Li source to sample center- 4 m. Distance from
            sample to point between two following telescopes- 3.5m
CORRECTION Following corrections made:
           . background due to neutrons scattered out of sample
             and rescattered into detector (+0.05%),
           . single scatter inscattering (+0.01%) (multiple
             scattering estimated approximately 1/10 single
             scattering correction),
           . deadtime (+0.3%),
           . displacement of air by sample (+0.2%),
           . finite energy width (-0.02%),
           . C/H ratio (-0.9%),
           . air displacement in sample weighing (-0.3%),
           . isotopic composition (+0.06%).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistics, plus folding in of 20% of
            background correction and 30% of deadtime correction.
            Also includes uncertainty in energy.
           Systematic uncertainty of 0.3% on all points due to
            H/C ratio and sample size uncertainties not included.
