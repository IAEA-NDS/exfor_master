TITLE      Neutron Yield of 252Cf Based on Absolute Measurement
            of the Neutron Rate and Fission Ratio.
METHOD     (MANGB) Manganese bath facility for measurement of
            neutron emission rate.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission rate obtained primarily from absolute
            fission-neutron coincidence data, with special
            attention to angular correlation effects.
PART-DET   (N,FF) Neutrons and fission fragments.
MONITOR    Manganese bath independently calibrated with reference
            to absolute beta-gamma coincidence counting of 56Mn.
CORRECTION Correction to Mn bath for parasitic absorption by high-
            energy neutrons in sulfur and oxygen, effective
            hydrogen/manganese thermal cross section ratio, and
            source-holder thermal absorption.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Assigned error combination of statistical
            and systematic effects at confidence level of 68%.
