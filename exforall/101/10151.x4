TITLE      Decay Schemes for the Isomers of 148Pm and the Cross
            Sections for Their Production by Neutron Capture in
            147Pm
SAMPLE     3.2x10**14 atoms of Pm147.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were measured by absolute gamma
            counting of irradiated 147Pm. A 1% Co in Al alloy
            wire was used as flux monitor.
DETECTOR   (GELI) GeLi planar diode with 2 mm depletion depth.
           147Pm source was placed 2 cm directly above diode.
MONITOR    (27-CO-59(N,G)27-CO-60,,SIG)
CORRECTION Correction was made for epithermal capture.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.
           Data taken from reference.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main contributions to error are counting
            rate (1.5%), absolute efficiency (1%) and counting
            rate of normalizing gamma ray (1.3%).
