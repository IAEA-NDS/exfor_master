TITLE      An absolute measurement of the 6Li(n,alpha) cross
            section at 964 keV.
METHOD     (MANGB) Manganese bath
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Silicon surface barrier detector
MONITOR    Source calibrated with respect to NBS-II standard
            photoneutron source using manganese bath.
CORRECTION Data given has been corrected for-
           . detector efficiency
           . inscattering from hydrogen in detector components
           . inscattering due to other detector components
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author
           Tabulated data rec'd from G. Knoll, March 1975
