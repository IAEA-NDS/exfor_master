TITLE      ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF THE LI-6(N,A)H-3 CROSS SECTION
           AT 23 KEV
N-SOURCE   (PHOTO) ANTIMONY-BERYLLIUM PHOTONEUTRONS
METHOD     REACTION RATE AND ALPHA PARTICLE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
DETECTOR   (TRD) CELLULOSE NITRATE TRACK RECORDING DETECTOR
MONITOR    NO INFORMATION.
ANALYSIS   WITH A COMPUTED NEUTRON FLUX, THE REACTION RATE WAS
           DETERMINED FROM THE WEIGHTED SUM OF FIVE ROTATED
           DETECTOR COUNTS. AS A COMPARISON, AN ALPHA PARTICLE
           DISTRIBUTION SHAPE MEASUREMENT WAS PERFORMED
CORRECTION CORRECTION FACTORS TOTALING NO MORE THAN 10 PER-CENT
           WERE APPLIED FOR THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM, NEUTRON SCATTER,
           AND SPECTRAL EFFECTS IN THE CALIBRATING MANGANESE BATH
