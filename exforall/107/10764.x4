TITLE      PRODUCTION CROSS SECTIONS FOR (N,T) REACTIONS IN SOME
           MEDIUM AND HEAVY MASS NUCLEI AT 14.6 MEV.
INC-SOURCE THE NEUTRON FLUX DENSITY AT THE POSITION OF THE SAMPLE
           WAS GENERALLY ABOUT 10E10/SEC-CM**2
SAMPLE     THE SAMPLES WERE HIGH PURITY POWDER IN THIN WALL
           CYLINDRICAL CONTAINERS PLACED IN FRONT OF AND NEAR THE
           TRITIUM TARGET.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE AND HIGH-RESOLUTION
                   GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY WERE USED.
DETECTOR   (GELI) THE ACTIVATION SPECTRA WERE MEASURED BY A
           COAXIAL GERMANIUM-LITHIUM DETECTOR AND RECORDED ON
           A 4096 CHANNEL ANALYZER.THE RESOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM
           WAS 2.6KEV AT THE 1332.5KEV CO-60 LINE.
ANALYSIS   CROSS SECTIONS WERE DETERMINED RELATIVE TO AN INTERNAL
           MONITOR AND CALCULATED FROM THE AREAS OF THE RESPECTIVE
           PHOTO PEAKS.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR DECAY G-RAY BRANCHING,
            INTERNAL CONVERSION,DETECTOR EFFICIENCY,
           SELF-ABSORPTION AND ISOTOPE ABUNDANCE.
ERR-ANALYS UNCERTAINTY INCLUDES ERROR OF THE PHOTO PEAK AREA,THE
            CROSS SECTION OF THE MONITOR,AND THE RELATIVE PHOTO
           PEAK EFFICIENCY OF THE DETECTOR.
MONITOR    ALL MONITOR CROSS SECTIONS ARE CHOSEN FROM HANDBOOK
           ON NUCLEAR ACTIVATION CROSS SECTION,TECHNICAL REPORT
           SERIES NO.156,PAGE87,VIENNA(1974).
