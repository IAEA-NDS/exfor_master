TITLE      TOTAL NEUTRON CROSS SECTION FOR AM-241.
FACILITY   (LINAC)LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LABORATORY 100MEV LINAC.
METHOD     (TOF)TIME OF FLIGHT,250 METER FLIGHT PATH.
SAMPLE     A LARGE SAMPLE OF ISOTOPICALLY PURE (99.975 PERCENT)
           AM-241 OXIDE WAS REDUCED TO METAL.THE RESULTANT 50 GRAM
           SAMPLE WAS DOUBLY ENCAPSULATED IN ALUMINUM CANS(.05CM
           THICK WALLS AND .025CM THICK ENDS.)
N-SOURCE   THE ELECTRON BEAM OF THE LINAC WAS PULSED WITH 10 NSEC
           BURST WIDTH.ON STRIKING A TANTALUM TARGET COOLED BY
           HEAVY WATER,THIS ELECTRON BEAM PRODUCED A CONTINUOUS
           ENERGY SPECTRUM OF NEUTRONS.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) SCINTILLATION DETECTOR
CORRECTION THE NEUTRON FLIGHT TIME SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR
           DEAD TIME LOSSES AND ADDED TOGETHER TO GIVE THE
           TRANSMITTED SPECTRUM FOR EACH SAMPLE.
            A SMALL MEASURED BACKGROUND (LESS THAN 5 PERCENT) DUE
           ONLY TO COSMIC RAY EVENTS WAS SUBTRACTED FROM EACH OF
           THESE SPECTRA.
ERR-ANALYS THE ERRORS ARE STATISTICAL.
            SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WHICH WOULD MODIFY THE OVERALL
           NORMALIZATION OF THE CROSS SECTION ARE ESTIMATED TO BE
           LESS THAN 3 PERCENT.
STATUS     (APRVD) APPROVED BY T.W.PHILLIPS, 78/11/29.
