TITLE      EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES OF THE ELASTIC
            SCATTERING OF POLARIZED NEUTRONS FROM LI-6.
FACILITY   (LINAC) YALE TRAVELLING WAVE LINEAR ACCELERATOR.
           YALE POLARIZED NEUTRON FACILITY
SAMPLE     ENRICHED TO 95.5-PERCENT LI-6, SEALED IN 0.05-MM THICK
            STAINLESS STEEL CANS. DIMENSIONS OF 7.5-CM BY 12.5-CM
            BY 1.2-CM.
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH 27-METER PATH LENGTH AND
            0.75 NANOSEC/METER RESOLUTION. PHOTONEUTRONS SCATTERED
            OFF GRAPHITE TARGETS AT 50 OR 130-DEG. POLARIZATION
            OF 50-DEG NEUTRONS DETERMINED BY RESCATTERING OFF
            IDENTICAL GRAPHITE TARGET. NEUTRONS AT 130-DEG ARE
            SCATTERED OFF C-12 TARGET WITH KNOWN ANALYZING POWER
            AT 50-DEG REACTION ANGLE. ENTIRE NEUTRON SPECTRA
            MEASURED SIMULTANEOUSLY. DOUBLE SAMPLE USED TO TEST
            FOR MULTIPLE SCATTERING EFFECTS, EMPTY SCATTERING CAN
            USED TO TEST FOR BACKGROUND.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 6 PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS, 12.5-CM DIAMETER BY
            15-CM THICK.
