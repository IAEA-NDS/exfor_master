TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE COHERENT NEUTRON SCATTERING LENGTH
            OF HE-3 BY REFLECTION FROM A QUARTZ-LIQUID-HELIUM
            INTERFACE.
FACILITY   (REAC) REACTOR
SAMPLE     LIQUID HE CELL- 177 BY 32 BY 2.5 MILLIMETERS
           QUARTZ CRYSTAL- 190 BY 45 BY 15. MILLIMETERS. INTERFACE
            SIDE OPTICALLY POLISHED.
MONITOR    (2-HE-4(N,THS)2-HE-4,COH,AMP)
METHOD     NEUTRON BEAM TRANSMITTED THROUGH QUARTZ AND INTERNALLY
            REFLECTED FROM LIQUID INTERFACE. INTERIOR SURFACES
            LINED WITH ROUGHENED CD TO REDUCE BACKGROUND. MIRROR
            SYSTEM EVALUATED WITH SEVERAL H2O-D2O MIXTURES. RUN
            MADE WITH HE-4 AT 1.2-DEG KELVIN. RUN THEN MADE WITH
            HE-3 AT 1.2-DEG KELVIN.
