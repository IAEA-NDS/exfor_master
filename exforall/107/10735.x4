N-SOURCE   (P-LI7)3-LI-7(P,N)4-BE-7 AT ALL ENERGIES.
            FOR 50-300KEV A PSEUDO WHITE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS
            USED.
           BETWEEN 500KEV AND 2MEV MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS WERE
            USED.

SAMPLE     THE SAMPLES WERE .03CM THICK STRIPS OF THORIUM METAL
           OF ABOUT 2.65 CM WIDTH AND 5.3 CM LENGTH.
DETECTOR   (STANK)LARGE LIQUID SCINTILLATOR TANK.

METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT. PROMPT G-RAY DETECTION.
CORRECTION CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR
            1.TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE SAMPLE.
            2.ELASTIC AND INELASTIC SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS WITHIN
              THE SAMPLE

              MAXIMUM ENERGY OF THE GAMMA CASCADES.
            4.AT HIGHER ENERGIES CORRECTIONS WERE APPLIED FOR THE
              SECOND NEUTRON GROUP OBTAINED WITH THE 3-LI-7(P,N)
              REACTION AND FOR THE FISSION EVENTS IN THE THORIUM

ERR-ANALYS  MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES FOR THE SHAPE DATA ARE DUE TO
           NORMALIZATION (3.8PERCENT AT 500KEV AND 5.5PERCENT
           BELOW)AND THE GOLD REFERENCE CROSS SECTION (5PERCENT).
            STATISTICS ACCOUNT FOR 3 PERCENT AND SYSTEMATIC
           UNCERTAINTIES 2 PERCENT.
