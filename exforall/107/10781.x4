TITLE      Search for non-statistical effects in
            173Yb(n,gamma)174Yb
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator
DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     An enriched 173Yb sample was used
ANALYSIS   Capture gamma-ray spectra were measured to determine
           the correlation coefficient between partial radiative
           widths and neutron reduced widths. Spins were also
           determined.
