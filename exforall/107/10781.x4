TITLE      SEARCH FOR NON-STATISTICAL EFFECTS IN YB-173(N,G)YB-174
FACILITY   (LINAC) OAK RIDGE ELECTRON LINEAR ACCELERATOR
DETECTOR   (GELI)
SAMPLE     AN ENRICHED YB-173 SAMPLE WAS USED
ANALYSIS   CAPTURE GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA WERE MEASURED TO DETERMINE
           THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN PARTIAL RADIATIVE
           WIDTHS AND NEUTRON REDUCED WIDTHS. SPINS WERE ALSO
           DETERMINED.
