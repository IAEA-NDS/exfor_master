           Intermediate data for the spontaneously fissioning
           252Cf (two sources of 252Cf).
METHOD     (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GE) A large coaxial Ge detector with a relative
           efficiency at 1332 keV of 110%. This detector was
           calibrated with a Physikalisch-Technische Bundestalt
           152Eu standard source (assayed in 1976) using
           the gamma-rays: 121.7, 344.3, 778.9, 964.0, 1085.8,
           1112.1, 1408.0 keV. Its efficiency curve was extended
           above 1400 to 2614 keV by counting a 232Th source
           using the gamma-rays: 583.2, 763.3, 785.5, 860.5,
           1620.7, 2614.5 keV. The relative peak efficiency
           curve from the 232Th source was normalized to the
           absolute curve from the 152Eu standard. From the
           uncertainties in the peak areas and those of the
           gamma-ray intensities, an uncertainty of +-5% between
           121 and 1400 keV and +-8% from 1400 to 2614 keV was
           assigned.
ADD-RES    (G-SPC) Gamma-ray spectra of the spontaneously
           fissioning actinides 244Cm and 252Cf.

SAMPLE     The 252Cf source was purchased from Isotope Products,
           Inc. (source No. A4-818). The overall size of the
           capsule is approximately 1-cm in diameter and 0.5-cm
           thick with a 0.25-mm thick beryllium foil window on
           one side and a backing of 0.127-cm thick stainless
           steel on the other side. The 252Cf source activity as
           of March 2002 was nominally 50 mu-Ci. The 252Cf
           activity is embedded in an anodized aluminum disk and
           sealed in the capsule. In the 2-nd ref. the gamma-ray
           yields were measured also with an older source of
           252Cf made in 1991 and mounted in the same type
           capsule.
