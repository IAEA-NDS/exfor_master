TITLE      Correlation of mass, energy, and angle in
           MeV-neutron-induced fission of U235 and U238

INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (VDG,1USAANL) 3-MeV Van de Graaff generator.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons produced by the D(d,n)He3 reaction
           using deuterium gas.
           (P-LI7) Neutrons produced by the Li7(p,n)Be7 reaction
           using thin lithium metal target.
INC-SPECT  The neutron energy spreads were about of 100 keV from
           the gas targets and about of 50 keV from the metal
           targets.
           Thermal neutrons were obtained by encasing the detector
           chamber in about 4 in. of paraffin.
SAMPLE     The uranium samples were 1 cm in diameter and had a
           surface density of about 120 mu-g/cm2. The U235
           samples were made by evaporating uranium metal
           enriched to about 93% onto 130 mu-g/cm2 nickel foils.
           The U238 samples were made in a similar manner, using
           uranium metal containing about 0.2% U235.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Four or two (to measure U238 fission at
           1.5 MeV) silicon surface barrier detectors having
           room-temperature resistivities in the vicinity of
           500 ohm-cm. The active areas were 4 cm2 for the common
           detectors (placed on each side of the uranium sample)
           and 3 cm2 for the others. The edges of the detectors
           shielded by aluminum collimators whose inside edges
           were rounded.
