TITLE      Neutron radiative capture cross section of 63,65Cu
           between 0.4 and 7.5 MeV

FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment perfomed at the TUNL tandem
           Van de Graaff accelerator facility.
SAMPLE     Natural copper targets with diameter of 18.9-mm and
           thickness between 1.0 and 2.5 mm. Disks were
           supported by a thin plastic foil and mounted at 0deg
           relative to the incident charged-particle beam at a
           distance of 2.5 cm from the end of the deuterium gas
           cell. To measure the neutron fluence, indium monitor
           foils of the same cross-sectional area and 0.125-mm
           thickness were attached to the front and back faces of
           the copper disk. The copper target and associated
           monitor foils were surrounded by a thin-walled cage
           made of cadmium (0.25-mm wall thickness) to eliminate
           the effect of thermal neutrons on the cross-section
           results.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Well-shielded and well-characterized high-
           purity germanium (HPGe) detectors was used to
           determine the induced activities. The copper and
           indium foil were positioned at a distance of 5 cm
           from the front face of 60% and 30% relative
           efficiency, respectively, HPGe detectors.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. Irradiation times
           of 15 min were used for the 65Cu and 45 min for 63Cu
INC-SOURCE (P-T) The 3H(p,n) 3He reaction was used at six
           energies in the neutron energy range between 0.4 and
           4 MeV
           (D-D)The 2H(d,n) 3He reaction was employed at four
           energies between 4 and 7.5 MeV.
