TITLE      Extension of the Fission-Product Region and Yields of
           Heavy Products in the Neutron Fission of Plutonium-239

INSTITUTE  (1USANRD)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAINL) Material testing reactor.
SAMPLE     A 1-10 milligrams of PuO2 enclosed in in thin (0.0005
           in) nickel foil to catch fission fragments.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Side-window, gas-flow, proportional counters.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Three irradiations were performed at
           thermal neutron flux of 10**14 n/cm**2/sec with 1 mg
           sample. A fourth irradiation of approximately 10 mg
           of PuO2 was performed at a flux of 1.5*10**13
           n/cm**2/sec. After irradiation the capsules were
           opened and nickel-wrapped samples were removed. The
           samples, including the nickel foil, were dissolved in
           hot HCl and then treated with HNO3. All counting was
           done in proportional counters. The radiochemical
           purity of each sample was determined by its decay
           characteristics.

CORRECTION The correction for neutron capture in 155Eu to form
           156Eu was calculated to be less than 4% in the se
           short irradiations (10 hr) .
