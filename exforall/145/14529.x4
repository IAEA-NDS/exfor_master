TITLE      A measurement of the prompt fission neutron energy
           spectrum for 235U(n,f) and the neutron-induced fission
           cross section for 238U(n,f)

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the Weapons
           Neutron Research facility at Los Alamos Science Center
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons were produced by spallation reaction
           using 800 MeV protons on W target.
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of incident neutrons was determined by
           time of flight. Measurement was performed on target 4
           flight path 15R. The proton beam was pulsed and divided
           into 625 mu-s long macropulses, which were subsequently
           subdivided into 1.8 mu-s micropulses, micropulse width
           was 0.2 ns.

REACTION   (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Parallel plate ionization chamber. The chamber
           was filled with P10 gas, which is 90% argon and 10 %
           methane at a pressure of 68 kPa. Time resolution of
           detector was of the order of 1 ns.
SAMPLE     Ionization chamber housed 3 deposits of target material
           Each foil is 0.0013 inch steel plate and each 238U
           deposit was  approx. 55 mg. The active site for each
           foil is a circle with diameter of 13.3 cm.

           standards sub-library submitted by A.D. Carlson, 2007
           Experimental data normalized to reference cross section
           at 130 MeV
CORRECTION Corrected for dead time
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Total systematic uncertainty including
             - uncertainty in reference cross section
             - yield summation uncertainty
             - data acquisition dead time
             all added in quadrature
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty obtained by adding systematic
                    uncertainty and statistical uncertainty
