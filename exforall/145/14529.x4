TITLE      A measurement of the prompt fission neutron energy
            spectrum for 235U(n,f) and the neutron-induced
            fission cross section for 238U(n,f)

FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Weapons Neutron Research facility (WNR)
            of Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)  800 MeV protons on W target
SAMPLE     Ionization chamber housed 3 deposits of target
            material.
           Each foil is 0.0013 inch steel plate and each 238U
            deposit was approx. 55 mg.
           The active site for each foil is a circle with
            diameter of 13.3 cm.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Parallel plate ionization chamber.
           The chamber was filled with P10 gas, which is 90% Ar
            and 10% methane at a pressure of 68 kPa.
           Time resolution of detector was of the order of 1 ns.
           (TELES,CSICR,SCIN)
           Placed at 16, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 deg relative to
            beam direction for charged particle detection.
METHOD     (TOF) Measurement was performed on target 4 flight
            path 15R.
           The proton beam was pulsed and divided into 625 us
            long macropulses, which were subsequently subdivided
            into 1.8 us micropulses, micropulse width was 0.2 ns.
