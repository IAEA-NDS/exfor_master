SAMPLE     Two type of samples: light and heavy uranium disks.
           The light sample was prepared by the electrolytic
           deposition of uranium on platinum from a solution of
           UO2(NO3)2*6H2O in absolute alcohol. The sample was
           distributed uniformly over a circle 1.3 cm in
           diameter and had a low specific mass, which was
           determined by alpha counting. This sample was used
           for determination of the number of fissions by
           counting the fission recoil fragments in an air
           ionization chamber. The heavy samples (disks of
           uranium metal of the 1.3 cm diameter) were used for
           chemically separation of individual fission products,
           and the number of atoms present was determined by
           beta counting.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Authors: The largest systematic errors in
           the determinations are in the estimation of the beta-
           counting geometry and in the correction of the beta
           counting for absorption. The error in determining the
           number of fissions 3-4%. The results are probably
           accurate within 20%.
