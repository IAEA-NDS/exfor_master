TITLE      Long-range particles from nuclear fission

DETECTOR   (IOCH,CSICR) The probability of long-range particle
           emission measured by four parallel-plate ionization
           chambers operating in an argon plus 5% CO2 gas mixture.
           The energy spectrum of long-range particles measured by
           CsI crystal scintillation-spectrometer apparatus
           consisted of a fission source deposited on a
           100-mu-g/cm2 nickel foil symmetrically positioned with
           respect to two sets of diametrically opposed
           thallium-activated CsI crystals, viewed by
           photomultiplier tubes through MgO2-surfaced vacuum
           light pipes.  Two crystals were 2 cm in diameter and
           0.41 mm in thickness, another two crystals were of the
           same diameter and 0.076-mm mm in thickness, used in two
           fold coincidence as fission detectors. These fission
           detectors were covered with 100-mu-g/cm2 nickel-foil
           light shields to prevent 'crosstalk' with the
           long-range particle crystals. The energy resolution of
           the long-range particle counters was about 11% for
           6.1 MeV 252Cf alphas and 6% for 8.78 MeV alphas from
           212Po. The fluorescent response of CsI crystals to
           alpha particles was determined by the use of alpha
           particles both from natural radioactivity and from the
           Los Alamos variable-energy cyclotron.
METHOD     (COINC)
ANALYSIS   Long-range particles, which are known to be
           predominantly alpha particles.

SAMPLE     The Cf252 source was prepared by autodeposition from
           an intense parent source. Deposits were made on
           100-mu-g/cm2 nickel foil which in some cases was
           reinforced by a backing of 20-mesh, 93%- transparent,
           'electromesh' nickel screen. Amount of active
           material about 10.E-3 mu-g, spontaneous fission
           rate - 3.E4 fissions/min.
