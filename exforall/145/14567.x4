TITLE      90Zr(n,gamma) Studies with Thermal Neutrons
AUTHOR     (M.A.Lone,G.A.Bartholomew)
REFERENCE  (C,78BNL,,675,1978)
INSTITUTE  (1CANCRC)
FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) N4 external thermal neutron facility at
           NRU reactor.
SAMPLE     (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.977) ZrO (97.7% of 90Zr,1.07% of 91Zr).
           (40-ZR-91,ENR=0.0107)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Two Ge(Li) detectors.
METHOD     (GSPEC) Gamma-ray spectra were recorded in both
           single and coincidence mode from thermal neutron
           capture in ZrO.
ANALYSIS   A crude estimate of the neutron capture cross section
           can be made by arbitrarily assuming that 50% of the
           decay proceeds by transitions to states below 4000
           keV and calibrating the observed decay transitions
           from these states against the 934 keV (37.5%)
           transition from 91Zr capture (sigma=1030 mb). This
           yields 14.4 mb. The 50% assumed intensity would
           appear conservative and therefore the 14.4 mb
           estimate may in fact be high.
