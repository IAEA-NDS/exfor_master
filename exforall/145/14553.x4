INC-SPECT  Compiler's comment:
            Type of spectrum in the heavy-water-moderated and
            -cooled Savannah River production reactor was not
            described in the article, EN-DUMMY=0.0253 eV is an
            assumption of compiler.
SAMPLE     Eight samples of natural uranium, irradiated over an
           exposure of 300-1,600 MWd/ton. The samples were derived
           from experimental rods of uranium irradiated in a
           heavy-water-moderated and -cooled Savannah River
           production reactor. Samples were sectioned from each
           rod, dissolved and analyzed for tritium content.
           Sections weighing 40-80 g were cut from each rod, and
           any adherent film of tritiated deuterium oxide removed
           with a solution of sodium hydroxide. The uranium of
           each section was then dissolved in nitric acid an
           apparatus designed to collect the off-gas
           quantitatively. The collected gas was scrubbed to
           remove nitrogen oxides and then was passed through
           copper oxide combustion tube to convert any hydrogen to
           water.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Tritium was measured by liquid scintillation
           counting.
