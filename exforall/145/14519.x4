FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The Californium Rare Isotope Breeder
           Upgrade facility at Argonne National Laboratory was
           used to deliver pure beams of mass-separated ions 134,
           134mSb from the spontaneous fission of approx. 1.7-Ci
           252Cf source at the CARIBU facility. A radio frequency
           quadrupole RFQ buncher containing residual helium gas
           was used to accumulate, cool, and bunch the beam with
           a timing of 100 ms between bunches.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Decay station consisted equiped with a plastic
           scintillation detector for detection of beta rays
           with diameter of 10 cm and length of 10 cm. The
           detector has a 6-mm diameter well bored in it to
           allow the beam to implant on a 35-mm-wide
           aluminized-mylar tape which passes through a slot in
           the middle of the detector oriented at 90deg to the
           beam direction.
           (HPGE) Array of five high-purity germanium clover
           detectors was used mainly to determine half-lifes of
           134Sb nuclei.
INC-SOURCE 134mSb,134Sb ions were produced from the spontaneous
           fission of a 1.7-Ci 252Cf source at the CARIBU
           facility. The 252Cf fission fragments were
           thermalized using a large helium-filled gas catcher
           and extracted as a continuous low-energy beam of
           singly charged ions from the nozzle of this device
           using a combination of gas flow and electric fields.
           The beam was sent through an isobar separator operated
           with a mass resolution of M/dM=15000 to
           isolate 134,134mSb.
ANALYSIS   Ratio of the yield of the high-spin to low-spin
           nuclear states of 134mSb to 134Sb was determined from
           beta singles build-up and decay for both the short
           and long tape cycles, taking into account the
           relative efficiency for beta detection for each
           species, as well as the decay losses incurred during
           the transport time
CORRECTION The correction for decay prior to measurement was made.
           This included 30 ms extraction time of the fission
           products from the CARIBU source to the buncher followed
           by the 100 ms buncher cycle. These corrections shift
           the yield ratio by 8%.
