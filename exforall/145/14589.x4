INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALRL) LPTR (Livermore pool-type reactor).
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) A single-directional focusing mass
           spectrometer with a 60-degree sector and 12-inch radius
            of curvature.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.932)
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.068) The neutron target was made by
           sealing the 235U3O8 powder in a quartz capsule tube,
           then it was put into an aluminum can for thermal
           neutron irradiation.
METHOD     (CHSEP,EXTB) A 235U target was irradiated in the
           thermal column of the LPTR at Livermore Radiation
           Laboratory. The irradiation time was 3 days with a
           neutron flux of 6*10**11 neutrons/cm2/sec. The
           purification procedure was as follows: Chemically
           pure uranium foil was dissolved in concentrated HCl
           and a few drops of concentrated HNO3. After the
           target was dissolved, the solution was allowed to
           cool and divided into two equal samples. To one
           sample was added an accurate amount of certain
           separated stable isotopes of elements to be measured.
           The solution were adjusted and then passed through
           two separate anion-exchange columns. The elutants were
           then evaporated almost to dryness. Finally, the
           individual rare earths were separated and measured
           using the mass spectrometer.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The limits of error are purely statistical;
           they are all standard deviations of the measurements.
CORRECTION The corrections are both for decay and for neutron
           capture. Since the neutron flux used was rather low,
           and the irradiation time was rather short, no capture
           correction exceeded 1%.
