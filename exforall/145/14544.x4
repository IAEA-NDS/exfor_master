INC-SOURCE The source had isotopically pure 252Cf
           electrodeposited on a platinum disk. The Cf source
           was placed in the center of a scattering chamber at a
           distance of 1.2 cm from a silicon surface barrier
           detector.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The silicon detectors were collimated to
           yield a half angle of between 22 degrees and 38
           degrees, depending on the size of the detector.
           Several of these detectors were used in the course of
           the measurement; the detectors lasted two to three
           days before they be came severely radiation damaged.
           (NAICR) A 25.4 cm x 38.1 cm NaI detector (50 cm away
           from the source) surrounded by a passive lead shield
           and an active anticoincidence shield to minimize the
           cosmic-ray background. The NaI detector was calibrated
           up to a gamma-ray energy of 30 MeV using low energy
           sources and gamma rays from 11B(p,gamma) at Ep = 7.25
           and 14.3 MeV.
           The solid-state detector was placed at an angle of 120
           degrees with respect to the axis of the NaI detector.
           The time of flight between events in the
           fission-fragment detector and in the NaI detector was
           recorded. The gate in the time-difference spectrum was
           narrow enough to allow the discrimination against
           neutrons of 25 MeV or less.
METHOD     (COINC) Measurement in the fission-fragment/gamma ray
           coincidence mode
