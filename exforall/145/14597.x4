ANALYSIS   The authors assumed that the counting yield of 20m Y
           and 10h Y to be the same, so the relative fission
           yields of the two radioisotopes can be calculated
           from the chain relations and the times of irradiation
           and decay.
COMMENT    Authors assigned 10h activity to Y-95, which was
           replaced by compiler by Y-93, taking into account
           editors' note 'This part of the chain has since been
           shown not to be of mass 95'.
           For 20m Y authors did not give value for A, A=94 for
           20m Y taken from editors' note.
