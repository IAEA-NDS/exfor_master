FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) The Argonne CP-5 reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The flux of 2.54E+13 n/cm**2/sec
SAMPLE     The uranium was irradiated as U3O8 powder in 0.2, 0.5
           and 1.0 gramme quantities. National Bureau of Standards
           U3O8 and U308 prepared from commercial uranyl nitrate
           hexahydrate  were  used.  The commercial uranium was
           purified by dissolution in nitric acid followed by an
           ether extraction and subsequent ignition to U308.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Tritium was converted to water in a closed
           system and its activity measured by liquid
           scintillation techniques.
           (NAICR) The gamma activity of the barium sample was
           measured using a 5 in. sodium iodide scintillator.
           The  counting efficiency for the 140Ba in the sodium
           iodide crystal spectrometer was determined by counting
           equal aliquots of a separated 140Ba solution
           simultaneously in the sodium iodide crystal
           spectrometer and in the "Tri-Carb" liquid scintillation
           spectrometer.

CORRECTION Corrections for decay, chemical yield, volume of
           aliquots, and efficiency of detection were applied to
           the observed 14OBa activity.
