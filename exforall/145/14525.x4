FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) The NRX nuclear reactor at Chalk River.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The counter was the "end window" type with a
           mica window of mass 2.3 mgm./cm2.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Spectroscopically pure samples of
           cerium oxide, sealed in small quartz ampoules, were
           irradiated in the NRX nuclear reactor at different
           neutron fluxes for different times. After irradiation,
           the cerium oxide was removed from the quartz ampoule
           and chemically separated. The final hydroxide
           precipitate was transferred as a slurry to an
           aluminum tray, where it was spread evenly, dried, and
           the counting-rate determined by a Geiger-Miiller
           counter. The pile neutron capture cross section of
           the 33 hr. Ce143 was determined by separating Pr144,
           the daughter of Ce144, from the rigorously-purified
           cerium at frequent intervals. The amount of Pr144
           formed increased linearly with the square of the
           neutron flux in a manner consistent with that of a
           successive neutron capture reaction.
