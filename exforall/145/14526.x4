REACTION   ((94-PU-240(N,F),,SIG,,SPA)/(94-PU-239(N,F),,SIG,,SPA))
SAMPLE     Plutonium samples 2 in. in diameter were cut from
           large 0.016 in. aluminum sheets that had been
           uniformly coated with several layers of lacquer
            (cellulose nitrate dissolved in amyl acetate)
           containing plutonium nitrate dissolved in acetone.
           240Pu sample:
           (94-PU-240,ENR=0.89365)
           (94-PU-239,ENR=0.10131)
           (94-PU-241,ENR=0.00483)
           (94-PU-242,ENR=0.00018)
           239Pu sample:
           (94-PU-239,ENR=0.97884)
           (94-PU-240,ENR=0.02043)
           (94-PU-241,ENR=0.00073)
DETECTOR   (FISCH) The samples were mounted on either side of a
           thin aluminum partition in the common cathode of a
           back-to-back gridded ion chamber. For the fission
           counting the chamber was operated at low pressure to
           permit complete discrimination between fission and
           alpha pulses.
METHOD     (RVAL,CHSEP) If isotopically pure samples of Pu239
           and Pu240 are available, the ratio of the
           alpha-disintegration rates and the published ratio of
           the alpha-decay half-lives would give the ratio of
           the masses of the samples. The ratio of the fission
           rates in these samples, when irradiated in the same
           neutron flux, would then give the ratio of the
           fission cross sections. The accuracy would be limited
           to the accuracy with which the ratio of the
           alpha-decay half-lives is known.
