INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure nitrogen.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) It was filled with nitrogen to a pressure of
           4.5 atmos. The active volume of the chamber was 2.54
           cm in diameter and 10 cm long.
METHOD     The neutron flux was monitored by counting the number
           of fission pulses occurring in an ionization chamber.
           The amount of fissionable material in the chamber was
           known.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors in the measurements of the cross
           sections are caused by the following facts:
            (1) Lack of definition of the peaks, principally
           because of wall effects,
            (2) Uncertainty in the calibration of the monitor
           chamber,
            (3) Lack of resolution of the resonances because of
           the energy spread of the neutrons,
            (4) Large size of the detectors compared to the
           distances from the neutron source. It is difficult to
           estimate the error caused by these factors. It is not
           unreasonable to assume that values of the cross
           sections may be in error by 25 percent.
