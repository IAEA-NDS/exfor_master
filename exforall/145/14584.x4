FACILITY   (CRASS,1USALAS) The National Critical Experiments
           Research Center (NCERC) Godiva IV critical assembly.
INC-SPECT  The center of the Godiva critical assembly and
           exposed to a single pulsed irradiation.
SAMPLE     Two depleted uranium samples: 99.961+-0.002% 238U,
           0.0385+-0.004% 235U, and 0.00031+-0.004% 234U from
           Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) were
           packed into separate quartz ampoules, affixed using
           quartz wool packing, and heat-sealed.

           (92-U-235,ENR=0.000385)

DETECTOR   (GE) Two 65% relative-efficiency, Mirion broad energy
           germanium (BEGe) detectors were horizontally
           opposed to one another and shrouded on four-sides by
           a copper-lined open lead box.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The quartz ampoules were loaded on top of the
           witness foil package into an aluminum sample holder.
           The sample holder was loaded into the center-line
           hole of the Godiva critical assembly. The witness
           foil package contained copper, gold, cobalt, iron,
           and titanium wires. Activities observed in these
           wires were used to estimate the total neutron
           fluence-energy profile from the exposure. Following
           the burst, the samples remained in the critical
           assembly for several minutes while the radiation
           field inside the critical assembly room decayed to
           radiologically manageable levels. The samples were
           hand-carried from the critical assembly building to
           the radiation counting facility and counting
           commenced 39.9 min post-irradiation.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Data acquired from the experiment were parsed
           into discrete integral spectra of varying length and
           analyzed using Mirion's Genie2000R software. The peak
           locations were classified as single peaks or
           multiplets and fit accordingly using low-tail
           Gaussian functions and a step background. Peak
           locations from each spectrum were identified using
           Mirion's Genie2000R Nuclide Identification algorithm,
           an empirical confidence function that accounts for
           each radionuclides half-life, branching ratio, and
           corresponding gamma rays.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) STAYSL PNNL software code propagates
           uncertainties from the production cross-section
           covariance matrices. Uncertainties at 1 sigma
           considered.
           (ERR-1) Gamma-ray branching ratio.
           (ERR-2) Half-life.
           (ERR-3) Efficiency.
           (ERR-4) Self-shielding correction factor.
CORRECTION The ENDF/B-VIII.0 parent fission yield was used to
           correct for the temporal shift in the total atom
           concentration of the radio-analyte. The 238U-metal
           samples were dense, high Z samples that strongly
           attenuated gamma-rays emitted by fission products
           generated in the sample. The gamma-ray self-
           shielding correction function was derived from the
           attenuation observed in several fission products
           with gamma-lines spanning the low-energy region.
