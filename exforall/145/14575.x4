FACILITY   (FNS,1USAROC) 14-MeV neutrons are produced from
           direct-drive ICF implosions on the OMEGA Laser System
           at the University of Rochesters Laboratory for Laser
           Energetics
SAMPLE     Deuterated compounds D2O and C6D6 were used as
           samples, which filled nuclear reaction vessel,
           constructed from thin (1mm) walled aluminum. The
           vessel has a form of truncated cone with overall
           length of 7.5cm, smallest diameter of 0.9cm and
           largest diameter of 4cm. The nuclear reaction vessel
           was positioned 9cm from the center of the OMEGA
           target chamber.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons were detected using liquid
           scintillation detector filled in cylindrical cell
           with diameter of 20 cm and depth of 10 cm. Cell was
           filled with scintillator based on oxygenated xylene
           doped with diphenyl oxazole C15H11NO+ p-bis-(o-
           methylstyryl)-benzene (PPO+ bis-MSB) wavelength-
           shifting dyes, which scintillates and emits light in
           the visible to near-ultraviolet wavelength range (380
           to 420 nm) . This oxygenated liquid scintillator has
           a fast time response and a low-light afterglow.
           Scintillator was read out by four microchannel-plate
           photomultiplier tubes. The ports for the MCP-PMT are
           40-mm-diam fused-silica windows mounted on the
           cylindrical cell and sealed with Viton O rings.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron detector was positioned stance of 13.4m
           from target chamber.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons are generated using a laser to implode
           thin-walled micro balloons with thickness of approx. 4.
           mu-m and diameter of cca 1mm filled with 10 atm of
           D-T fuel. The OMEGA UV has 60 laser beams which
           deliver up to 30 kJ of energy onto the D-T target
           during a nominal 1-ns square pulse. The shock wave
           caused by laser pulse compresses and heats the fuel
           as it converges at the center of the target. The fuel
           reaches sufficient temperatures to produce
           thermonuclear reactions with neutron yields of up to
           1E+14 neutrons emitted into 4Pi. The neutron emitting
           region is approx.. 100 mu-m in diameter and 100 ps
           duration.
ANALYSIS   Separate experiments were performed with
           deuterated samples D2O,C6D6 and nondeuterated targets
           H2O,C6H6. The neutron yield from deuteron breakup
           contribution was extracted from difference in time of
           flight spectra obtained from deuterated and
           nondeuterated targets. The primary D-T signal from
           monitor diagnostic was used to normalize both time of
           flight spectra.
