FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed using the Mini-
           CAPTAIN detector at the WNR/LANSCE beam at Los Alamos
SAMPLE     Active Ar target within liquid Argon Time Projection
           Chamber was used in experiment
DETECTOR   (TPC) For total cross section a liquid argon time
           projection chamber (TPC) - LArTPC with 400 kg of
           instrumented mass was used. In addition to the TPC,
           the detector was equipped with a photon detection
           system (PDS) consisting of 24 photomultiplier tubes
           PDS was used mainly to obtain time signal for TPC.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons with a broad energy spectrum up to
           800 MeV were produced by spallation reaction of 800
           MeV protons with Tungsten target. Macropulses with
           time width of 625 mu-s were manipulated to get
           microbunch spacing of 199 mu-s. The neutron flux was
           further reduced to get neutron flux of 1 neutron per
           macropulse to detector to prevent pile-up in TPC with
           drift time of 200 mu-s.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy was determined using
           time of flight method, determined by signal from PDS.
           Tracks of charged particles, produced by neutron
           interaction with liquid Argon and reconstructed using
           signals from various planes of TPC detector were used
           to determine number of neutrons in different depth
           of the active Ar target-detector.
ANALYSIS   Cross section determination is based on fact, that
           neutron flux decreases as a function of depth in the
           detector due to neutron interactions with argon. The
           attenuation of the beam is proportional to the total
           neutron-argon cross section.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties were determined mainly by
           simulations using Geant4 system. It was found,
           that systematic uncertainties are negligible compared
           to statistical uncertainties.
