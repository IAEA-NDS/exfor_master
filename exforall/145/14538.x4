FACILITY   (REAC,1USAWSU) Experiment performed at 1 MW TRIGA
           thermal research reactor at Washington State University
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma spectra of fission products were
           detected using HPGe detectors
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method was used
INC-SOURCE The thermal sample was irradiated for 322 s in reactor
           position E9, outside the reactor core. The non-thermal
           sample was irradiated for 200 min in position D8(closer
           to the core than E9) for exposure to the highest
           neutron flux. The non-thermal sample was irradiated in
           a natural boron carbide (B4C) capsule, snugly wrapped
           in cadmium sheeting (0.020 in. thick) with 1/2 in.
           overlap in the circumference.
           Two sets of high purity metal wires were used to
           characterize neutron fluence and spectrum for each
           uranium sample. The experimental measurements and the
           MCNP model were used as input into the STAYSL PNNL code
           that provided an experimentally adjusted neutron
           spectra.
INC-SPECT  The B4C neutron spectrum was a little harder than a
           fast flux reactor, but a bit softer than the COMET
           experiment and 235U fission neutron spectrum.
           The thermal spectrum of WSU E9 and B4C capsule spectrum
           is presented in Fig.2 in Rad.Nucl.Chem.,296,763,2013.
