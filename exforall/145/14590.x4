METHOD     (ASSOP)
PART-DET   (A) Long range alphas.
           (HF) Heavy fission fragments for ratio to binary
            fission.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted errors result from both the
           unresolved low-energy portion of the spectrum and
           from the statistical error.
ADD-RES    Deviation of the binary-to-ternary fission ratio for
           the incident neutron energies of 0.003, 0.0253, 0.08,
           and 0.3 eV from the mean value in the neutron energy
           region between 0.003 and 0.3 eV.
