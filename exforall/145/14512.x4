INSTITUTE  (1USABNW,1USALRL)
FACILITY   (CRASS,1USALAS) The Godiva critical assembly at
           the National Criticality Experiments Research Center.
INC-SPECT  The center of the Godiva critical assembly and
           exposed to a single pulsed irradiation.
DETECTOR   (GE) A 65% relative efficiency, Mirion BEGe detector
           was set up horizontally shrouded on four-sides by a
           copper-lined open lead box. The detector was placed
           inside the lead shield to reduce room background
           observed by the detector and the copper liner
           attenuated x-rays emitted by the lead shielding.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9984) Two isotopically-characterized
           targets of high-purity (99.84+ 0.03%) 235U-oxide. Two
           targets, one large and one small, were prepared at
           LLNL from the stock powder by loading nominal masses
           of 63.0 and 8.6 milligram-equivalents of 235U-metal
           into separate quartz ampoules. Quartz wool was packed
           into the quartz tube to x the 235U-oxide in-place
           within the ampoule before heat sealing them.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Two ampoules along with a witness foil
           package were loaded into the center of the Godiva
           critical assembly and exposed to a single pulsed
           irradiation. The witness foil package contained
           high-purity copper, gold, cobalt, iron, and titanium
           wires. Activities observed in these wires were used
           to estimate the neutron fluence of the exposure. The
           targets were retrieved from Godiva shortly after the
           irradiation. The small target was placed 8.8 cm from
           the face of the BEGe detector for list-mode gamma
           counting 230.2 minutes after irradiation and was
           later replaced by the larger target 290.77 minutes
           after irradiation. Data were taken for a total of 7
           days. The switch between small and large targets was
           made to increase the data acquisition rate; thus,
           improving the statistical precision of fission product
           measurements made at days-after-irradiation.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Spectra were analyzed using Mirion's
           Genie2000 software. Spectra loaded into Genie2000
           were analyzed using a step-based process. First, the
           spectra were analyzed using a second-difference peak
           search algorithm. Next, distances between peaks were
           compared against a user-defined threshold based on
           the measured resolution calibration to identify
           single peaks and multiplets. After sorting, peaks
           were fit using the sum of a low-tail Gaussian
           function and either a linear or step based background
           estimation function, depending on which background
           function gave better residual chi** 2. Peaks within
           multiplet regions were fit simultaneously for better
           background estimation. Each peak fit was visually
           reviewed and in many cases manually refit using the
           Mirion's Interactive Peak Fitting software; this
           utility was crucial in providing reliable data
           quality because of the complexity encountered within
           the spectrum. Decay data used in the final
           measurements were taken from Nudat 2.0 in 2011.
CORRECTION A first pass analysis was conducted using only
           first-order Bateman decay corrections to identify
           cases where higher order Bateman corrections were
           needed. Specific activities corrected to a concurrent
           time are expected to be similar. Second-order Bateman
           decay corrections were generally applied in cases
           where the parent nuclide's half-life was >5% of the
           daughter's half-life as was the case for 134Te/I. The
           last correction was the self-shielding correction
           factor.

ANALYSIS   Products were analyzed using second-order Bateman
           decay corrections.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The given uncertainties for these isotopes
           are significantly smaller than the total standard
           deviation in the total fissions uncertainty; any
           changes in the reference isotope uncertainties are
           unlikely to shift the average total fissions outside
           of 1 sigma of the reference fissions value. The
           positive correlation between the measured fission
           product yields and the reference fission product
           lists are assumed to be captured in the standard
           deviation. Uncertainties at 1 sigma considered
           (ERR-1) Gamma-ray branching ratio.
           (ERR-2) Half-life.
           (ERR-3) Efficiency.
           (ERR-4) Self-shielding correction factor.
