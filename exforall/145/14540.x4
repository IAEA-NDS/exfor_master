TITLE      Light charged particles and fission elements from
           californium-252 fission

SAMPLE     The source strength was about 4e5 fiss/min. The 252Cf
           source was electrodeposited on a 0.002-in.-thick
           platinum disk.
DETECTOR   (SOLST,FISCH) A fission chamber was constructed to
           house the 252Cf source and the solid-state K x-ray
           and particle detectors. The particle telescope
           detector, which consisted of a series of two
           solid-state detectors, was just above the source. The
           K x-ray detector was just below the source.
METHOD     (COINC) A data acquisition sequence was started
           whenever the long-range particle and X-ray detectors
           were activated in coincidence.
HISTORY    (20190703C) OG.
