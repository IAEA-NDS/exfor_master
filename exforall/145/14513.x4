FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at Los Alamos
           National Laboratory- Los Alamos Neutron Science

SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9812) The 235U target consisted of a
           2 cm diameter circular deposit of 235UF(4) on a thin
           C backing. The thickness of the 235U was 175.5 mu-g
           235U/cm2. Thickness of C backing was 100 mu-g/cm2.
           The target was tilted at 45deg with respect to the
           incident beam.
DETECTOR   (SI) Two arrays of four Si PIN photodiodes were used
           to detect the fission products, where the photodiodes
           were arranged on opposite sides of the beam at angles
           60deg and 120deg from the incident beam. The
           individual PIN diodes had an area of 1 cm2, and the
           detectors were 2.1 cm from the center of the target.
           The timing pulse from a Si PIN diode coupled with the
           accelerator RF signal were employed to measure the
           time of flight of each interacting neutron. The
           uncertainty of the position of the photofission peak
           in the TOF spectrum was found to be 2.4%.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy was determined by time of
           flight. The 625 mu-s macropulse proton beam contains
           340 micropulses of width 250 ps that are spaced 1.8
           mus apart, where the macropulses had a repetition
           rate of 100 Hz. The distance from the spallation target
           to the Th target was measured to be 1384.9+-1.1 cm.
           The 15R beam line with 13.85m flight path was used in
           this experiment.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutron beams were generated from an
           unmoderated tungsten spallation source using an
           800MeV proton beam. Neutron time of flight and energy
           was calculated via the proton accelerator pulse timing.
CORRECTION Data were corrected for the pulse height defect in
           Si PIN diode detectors and the energy losses of the
           fragments in the target and backing foil
