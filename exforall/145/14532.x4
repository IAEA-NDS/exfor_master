TITLE      Symmetric fission observed in thermal-neutron-induced
           and spontaneous fission of 257Fm

FACILITY   (REAC,1USALRL)
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) The thermal column of the Livermore reactor in
           a flux of 2.e11 n/(cm2 sec) (cadmium ratio 600).
           Data were accumulated alternately with the reactor on
           and then off. Two separate runs of about three weeks
           each were made.
METHOD     (COINC,PHD) The fragment masses for each event were
           calculated from the kinetic energies, assuming
           conservation of momentum and mass.
DETECTOR   (SI) Two Si detectors with collimators to limit the
           maximum fragment entry angle to 50 degrees from the
           normal to the detectors
MONITOR    233U source (2 ng) for neutron-flux determination and
           a check on the energy calibration,
           252Cf spontaneous-fission source for energy
           calibration
SAMPLE     The sample, containing 4.e8 atoms of 257Fm, was
           obtained from the Hutch underground nuclear explosion.
           After final purification, a few microliters of solution
           containing 257Fm was evaporated on a 200-micro-g/cm2 Pt
           foil.
CORRECTION A correction was made for the pulse-height defect but
           not for neutron emission.
