SAMPLE     A 252Cf source (92 fissions/s) on a thin nickel foil
            (226 mu-g/cm2)
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SILI) A 252Cf source was sandwiched between two
           thin plastic scintillators (0.025 cm thick), and this
           was placed between two in-house fabricated Si(Li) X-ray
           detectors with solid angle fractions of 0.18 each, and
           sensitive regions of 3x170 mm2 each.
METHOD     (COINC,XSPEC) Coincident signals from the two
           scintillators indicated fission. The fission signal and
            the two X-ray detector signals were required to be
           within 2.5mu-s of each other to trigger a two-parameter
           accumulation system in which the outputs of each X-ray
           detector were recorded event by event on magnetic tape.
           Multiple  K X-ray detection events were identified by
           coincident outputs from the two X-ray detectors and by
           a single detector output which was equal to the sum of
           several single K  X-ray detection  outputs.
ANALYSIS   A statistical model for X-ray emission was used to
           determine the element yield by letting the ratios in
           the detection rates of the various multiplicities fix
           the parameters in the model.
