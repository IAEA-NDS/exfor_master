FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) The Argonne CP-5 reactor thermal isotope
           tray.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The flux was between 3.5E+12 n/cm**2/sec and
           4.5E+12 n/cm**2/sec.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The final volume of the purified tritiated water
           was measured to determine the recovery yield
            (essentially always 100%) of the aqueous added to the
           samples as HNO3 and NaOH solutions.
           Aliquotes of this water were counted in a coincidence
           type liquid  scintillation counter. Using a dioxane
           base scintillas, or solution with 2 ml of the water in
           15 ml of the dioxane solution the counting efficiency
           for tritium was 11%. Changes in the counting efficiency
           due to quenching by impurities in the sample and/or
           decomposition of the dioxane were monitored by the
           Compton edge technique.
METHOD     (CHSEP)
MONITOR    (92-U-233(N,F)56-BA-140,CUM,FY,,MXW) The number of
           fissions was determined from an analysis of the 140Ba
           produced during the irradiation and the 6.0% fission
           yield of 140Ba from the thermal fission of 233U.

SAMPLE     A few tenths of a gram of 233U308 were purified
            (especially from lithium) by dissolution in HNO3,
           ether extraction, back-extraction into water and
           re-ignition to 233U308. The isotopic composition of
           this  sample:
           (92-U-233,ENR=0.9687)+-0.0003
           (92-U-234,ENR=0.0122)+-0.0002
           (92-U-235,ENR=0.00196)+-0.00004
           (92-U-236,ENR=0.000019)+-0.000001
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.0171)+-0.0002.
           The  233U3O8 ether extractions and the use of platinum
           metal irradiation capsules removed the possibility of
           tritium contamination from the sample and the sample
           container.
           Several grams of 238U3O8 were also purified by ether
           extraction cycles. This sample was 99.983 atom% 238U
           and only 0.017 atom% 235U. This depleted U3O8 was mixed
           with the 233U308 to give a weight ratio of 238U to 233U
           of approximately 10:1.
           Samples of 0.5 to 1.5g of the 10:1  238,233U308  were
           weighed into platinum irradiation capsules which were
           sealed to prevent any gas leaks. These were then
           irradiated.

SAMPLE     Of the six PuO2 samples measured three gave values near
           that which could be expected from the Z2/A dependency.
           The experimental values obtained on these three samples
           are presented. The other three values indicated lower
           tritium yields. A big differences between the values
           and a large error were because of the difficulty of
           dissolving the PuO2 after it has been in  the reactor.
