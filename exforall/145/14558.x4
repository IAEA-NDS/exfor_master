TITLE      Neutron capture cross sections of 108,110Pd

REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,99,044313,2019)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORU) Measurements were performed at the
           Oregon State University TRIGA Reactor.
SAMPLE     Natural Pd metal of thickness 0.025 mm was used as a
           sample. Simultaneous irradiations of Au, Co, and Zr
           were done to determine the neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma rays were observed with a high-
           purity Ge detector with efficiency of 35% compared
           with NaI at 1332 keV. The detector resolution was
           typically 1.68 keV at 1332 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)Activation were performed in reactor thermal
           column with nominal thermal and epithermal neutron
           fluxes 7E+10 and 2E+8 n/cm2/s-1, respectively. Some
           samples were irradiated using fast pneumatic transfer
           facility with neutron fluxes 1E+13 and 3.5E+11
           n/cm2/s-1, respectively
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,,1.0) Statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-2,,1.0) Syst. uncertainty in detection efficiency
           (ERR-3) Syst. uncertainty due to intercomparison of
                   different flux monitors
           (ERR-4,3.0,8.0) Syst. uncertainty due to branching
                  ratios
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty

COMMENT   In the paper there are given no energy limits on
           resonance integral. Since irradiations were performed
           using Cd box with thickness of 1 mm and Cd cut-off
           energy is approx. 0.5 eV, we used this value as
           EN-MIN.
