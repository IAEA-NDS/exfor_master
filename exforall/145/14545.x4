FACILITY   Gammasphere.
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC) The triple gamma coincidence technique
            with Gammasphere.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) 72 Compton suppressed Ge detectors
           (TELES,SI,SISD) The energy spectrum of charged
           particles was measured by using two deltaE-E Si
           detector telescopes installed at the center of the
           Gammasphere array at Argonne National Laboratory.
           Each deltaE-E telescope included one deltaE detector
            (of 15 mu-m thickness and 10x10 mm2 area) and one
           strip detector. The strip detectors were 400 mu-m and
           60x60 mm2 in thickness and area, respectively and had
           29 strips. With the position resolution of the strip
           detector (4 mm wide strips and 1 mm resolution along
           each strip) , the deltaE-E telescopes provided
           unambiguous Z and A identification for all the light
           charged particles of interest. The energy calibration
           of the telescopes was performed with 224Ra and 228Th
           radioactive sources. This calibration automatically
           takes the presence of the Mylar foil into account. A
           software correction was applied for the energy loss
           in the Au foil.
SAMPLE     The 252Cf source with a strength of the order of 30
           mu-Ci was sandwiched between two Au foils, each 19
           mg/cm2 in thickness. These foils were used to stop
           the fission fragments so that problems associated
           with the Doppler shift of prompt fission gamma-rays
           were minimized. In addition, on each side of the
           source a 0.84 mg/cm2 Mylar foil was added to provide
           full absorption of a particles emitted in the
           radioactive decay of 252Cf.
