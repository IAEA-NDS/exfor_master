TITLE      DETERMINATION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SPIN CHANNELS IN
            P RESONANCES OF Y-89
FACILITY   (REAC) JOINT INSTITUTE REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC) PULSED REACTOR
SAMPLE     FLAT SAMPLES OF METALLIC YTTRIUM OF SIZE 20 BY 19 CM
            AND WEIGHT EITHER 284 OR 554 G USED
METHOD     (TOF) TIME OF FLIGHT WITH A 250 M FLIGHT PATH
DETECTOR   (PROPC) PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS FILLED WITH HE-3 TO
             10 ATM.
CORRECTION AREAS FOUND WERE CORRECTED FOR ANISOTROPY OF SCATTERING
            IN THE LAB SYSTEM AND CHANGE OF DETECTOR SENSITIVITY
            AS A FUNCTION OF RECOIL ENERGY. BLOCKING OF POTENTIAL
            SCATTERING BY RESONANCE SCATTERING NOT TAKEN INTO
            ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF ITS SMALL EFFECT.
