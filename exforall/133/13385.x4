TITLE      The fission yields of the cesium isotopes formed in
           the thermal neutron fission of U235 and the neutron
           absorption cross section of Xe-135

METHOD     (CHSEP,EXTB) Two samples of natural uranium metal
           were irradiated with thermal neutrons in the N.R.X.
           The uranium was dissolved in freshly distilled nitric
           acid and, where isotope dilution was required,
           known amounts of natural Cs (Cs133) were added to
           aliquots of this solution. The uranium was separated
           from the fission products by precipitation of uranium
           tetroxide from a neutral solution of the nitrate
           using hydrogen peroxide as precipitant. The
           supernatant solution containing most of the fission
           products was concentrated by evaporation and
           transferred I directly to the ion source filament of
           a 90 degrees sector mass spectrometer.

REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F)55-CS-133,CUM,FY,,MXW)
METHOD     The cumulative yield of Cs133 has been determined
           from measurements of the number of cesium atoms
           produced during a given irradiation and a knowledge
           of the extent of the U235 fission. The number of
           cesium atoms produced was measured with the mass
           spectrometer using isotope dilution techniques.The
           number of U235 fissions was calculated from the
           change in the B10/B11 ratio in a simultaneously
           irradiated boron flux monitor: 5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7 and
           the known ratio of the neutron fission cross section.
