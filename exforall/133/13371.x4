FACILITY   (REAC,1USABNL) Brookhaven pile.
INC-SPECT  A constant (+-2%) flux of ~2x10**11 neutrons/cm2/sec.
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9372) Five fission foils, each
           containing 7.855x10**-3 microg of 93.72 percent U235,
           were prepared by the standard method. Two additional
           foils were prepared by slight variations of this
           method: one, without final ignition, to test whether
           ignition affects the escape of fission recoils; and the
            other, by stippling the foil solution and rinse in
           small droplets over the surface of the Pt before
           evaporation and ignition, to test whether possible
           clumping of the U was great enough to cause loss of
           fission recoils.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) The gas counters were of glass, 2 cm in
           diameter and 30 cm long, with chemically deposited
           silver cathodes whose volumes had been measured to
           within 0.2 percent.
METHOD     (CHSEP,INTB) Two slug solutions were prepared
           independently of each other by diluting aliquots of
           the U235 stock solution. The slug was bombarded in
           the space between the two fission foils for an hour.
           The total of the recorded fissions of each foil was
           then corrected for background and counting-rate loss,
           divided by 60 to give the foil fission rate as
           fissions per min, and multiplied by the ratio of
           slug weight to foil weight to give the slug fission
           rate.
COMMENT    Surprisingly, modern T1/2 values for 133Xe and 135Xe
           are 5.2475 d and 9.14 h, respectively. Almost no
           changes in the last 65 years.

METHOD     (RELFY) In our experimental procedure two identical
           uranium samples(~40 microg U235 in each) were sealed
           into the usual quartz cells and then irradiated side
           by side in one of the pile pneumatic tubes for 0.033
           hr. The slugs were dissolved and swept with Xe
           carrier and 2 l of helium as rapidly as possible. The
           Xe of extract a collected at the bottom of the
           charcoal column was probably contaminated with some
           short-lived Kr isotopes. Therefore the first 10-15
           percent of the Xe desorbed from the column was
           discarded. The remainder was collected and put into
           counters in the usual manner.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

METHOD     (BSPEC) The Xe from each run was measured into two
           counters, designated a and b, each of which was
           counted ten times, over a period of two weeks,
           starting about 10 days after irradiation, on each of
           two electronic circuits, designated 1 and 2. Eight
           different counters were used for the five runs.
ANALYSIS   The basic Xe activity datum that enters the fission
           yield calculation in a given run is the mean of the
           corrected a and b averages of that run. This gives
           the disintegration rate of the total Xe in the given
           slug 253 hr after the end of a 1-hr bombardment. Of
           this total activity, about 98.8 percent was 5.27-day
           Xe133, one percent was 2.3-day Xe133m, and the
           remaining 0.2 percent was 12.0-day Xe131m.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Probable error.
           (ERR-1) 1% Slug fission rate.
           (ERR-2) 2% Xe disintegration rates.
