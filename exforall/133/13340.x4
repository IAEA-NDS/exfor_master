SAMPLE     The einsteinium isotopes used for these studies were
           obtained from the Transuranium Element Production
           Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The
           einsteinium was chemically separated from other
           actinide and fission product elements by elution with
           a-hydroxyisobutryric acid from a Dowex-50 cation
           exchange resin column(ammonium form). After removal of
           small aliquots for alpha counting, the purified sources
            of einsteinium were deposited on platinum discs.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 17-cm3 coaxial lithium-drifted germanium
           detector.
METHOD     (CHSEP,GSPEC) The catcher foils were dissolved in the
           presence of carriers, specific fission products were
           radiochemically purified and thick samples(~10mg/cm2)
           were mounted for beta counting in calibrated low
           background (0.4 count/min) counting equipment. The
           radioactive purity of each sample was verified by
           following its decay over several half lives. The
           observed counting rate for each fission product was
           corrected for chemical yield, counter efficiency,
           decay, genetic relationships and degree of saturation
           to give the relative saturation activity A which is
           proportional to the fission yield. In several
           experiments the activities of various fission
           products were determined without chemical separation
           by measuring the gamma-ray spectrum from the catcher
           foils with a lithium-drifted germanium detector.
           These spectra were analyzed with a computer program
           to determine the relative intensity of the various
           gamma-rays.
ANALYSIS   The relative fission yields determined by these
           methods were placed on an absolute basis by
           normalizing the final mass-yield curves to 200% total
           yield.
