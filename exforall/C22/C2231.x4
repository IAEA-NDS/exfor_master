FACILITY   (LASER,1USATEX)The experiment was performed using
           Texas Petawatt Laser at the Center for High Energy
           Density Science at The University of Texas at Austin.
METHOD     D2 or CD4 molecular clusters were produced in the
           adiabatic expansion of a high-pressure (52.5 bars)
           and low-temperature gas into vacuum through a
           supersonic nozzle. The temperature of the gas was 86 K
           in the case of D2 and 200 - 260 K in the case of CD4.
           Different concentrations of 3He gas were introduced
           into the reservoir in order to study collisions
           between fast d ions and 3He. For each laser shot, a
           residual gas analyzer measured the partial pressures
           of D2 or CD4 and 3He in the reaction chamber.
           Images of the plasma were taken by different cameras
           in order to measure the dimensions and calculate the
           plasma volume.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The yield of 14.7 MeV protons was measured
           with three thin plastic scintillators placed at 45, 90,
           and 135deg with respect to the laser beam direction.
