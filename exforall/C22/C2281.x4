INSTITUTE  (1USAANL)
FACILITY   (SPECM,1USAANL) The Argonne tandem mass spectrometry
           system.
           (VDGT,1USAANL) The Argonne FN tandem accelerator.
SAMPLE     (12-MG-26,ENR=0.994) 26Mg foils (99.4% isotopic
           abundance, 3.5-3.9 mg/cm2 thick, ~ 1 mg total
           material).
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (AMS) Stacks of up to three foils were bombarded with
           protons. After the irradiation, known amounts of 27A1
           powder (15-25 mg Al) were added to each of the 26Mg
           foils. It is assumed that the 26Al produced in the
           26Mg foils is converted to Al203 with the same
           efficiency as the added 27Al. The MgO + Al203 powder
            (16-40 mg) was then thoroughly mixed with 140 mg Zn
           powder and pressed to solid pellets of 6.4 mm
           diameter, which were mounted to the 10-position cone
           wheel of the inverted Cs-beam sputter source at the
           Argonne tandem. The split-pole focal plane detector
           is a position sensitive ionization chamber which
           generates position, differential energy loss and
           total energy signals, thus allowing complete mass and
           nuclear charge identification.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The main contributions to the errors arise
           from statistics.
