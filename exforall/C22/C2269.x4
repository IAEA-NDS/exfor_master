FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment performed using ATLAS
           facility at Argonne National Laboratory
SAMPLE     10B target with thickness of 200 mu-g/cm2 was bombarded
           by 24Mg ions to produce nuclei of interest 32Cl
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted from recoiling heavy nuclei
           were detected by Gammasphere, which consisted of 98
           Compton suppressed high-purity Ge detectors covering
           nearly whole solid angle 4Pi.
           (MAGSP) Ions recoiling from the target were separated
           from the beam and dispersed by the Argonne Fragment
           Mass Analyzer, which selects recoils according to
           their mass-to-charge ratio.
           (PGAC) Parallel-grid avalanche counter was located at
           the focal plane of the FMA to determine
           mass-to-charge ratio of the reaction products by
           their measured horizontal positions.
           (IOCH) Ions were stopped in an ionization chamber
           filled with isobutane gas at 13 Torr. The IC was
           divided into three segments (5, 5, and 20 cm long,
           respectively) to facilitate particle identification
           by energy loss (dE) and total energy (E) measurements.
INC-SOURCE Excited states in 32Cl nucleus were produced via
           nuclear reaction 10B(24Mg,2n)32Cl by bombarding 10B
           target with 24Mg ions. Ions recoiling from the target
           were separated from the beam and dispersed by the
           Argonne Fragment Mass Analyzer
ANALYSIS   Excited states of 32Cl were studied by gamma
           spectroscopy. The unbound states at 1738.1 and 2130.5
           keV in 32Cl correspond to 156 and 549 keV resonances
           in the 31S(p,gamma)32Cl reaction and their properties
           dominate the 31S(p,gamma)32Cl reaction rate. Gamma-ray
           partial widths were inferred based upon properties of
           mirror states in 32P
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification
           (COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays and recoil ions
           was required
