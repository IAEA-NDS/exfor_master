REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,96,064315,2017)
FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           Coupled-Cyclotron Facility of the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan
           State University
SAMPLE     Liquid Hydrogen target was used. The liquid hydrogen
           was contained by a cylindrical aluminum target cell
           with 125 mu-m Kapton entrance and exit windows mounted
           on a cryocooler. The nominal target thickness was 30
           mm.The effective thickness of the target was
           determined to be 258 mg/cm2 and mid-target beam
           energy was 91.5 MeV/nucleon.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Secondary beam particles were identified
           upstream of the reaction target by energy loss in a
           silicon surface barrier detector and by time of
           flight from the A1900 extended focal plane to the
           S800 object scintillator
           (MAGSP) Charged reaction products were momentum
           analysed using magnetic spectrometer S800.
           (HPGE) The GRETINA gamma-ray tracking array,
           consisting of 28 36-fold segmented high purity
           germanium crystals packaged in seven clusters of four
           crystals each, was installed at the pivot point of
           the S800
           (SCIN) Beamlike reaction products were identified
           downstream of the target by energy loss in the S800
           ion chamber and time of flight from the S800 object
           scintillator to a scintillator in the focal plane of
           the S800
METHOD     (TOF) Reaction products were identified using time of
           flight
           Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE The secondary beam 54Ti was produced by the
           fragmentation of a 130 MeV/u 76Ge primary beam in a
           376 mg/cm2 9Be production target and separated by the
           A1900 fragment separator
