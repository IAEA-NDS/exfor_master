FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was carried out at the
           ISAC-I radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF. The ion
           beam was accelerated first by RFQ and then
           postaccelerated using a drift tube linac.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with H2 at a pressure of
           5 Torr. The beam energy was chosen in order to cover
           a center-of mass energy range Ecm = 447-465 keV
           across the volume of the gas target.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Array of 30 bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors
           surrounding the windowless gas target was used to
           detect gamma rays resulting from the (p,gamma)
           reaction,
           (MAGSP) 20Na6+ recoils were transmitted to the focal
           plane of DRAGON spectrometer and were identified using
           time-of-flight system and an isobutane-filled
           ionization chamber
           (MCPLT) Time-of-flight (TOF) system was based on two
           microchannel plates detecting secondary electron
           emission from thin diamondlike carbon foils.
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber was used to determine
           energy of recoil ions
           (SCIN) Number of incident 19Ne ions was determined by
           measuring 19Ne beta decays in two 6-mm-thick plastic
           scintillators located near an intermediate focus of
           the separator where the 6+ component of the unreacted
           beam was stopped.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,GSPEC,COINC) Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) An intense radioactive beam (RIB) of 19Ne in
           a 1+ charge state was produced by bombarding a SiC
           target with 500 MeV protons. Products of mass approx.
           19 amu were extracted and ionized in a Forced
           Electron Beam Induced Arc Discharge ion source and
           filtered using a high resolution mass separator. This
           beam was then injected into a radio-frequency
           quadrupole accelerator for an initial acceleration.
           The average 19Ne beam intensity was found to be
           approx. 7E+6 ions per sec.
