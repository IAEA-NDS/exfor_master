FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) The experiment was performed at the
           John D. Fox accelerator laboratory at Florida State
           University
SAMPLE     Natural carbon foil with thickness of 105 mu-g/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Carbon target foil served as a secondary
           emission foil for target microchannel plate detector
           for time of flight detector.
           (SI) Evaporation residues (ER - mainly 30Si, 29Si,
           28Si, 29Al, 28Al, 27Mg, and 26Mg) were detected by
           two annular Si detectors, which subtended angular
           range 3.5 deg - 25 deg. ER were identified by time of
           flight end energy loss in Si detectors.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) Energy was determined by time of flight
INC-SOURCE A beam of 18-O ions, accelerated to an energy of 80.7
           MeV, impinged on a deuterium gas cell at a pressure
           of 350 torr and cooled to a temperature of 77 K. Ions
           of 19-O were produced via a (d,p) reaction. Reaction
           products were partly separated from the incident beam
           by the electromagnetic spectrometer RESOLUT. Although
           this spectrometer rejected most of the unreacted
           beam that exited the production gas cell, the beam
           exiting the spectrometer consisted of both 19-O and
           18-O ions necessitating identification of each ion on
           a particle-by-particle basis. ions were identified by
           time of flight and energy loss. 19-O ions
           corresponded to approximately 31% of the beam
           intensity, 18-O-7+ and 18-O-6+ represented to
           approximately 20% and 29%, respectively. 19-O beam
           incident on the target was (1.5 - 4)E+3 ions/s.
