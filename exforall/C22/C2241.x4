TITLE      Formation cross-sections and chromatographic
           separation of protactinium isotopes formed in

INC-SOURCE Two separate experiments were  performed at the Los
           Alamos Neutron Science Center at LANL using incident
           proton energies of 100 and 200MeV. In each experiment,
           the original beam energy was degraded to approximately
           half of its original value using aluminum degraders.
SAMPLE     Natural thorium foils of 99.7% purity were used in
           the experiment. The foils were of 2.5mm x 2.5mm
           approximate dimensions, with mass thicknesses ranging
           from 60.5 to 70.5 g/cm2.
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) Aluminum foils of 99.9%
           purity and 65mg/cm2 thickness were used as beam
           fluence monitors
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Thorium foils irradiated for nuclear reaction
           cross section measurements were counted on an ORTEC
           GEM10P4-70 p-type Al-windowed detector with relative
           efficiency of 10% at 1333 keV and a measured FWHM of
           1.99 keV at 1333 keV
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. Irradiated foils
           were counted over a period of approximately 12 months,
           collecting approximately 300 spectra
           (CHSEP) A sequence of chromatographic separations was
           developed to isolate Pa isotopes from the irradiated
           Th target and subsequently remove fission and other
           activation products. In the first step, Pa was
           isolated from the bulk Th mass via anion exchange in
           hydrochloric acid media. In the second step sample
           was divided in two similarly sized target portions
           were dissolved and two slightly different methods of
           anion exchange were performed with each portion.
           After the anion exchange step, the respective Pa
           fractions were collected and subjected to extraction
           chromatography.
