FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAFSU)
           (VDGT,1USAFSU)  Experiment performed using
           tandem Van de Graaff and linac at the John D. Fox
           Accelerator Laboratory of the Florida State University
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene (CD2) foil with a thickness
           of 0.52 mg/cm2.
DETECTOR   (SISD) The compact detection system consisted of thin
             (65 mu-m) and thick
             (500 mu-m) annular double-sided silicon strip
           detectors covering angles in the laboratory frame
           from 8-21 degrees for detection of protons,
           (IOCH) Heavy-ion reaction products and unreacted beam
           particles were identified using a position-resolving
           ion chamber
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight defined by linac RF and proton
           detection time was used for proton energy
           determination and identification
           (EDE) Energy loss in Si strip detectors was used for
           particle identification
INC-SOURCE A primary beam of 19F at 117 MeV bombarded
           hydrogen-gas target contained between thin Havar
           windows and creating a secondary beam of recoiling
           19Ne particles by means of the (p,n) reaction. The
           RESOLUT radioactive beam facility was used to
           separate the recoiling 19Ne particles in flight
           before focusing them onto the secondary target
           The 19Ne beam of approx. 1700 particles per second at
           86 MeV energy constituted 13% of the beam composition.
ANALYSIS   Experiment populated the resonances via the
           19Ne(d,n)20Na reaction. Proton resonances in 20Na were
           kinematicaly reconstruted from detected protons
           and 19Ne ions
