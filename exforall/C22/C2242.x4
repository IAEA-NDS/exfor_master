FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAWAU) Variable energy, positive ion, multi-
           particle Scanditronix MC50 compact cyclotron at the
           University of Washington Medical Cyclotron Facility
           was used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) GEM-18180-P HPGe detector system was used to
           determine produced radioactivity
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP). Activation method was used. 186Re from
           irradiated 186W was isolated using chemical
           separation. Typical 186Re isolation yields were
           in excess of 80%.
