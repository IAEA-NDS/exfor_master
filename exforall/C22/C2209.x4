FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment was performed at Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory using the 10 MV FN
           Tandem accelerator facility.
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.98) The target consisted of a thin 10B
           layer with approx. 400 mu-g/cm2 nominal thickness,
           deposited on a piece of tantalum that was thick
           enough to stop all of the protons.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Annihilation photons were registered with two
           LaBr3 crystal bars (4 in. long and with a 2 x 2
            (in.)2 cross sectional area), optically coupled to
           make a bar with dimensions 2 x 2 x 8 (in.)3 Two 8 in.
           long LaBr3 detectors were placed outside the chamber
           at a scattering angle of 90. on the left and the
           right side of the beam at the distance of 2.5 cm from
           the target.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 10B target was irradiated for 1 h at each
           of the proton energies . After each irradiation the
           beam was interrupted and the two coincident 511 keV
           gamma rays emitted by the activated target were
           measured for another hour.
           (COINC) Coincidence between the two detectors was
           required to measure annihilation gamma quanta.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Number of activated nuclei was determined by
           analysis of decay 11C curve.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Overall systematic uncertainty not included
                     in DATA-ERR
           (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty from weighted average yields,
            excluding the 8.6% systematic uncertainty
