FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University using Coupled Cyclotron
           Facility
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 51 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The 12Be reaction products were deflected by
           a large-gap sweeper magnet and identified from
           energy-loss and time-of-flight measurements.
           (SCIN) Neutrons were detected using MoNA array. The
           MoNA consists of 144 individual detector modules. Each
           module is based on a 200 x 10 x 10 cm3 block of BC-408
           plastic scintillator. In the nominal configuration the
           vertical layers of 16 of the scintillator blocks give
           a detector volume of 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.9 m3. Neutron energy
           and position was determined from time of flight.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between charged particle reaction
           products and neutrons were required.
           (TOF) Momentum and energy of neutrons were determined
           from time of flight measurement
INC-SOURCE Primary beam 18-O with energy of 120MeV/A bombarded a
           2.5 g/cm2 9Be production target. The A1900 fragment
           separator was used to separate and select the 13B
           secondary beam. The final energy of the beam was 71
           MeV/A, with an intensity of approximately 8.0E+5
           particles per second and a purity of 96%. 13Be was
           produced in a nucleon exchange reaction and immediately
           decayed into 12Be + n.
