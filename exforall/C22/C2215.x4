FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, Michigan
           State University.
SAMPLE     Sample was a deuterated polyethylene target (CD2)n
           with thickness of (10.7+-0.8)mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Recoil products were identified with the S800
           spectrograph downstream of the GRETINA array. The
           S800 was run in focused mode in order to allow a
           large momentum acceptance. The data acquisition was
           triggered either by recoil-gamma coincidences between
           GRETINA and the first scintillator at the focal plane
           of the S800 spectrograph
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were measured using GRETINA (Gamma-
           Ray Energy Tracking Inbeam Nuclear Array). GRETINA
           detectors positioned at laboratory angles of 58 deg
           and 90 deg.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence of recoil products detected in
           S800 focal plane scintillator and gamma rays detected
           in GRETINA detectors was required. Inverse kinematics
           was used.
INC-SOURCE The 30MeV/u 26Al13+ beam was produced inflight via
           fragmentation reactions using a primary beam of
           150MeV/u, 112 pnA 36Ar18+ ions to bombard a
           1960mg/cm2 thick Be target. The A1900 high-resolution
           fragment separator selected the ions of interest
           based on the momentum/charge, p/q, ratio after they
           had passed through a 600mg/cm2 thick Al wedge The
           26Al beam had a high purity (98+-2)% and an average
           intensity of (8.1+-0.4E+5 particles per second.
