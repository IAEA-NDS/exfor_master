FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory, East Lansing
SAMPLE     The secondary 9Be target with thickness of (188+-
           4)mg/cm2 was placed at the target position of the
           S800 spectrograph
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction residues were momentum analyzed
           using high resolution S800 spectrograph. Reaction
           residues were identified in focal plane detector.
           (IOCH,SCIN) Energy loss in the S800 ion chamber, time
           of flight taken between scintillators, and the
           position and angle information of the reaction
           products in the focal plane of the spectrograph were
           employed to unambiguously identify the reaction
           residues
           (HPGE) Fifteen 32-fold segmented HPGe detectors were
           arranged at a distance of 20 cm from the secondary
           target in two rings with central angles of 90deg and
           37deg relative to the beam axis.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,COINC) The gamma-ray spectra were detected
           in coincidence with the knockout reaction residues
           Gamma rays emitted in flight were event-by-event
           reconstructed for Doppler shift.
INC-SOURCE A multicomponent beam consisting of the N=16 isotones
           32S, 33Cl, and 34Ar was obtained by fragmentation of
           a 150 MeV/nucleon 36Ar primary beam. The 9Be
           fragmentation target with thickness of 1034 mg/cm2
           was located at the midacceptance target position of
           the A1900 fragment separator. Composition of the final
           incoming beam was

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty related to the choice
           of the software gates used for particle identification
           (ERR-2) Systematic uncertainty related to the stability
           and purity of the particle beam
           (ERR-3) Systematic uncertainty in correction of the
           momentum acceptance of the S800 spectrograph
