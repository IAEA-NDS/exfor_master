SAMPLE     A Ta target of thickness  0.938 mg/cm2 was used for
           all measurements.
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Array of four large area parallel plate
           avalanche counters were used to measure the time of
           flight and relative position of fission fragments from
           a binary event.

INC-SOURCE The Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) projectile
           fragmentation facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory was used in conjunction with the
           ReA3 reaccelerator to produce beams of 46 K. The
           stable 39 K beams at the were produced using only the
           ReA3 facility.
ANALYSIS   Reconstruction of the velocity vectors of the
           coincident fragments allowed to calculate the
           masses and angular distributions of the fragments.
           Capture-fission excitation function can be taken as
           the capture excitation function because straight-
           forward calculations for these reactions indicate
           that 99% of the capture events undergo fission.
