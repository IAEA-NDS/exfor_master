FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting
           Cyclotron Laboratory
SAMPLE     Vitreous carbon 12C target with thickness of
           149.4 mg/cm2 and density of 1.54g/cm3
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) reaction products were momentum analysed
           using S800 spectrograph and identified on an
           event-by-event basis in focal plane detector
           (HPGE) Gamma ray energy tracking was performed using
           in-beam nuclear array GRETINA. Seven highly segmented
           GRETINA modules with 36-fold segmented crystals were
           arranged in two rings. Four modules were located at
           58 deg and three modules at 90 deg. Online signal
           decomposition provided gamma-ray interaction points
           for event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the
           gamma rays emitted in-flight. The information on the
           momentum vector of the projectile-like residues was
           incorporated into the Doppler reconstruction
METHOD     (COINC) For clean particle identification, gamma-ray
           coincidences were required to eliminate unreacted
           48Ca contaminating identifications made without
           coincidences.
CORRECTION Detected gamma ray energy was corrected for Doppler
           shift taking into account also momentum of the
           projectile-like reaction residues.
INC-SOURCE 48Ca primary beam was energy degraded in the A1900
           fragment separator with a 1363mg/cm2 9Be target and
           transmitted to the experimental vault with the
           momentum acceptance dp/p restricted to 0.25%.
