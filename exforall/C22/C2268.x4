                 Earlier measurement in different energy range
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) The experiment was performed at the
           Nuclear Science Laboratory at Notre Dame with the FN
           Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
SAMPLE     Gas cell filled with 10 Torr of 4He
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Amount of produced reoiled 36Cl nuclei were
           determined by AMS performed at Purdue's Rare Isotope
           Measurement (PRIME) Laboratory
METHOD     After passing through the entrance foil, the  33S
           beam reacted along the length of the gas-filled
           volume and forward-recoiled 36Cl atoms were stopped
           in a 0.25 mm thick Al foil at the back of the gas
           cell. SRIM simulations shown that, for all energies,
           more than 99% of recoils are caught in the 9 cm
           diameter circular cross section of the foil.
           (CHSEP) After irradiation chemical separation was
           performed with overal efficienfy of 97.5%.
           (AMS) Atomic mass spectroscopy was used to determine
           number of 36Cl nuclei produced. The AMS measurements
           were normalized to the 36Cl standard material KNSTD500.
