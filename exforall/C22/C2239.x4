FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment was performed at the
           University of Notre Dame FN Tandem facility
SAMPLE     (6-C-13,ENR=0.99) Self-supporting 13C target of 45 mu-
           g/cm2 nominal thickness.
DETECTOR   (SISD) An array of four double sided silicon strip
           detectors was employed in order to detect the four
           alpha particles. Each DSSDwas 500 mu-m thick and 5 x 5
           cm2 in active area. Each face was segmented into 16
           strips of 3 mm width, with the front face strips being
           horizontal and those on the rear face vertical. The
           detector distances and center angles were 10.0 cm and
           +50.8deg, 14.0 cm and +23.5deg, 13.9 cm and -28.6deg,
           and 10.7 cm and -54.5deg.
METHOD     (COINC) Events in which four charged particles were
           detected in the DSSD array were selected. Energy and
           position calibrations were applied to the data.
INC-SPECT  Authors used events with three incident alpha beam
           energies (27.0, 27.5, 28.0 MeV).
ANALYSIS   As no particle identification was provided directly by
           the detectors, the four hits were assumed to be alpha
           particles in the analysis. The undetected neutron
           energy was determined for each event from the missing
           momentum between the beam and four detected alpha
           particles,
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
              calculated from statistical uncertainty and
              20% systematic uncertainty in 13C target thickness
