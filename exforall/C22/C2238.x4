FACILITY   (VDG,1USATNL) Experiment performed using 1 MV JN Van
           de Graaff accelerator at the Laboratory for
           Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics located at the
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory.
SAMPLE     Nitrogen targets were prepared by implanting 14N ions
           into (0.35+-0.05)-mm-thick tantalum backings of 99.95%
           metals-basis purity. The target stoichiometry was
           determined via Rutherford backscattering spectrometry.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial HPGe detector with a diameter of (89.0
           +-0.5) mm and a length of (91.6+-1.0) mm, resulting in
           135% relative efficiency. The HPGe and target chamber
           were surrounded by an annulus of NaI(Tl)
           scintillators, which were not used in present
           measurements.
           (NAICR) Segmented annular detector consisting of 24
           position sensitive trapezoidal crystals with
           dimensions 55.0 x 6.0 x 5.5/7.0 cm3 (L x H x W).
           Each NaI(Tl) bar has a photomultiplier tube (PMT)
           coupled to either end. Position and energy of each
           detected photon could be reconstructed.

ANALYSIS   Yield was determined from combined yields for the three
           dominant transitions 5181 keV, 6172 keV and 6792 keV.
