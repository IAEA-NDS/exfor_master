FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the National
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, Michigan State
           University
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene target (CD2)n with thickness of
             (10.7+-0.8)mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using GRETINA (Gamma-
           Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Nuclear Array) detectors
           positioned at laboratory angles of 58deg and 90deg.
           (MAGSP) The projectile-like reaction products were
           identified with the S800 spectrograph downstream of
           the GRETINA setup. The S800 was run in focused mode
           in order to allow a large momentum acceptance. 31S15+
           ions were clearly separated from other reaction
           products, and a nearly 100 % acceptance at the S800
           focal plane was determined.
METHOD     (COINC) Data acquisition was triggered by
           coincidences between GRETINA and the first
           scintillator at the focal plane of the S800.
           Downscaled projectile-like singles events were also
           accepted for minimum bias analysis
INC-SOURCE The 30MeV/u 30P15+ beam was produced inflight via
           fragmentation reactions using a primary beam of
           150MeV/u, 112 pnA 36Ar18+ ions to bombard a
           1857mg/cm2 thick Be target. The A1900 high-resolution
           fragment separator selected the ions of interest
           based on the momentum/charge, p/q, ratio after they
           had passed through a 450mg/cm2 thick Al wedge The
           26Al beam had a high purity (97+-2)% and an average
           intensity of (1.04+-0.08)E+6 particles per second.
