FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) FN tandem accelerator was used to
           accelerate radioactive 6Li beam
SAMPLE     Natural Ni targets were used, with thicknesses
           between 1.36 and 5.60 and target sizes
               thickness (mg/cm2)     size (cm)
                      1.36           2.5 diameter
                      2.22           8.9 x 8.9
                      5.60            13 x 13
CORRECTION Corrections were applied to account for the presence
           of isotopes other than 58 Ni.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detectors
           were used for the backward telescopes and for the
           beam monitors. The thin (dE) detectors of the
           backward telescopes were 65-95 mu-m thick for stage 1,
           while they had a typical thickness of cca 40 mu-m for
           all other stages. The thick (E) detectors had a
           thickness of cca 1000 mu-m thick for all
           measurements. Solid angles were defined by
           collimators of 18-25 mm in diameter placed in front
           of all telescopes.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE A primary 6Li3+ high-intensity beam with energies
           between 31 and 38 MeV, delivered by the UND FN tandem
           accelerator, was used to bombard a 2.5-cm- long
           primary gas target of 3He at a pressure of 1 atm.
           Secondary beam rates of (0.6-4.0)E+7 particles/s were
           typically achieved. The respective energy resolution
           was 0.6-0.8 MeV FWHM, with a typical time spread of
           7-10 ns. 6Li beam could be nicely separated by TOF
           from the other major components, except satellite
           4He2+ beam, with relative yield of 0.4%, which can be
           safely neglected.
