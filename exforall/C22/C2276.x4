FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Measurements were performed with the
           FN Tandem Accelerator at the University of Notre Dame
           Nuclear Science Laboratory
SAMPLE     (68-ER-162,ENR=0.282) Material enriched with 162Er
           was purchased in an oxide form Er2O3. The oxide form
           of enriched 162Er was deposited onto a 40mu-g/cm2
           carbon backing by an electron beam gun evaporator.
           Eight targets were produced with thicknesses between
           65 and 130 mu-g/cm2 Target frames were made of Ta,
           with 1 cm diameter holes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Targets were counted offline by a high-purity
           germanium detector of 40% relative efficiency.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used.The reaction yields
           were determined by the observed activity of produced
           isotopes. The whole setup was shielded by 10 cm thick
           lead  shield against laboratory background.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty in target thickness
                   obtained as a quadratic sum of target thickness
                   and inhomogeneity of the target
           (ERR-2) Systematic uncertainty in detection efficiency
                   with coincidence summing correction
           (ERR-3,0.2,3.) Systematic uncertainty in decay data
           (ERR-4,0.,2.) Systematic uncertainty in beam current
                         normalization
           (ERR-S,0.4,11.) Counting statistical uncertainty
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
