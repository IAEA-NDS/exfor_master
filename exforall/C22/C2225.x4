FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the LBNL 88-
           inch cyclotron facility using the Berkeley gas-filled
           separator.
SAMPLE     208Pb target consisted of nine arc shaped segments,
           each with a 500-mg/cm2 thick lead layer sandwiched
           between layers of carbon with thicknesses of 40
           mu-g/cm2 facing the beam and 2 mg/cm2. These segments
           were mounted around the periphery of a 14-inch
           diameter wheel which was rotated to minimize thermal
           stress on the target from beam heating wheel which
           was rotated to minimize thermal stress on the target
           from beam heating.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Berkeley gas-filled separator (BGS) spatially
           separated the recoiling fusion evaporation residues
            (with E approx. 70 MeV) in flight from both beam
           particles and transfer reaction products on the basis
           of their differing magnetic rigidities within the
           separator's 0.88-torr helium atmosphere. The magnetic
           rigidity Br of the recoiling fusion evaporation
           residues (EVR) with Z=110 and A=271 was estimated to
           be 2.1 T m
           (SISD) EVR's were deposited at the BGS focal plane
           300-mm thick passivated ion implanted silicon
           detector with an active area of 116 mm (horizontal) x
           358 mm (vertical). Detector recorded the time,
           energy, and position of the implanted EVR's and of
           their subsequent alpha decays. Resistive charge
           division provided vertical position resolution within
           each strip
           (PPAC) Parallel plate avalanche counter placed 24 cm
           in front of the strip detector, recorded the time and
           position of recoiling ions before implantation. The
           presence or absence of signals from ions passing
           through the PPAC distinguished beam-related events in
           the strip detector and those from the alpha decay of
           previously implanted ions.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence of PPAC and SISD within the
           position resolution indicated existence of correlation
           between evaporation residues and their alpha decay.
           EVR were identified by alpha decay sequences. Two
           decay chains were observed.
