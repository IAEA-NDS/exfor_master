FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed using coupled
           cyclotrons of the National Superconducting Cyclotron
           Laboratory at Michigan State University.
SAMPLE     The secondary tin beams impinged on a 47 mg/cm2 9Be
           reaction target at the target position of the S800
           magnetic spectrometer
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction residues were momentum analysed
           using S800 magnetic spectrometer.
           (DRFTC) Two cathode readout drift chambers measured
           the particle positions and angles in the focal plane.
           These were used to reconstruct momentum distributions
           of the reaction residues.
           (CSICR) The secondary target was surrounded by the
           high-efficiency CsI(Na) scintillator array (CAESAR)
           that was used to identify the decay gamma rays of the
           reaction products. CAESAR consists of 192 CsI(Na)
           crystals with 95% of solid-angle coverage. The
           granularity of the array enables event-by-event
           Doppler reconstruction of gamma rays emitted in-flight.
           (SCIN,IOCH) The reaction residues were identified
           event by event by using the time of flight between
           two plastic scintillators and the energy loss dE
           measured in the S800 focal-plane ion chamber.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE,TOF) Particle energy determination for EdE
           method was made using time of flight
INC-SOURCE Primary 124Xe beam was accelerated to 140 MeV/A. Two
           settings of the A1900 fragment separator were used to
           select 108Sn and 106Sn secondary beams and to deliver
           them to the target position of the S800 spectrograph.
           The average rate of 108Sn on the reaction target
           was 3000 pps.
