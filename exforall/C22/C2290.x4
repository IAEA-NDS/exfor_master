FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed using
           the ReA3 facility at Michigan State University's
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.
SAMPLE     The 327 mu-g/cm2 -thick 28Si secondary emission foil
           of the microchannel plate (MCP) detector served as
           the target for the experiment.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) Two microchannel plate detectors, one at the
           target position, the second one 1.3 m upstream
           provided a time-of-flight measurement of the beam
           particles.
           (IOCH) Two compact axial field ionization chambers
           were inserted in the beam path between the two MCP
           detectors for particle identification.
           (SI) Two annular silicon detectors which  subtend the
           laboratory angles 1.0-7.3deg were used for detection
           of evaporation residui.
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight allowed rejection of beam
           particles scattered or degraded prior to the target
           and provided a direct measure of the number of beam
           particles incident on the target.
           Particle identification was achieved by E-TOF
           method.
INC-SOURCE Ions of 39 K from a source or 47 K from a thermalized
           radioactive beam were charge bred in an ion trap,
           injected into the ReA3 80-MHz linac, and
           re-accelerated to energies between 2 and 3 MeV/A.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainty in the fusion cross sections
           includes both measurement statistics and systematic
           uncertainties. Sources of uncertainties not described.
