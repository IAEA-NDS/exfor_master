TITLE      Investigation of the role of 10Li resonances in the
           halo structure of 11Li through the 11Li(p,d)10Li

FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed using
           superconducting linac at the ISACII facility at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Solid H2 target formed by spraying H2 gas onto a 5.4
           mu-m thick cooled Ag foil. The foil adheres to a
           copper target cell frame cooled to 4K. The average
           thickness was approx. 60 mu-m varying from 30 mu-m to
           130 mu-m with time. The target thickness was
           continuously measured using the Ag(11Li,11Li)Ag
           elastic scattering peak energy of 11Li.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) The light particles p,d,t were
           detected using annular arrays of segmented silicon
           strip detectors backed by a CsI(Tl) array. The
           silicon detectors with thickness of 100 mu-m served
           as dE detector, the total energy was measured using
           CsI(Tl) array. This array covered laboratory angles
           of theta(lab) from 32 deg to 58 deg.
           (TELES,SISD,SISD) The heavy reaction residues pass
           through the hole in the YY1 annular array, and are
           detected using a dE - E (60 mu-m and 500 mu-m thick)
           double-sided segmented silicon strip detector array
           placed further downstream of the target. This
           telescope covered laboratory angles of theta(lab)
           from 1.8 deg to 5.7 deg.
