FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Experiment was performed at the
           superconducting linear accelerator ATLAS at Argonne
           National Laboratory.
SAMPLE     (14-SI-30,ENR=0.9602)
           (14-SI-29,ENR=0.0033)
           (14-SI-28,ENR=0.0343) Thin targets with thicknesses
           of about 20 mu-g/cm2 SiO2 (evaporated on 40 mu-g/cm2
           carbon foils) were used
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporation residues were analyzed with
           the Fragment Mass Analyzer, placed at 0deg with
           respect to the beam direction
           (PGAC,IOCH) The evaporation residues were detected
           and identified in the focal plane of the FMA with
           detectors of the configuration PGAC1-TIC1-
           PGAC2-TIC2-PGAC3-IC, where PGAC stands for an x-y
           position-sensitive, parallel-grid avalanche counter,
           TIC for a transmission ionization chamber, and IC for
           a large volume multi-anode ionization chamber. The
           first PGAC1 counter was mounted at the focal-plane of
           the FMA,where the evaporation residues are dispersed
           according to their mass-to-charge ratio m/q.
