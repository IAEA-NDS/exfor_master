FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was performed in the ISAC-
           I facility at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory
           for particle and nuclear physics.
SAMPLE     Windowless hydrogen gas target filled with H2 at an
           average pressure and temperature of 10.6 mbar
           and 298 K, respectively.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Array of 30 bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors
           surrounding the windowless gas target was used to
           detect gamma rays resulting from the (p,gamma)
           reaction,
           (MAGSP) 39Ca recoils were transmitted to the focal
           plane of DRAGON spectrometer and were identified using
           time-of-flight system and an isobutane-filled
           ionization chamber
           (MCPLT) Time-of-flight (TOF) system was based on two
           microchannel plates detecting secondary electron
           emission from thin diamondlike carbon foils.
           (IOCH) The total kinetic energy and stopping power
           of the recoil ions was measured in a multi-anode
           ionization chamber
           (SCIN) Number of incident 19Ne ions was determined by
           measuring 19Ne beta decays in two 6-mm-thick plastic
           scintillators located near an intermediate focus of
           the separator where the 6+ component of the unreacted
           beam was stopped.
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidences between gamma rays detected in
           BGO array and recoil nuclei, detected by ionization
           chamber was required.
           Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) A beam of radioactive 38K was produced by
           impinging 500 MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron
           onto a high-power TiC production target. The 38K(1+)
           produced by spallation reactions in the target
           were extracted and sent through a high-resolution
           mass separator. They were then charge bred to the 7+
           charge state in an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)
           charge state booster before post-acceleration in
           ISAC-1 radiofrequency quadrupole.
