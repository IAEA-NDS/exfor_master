FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was performed using DRAGON
           ISAC-I facility at TRIUMF.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target with an effective length of
           12.3 cm was operated at He pressures ranging from
           7.08 to 9.13 Torr. This resulted in target thicknesses
           ranging from 55 to 75 keV in the CM system.
DETECTOR   (BGO) DRAGON's gamma detector array consists of 30
           bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillators in a close-
           packed geometry covering 92% of the solid angle
           surrounding the gas target.
           (MAGSP) Heavy reaction products were momentum
           analyzed in DRAGON spectrometer and identified in
           spectrometer focal plane.
           (MCPLT) Heavy reaction products were identified in
           focal plane using time-of-flight system consisting of
           two microchannel plates
           (IOCH) A multi-anode ionization chamber measured the
           energy loss and total kinetic energy of heavy ions
           transmitted to DRAGON's focal plane.
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,COINC)
INC-SOURCE An isotopically pure beam of 34S ions was generated
           by the Supernanogan electron cyclotron resonance
           plasma source using a gas supply of SF6 enriched in
           34S. The beam was accelerated through the ISAC-I
           Radio-Frequency Quadrupole and the Drift-Tube Linac
           to energies between 20.23 and 25.75 MeV
