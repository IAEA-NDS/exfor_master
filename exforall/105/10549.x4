TITLE      Cross-Section Measurement of Plutonium-236 Formation in
           Plutonium-238 by 237Np(n,2n) Reactions.
FACILITY   (REAC,1USASRL)
INC-SPECT  Averaged over 235U fission spectrum above 6.8 MeV
           Fraction of fission neutrons equal to or above 6.8 MeV
            is 0.0168 for 235U thermal-neutron fission.
METHOD     Cross section determined from the 236Pu/238Pu ratio
            in low assay 238Pu, separated from irradiated fuel
            assemblies.
MONITOR    Cross section dependent upon fission spectrum accuracy
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data error is about 10%, of which
            approximately 5% is due to inaccuracies in the alpha
            ratio measurement.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author 1975/12/1.
