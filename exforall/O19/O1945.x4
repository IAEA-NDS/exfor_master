FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)
SAMPLE     The 150 MeV Si-28 beam entered a 1.3m in diameter
           scattering chamber through a 2.7+-0.4 mum thick Havar
           foil. The chamber was filled with helium gas,
           representing the alpha-particle target.
METHOD     (TTM)
           Thick-target inverse kinematics method
           (TOF)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR).The recoiling alpha-particles were detected by
           an array of six standard silicon surface barrier
           detectors, each separated by 6 degree and mounted on a
           turntable. A fixed detector at -15 degree was used for
           monitoring and for normalization of the angular
           settings. The seven detectors varied in thickness
            1.5-5 mm and in area 50-200 mm**2. The time of flight
           was measured in the experiment using the cyclotron RF
           signal and the fast signal from the Si detectors.
STATUS     The letter was send to Dr.M.Norrby
