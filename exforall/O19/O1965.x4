DETECTOR   (TELES,MWPC,SOLST) two proportional counters, P1 and
            P2 and two cylindrical solid-state silicon detectors,
            S1, 2.5 mm and S2, 5.0 mm thick were employed to
           determine the fluence of neutrons in the high-energy
           peak
           (SCIN,FISCH)  two independent beam monitors were
           located behind the collimator exit- a fission chamber
           monitor (FCM) and a plastic scintillation detector-
           NE213 scintillation detector, 51 mm in diameter, 102 mm
           in length
SAMPLE     Targets of metallic lithium with natural isotope
           composition were used for the neutron production.
STATUS      The letter was send to Dr.H.Schuhmacher 14.02.2012.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Relative spectral neutron fluences, as a
           function of neutron energy E(n), measured with NE213 at
           a proton energy of 36.4 MeV must be reported in
           Data section.
