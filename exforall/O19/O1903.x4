           The analyzing powers obtained in the same measurement
           have already been published in O1289002-004.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2NEDKVI) the superconducting cyclotron AGOR
INC-SOURCE (POLIS)
SAMPLE     A 4.5 mm thick liquid-hydrogen target was used.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The Big-Bite spectrometer is a QQD-type
           spectrometer, two vertical drift chambers were mounted,
           measuring the position and the angle of the 3He
           traversing the focal plane. After the last VDC, two
           segmented scintillators are located. This scintillator
           is made of NE102A with the thickness of 8 mm.
           Each module contains a 4 mm thick CaF(2) layer glued on
           to a 356 mm thick scintillator, which allows to
           discriminate photons, leptons and protons from each
           other.
METHOD     (COINC) Differential cross-sections of the deuteron-
           proton radiative capture were measured with a
           coincidence setup.

            +-8% is indicated as a grey band with a thickness of
            2 SIGMA  in each panel-fig.6 of J,EPJ/A,47,59,2011.
