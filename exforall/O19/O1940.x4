INC-SOURCE  The He-6 beam was produced by the Li-7(p,2p)He-6
           reaction in a LiF powder target with a graphite
           container.
SAMPLE     Two different types of target were used in the present
           experiment.
           Targets of Type I were a layer of enriched more than
            97% Pb-206 metal of 0.50+-0.05 mg/cm**2 thickness
           evaporated on a 40 mug/cm**2 thin Carbon foil.
           According to TRIM calculation the thickness of the
           Carbon backing was sufficient to stop the fusion
           produced Po-210 evaporation residues.
           Targets of Type II were made by depositing a disk-
           shaped layer 15 mm diameter of 206PbS compound on
            1.5 mum thick Ti foils. The material used was of
           enrichment more than 95%, effective 206Pb thickness of
           around 1 mg/cm**2. The Ti foils served as beam energy
           degraders.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Charged particles emitted by the scattering
           target were detected by the large area Si multi-
           detector system LEDA. One LEDA array is an annular
           detector consisting of 8 sectors, each having 16 strips
           of 10 mm width. Forward and backward scattering angles
           were covered by 2 LAMP(The removal of two sectors from
           LEDA assembly enables the remaining sectors to be
           arranged as a six-sided cone-colloquially know as
           the LAMP configuration) sets of 5 LEDA sectors each.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (STTA)
           (CHSEP) All irradiated samples were subjected to a
           chemical processing, known amounts of 209Pb tracer were
           added, Po material extracted and induced alpha-
           radioactivity measured at  Huelva University. The total
           stack thickness and a beam energy spread were measured
           in a special experimental run of a low beam intensity.

COMMENT    *By author*.Experimental data for the 206Pb(6He,2n)
           evaporation channel cross-section, uncorrected on the
           beam energy spread.
           *By authors*.To determine the reaction cross-section
           of interest, sigma(2n) at E(lab)= 18 MeV, the product
           of the total integrated projectile flux bombarding the
           scattering target and its density was obtained by
           normalizing the elastic scattering count rate to
           Rutherford scattering.
