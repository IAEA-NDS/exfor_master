FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SF JYV)
SAMPLE     The 150 MeV Ar-36 beam entered a 1.3m in diameter
           scattering chamber through a thin Havar foil. The
           chamber was filled with helium gas.
METHOD     (TOF)
           (TTM)
           Thick-target inverse kinematics method
DETECTOR   (SIBAR).The recoiling alpha-particles were detected by
           an array of six standard silicon surface barrier
           detectors, each separated by 6 degree and mounted on a
           turntable. A fixed detector at -15 degree was used for
           monitoring and for normalization of the angular
           settings. The seven detectors varied in thickness
            1.5-5 mm and in area 50-200 mm**2. The time of flight
           was measured in the experiment using the cyclotron RF
           signal and the fast signal from the Si detectors.
CORRECTION Corrections for the differences in solid angle
           depending on energy and angle was made.
STATUS     The letter was send to Dr.M.Norrby
