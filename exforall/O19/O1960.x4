FACILITY   (ISOCY,2ITYUBO)  a 16.5MeV GE-PETtrace cyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA)   Irradiation time approx. 1 hour
           (CHSEP)
SAMPLE     High purity, more than 99.9% yttrium metallic foils.
           One or two thin discs, thickness = 0.15 mm, diameter =
            14 mm of Y-89 were firmly positioned in a copper
           backing support, diameter = 32 mm, depth = 1 mm, having
           a central cavity, diameter =14 mm, depth =0.15 or
            0.30 mm). The target was covered by an aluminium disc
           of 32 mm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness.
           The aluminium disc allows for degradation of the energy
           of the incident proton beam and protects the yttrium
           target foil from possible motion due to the incident
           high-pressure helium flow.
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils were included in the stack to
            calculate the actual beam current during the
            irradiation.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high purity Germanium detector has a 30%
           relative efficiency and a resolution of 1.8 keV at
            1332 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is reported in text.
           (ERR-1,1.,2.).Error in the calibration of the reference
           source 1-2% at 1 sigma level, depending on the peak in
           the mixture. The latter being evaluated from the
           covariance matrix of the fitting of the efficiency
           curve (typically less than 3%). The calibration
           uncertainty thus amounts to about 4-5% at 1 sigma level
           (ERR-2,,1.).Error in the tabulated yield typically
           less than 1%.
           (ERR-3,,1.).Error in the net peak area less than 1% for
           for calibration peaks and in the interpolation of the
           efficiency values.
           (ERR-4,5.0,7.0).Error in the accuracy in the activity
           values obtained was in the range 5-7%. Taking into
           account the accuracy in the dispensing of the samples,
           the uncertainty in measurements of net areas of samples
            typically less than 2% and in positioning of samples,
           less than 1%, a comparison of the activity values
           obtained by the gamma ray spectrometry system and the
           results of the measurements performed with the
           radionuclide activity calibrator, allows for assessment
           of a first order calibration factor for the activity
           meter, with a level of accuracy of about 8% at 1 sigma
           level, that is considered satisfactory in the scope of
           the present work.
