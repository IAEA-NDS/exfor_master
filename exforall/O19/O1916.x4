FACILITY   (SYNCH,2GERGSI)
           (FRS,2GERGSI)
SAMPLE     A Be target 1.6 g/cm**2 thick.
METHOD     (TOF)
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SCIN,IOCH) The reaction products were analyzed
           with the magnetic spectrometer fragment separator (FRS)
           Two multisampling ionization chambers (MUSIC) located
           at the final image plane of the spectrometer.
           Two plastic scintillators.
           The charge-state equilibrium close to fully ionized
           nuclei was restored by using three stripping Niobium
           foils: the first behind the target (220 mg/cm**2),
           the second behind the energy degrader at the
           intermediate image plane of the separator(105 mg/cm**2)
           and the third in between the two MUSIC chambers
            (230 mg/cm**2).
ERR-ANALYS  The uncertainties associated with these measurements
           include the statistical and the systematic effects.
           The systematic uncertainties embody the errors related
           to the yield corrections and the reference cross
           section.
           (ERR-1).The uncertainties in beam attenuation and
           secondary reactions amount to 10%.
           (ERR-2).Uncertainties associated with the correction
           for incompletely stripped ions is 5%.
           (ERR-3).Uncertainties associated with the correction
           for transmission is 20%.
CORRECTION The corrections for beam attenuation, secondary nuclear
           reactions, and charge states were calculated for each
           nuclear species using the codes KAROL and GLOBAL,
           whereas the transmission correction was applied to the
           residues partially transmitted in one or both focal
           planes.
