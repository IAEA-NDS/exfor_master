INSTITUTE  (4UKRIJD)
FACILITY   (VDG,4UKRIJD) Type of neutron generator is not
            mentioned in the article.
MONITOR     No information
DETECTOR   (SOLST) Two semiconductor detectors,
            registration efficiency 40 %,
            energy resolution 2.0 keV for gamma-lines of 60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Radiation during 6 hr and 1 hr.
            Measurements series of 10 x 10 min.
SAMPLE      Sample weights were 5-10 gram of 30Si.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Errors are not specified

           (20241212A) M.M. Upper -> lower case correction.
            Dates were corrected for 4-digits year.
            STATUS information was updated.
            E-RSL was moved from COMMON block to DETECTOR free
            text. Decay data were added.

DECAY-DATA (12-MG-27,9.5HR,DG)
COMMENT    Of compiler. According to now-day decay data the HL of
           Mg-27 is 9.435 min. So probably there is a misprint in
           article: HR -> MIN.
