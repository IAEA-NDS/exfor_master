TITLE       Interaction of 14.1 MeV neutrons with tritium
INSTITUTE  (4RUSFTI)
REFERENCE  (J,YF,1,1009,1965)

AUTHOR     (G.E.Velyukhov,A.N.Prokof'ev)
DETECTOR   (COIN,CSICR,PROPC) Cs-I(Tl) scintillating crystal and
                          two proportional counters.
           Scintillation counter resolution ~5 % .
METHOD     (COINC)
SAMPLE       T-Ti of 40 mm diameter, ~10**19 Tatoms per cm2;
            Ti layer of 0.95 mg/cm2.
            Placed at 110 mm from proportional counter, 230 mm fro
            the crystal.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,4RUSFTI)
INC-SPECT    ~(1/4PI)x10**11 n/sec.
            Absolute neutron flux was obtained by measurement of
           alpha-particles from T(d,n)alpha reaction by
           proportional counter.
ERR-ANALYS  Errors are not given
ADD-RES       Energy spectra of charge particles from n+T reaction
           are on fig.1-4 for angles 0, 10, 20 deg.
