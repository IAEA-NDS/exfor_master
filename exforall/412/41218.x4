TITLE       Total effective cross sections of Li6 and Li7 for
           neutrons with energies of 2.5 and 14 MeV.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
DETECTOR   (SCIN)     Scintillating crystals
           (PROPC) Proportional counter - for neutron flux
           monitoring by number of alpha-particles from T(d,n)He4
           reaction or by protons from D(d,p)H3 reactions.
METHOD     (TRN)
MONITOR    ((MONIT)6-C-12(N,TOT),,SIG)
ANALYSIS    Transmission T was defined as:
            T=1-(1-R)*(N0-N1)/(N0-N2), where
            R - transmission of carbon sample,
            N0 - counting rate without sample,
            N1 - counting rate with investigated sample,
            N2 - counting rate with graphite sample.
CORRECTION  Separate measurements were performed to take account
           of the effect of Al jacket.
