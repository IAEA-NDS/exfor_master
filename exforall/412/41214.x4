AUTHOR     (V.Ya.Averchenkov,A.I.Veritennikov)
TITLE       Total cross sections of U235 and Th232 for 2 to 8 MeV
            energy Neutrons.
INC-SOURCE (PO-BE) Neutrons of Po-Be source of about 2E+6 n/s .
DETECTOR   (SCIN)  Energy threshold about 1.5 MeV.
METHOD     (TOF)      Time-of-flight.
            Time resolution about 2 nsec.
           Energy resolution 8 and 16% for neutrons of 2 and 8
           MeV, respectively .
           Time scale was calibrated by gamma-gamma coincidences
           of Co-60 .
           (TRN) Transmission
SAMPLE      Disks of 40 mm diameter, 2mm high, placed at 35 cm
           distance from Po-Be source.
MONITOR     No Information
CORRECTION  Background due random coincidences was subtracted
            using measured counts with and without sample.
           For inelastic scattering - less 1.% .

           In D.Hughes+,Neutron Cross Sections,BNZ,N.Y.,1958
           data of M.Walt+ were used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)   Errors are not specified .
            Accuracy in range from 3 to 7 MeV is about 7%,
           at lower and upper energies up to 13 % .
CORRECTION For neutron elastic scattering - about 6% at 8 MeV
