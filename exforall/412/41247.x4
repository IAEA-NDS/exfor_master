REFERENCE  (J,YK,,(2),69,1996)  Main reference, data table
                                    is given
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)  Fast booster IBR-30
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight method together with gamma
                 multiplicity determination. Flight base is 60 m
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  Coaxial HP Germanium Detector, Ge-crystal

COMMENT     Of compiler M.M.
            There is an misprint in the article :
           "volume 75 m" -> "volume 75 cm**3 ",
           see Entry 41365.
