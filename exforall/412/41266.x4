            Resonance parameters used.
FACILITY   (LINAC,4RUSKUR) Neutron pulse duration 0.2 microsec,
            the width of 2048 channel time analyzer 0.25 microsec.
MONITOR     Resonance area for Cu-65 at E0=221 eV was used as
           monitor time in measurements.
SAMPLE     .Nb samples were made as metal disks 70 mm in diameter
            with less than 0.2 % Ta impurity. To avoid
            multiple scattering, one sample was split into two
            thinner samples and placed 30 mm from each other.
            Rotating sample technique with a linear velocity of
            63 m/sec was used.
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path of 37 m
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) crystals with 150 mm diameter,
           efficiency of neutron capture ~50 %,
           resolution time 0.2 microsec.
           Spectrometer resolution ~10 nsec/m.

ANALYSIS   In case of S level A- > A+, in case of P-level A-=A+,
           parameter K=2*(A- - A+)/(A- + A+) was determined,
            A- is resonance area in case of sample moving in the
           direction of the neutron beam, A+ is one for the
           opposite direction.
FLAG       (1.) Angular momentum assignment is uncertain
