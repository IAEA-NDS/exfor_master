FACILITY   (LINAC,2UK KCL) The proton linear accelerator was used.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SILI) The scattered particles were
           detected in two semiconductor counter telescopes.
SAMPLE     (2-HE-3,ENR=0.999) Pure He-3 was transferred from the
           glass vessel, in which it was supplied at 0.8 atm, by
           a simple flow inducer to attain a final pressure of 4
           atm in the target cell. Gas cell consisted of a dural
           cylinder of outer diam 7.7 cm and inner diam 5.2 cm
           into which four windows were cut so that the upper and
           lower parts of the cylinder were connected by four
           struts. The thickness of the target and solid angle for
           detection of the scattered protons was defined by two
           collimator slits on each telescope arm. All four
           collimators were approximately 2.4 mm wide by 9 mm high
