FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANMNA) The sector-focussed cyclotron was used.
INC-SOURCE The beam current was held to (7+-1)*10**3 protons/sec.
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,CSICR) Coincidence counter arrangement was
           used. Two detectors were used for registration of
           coinciding events and two for registration of
           anticoinciding ones. Fifth detector was a small
           plastic scintillator which subtends an angle at the
           target of 8.97%+-0.8 degr. and detects approximately
           98% of the beam. Sixth detector subtends an angle of
           45.51+- 0.08 degr. and detects primarily elastic
           scattering events at forward angles.

REACTION   (12-MG-24(P,NON),,SIG)
SAMPLE     Mg-24 target of 99% enrichment with the thickness of
           39.3+-0.2 mg/cm2 was used. The target was transferred
           to the apparatus in an argon atmosphere and surface
           contamination with oxygen or nitrogen was estimated to
           be less than 1% by weight, which would have little
           effect on the final results.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The principle uncertainties arise from the
           necessity to extrapolate the data to 0 degr. and to
           interpolate the integrated cross sections to energies
           for which data do not exist. A total error of + - 20%
           has been assigned to the (p,inl) correction of which
           about 15% comes from the extrapolation and 12% from the
           data. Other reactions individually produce corrections
           of only a few percent of the (p,inl) correction.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)An uncertainty of 20% was assigned to elastic
           scattering correction. A correction of 9 + -3 mb was
           chosen for inelastic scattering events at all incident

           p,alpha reaction at all incident proton energies.
