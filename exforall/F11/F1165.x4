FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANMNA) The sector-focussed cyclotron was used.
INC-SOURCE The beam current was held to (7+-1)*10**3 protons/sec.
DETECTOR   (COIN) Coincidence counter arrangement was used.Two
           detectors were used for registration of coinciding
           events and two for registration of anticoinciding
           ones.
           (SCIN) Fifth detector was a small plastic scintillator
           which subtends an angle at the target of 8.97%+-0.8
           degr. and detects approximately 98% of the beam.
           (CSICR) Sextic detector subtends an angle of 45.51+-
           0.08 degr. and detects primarily elastic scattering
           events at forward angles.

REACTION   (12-MG-24(P,X)1-H-1,,SIG)
SAMPLE     Mg-24 target of 99% enrichment with the thickness of
           39.3+-0.2 mg/cm2 was used. The target was transferred
           to the apparatus in an argon atmosphere and surface
           contamination with oxygen or nitrogen was estimated to
           be less than 1% by weight, which would have little
           effect on the final results.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The principle uncertainties arise from the
           necessity to extrapolate the data to 0 degr. and to
           interpolate the integrated cross sections to energies
           for which data do not exist. A total  error of + - 20%
           has been assigned to the (p,inl) correction of which
           about 15% comes from the extrapolation and 12% from the
           data. Other reactions individually produce corrections
           of only a few percent of the (p,inl) correction.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)The (p,inl) correction carries an uncertainty
