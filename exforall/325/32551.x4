MONITOR    (28-NI-58(N,P)27-CO-58,,SIG)    Monit1
           (26-FE-56(N,P)25-MN-56,,SIG)    Monit2
           (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196,,SIG) Monit3
           (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)    Monit4
           Monit1 and Monit2 were corrected for the contribution
           from D-d low energy neutron by gas in and gas out runs
           in the energy range of 5 to 7 Mev. In 8 to 12 MeV
           range, a group monitors was selected with different
           threshold, such as Monit1 to Monit4, and irradiated
           with Mo sample together. The neutron energy above
           14 MeV, Monit2 and Monit4 were used to reduce the
           effect of D-d low energy neutron. In high energy range
           of 17.30 and 19.09 MeV the Monit4 was used to determine
           the neutron flux.

SAMPLE     Natural metal molybdenum plate is 20mm in diameter and
           1mm in thickness. The samples were irradiated in the 0
           degree direction relative to incident particles.
           The irradiation time was 4 to 9 hours and the distance
           between the samples and the neutron source was 2 to
           4 cm.
CORRECTION In all the measurements, the corrections were made for
           the fluctuation of the neutron flux during the
           irradiation. The count rates of Ge(Li) gamma-ray
           spectroscopy were corrected for the gamma-ray self-
           absorption in sample and the cascade effect. The
           correction is 10% at 19 Mev neutron energy.
ERR-ANALYS The principal sources of error are as follows:
           - the efficiency of gamma-ray detector
           - the cross section of monitors
           - counting statistics
           - correction for the gamma-ray self-absorption in
             sample
           - correction for the effect of low energy neutron
