           WALTON ACCELERATOR.
           ABOVE 15 MEV, NEUTRONS PRODUCED BY VAN DE GRAAFF
SAMPLE     NATURAL NICKEL METAL DISK, DIAMETER=20MM,PURITY BETTER
           THAN 99.9 PERCENT. IN GENERAL THE WEIGHT WAS ABOUT 500
           MILLI-GRAM, THICKNESS ABOUT 0.2 MM, BUT FOR 14.09 AND
           14.77 MEV, THE WEIGHT WAS 5400 MILLI-GRAM, AND THICK-
           NESS 2 MM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 136 CM3 GE-LI DETECTOR WAS USED FOR GAMMA
           RAY (FROM RESIDUAL NUCLEUS) MEASUREMENT.
           GAMMA-RAY STANDARD SOURCES SERIES WITH GAMMA
           ENERGY FROM 0.1 MEV TO 1.5 MEV WAS USED FOR DETECTOR
           EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION, THE EFFICIENCY CURVE OBTAINED
           BY LEAST-SQUARE METHOD CALCULATION.
