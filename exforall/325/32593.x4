INC-SOURCE (D-T) En=13-15 MeV, neutrons produced by Cockcroft-
           Walton accelerator.
           Above 15 MeV, neutrons produced by Van de Graaff
SAMPLE     Natural nickel metal disk, diameter=20mm,purity better
           than 99.9%. In general the weight was about 500 milli-
           gram, thickness about 0.2 mm, but for 14.09 and
           14.77 MeV, the weight was 5400 milli-gram, and thick-
           ness 2 mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 136 cm3 Ge-Li detector was used for gamma
           ray (from residual nucleus) measurement.
           Gamma-ray standard sources series with gamma
           energy from 0.1 MeV to 1.5 MeV was used for detector
           efficiency calibration, the efficiency curve obtained
           by least-square method calculation.
