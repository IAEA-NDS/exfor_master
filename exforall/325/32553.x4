TITLE      Measurement of fission yield of Cs-135 from thermal
           neutron induced fission of U-235 by neutron activation
           analysis
FACILITY   (REAC) Heavy-water reactor
INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons from heavy-water reflecting layer
           channel. The epithermal parameter was 0.02980 and the
           error was 0.00103. The neutron flux density was
           3.99e+13cm2s.
METHOD     (RCHEM,ACTIV) Fission products were separated from the
           U-235 irradiation samples by radiochemical separation
           method and weighted for determination of the chemical
           recovery factor.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A 143cm3 high-purity germanium detector with
           resolution (FWHM) 1.78keV at 1332keV gamma ray of
           Co-60 was used for gamma measurement.
           By energy-efficiency curve, the efficiency of Cs-136
           Cs-137 and Au-198 were as follows:
           Nucleus   Gamma-energy(kev)   Purity(%)   Efficiency(%)
           Cs-137    661.6               85.1        1.27
           Au-198    441.8               94.7        1.71
           Cs-136    818.5              100.0        1.08
                     340.6               44.5        1.84
                    1048.1               80.5        0.91
           The geometrical efficiency of recoil-catch was
           approximate 40% for Cs-137 and Cs-135.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
           (92-U-235(N,F)55-CS-137,IND,FY,,FIS)
SAMPLE     Aluminium is used underlaying of uranium. Uranium were
           269mm2 in active area (18.5mm in diameter)and 100ug
           in weight. The irradiation time was 66.0 hours.
           The aluminium catcher was 50mg/cm2 in mass thickness
           and 27.0mm in diameter, a aluminium circle was settled
           on its surface and covered with two aluminium foils
           on the circle.
ERR-ANALYS 1. The error from monitor were as follows:
            -  1.7%   neutron flux density
            -  0.3%   counting statistics
            -  0.2%   Au-197 standard solution sampling
            -  0.8%   other error of Au-197 targets were
                      irradiated in the same time
            -  1.0%   efficiency for Au-198
            -  0.5%   density of Au-197 solution
            -  0.3%   activation cross section for Au-197
           2. Activity of Cs-136 in Al catcher
            -  0.8%   counting statistics
            -  1.0%   detector efficiency
            -  1.7%   neutron flux density
            -  5.7%   activation cross section
            Total error was 6.1%.
           3. Activity of Cs-137 in Al catcher
            -  0.1%   counting statistics
            -  1.0%   detector efficiency
            Total error was 1.1%.
