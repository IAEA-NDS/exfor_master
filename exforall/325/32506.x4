TITLE      The measurement of fast neutron radiative capture
           cross sections of natural terbium and hafnium
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRSIU) Sichuan university pulsed Van de Graff
           accelerator.Resolution time 10 ns,F= 2 MHz,
                                     average I=2-4 micro a.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)
SAMPLE     Disk,diameter 9cm,purity 99.9%.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy is determined with TOF method.
           Neutron flux is monitored with long counter.
DETECTOR   (SCIN,LONGC)
           Capture detector: a large scintillator,shaped in appro-
           ximate sphere,diameter 1.0m.
           Monitor: long counter.
           Neutron detector: a small scintillator.

MONIT-REF  (,Jiang+,R,HSJ-81183,1981)
CORRECTION Multiple scattering,calculated with Monte-Carlo method
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors are +- 11-12%,
            contributed from (in %):
           (ERR-1) extrapolation to zero pulse height (8),
           (MONIT-ERR) standard cross sections (7),
           (ERR-2) correction of multiple scattering in sample (2)
           (ERR-3) efficiency of detector (2),
           (ERR-4,3.,4.) counting statistics (3-4).
