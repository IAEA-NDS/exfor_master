TITLE      Measurement of the neutron capture cross section of
           Ta-181
FACILITY   (VDG) PULSED 2.5 MEV VAN DE GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The thick Li-7 targets were 1mg/cm2 in thick-
           ness. Tantalum was used underlying of target and 0.2mm
           in thickness. The neutron beam was kinematically
           collimated neutron.
SAMPLE     The metal sample parameters are as following:
           sample  weight    thickness    thickness  purify
                   (grams)   (atom/b)      (mm)      (%)
           Au      4.7607    1.158e-3      0.25      99.9
           Ta      6.3572    1.683e-3      0.30      99.9
           C       2.3834    9.542e-3      1.40
METHOD     (TOF) The prompt gamma ray was measured with Moxon-Rae
           detector, neutron energy was determined by TOF method
DETECTOR   (MOXR) Moxon-Rae detector for gamma detection ,neutron
           spectrum measured by Li-6 glass scintillation detector.
           At distances 1.7m away from the target and at angles
           20 degrees to the neutron beam direction, using a long
           neutron counter for monitoring neutron flux.

CORRECTION The difference of neutron energy spectrum were correct-
           ed for the changes of proton energy, thickness of
           targets and cooling water. The correction were 1.033-
           1.069, 0.976-0.985 in multi-scattering, self-screenage,
           respectively. The correction factor of gamma ray self-
           absorption was 0.98. The correction of Moxon-Rae
           detector efficiency departure linearity was 1.022.
ERR-ANALYS The system error of Ta-181 were result from:
           1. 0.9%-7.0%,  distance of flight
           2. 1.0%-1.5%,  background
           3.      0.7%,  multi-scattering and self-absorption
           4.      0.4%,  gamma self-absorption
           The system error of Au-197 were result from:
           1. 1.3%-6.0%,  distance of flight
           2. 1.0%-2.0%,  background
           3.      0.7%,  multi-scattering and self-absorption
           4.      0.4%,  gamma self-absorption
           5. 0.5%-1.5%,  neutron energy spectrum
           6.      1.0%,  efficiency of detector
           7. 3.0%-4.0%,  standard cross section
