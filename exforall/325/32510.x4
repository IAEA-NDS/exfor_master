TITLE      THE PROMPT NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM FROM THE
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252
METHOD     (TOF)FLIGHT PATH WERE 2.0,2.5 AND 3.0 M RESPECTIVELY,
           ZERO-TIME SIGNAL FROM FISSION FRAGMENT,WHILE NEUTRON
           TIMING SIGNAL WAS OBTAINED FROM A FAST RESPONSE
           NEUTRON DETECTOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           1: LIQUILD   SCINTILLATOR  (THICKNESS=50MM ,
           DIAMETER=104MM) AND XP2040 PHOTO-MULTIPLIER FOR NEUTRO
           DETECTION
           2: PLASTIC  SCINTILLATOR (THICKNESS=4.5 MICRO METER,
           DIAMETER=30MM) AND 56AVP PHOTO-MULTIPLIER FOR FISSION
           FRAGMENT DETECTION
SAMPLE     ELECTRO-PLATED CF-252,DIAMETER=8MM,INTENSITY ABOUT
           1.2*E+5 FISSION/SECOND
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)
PART-DET   (PN)PROMPT NEUTRONS FROM SPONTANEOUS FISSION
           (SF)FRAGMENT FROM SPONTANEOUS FISSION
ANALYSIS   ENERGY SPECTRUM OF PROMPT NEUTRONS FROM CF-252
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION WAS MEASURED FOR ENERGY RANGE 0.9
           TO 14.5 MEV. THREE DATA SETS OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT
           FLIGHT PATH WERE FITTED TO A 'MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTION'
           RESPECTIVELY, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUE WAS
           T=1.418+-0.015 MEV.
CORRECTION CORRECTION APPLIED FOR:
           1:RANDOM BACKGROUND
           2:SCATTERING  BACKGROUND
           3:DELAYED GAMMA RAY AND DELAYED NEUTRON EFFECT
           4:CHANNEL SHIFT EFFECT
