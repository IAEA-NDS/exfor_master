TITLE      The prompt neutron energy spectrum from the
           spontaneous fission of Cf-252

METHOD     (TOF)Flight path were 2.0,2.5 and 3.0 m respectively,
           zero-time signal from fission fragment,while neutron
           timing signal was obtained from a fast response
           neutron detector
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           1: liquid   scintillator  (thickness=50mm ,
           diameter=104mm) and XP2040 photo-multiplier for neutro
           detection
           2: plastic  scintillator (thickness=4.5 micro meter,
           diameter=30mm) and 56AVP photo-multiplier for fission
           fragment detection
SAMPLE     Electro-plated Cf-252,diameter=8mm,intensity about
           1.2 x 10**5 fission/second
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG)

ANALYSIS   Energy spectrum of prompt neutrons from Cf-252
           spontaneous fission was measured for energy range 0.9
           to 14.5 MeV. Three data sets obtained from different
           flight path were fitted to a 'Maxwellian distribution'
           respectively, and the weighted average value was
           t=1.418+-0.015 MeV.
CORRECTION Correction applied for:
           1:random background
           2:scattering  background
           3:delayed gamma ray and delayed neutron effect
           4:channel shift effect
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 2 of Chin. J.Phys,10,(4),
           346,1988. This result slightly differs from earlier
           work of the same author,see Chin.J.Phys,3,(2),163,1981,
           also see EXFOR30610, in which the average energy was
           given. This entry replaces the earlier entry 30610
