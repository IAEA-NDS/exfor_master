TITLE      THE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT FOR THE CU-63(N,A)CO-60
             REACTION
FACILITY   (CCW) ZF-300-2 INTENSE NEUTRON GENERATOR OF LNZ
INC-SOURCE (D-T) T-TI TARGET WITH THICKNESS = 0.9MG/CM**2
           AVERAGE DEUTERON ENERGY = 125KEV
           BEAM CURRENT INTENSITY = 20MA
           NEUTRON YIELD = (1-3)E12 N/SEC
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
DECAY-MON  (11-NA-24,14.659HR,DG,1368.598)
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) CH8403 COAXIAL HIGH PURITY GE(LI) DET.
           RELATIVE EFFICIENCY WAS 20 PER-CENT
           ENERGY RESOLUTION WAS 3KEV(1.33MEV)
SAMPLE     NATURAL COPPER SAMPLES WITH 0.45MM*20MM DIAMETER
           WERE PLACED AT DIFFERENT ANGLES RELATIVE TO BEAM
           DIRECTION AND CENTERED AT BEAM STOP ON THE T-TI TARGET
           WITH DISTANCES BETWEEN 10-28CM, RESPECTIVELY.
           CU SAMPLES WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO AL FOILS WITH
           0.1*20MM DIAMETER. SAMPLE PURITY WAS 99.999 PER-CENT
ERR-ANALYS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY WERE:
