TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF ACTIVATION CROSS SECTION FOR
           HF-179(N,2N)HF-178M2 REACTION
FACILITY   (CCW) THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED AT THE COCKCROFT-
           WALTON ACCELERATOR OF CIAE AND THE INTENSE NEUTRON
           GENERATOR OF LANGHOU UNIVERSITY
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     THE HF DISCS WERE MADE OF NATURAL OXIDE HAFNIUM POWDER
           BY PRESSING, DIAMETER=20 MM, THICKNESS=2MM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 136 CM3 GE-LI DETECTOR WAS USED FOR GAMMA-RAY
           DETECTION.
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
           NIOBIUM FOILS WITH 20 MM IN DIAMETER AND 0.05 MM IN
           THICKNESS.
