AUTHOR     (Yu Weixiang,Lu Hanlin,Zhao Wenrong)
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRAEP) The samples were irradiated at the
           Cockcroft- Walton accelerator of CIEA and
           (NGEN,3CPRLNZ) the intense neutron
           generator of Langhou University
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     The Hf discs were made of natural oxide hafnium powder
           by pressing, diameter=20 mm, thickness=2mm.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 136 cm3 Ge-Li detector was used for gamma-ray
           detection.
MONITOR    (41-NB-93(N,2N)41-NB-92-M,,SIG)
           Niobium foils with 20 mm in diameter and 0.05 mm in
           thickness.
