INC-SOURCE (D-T) En=13-15 MeV neutrons produced by 200 keV
           deuterons from Cockcroft-Walton accelerator bombarding
           the titanium tritide target.
           Below 13 MeV and above 15 MeV neutrons produced by
           Van de Graaff.
SAMPLE     Natural cobalt, purity better than 99.9%,
           diameter=20 mm, thickness about 1.1 mm, weight about
           2900 mg.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 130 cm3 Ge-Li detector was used for gamma ray
           from residual nuclei measurement, gamma-ray standard
           sources series with gamma energy from 0.1 MeV to 1.5MeV
           was used for detector efficiency calibration, the
           efficiency curve was obtained by the Least-Square
           method.
