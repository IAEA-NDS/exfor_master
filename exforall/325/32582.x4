           (W,WANG,199304) private communication
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRSIU) pulsed 2.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator
INC-SOURCE Samples were irradiated simultaneously at 0, 30, 60,
            90 and 120 degrees with respect to proton beam.
           (P-LI7) En=29-230 keV neutrons
           (P-T)   En=215-1100 keV neutrons
SAMPLE     Ho2O3 powder (99.9% pure) pressed in disks (20 mm
            in diameter).
           The samples were sandwiched between two Au foils with
            thickness 0.1 mm, wrapped in 0.3 mm thick Cd foils
METHOD     (ACTIV) gamma detection after 2 months cooling
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Energy resolution of 2.1 keV at 1332 keV,
            efficiency calibrated with standard gamma sources
CORRECTION Corrected for neutron scattering and attenuation
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total 20.5%,including:
           (ERR-S) counting statistics           (~19.6%)
