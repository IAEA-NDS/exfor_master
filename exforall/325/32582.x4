TITLE      ACTIVATION CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENT FOR THE
           HO-165(N,G)HO-166M REACTION.
FACILITY   (VDG) SICHUAN UNIVERSITY PULSED 2.5 MV VAN DE GRAAFF
           ACCELERATOR
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7,P-T)29-230 KEV AND 215-1100 KEV NEUTRONS WERE
           PRODUCED BY LI-7(P,N) AND T(P,N) REACTION RESPECTIVELY
           THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT 0, 30,
           60, 90 AND 120 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT
           PROTON BEAM.
SAMPLE     99.9% PURE HO2O3 POWDER PROCESSED INTO THIN DISKS. THE
           DIAMETER IS 20 MM. THE SAMPLES WERE SANDWICHED BETWEEN
           TWO GOLD FOILS WITH THICKNESS 0.1 MM, WRAPPED IN 0.3
           MM THICK CADMIUM FOILS.
METHOD     (ACTIV) THE INDUCED GAMMA-RAY WAS DETECTED AFTER 2
           MONTHS COOLING.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)ORTEC GEM-30195 HPGE DETECTOR.THE ENERGY RESOLU-
           TION IS 2.1 KEV FOR 1332 KEV CO-60 PEAK.THE EFFICIENCY
           WAS CALIBRATED WITH AM-241,CD-109,CO-57,MN-54,ZN-65,
           EU-152,CO-60,AND NA-22 STANDARD GAMMA SOURCES.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG) THE DATA WERE TAKEN FROM
           ENDF/B-6.
