DECAY-DATA (29-CU-59,82.SEC,DG,878.,,
                            DG,1302.)
METHOD     (ACTIV,SITA,BCINT)
SAMPLE     Ni-58 target, 2.88 x 10**19 atom/cm**2 thickness, were
           prepared by evaporation of metallic nickel powder,
           isotopically enriched to 99.76% in Ni-58,
           on to 0.25 mm gold backings. The target was made
           sufficiently thick to straddle at least ten
           resonances in the (p,gamma) reaction over most of the
           range of bombarding energies to allow a meaningful
           visual comparison of the data with the predictions of
           the statistical model.
COMMENT    /By authors/ Cu-59 decays 42% to excited states of
           Ni-59 and the Ni-58(p,gamma)Cu-59 cross section
           was deduced from the yield of the resulting 878 and
           1302 keV gamma-rays accumulated over the 30 min
           bombarding period at each energy and for 10 min
           thereafter.

METHOD     (SITA,BCINT)
COMMENT    /By authors/ There data were measured by direct
           counting of gamma-rays. The cross section was
           obtained from excitation functions of four strong
           gamma-ray lines corresponding to the ground-state
           transitions in Cu-59.
SAMPLE     Ni-58 target, 2.88 x 10**19 atom/cm**2 thickness, was
           prepared by evaporation of metallic nickel powder,
           isotopically enriched to 99.76% in Ni-58, on
           to 0.25 mm gold backing. The target was made

REACTION   (28-NI-58(P,INL)28-NI-58,,SIG,G)
METHOD     (SITA,BCINT)
SAMPLE     Ni-58 target, 4.68 x 10**18 atom/cm**2 thickness, was
           prepared by evaporation of metallic nickel powder,
           isotopically enriched to 99.76% in Ni-58, on to
           0.25 mm gold backings. Target was made sufficiently
           thin that the cross sections data would always provide
           at least ten points in the Gamow peak for thermo-
           nuclear-reaction-rate calculations at all temperatures
           of astrophysical interest.
COMMENT    /By authors/ The cross section for the reaction
           58Ni(p,p'+gamma)58Ni shown at the fig.3. The 1454 keV
           1-0 transition from this reaction dominated the
           gamma-ray spectra for bombarding energies above 3 MeV
           other ground-state transitions represented less than
           1% of the total and the excitation function of the
           1454 keV line was taken as a reliable measure of the
           total (p,p'+gamma) cross section.
