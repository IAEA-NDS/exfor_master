TITLE      Alpha and Neutron Induced Reactions on Ruthenium
REFERENCE  (J,NP/A,688,427,2001)
           Similar Paper Which Contains Neutoron Cross Section Too
           Was Submitted to Phys. Rev. C

SAMPLE     A Series of Targets was Prepared by Sputtering 80
           Nanometers to 500 Nanometers Thick Layers of Natural
           Ruthenium onto 1 Millimeters Thick Tungten Backings.
           The Target Thickness was Determined Independently by
           X-Ray Fluorescence and by Rutherford Backscattering.
           With the Technique the Sample Thickness Could be
           Determined to 3.5% Accuracy.
           The Gamma-Ray Spectra Showed Prominent Background Lines
           From K-43 and K-38 Due to Ar-40(ALPHA,P)K-43 and
           Ar-36(ALPHA,N+P)K-38 Reactions.  The Strength of these
           Lines Being Independent of the Sample Thickness
           Indicates That Argon had Diffused Into the Tungsten
           Backings During Sputtering. Activation of the Tungsten
           Backings was not Observed.

CORRECTION Summing Corrections of 26.2% and 26.6% Due to the
           Coincident Detection of the Accompanying Cascade
           Transitions  were Determined with the Monte Carlo Code.
           Since Pd-100 Decays Via Electron Capture, Additional
           Summing Corrections of 15% Due to the Coincident
           K/Alpha and K/Beta X-Rays had to be Considered As Well.
           These Corrections were Deduced Directly from the
           Gamma-Spectra As and were Therefore Independent of
           Detector Efficiency and Absorption Effects in the
           Sample and in the Detector Window.

CORRECTION In this Case Gamma-Cascade Corrections of 8.3% and 9.9%
           Were Calculated For the Coincident Gamma-Transitions,
           While the X-Ray Summing Corrections of 7% were Taken
           Directly from the Measured Spectra.  Additional
           Corrections of 4% Due to Coincidences Between the 136
           KeV Gamma-Line and the 511 KeV Gamma-Line from Positron
           Annihilation were Also Directly Derived from the
           Spectra.
COMMENT    - By Authors:  Two Activations with Different Samples
           Were Carried Out at 10.118 MeV Alpha-Energy.  The Good
           Agreement of Both Results Confirms the Procedures and
           Corrections Adopted in Data Analysis.

           Ru-96(A,N)Pd-99(EC)Rh-99 had to be Properly Corrected

           Spectra.
