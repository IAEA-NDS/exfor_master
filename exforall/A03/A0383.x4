COMMENT    /By authors/ In the Aarhus and Jyvaskyla measurements
           the irradiations were performed in vacuum and the
           beam was dumped away from the target. In the Turku
           measurements the target was mounted directly on a
           graphite beam-stop just after a thin steel window which
           terminated the beam line.
           /By authors/ The results Th-232(p,gamma)Pa-233 still
           had to be corrected for the effects of neutron capture
           in the target of neutrons produced inside the target
           volume. The contributing processes are the (p,n),
           (p,2n), (p,3n) and (p,f) reactions on Th-232.
            A correction for the influence of the (p,xn) reactions
           was calculated with the assumption of a compound
           nucleus energy spectrum of the neutrons and with the
           cross sections given in Celler et al.(see MONIT-REF).

COMMENT    /By authors/ The relative fission cross sections were
           obtained via a normalization to the K-shell ionization
           cross sections used also by Celler et.al (see
           MONIT-REF). The resulting relative fission yield
           curve was transformed into an absolute excitation
           function by normalization to the excitation function
           of Kurcewicz et al., see REL-REF.
