TITLE      REACTION HE-2(HE3,G)LI-5 AT CENTER-OF -MASS ENERGIES
           BETWEEN 25 AND 60 MEV.
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USACSM)
SAMPLE     THICK,DEUTERATED POLYETHYLENE TARGET WITH SINGLY
           IONIZED HE3 IONS.
METHOD     (SITA)
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)
           (4PI1A).THE CENTER-OF-MASS ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF
           BOTH THE GAMMA RAYS AND THE CHARGED PARTICLES WERE
           ASSUMED ISOTROPIC.
COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.THE GAMMA RAY TO PROTON BRANCHING RATIO,
           OF THE H-2+HE3 REACTION HAS BEEN MEASURED BETWEEN
           CENTER-OF-MASS ENERGIES OF 25 AND 60 KEV.THE RATIO
           OF THE GROUND-STATE GAMMA REACTION H2(HE3,G)LI-5
           TO THE DOMINANT REACTION H-2(HE3,P)HE-4 IS OBSERVED
           TO BE ROUNDLY CONSTANT OVER THIS ENERGY RANGE WITH
           A BEST VALUE OF (4.5+1.2)*10E-5.THIS RATIO FOR THE
           GAMMA-RAY REACTION TO THE LI-5 FIRST EXCITED STATE
           IS MEASURED TO HAVE A VALUE OF (8+3)*10E-5.THE
           EXCITATION ENERGY OF THE FIRST EXCITED STATE IS
           ESTIMATED TO BE 3.0+1.0 MEV.
