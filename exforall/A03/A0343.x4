TITLE      Reaction H-2(He3,gamma)Li-5 at center-of-mass
           energies between 25 and 60 keV
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USACSM)
SAMPLE     Thick,deuterated polyethylene target with singly
           ionized He3 ions.
METHOD     (SITA)
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)
           (4PI1A).The center-of-mass angular distributions of
           both the gamma rays and the charged particles were
           assumed isotropic.
COMMENT    /By authors/.the gamma ray to proton branching ratio,
           of the H-2+He3 reaction has been measured between
           center-of-mass energies of 25 and 60 keV.The ratio
           of the ground-state gamma reaction H2(He3,g)Li-5
           to the dominant reaction H-2(He3,p)He-4 is observed
           to be roundly constant over this energy range with
           a best value of (4.5+1.2)*10E-5. This ratio for the
           gamma-ray reaction to the Li-5 first excited state
           is measured to have a value of (8+3)*10E-5. The
           excitation energy of the first excited state is
           estimated to be 3.0+1.0 MeV.

COMMENT    /By authors/.the He-3(d,g)Li-5 reaction has been
           proposed as a diagnostic of high temperature d-He3
           plasmas.
