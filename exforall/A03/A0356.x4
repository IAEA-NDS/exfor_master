METHOD     (SITA,TOF,PSD,BCINT)
            The incident deuteron beam was monitored using a
           current integrator connected to the target cell.
SAMPLE      The gas target cell was 1.0 cm in diam. with a length
           of 2 cm. The entrance window consisted of a molybdenum
           foil with a thickness of 5.3 mg/cm . The downstream end
           of the target cell contained a beam stop of gold.
DETECTOR   (SCIN).NE-213 scintillation counter was used for
            neutrons.
           (SCIN)7.6 cm diam. by 7.6 cm bismuth germinate
           crystals (BGO) was used for gamma-rays.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty in the result was
           estimated to be about 11.4%.
           (ERR-2).the uncertainty in the neutron measurements.
           (ERR-3).BGO efficiency determination.
           (ERR-4).Counting statistics in foreground and
           background.
