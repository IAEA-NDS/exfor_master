COMMENT    -Abstract:  Angular Distributions of a
           6-Li(P,ALPHA)3-He Reaction were Measured at Six Angles
           For 140 KeV Proton Energy Using Nuclear Track
           Detectors.  The Measurements were Carried Out Over
           60-160 Lab. Angles in 20 Increments Using a Scattering
           Chamber of Beam Line of the 350 Kv  Accelerator.
           Semiconductor Silicon Surface Barrier Detector was
           Placed at +160 Degrees and was Used As a Monitor. The
           Results have Shown That the Cr-39 Detector has
           Excellent Capabilities to Distinguish 1.4-2.7 MeV Alpha
           + 3-He Particles from the Reaction and 8-9.4 MeV
           Alpha-Particles from the 7-Li(P,A)4-He Reaction Through
           Their Track Diameters.  However,It was not Possible to
           Distinguish Between the 2.3 MeV 3-He Ions and the 1.7
           MeV 4-He Ions from the 6-Li(P,A)3-He Reaction from
           Their Track Diameter Measurements, But It was Possible
           To Differentiate Between the Two, from the Darker
           Contrast of the 3-He Particles Caused by Its Deeper
           Tracks As Compared to Those of 4-He.
SAMPLE     The Lithium Targets were Prepared by Evaporating 2400
           Angstrom Thick Li-F Layers on 1.5 Millimeters Thick
           Tantalum Sheets.
