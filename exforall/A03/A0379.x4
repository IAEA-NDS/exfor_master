COMMENT    Abstract:  we give the LUNA results on the cross
           section measurement of a key reaction of the proton-
           proton chain strongly affecting the calculated neutrino
           luminosity from the sun:  3-He(3-HE,2P)4-He .  Because
           of the cosmic ray suppression provided by the Gran
            Sasso underground laboratory, it has been possible to
           measure cross section throughout the energy range in
           which this reaction occurs in the sun, I.E., Down to
           16.5 KeV center of mass energy.  The data clearly show
           the cross section increase due to the electron
           screening effect but they do not exhibit any evidence
           for a narrow resonance suggested to explain the 8-B and
            7-Be solar neutrino flux reduction.
SAMPLE     3-He gas target
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Eight thick (1 millimeter) detectors of 5*5
           cm**2 area placed around the beam
FACILITY   (ACCEL,2ITYLGS)
METHOD     (SITA)
           (EXTB)
           (BCINT) Beam current was measured by calorimeter.
           (COINC) Selected events must fulfill the following
           conditions:
           1. There is a coincidence, within 1 microsecond,
           between the signal of two silicon detectors.
           2. Each proton deposits more than 2 MeV in the detector
           and the sum of the two proton energies is within the
           constraints given by the Q-Value, 12.86 MeV, of the
           reaction.
           3. The coincidence occurs between two, and only two,
           detectors.
           Detection efficiency was determined by Monte Carlo
           programm as 5.3% +/- 0.2%
HISTORY    (20020709C)
           (20021217U) Last checking has been done.

REACTION   (2-HE-3(HE3,2P)2-HE-4,,SIG,,SFC)
MISC-COL   (MISC1) Centre of mass energy derived from the absolute
           energy of the ion beam and the Monte Carlo simulation,
           including the energy loss of the beam inside the target
           gas and the effects of the extended gas-target and
           detector geometry.
           (MISC2) Total charge (in coulombs) of 3-He ions ran
           across gas target
           (MISC3) Number of detected reactions.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical error, one standard deviation
           (ERR-1) Systematical error, one standard deviation
           the systematical error arising mainly from the 10%
           uncertaintly in the beam energy loss inside the target.
COMMENT    - By compiler. Effective beam particle energy was
           calculated by compiler.
