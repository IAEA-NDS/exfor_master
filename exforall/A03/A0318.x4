TITLE      A comparative investigation of nuclear reactions
           leading to the formation of short-lived 30P and
           optimization of its production via the 27Al(alpha,n)30P
           process at a compact cyclotron

COMMENT    /By authors/ In the case of 30P, which only gives
           rise to annihilation radiation, it was really 2,5 min
           30P and not 2.03 min O-15. Therefore, besides gamma-
           ray spectroscopy, counting of positrons above 2.0 MeV
           /i.e. above the cut-off energy of the positrons from
           O-15/ was also applied. Both the counting methods
           gave similar results, confirming thereby that the
           activity under investigation was pure 30P.

SAMPLE     Each Si-foil piece was mounted on a Ti-foil (purity
           99.6%, thickness 20 mum, diameter 13 mm) by
           fixing it with glue at two peripheral points of the
           Ti-foil. As a further support to the Si-foil, a 2 mm
           broad Al-ring was fixed at the periphery of the
           Si-foil.

SAMPLE     By converting ordinary sulphur (purity 99.9999%) into
           plastic sulphur (through melting and pouring into
           water) and subsequent pressing at a pressure of 2.5

           mm) it was possible to obtain 'S'-pellet on Ti-foil
           was further supported by fixing a 2 mm broad Al-ring
           at the periphery of the 'S-'pellet. These samples

           over several days. Nonetheless, all the samples were
           prepared freshly prior to each irradiation.
