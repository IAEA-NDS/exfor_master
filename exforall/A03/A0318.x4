TITLE      A COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF NUCLEAR REACTIONS
           LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF SHORT-LIVED P-30 AND
           OPTIMIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTION VIA THE AL-27(A,N)P-30
           PROCESS AT A COMPACT CYCLOTRON.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/. IN THE CASE OF P-30, WHICH ONLY GIVES
           RISE TO ANNIHILATION RADIATION, IT WAS REALLY 2,5 MIN
           P-30 AND NOT 2.03 MIN O-15. THEREFORE, BESIDES GAMMA-
           RAY SPECTROSCOPY, COUNTING OF POSITRONS ABOVE 2.0 MEV
           /I.E.ABOVE THE CUT-OFF ENERGY OF THE POSITRONS FROM
           O-15/ WAS ALSO APPLIED. BOTH THE COUNTING METHODS
           GAVE SIMILAR RESULTS, CONFIRMING THEREBY THAT THE
           ACTIVITY UNDER INVESTIGATION WAS PURE P-30.
