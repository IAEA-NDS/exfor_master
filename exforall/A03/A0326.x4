ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Overall errors are typically of the order
           of 12%, although relative errors for comparative yields
           from the various reactions would be considerably
           smaller, since systematic uncertainties in detector
           efficiencies and nuclear decay properties
           would be removed.
           (ERR-1,,10.) Uncertainty in the dead time losses.
           (ERR-S,3.,5.) The counting error at the 95.5%
           confidence level for 123Xe and 123I was less than 3%.
           For 125Xe(125I) the error was 5%.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainties in the irradiation parameters
           resulting from any lack of uniformity in the tellurium
           thickness, and specifically from heterogeneous
           distribution, if any, with time and place of the
           incident beam density.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in the energy beam

COMMENT    /By authors/ The cross sections for 20-45 MeV He3 and
           alpha and the corresponding reactions-
           Cu-65(He3,2n+p)30-Zn-65 and Cu-63(alpha,n+p)30-Zn-65.
           have been accurately measured.
           /By authors/ Cyclotron production of Xe-123 from
           isotopically enriched tellurium targets was evaluated
           as a source of high purity I-123 for
           radiopharmaceutical applications.
           The Te-123(He3,3n)Xe-123 and the Te-124(He3,4n)Xe-123
           nuclear reactions have cross sections peaks of 178 mb
           and 162 mb at 26 MeV and 45 MeV, respectively.
           The Xe-123 thick target production yields for the
           reactions were 6.44 mci/muAhr and 7.16 mCi/muAhr
           respectively, as compared to large 5 mCi/muAhr for
           the Te-122(a,3n)Xe-123 reaction.
