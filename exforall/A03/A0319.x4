TITLE      Excitation functions for 3-He and alpha-induced
           reactions with 107-Ag and 109-Ag.
AUTHOR     (P.Misaelides,H.Munzel)

FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV)
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Two Ge(Li)-detectors having an effective volume
           of 42 and 27 cm3. The corresponding resolution was
           2.15 and 2.85 keV for the 1.332 MeV peak of 60Co.
ANALYSIS   With the natural silver foils the sum of the excitation
           functions of the reactions of both silver isotopes
           leading to the same reaction products was determined.
           Subtracting from this sum the contribution of the
           reactions with Ag-107, determined by irradiations of
           enriched Ag-107 foils, the excitation functions of the
           corresponding reactions on Ag-109 were obtained.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainty due to foil thickness;
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty due to beam current;
           (ERR-3) The uncertainty due to detector efficiency;
            * the analysis of the gamma-ray spectra.
             The uncertainty due to the analysis of the gamma-
           spectra differs from case to case. Much greater
           uncertainties were taken into account in those cases
           where complex peak evaluation and subtraction of
           activities could not be avoided during the calculation
           of the cross sections. In many of these cases only a
           rough lower limit estimation of the error could be
           given.

           the metastable state (T1/2=7.2 m). The metastable state
           having no intensive gamma-rays was not measured.
           The cross sections calculated are the sum of the cross
           sections of both states.

           the calculation of the cross sections.
