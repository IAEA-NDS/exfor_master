FACILITY   (VDGT,1USABNL)
DETECTOR   (NAICR).The absolute disintegration rates were
           determined by in a counting the sample in
           a calibrated NaI(Tl) well counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,BCINT,EXTB)
SAMPLE     The targets were filled with 99.9% and 98.3%
            isotopically enriched N-15 as nitrogen gas.
           The initial beam was degraded by 10.8 mg/cm**2
           aluminum foil or a 6.25 mg/cm**2 havar foil that was
           part of the Faraday cup assembly, and by a 6.8mg/cm**2
           aluminum target window.

COMMENT    /By authors/.the thick target yield was calculated
           by integrating the measured excitation function over
           the energy region of interest. The integration was
           performed in steps of 50 keV since N-15(p,n)O-15
           reaction has a large number of resonances.
            /From M.Sajjad (2018-06-06)/: Saturation yields given.
