TITLE      Cross sections for producing some long-lived nuclides

DETECTOR   (GELI) 38 and 100 cm3 with energy resolution 2.5 and
           2.9 keV at Eg=1.3 MeV.
SAMPLE     Thin gold target of 0.4 g/cm**2 thickness. This target
           was disposed on surface thick Fe cylinder (diam.=200,
           length=600 mm).

COMMENT    Results were compared with the data of work (see
           REL-REF), in which such measurements were performed in
           the absence of a massive target. Its influence
           overestimates the value of 196gAu and 194Au cross
           section (and, apparently, 195Au) due to the
           contribution of reactions caused by secondary neutrons.
