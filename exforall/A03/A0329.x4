           (ACTIV) Irradiation Time is not Given. Cooling Time is
           Not Given Too. The Information is Needed Because Cross-
           Section of Short-Lived Isotopes were Measured.
           Yb-167 - Half-Life is 17.7 Minutes.
           Yb-165 - Half-Life is 9.9 Minutes.
           If the Radiations of Daughter Nuclides were Measured,
           Then Cumulative Cross Sections of the Daughters were
           Measured, But not Independent Cross Section For Yb-167
           And Yb-165 Production.
           (GSPEC)
SAMPLE     Target-Natural Erbium.
           Stacks of Natural Erbium Foils,0.012G/Cm**2 Thickness,
           Were Irradiated in the External Beam of the 60 Inch
           Synchocyclotron.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).The Thick Target Yields For Yb-169-G and Yb-166
           Production were Recalculated Through Numerical
           Integration, Applying Experimental Cross Section Values
           Obtained in the Present Work.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).Uncertainties in the Cross Section Values
           Were Estimated by Propagating in Quadrature the
           Contributions from Both Decay Curve and Peak Analyses
           -The Latter Including Counting Statistics, Absolute
           Detector Efficiencies, Disintegration Schemes, Target
           Thickness and Alpha Particles Flux.
CRITIQUE   Decay Data For Investigated Products are not Given by
           Authors. Therefore Data Evaluation is Hindered.
