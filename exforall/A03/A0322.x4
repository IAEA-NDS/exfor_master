TITLE      Preparation of Pu-237 from Np-237 irradiated with
           deuterons.
AUTHOR     (S.Baba,K.Hata,M.Izumo,R.Motoki,T.Sekine)
INSTITUTE  (2JPNJAE)
FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNJAE).Using the JAERI tandem accelerator
           one of the targets was bombarded with 18 MeV deuteron
           and the other with 25 MeV deuterons.
REFERENCE  (J,ARI,36,564,1985)
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,BCINT,EDEG,CHSEP)
SAMPLE     Two targets were used, each made from stacked foils
           containing neptunium layers and aluminum foils to
           degrade the energy of the deuterons.
           About 30 days later both neptunium targets and
           aluminum foils (which contained plutonium recoils)
           were dissolved in nitric acid.
           Finally, a neptunium target was bombarded to obtain
           the cross section s for (d,p) and (d,p+2n) reaction
           at 21 MeV.
COMMENT    /By authors/.the yields of Pu-236 and Pu-238 were
           measured by alpha spectrometry and from the knowledge
           of the yield of plutonium.
ADD-RES     The anion exchange method mentioned earlier was used
           to separate the plutonium from neptunium, aluminum
           and from fission products, and the purified plutonium
           was evaporated onto a stainless steel disc when its
           alpha spectrum was measured with a surface barrier
           detector.
