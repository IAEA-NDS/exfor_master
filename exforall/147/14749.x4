           description.
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) 184-inch Berkeley cyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) The 90-MeV neutrons produced in the stripping
           process by bombarding a 2-inch thick beryllium target
           with 190-MeV deuterons.
DETECTOR   (TRD) A 22-inch cloud chamber filled with helium gas
           and operated in a pulsed magnetic field of 22000 gauss.
METHOD     The particles were identified by curvature and relative
           ionization, or by change of curvature with range when
           they stopped in the chamber.
ANALYSIS   A weighting factor was computed for each one and
           two-prong star analyzed, which corrects for events
           which were too slanted to be measured. Since the
           number of He3,s was uncertain because they could not
           be distinguished from He4's when the track did not
           end in the chamber, the ratio of He3/pt events was
           assumed to be the same as the ratio of sigma nn/sigma
           np at 90 MeV. The total number of events, for
           neutrons above 20 MeV, was normalized to the
           interpolated n-He4 total cross section of 0.19 b.
MONITOR    (2-HE-4(N,TOT),,SIG)
MONIT-REF  ((MONIT)11146001,L.J.Cook+,J,PR,75,7,1949) Value was
           deduced in the current work using H,D,Li, and Be
           cross sections from 11146 plotted vs. A**(2/3).

ANALYSIS   The angular distribution of scattered neutrons in the
           elastic collisions fits a Gaussian centered on the
           forward direction for incident neutrons with energies
           greater than 40 MeV and is roughly isotropic for
           neutrons below 40 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical probable errors based on the
           number of events actually analyzed. For each quantity
           making up the 484 elastic events a statistical
           probable error can be associated based on the number
           of events actually measured. But it is more realistic
           to consider the magnitude of the extrapolation that
           had to be made for missed tracks and the uncertainty
           in the 80.8 assumed He3 events, and consequently a
           probable error of +-60 was assigned to the 484 recoils.

ANALYSIS   As has been mentioned before, it was impossible to
           determine whether a single track was He3 or He4 when
           it did not end in the chamber. In order to estimate
           what fraction of all the single tracks was He'3, some
           assumption must be made regarding the He3 formation
           mechanism. Corrections, in the present investigation
           the ratio of He3 to pt events is assumed to be sigma
           nn /sigma np = sigma pp /sigma np = 1/3, which leads
           to about three times the He3 cross section.
