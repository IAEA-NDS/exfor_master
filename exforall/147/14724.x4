FACILITY   (VDG,1USALAS) Electrostatic generator.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were obtained from a thick lithium
           target bombarded by protons from the short
           electrostatic generator in W. This meant maximum
           energy of the neutron emitted at 0 degree was about
           170 keV and emitted at 90 degree about 25 keV. The
           average energy including neutrons emitted at all
           angles from a thick target was computed to be about 5
           keV. The target was surrounded by a paraffin sphere
           having a radius of 3.5 cm, or alternatively by a
           carbon sphere having a radius of 12 cm.
SAMPLE     The detector samples consisted of thin films of boron
           and 235U on platinum foils. The 235U foils had a
           density of less than 40 micrograms of 235U per cm2,
           and the boron films had a considerably lower density
           so there could be no appreciable shielding due to
           absorption of neutrons in the foils.
METHOD     The experiment, in its simplest form, again consists
           of comparing the counting rates of the fission in the
           235U chamber and of the alpha-particles in a boron
           chamber.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,BF3) Target foils were mounted on opposite
           sides of common electrode in the double ionization
           chamber. Gas filled chamber with BF3 and a 25 fission
           chamber.
