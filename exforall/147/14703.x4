INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) The source of neutrons (Be+200 mg Ra).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The counter used was made from a steel tube
            (12.5 cm x 3.8 cm, 0.13 mm wall thickness) and was
           filled with a mixture of argon and ethyl alcohol
           vapor (10 cm Ar+0.3 cm C2H5OH).
SAMPLE     The cylindrical absorbers used in these experiments
           were 17.8 cm long and approximately 10 cm in diameter.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Ra-Be neutron spectrum is below
           13 MeV.

METHOD     (TRN) The source of neutrons (13 cm long and 1.78 cm
           in diameter) was placed centrally in a 1.78 cm hole
           through the axis of the cylinder. Flexible targets of
           iron or aluminum (made of small strips held together
           with Cellophane tape) fitted around the curved surface
           of the cylinders. The radioactivity induced in these
           targets was measured with a thin-walled steel
           Geiger-Muller counter. In the measurements made without
            the absorbers, the geometrical conditions were
           accurately preserved by the use of identical blanks.
           When aluminum targets were used, measurements were made
            alternately with and without the absorbing cylinders
           in order to eliminate the effects of any changes in
           the sensitivity of the counter:56Fe(n,p)56Mn detection.

METHOD     (TRN) The source of neutrons (13 cm long and 1.78 cm
           in diameter) was placed centrally in a 1.78 cm hole
           through the axis of the cylinder. Flexible targets of
           iron or aluminum (made of small strips held together
           with Cellophane tape) fitted around the curved surface
           of the cylinders. The radioactivity induced in these
           targets was measured with a thin-walled steel
           Geiger-Muller counter. In the measurements made without
            the absorbers, the geometrical conditions were
           accurately preserved by the use of identical blanks.

ANALYSIS   The quantity measured in these experiments is the
           total cross section for all processes by which the
           neutron loses a large fraction of its energy or is
           absorbed. The values called absorption+inelastic
           scattering cross sections in the text are therefore
           more strictly cross sections for absorption+
           inelastic scattering with large energy losses. If a
           form of inelastic scattering occurs in which only a
           small fraction of the energy is lost, the experiments
           will not detect the process to any marked extent. The
           cross sections sigma have been calculated from the
           fraction transmitted T by use of the relation T=exp(-
           N*sigma*t), where N is the number of nuclei per cm2

           the absorbers.

ANALYSIS   The quantity measured in these experiments is the
           total cross section for all processes by which the
           neutron loses a large fraction of its energy or is
           absorbed. The values called absorption+inelastic
           scattering cross sections in the text are therefore
           more strictly cross sections for absorption+
           inelastic scattering with large energy losses. If a
           form of inelastic scattering occurs in which only a
           small fraction of the energy is lost, the experiments
           will not detect the process to any marked extent. The
           cross sections sigma have been calculated from the
           fraction transmitted T by use of the relation T=exp(-
           N*sigma*t), where N is the number of nuclei per cm2
           and t is the average path length of the neutrons in
           the absorbers.

METHOD     (TRN) The source of fast neutrons was mounted at the
           center of the cavity A within the lead block, which
           was large enough to absorb nearly all of the
           gamma-rays emitted by the radium source in the

           glass surrounded the copper/lead detector, as shown, to

           slowed in the floor and walls of the room from acting
