DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Our measurement was based on a
           determination of the number of disintegrations per
           second of the 23-minute period of uranium produced by
           thermal neutrons and of the number of thermal
           neutrons effective under the conditions of
           irradiation. The procedure was as follows: (1)
           Purification of uranium from uranium X by dissolving
           uranyl nitrate in ether and shaking with a small
           amount of water, UX and other impurities remain in
           the water, while a large fraction of uranium remains
           in ether solution and a purified uranyl nitrate may
           be obtained by evaporating the ether. (2) Irradiation
           inside paraffin by means of the cyclotron with an
           indium foil as monitor placed elsewhere in a fixed
           position. (3) Second ether purification in order to
           separate  the 23-minute life from all other activities
           which are not due to isotopes of uranium.
            (4) Measurement, by means of an ionization chamber, of
            the decay of the 23-minute life and the growth of the
           UX activity.  (5) The activation was performed with and
            without Cd absorbers in order to isolate the
           contributions of thermal neutrons. (6) The number of
           thermal neutrons for a given indication of the monitor
           was obtained by comparing the activity induced in an
           indium foil when irradiated either in the uranium
           position with the cyclotron or in a paraffin
           arrangement of standard geometry.
CORRECTION We have therefore corrected our results for the
           absorption of beta-rays in the substance itself, in
           the container and in the window of the ionization
           chamber, and for the sensitivity of the chamber. The
           total correction factor was 3.4.
