INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) The source of neutrons (Be+200 mg Ra).
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) A steel Geiger-Muller counter of dimensions
           3.7 cm x 12 cm with a wall thickness of 0.20 mm and
           filled with argon to a pressure of 15 cm Hg was
           surrounded with a lead foil (1.0 g/cm2).
SAMPLE     The absorbing cylinders used in these experiments
           were 17.8 cm long and approximately 10 cm in diameter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Probable errors.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Ra-Be neutron spectrum is below
           13 MeV.

METHOD     (TRN) The absorption of fast neutrons has been
           measured with cylindrical absorbers to minimize the
           loss of neutrons by scattering and with a method of
           detection which made any change in the energy
           spectrum of the fast neutrons relatively unimportant.
           The fast neutrons were detected by slowing them in
           5.7 cm of paraffin at 8 and counting by means of a
           Geiger-Muller counter the gamma-rays produced by the
           absorption of these slow neutrons in cadmium and lead.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: calculated as 4.1cm x 1.3 g/cm3.
           Transmission is normally smaller than 1 (or only
           slightly bigger when an error of suitable size is
           given, or when it is raw data), but here we have
           values bigger than 1, authors explain it by saying
           that fast neutrons slowed down in the absorbers may
           result in more neutrons coming out. This means
           something like a (n,2n) reaction in the absorber.

REACTION   (16-S-0(N,INL)16-S-0,,SIG,,SPA)
SAMPLE     Calculated thickness as 4.0cm x 2.0 g/cm3=8 g/cm2,
           modern density value is 2.07 g/cm3. Transmission is
           normally smaller than 1 (or only slightly bigger when
           an error of suitable size is given, or when it is raw
           data), but here we have values bigger than 1,
           authors explain it by saying that fast neutrons
           slowed down in the absorbers may result in more
           neutrons coming out. This means something like a
            (n,2n) reaction in the absorber.
METHOD     (TRN) Measurements were made alternately with and
           without cylindrical absorbers. The counts recorded by
           the Geiger-Muller counter (after subtracting the
           natura1 background) were due chiefly to gamma-rays
           excited in the lead by fast neutrons. When the
           cylindrical "absorbers" were placed around the source,
           a marked decrease in the counting rate was observed.
           In order to show that these effects did not arise
           solely from changes, the counter was removed from its
           lead housing and placed in a copper cylinder of 2.8
           cm wall thickness.  Average value Pb and Cu gamma-rays
           detection.
