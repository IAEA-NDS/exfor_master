SAMPLE     Two thicknesses of gold leaf were used. One was pure
           gold leaf of about 10 mg/cm2, the other was 25 karat,
           about 5 mg/cm2.
           (92-U-235,ENR=0.70) One run each was taken with the
           highly enriched (70%) sample, and with a sample of
           normal alloy.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,IOCH) All of the counters were of the fast
           argon - alcohol type. The bell type beta ray counter
           mica window about 5 mg/cm2 thick and the gamma ray
           counter was made of a had a brass tube on the inside
           of which a thin film of bismuth was plated to
           increase the efficiency for low energy gamma rays.
           The ionization chamber was placed in the carbon
           column about 6 feet from the cyclotron. The chamber
           was filled with nitrogen at a pressure of a 90 cm Hg.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) In calculating the probable error of the
           average cross section ratio was taken of the fact
           that the input parameter errors do not average out in
           the several runs but remain constant.
