TITLE      Investigation of fission gamma rays
AUTHOR     (M.Deutsch,J.Rotblat)

DETECTOR   (GEMUC,FISCH) The cylindrical fission chamber was
           constructed of l-mm-thick polyTFE and subdivided
           into four separate concentric compartments with about
           4-mm electrode spacing, by three foils of one mil
           dural. Both the inner and the outer cylindrical
           polyTFE walls were coated with acquadag on the side
           facing the dural foils, thus forming another two
           conducting surfaces.
SAMPLE     Two of the foils were coated on both sides with
           deposit of 0.4 mg/cm2 of U308 containing about 20 per
           cent 235U the total amount of 235U was thus about 30
           mg.
METHOD     (COINC) The method adopted in our experiments was to
           observe coincidences between fission fragments in an
           ionization chamber and gamma-ray pulses in
           Geiger-Mueller counter. We have limited our study to
           fission induced by thermal neutrons. The "prompt"
           fission gamma rays which were investigated in this
           experiment, i.e., these emitted within less than 2
           microseconds of the fission process may be expected
           to originate from the highly excited fragments long
           before their radioactive decay. It is not excluded
           that some gamma rays may be emitted by the compound
           nucleus 236U before fission.
