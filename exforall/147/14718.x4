SAMPLE     Natural barium.
PART-DET   (ICE) Conversion electrons.
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) The barium was removed from the cesium
           by five carbonate precipitations using cesium and
           barium carriers. The cesium was then separated as the
           perchlorate and exhaustively purified. The neutron
           flux was experimentally determined using La139.
MONITOR    (57-LA-139(N,G)57-LA-140,,SIG,,SPA) Flux monitor.

REACTION   (56-BA-130(N,G)56-BA-131,,SIG,,SPA)
ANALYSIS   Assuming that the Cs131 gamma-ray is 97 percent
           converted.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION The Cs131 activity obtained was corrected for
           - decay elapsing between removal of the sample from the
            pile and chemical separation,
           - time elapsing between chemical separation and
           measurement, chemical recovery,
           - counter efficiency,
           - absorption in sample, in counter window and in air
           gap between counter window and sample,
           - and backscattering from tray.
