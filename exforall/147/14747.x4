INSTITUTE  (1USALRL)
FACILITY   (LASER,1USALRL) The National Ignition Facility at
           Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (GE) gamma- and x-ray photons were measured with
           single semiconductor germanium photon detectors.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of thin gold foils, nominally
           2.5 cm in diameter, backed with thin aluminum foils
           to act as flux monitors via the 27Al(n,a)24Na
           reaction and to collect reaction products recoiling
           from the gold. The foils were fielded in sealed
           aluminum irradiation fixtures (Target Option
           Activation Device (TOAD)), often as part of a stack
           of foils comprising other activation experiments. The
           TOADs are 2 mm thick and 5 cm diameter, and can
           accommodate circular foils up to 2.5 cm diameter in a
           stack that can be as thick as 0.6 mm. Targets of
           different materials are isolated from one another by
           thin aluminum foils; recoil losses of 15 h 24Na from
           a backing foil are replaced by recoil from the
           upstream foil stack or the TOAD cover plate,
           validating the use of 27Al as a flux monitor. The
           TOAD is sealed with an adhesive that, after curing,
           can be reopened with mechanical force to release the
           irradiated foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron activation of gold is the basis
           of an implosion performance diagnostic at the
           National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore
           National Laboratory.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) All errors are reported at the one-sigma
           limit. The statistical and systematic uncertainties
           were propagated.
           (ERR-SYS,1.,2.) The systematic uncertainty of 1%-2%,
           from the uncertainties of the decay rates of the
           radionuclides in the sources used in the calibration
           of the detectors, does not apply to the reported
           ratios of gamma-ray intensities.
CORRECTION Correction for self-attenuation by the relatively
           thick gold foils, the extended-source geometric
           correction, and for gamma-ray absolute branching
           ratios.

ANALYSIS   The total cross section for the production of the sum
           of all isomeric states (196Aut) is obtained by
           multiplying by (1 + I), where I is the isomer ratio.
           Propagating the uncertainty with those associated with
           the two activation fractions and the isomer ratio a
           reaction cross section for 197Au(n,2n)196Aut is
           obtained.
