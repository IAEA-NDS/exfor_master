           for fast neutrons

INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) A variety of neutron detectors was
           employed in the transmission geometry. In the neutron
           energy region from 0.3 to 3.0 MeV a l/2-in. diameter
           ionization chamber filled with hydrogen or deuterium
            (200 to 700psi) was used. In the region from 3.4 to 7
           MeV both the hydrogen filled recoil chamber and a
           l/2-in. diameter by l-1/2-in. long stilbene crystal
           were used at different times. In the region from 18
           to 20 MeV a 3/4-in. diameter by l-1/2-in. long
           anthracene crystal was was employed. At 14 MeV the
           recoil chamber filled with 600 psi deuterium and 600
           psi argon was employed.
METHOD     (TRN) In the geometry employed for the transmission
           neutron source and the neutron detector were spaced
           30 cm from opposite ends of the 100-cm long cell.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Estimated probable errors. The quoted
           errors are in general two to three tires the
           statistical errors. Allowance for uncertainty of true
           background, for uncertain influence of long steel
           cell in spite of the fact that no scattering of
           neutrons by the cell wall could be detected in the
           geometry employed.

REACTION   (1-H-3(N,TOT),,SIG)
INC-SOURCE (P-T,D-D,D-T) The reactions T(p,n), D(D,n), and
           T(D,n) with the electrostatic generator of Group P-9
           gave neutrons in the respective energy intervals 0.3
           to 3.0 MeV, 3.4 to 7.0 MeV, and 18 to 20 MeV.
           Neutrons of energy 14.10 MeV were obtained from the
           T(D,n) reaction with the 250 kV Cockcroft-Walton
           accelerator of Group P-4.
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USALAS) The electrostatic generator.
           (CCW,1USALAS)
SAMPLE     All samples were contained in gaseous form in steel
           cells 100 cm long and 1 in. outside dimeter. The cell
           employed for hydrogen and tritium were designed by
           CMR-9, which made accurate dimension and volume
           measurements and filled the cell with accurately
           measured quantities of gas.

SAMPLE     All samples were contained in gaseous form in steel
           cells 100 cm long and 1 in. outside dimeter. Normal
           helium samples were contained in a having a

           steel cell compared with 1/16-in. thickness for the
           cell which held the tritium and hydrogen samples. The
           number of atoms per cm2 of helium was determined from
           data on gas weight, cell volume, and cell length.
