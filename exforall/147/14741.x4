METHOD     (COINC) The chamber was irradiated with slow neutrons
           from the cyclotron. A coincidence circuit registered
           events occurring simultaneously on each side of the
           chamber. Alpha particles are emitted in coincidence
            (within 5*10**-6 sec.) with fission in U235 and Pu239.

SAMPLE     The enriched sample used consisted of 0.220 mg of
           U235 electrodeposited on a thin platinum foil
           weighing 8 mg/cm2. This foil was also backed with an
           additional layer of gold weighing 5 mg/cm2 making an
           equivalent total of 12.2 mg/cm2 of gold.

SAMPLE     A sample of about 2 mg of Pu239 was used for the
           experiment. A collimating screen, necessary to reduce
           the alpha-background on the fission side A, reduced
           the effective mass of the Pu239 to about 0.200 mg.
