SAMPLE     The 25 chamber: Enriched uranium oxide, for which the
           ratio of 235U to 238U was about 1 to 8, was sprayed
           onto each side of the foils to the thickness of 1 mg
           per cm2 of uranium. There was a total of 7.74 gm of
           uranium in a chamber, of which about 0.89 gram was
           235U.
METHOD     (TOF) Hydrogenous material was used to reduce the
           energy of neutrons to the region below 1000 eV. A
           slow neutron velocity spectrometer was used to select
           neutrons of the desired energy.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Continuous fitted curve was
           digitized. Points were chosen by the compiler.

SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.1374) A sample of uranium oxides
           enriched in 25, was used. The amount of 235U
           contained in the sample was 13.74% by weight of the
           total amount of uranium present. The entire sample of
           the oxide weighed 309.6 gm., but was divided into two
           parts. These two parts, designated as #l and #2
           contained approximately two third and one thirds,
           respectively, of the total amount. The samples were
           placed in cylindrical aluminum containers having an
           inside diameter of 2.50 inches. Two other samples,#3
           and #4 were made of normal tuballoy oxide. These were
           placed in containers similar the enriched samples.
METHOD     (TRN) The absolute transmission for various absorbers.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The probable errors are the statistical
           errors associated with the timed counts only and do
           not include the error in the total transmission.
