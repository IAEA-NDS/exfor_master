TITLE       (n,2n) cross section of Be9
AUTHOR     (H.M.Agnew)
REFERENCE  (R,LA-1371,1952)
INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
DETECTOR   (LONGC) A long counter which had a flat response.
METHOD     (SHELT) By measuring the transmission of shells of
           graphite of various thicknesses. A series of shells
           having a diameter up to 9 in. all gave a transmission
           of unity.
ANALYSIS   The cross section was computed as I = I0*exp((sigma
           n,2n - sigma a)Nt), where I is the number of
           neutrons per standard time interval detected by the
           long counter with the sphere of Be surrounding the
           neutron source. I0 is the number of neutrons detected
           under identical conditions except with source bare,
           sigma n,2n is the average cross section of Be per
           atom for the (n,2n) reaction for the neutron spectrum
           involved, sigma a is the average absorption cross
           section of Be per atom for the neutron spectrum
           involved, and t is the wall thickness in source.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relatively large errors (average
           deviation from the mean) are due primarily to the
           misfit cavities in the Be spheres, cracks in in size of
            the Be spheres.
           (ERR-S,,1.) In the experiment reported the here
            the source was 80 cm from statistical errors involved
           were less than 1%.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The difference between (n,2n) and
           the absorption cs would have to be negative, because
           "absorption" as defined in EXFOR includes (n,2n). In
           old papers "absorption" is often used for "capture", so
           (N,ABS) was replaced with (N,G).
