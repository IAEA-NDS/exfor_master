INSTITUTE  (1USAORU)
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) 15R beam line at the Los Alamos
           National Laboratory, Los Alamos Neutron Science
           Center at the Weapons Neutron Research (LANSCE-WNR)
           facility.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) "White spectrum" neutron beams were generated
           from an unmoderated tungsten spallation source using
           the 800-MeV proton beam from the LANSCE linear
           accelerator.
DETECTOR   (SI) Fission fragments were detected by nine pairs of
           1-cm2 Si p-i-n diode detectors (Hamamatsu S3590-09)
           positioned 3.5 cm from the target.
METHOD     (TOF) The time of flight of each interacting neutron
           was measured using a timing pulse from a Si p-i-n
           diode and the accelerator rf signal. The distance
           from the spallation target to the Pu targets was
           measured to be 1384.9 +- 1.1 cm. The solid angle
           covered by the Si p-i-n diodes was ~11% of 2pi.
ANALYSIS   The 2E method was used to measure the fission product
           masses and their TKE by detecting the fission
           products and determining their energies after neutron
           emission.
CORRECTION Corrections for PHD, the pulse-height defect, and
           energy loss of fragments in the target and backing
           foils are also applied.

SAMPLE     (94-PU-240,ENR=0.99874) The plutonium targets were
           prepared by vapor deposition using the method. The
           targets consisted of 2-cm-diameter circular deposits
           of the Pu isotope on a thin C backing. The target
           thickness was 72.3 microg/cm2 (240Pu) (as measured by
           alpha spectroscopy). The source material for the
           240Pu target was 99.874 wt% 240Pu. The assumed
           chemical composition of the targets was that of PuF4.
           The C backing thickness was 100 microg/cm2. The
           targets were at an angle of 45 degree with respect to
           the incident beam.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Error bars are uncertainty on measurements
           from the Gaussian fits.
