FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO) Experiment performed using 4.5 MeV
           tandem accelerator at the Edwards Accelerator
           Laboratory at Ohio University in Athens
DETECTOR   (BGO) BGO crystal with diameter of 10.16 cm and
           thickness of 10.16 cm coupled to a PMT was placed at
           a distance of 4.46 m from the carbon targets with an
           angle of 90 deg to the neutron beam.
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron flux was pulsed with pulse FWHM of 2.0
           ns and 200 ns pulse period
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The alpha particles from the DT reaction were
           monitored with a collimated Si detector located at
           135 deg with respect to the incident deuteron beam.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in neutron flux
           (ERR-T) in overall uncertainty contribution from
                     - neutron flux
                     - BGO efficiency
                     - neutron energy distribution
                     - assumed energy dependence of cross section
