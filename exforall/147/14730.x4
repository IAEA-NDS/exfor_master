SAMPLE     The samples were thin layers (0.25 mg/cm2) of U308
           deposited electrolytically on platinum disks 0.05 mm
           thick and 4.3 cm in diameter. The discs were spot
           welded to copper discs of 12.7 cm diameter. A series
           of samples was prepared out of ordinary uranium
            (specific alpha activity 1500 alphas/mg); another
           series of samples was of uranium of isotopic
           composition U238:U235:U234 = 2.76:1.00:0.0044 in mass
            (specific activity 16.44x10**3 alphas/mg*min).
METHOD     The experiments consisted of putting certain amounts
           of normal uranium or of uranium whose isotopic
           composition had been changed in a known fashion in
           ionization chambers connected to linear amplifiers,
           and counting the fission pulses.
ANALYSIS   Authors measured that the spontaneous fission rate of
           238U is 24.0 +- 1.1 f/gm*hr and the spontaneous
           fission rates of 235U and 234U are - 2.2 +- 4.6 and
           <60 f/g*hr, respectively.
