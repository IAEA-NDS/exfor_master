           Following measurement.
INSTITUTE  (1USAUI)
INC-SOURCE (TH-BE) 13 mC RdTh, contained in a platinum tube of 1
           cm length and 2 mm diameter, was surrounded by a
           cylinder of beryllium metal.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) An ionization chamber filled with 5 atmos. of
           hydrogen, which was connected to a four stage linear
           amplifier and a scaling circuit.
SAMPLE     The scatterers consisted of paraffin cylinders of
           lengths varying between 1 and 9 cm. They were placed
           halfway between source and ionization chamber. 2.43
           g/cm2 for the mean free path of the RdTh+ Be neutrons
           in paraffin.
METHOD     (REC) Recoil protons of more than 350 keV energy were
           recorded. The gamma-ray background reduced by a lead
           cone mounted in front of the source was well below
           this limit.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION The correction for the obliqueness of the neutron
           paths within the scatterer is negligible.
