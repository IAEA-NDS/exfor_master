TITLE      On the Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead

DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
METHOD     The counter wall was covered with 1.0 g/cm2 of lead.
           When the Ra-Be was introduced into the large lead
           block counts increased. With the 200 mc Ra-Be source
           in the lead block additional lead (in plates 15x30
           cm2) was placed behind the counter and produced a
           further increase in the count. The increases in
           counts vs. Pb thickness establish the existence of a
           gamma-ray produced by the action of fast neutrons on
           lead and the magnitude of its self-absorption
           indicates an energy somewhat less than 1 MeV.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: It could be levels in 204,206,
           207Pb below 1 MeV. Ra-Be neutron spectrum is below 13
           MeV.
