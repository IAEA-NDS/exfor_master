CORRECTION Corrections for geometrical size of sample, for
           absorption, and for multiple scattering can be made
           by obtaining the slope at zero thickness of an
           intensity vs sample thickness curve. Such intensity
           curves made with materials of known cross sections
           make it possible to calculate the corrections for
           samples of unknown scattering cross sections.

METHOD     The scattering material is placed in layers inside an
           inverted Cd cup in such a way that neutrons moving
           upwards from the graphite of a thermal column are
           scattered backwards from the scatterer and strike an
           In foil protected by Cd from a direct beam. The
           scattering cross section of a material is determined
           by comparing its back-scattering to that of graphite.

REACTION   (76-OS-0(N,EL)76-OS-0,,SIG,,SPA)
METHOD     The scattering cross section of one strong absorber
           was measured, however that of Cd. The scattering of
           Cd causes a background count in the apparatus and
           this background with several auxiliary measurements
           gives the background scattering of Cd.
ANALYSIS   The scattering intensity from a Cd sheet cannot be
           compared directly with that from a graphite sheet
           because the former is infinitely thick. The ratio
           between the back-scattering intensity can be
           calculated approximately, however, and Os for Cd
           obtained.
