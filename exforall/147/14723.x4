INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Lithium targets, approximately 75 kv thick,
           bombarded by 1.95 MeV protons. The maximum energy of
           the primary neutrons was therefore 0.15 MeV. These
           primary neutrons were transformed to slow neutrons by
           surrounding the target and detectors by either
           paraffin or water.
SAMPLE     The 235U samples, with which these aliquots have been
           compared in a double fission chamber to give          1
           relative fission cross section, are thin foils of
           normal uranium containing 065, 3.54 and 10.6
           micrograms of 235U and an enriched sample containing
           17.9 micrograms of 235U. The 235U content of the latter
            sample was obtained by comparing it with 500- and
           1500- microgram foils of normal alloy. For the
           paraffin geometry pertaining to the first und third
           experiments we have compared two aliquots of the
           original solution containing the 239Pu sample with
           various uranium samples. Assuming that 239Pu has a
           half-life of 21,300 years the masses of these
           aliquots was found to be 1.02+-0.02 and 1.60+-0.03
           micrograms respectively. From these values and the
           percentages of the original material in these aliquots
           the mass of 239Pu used in the earlier experiments is
           calculated to be 142.3+-3.7 micrograms.
METHOD     The ratio of the number or neutrons emitted per
           fission in 239Pu to the number of neutrons emitted per
           fission in 235U has been measured by two different
           methods.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are calculated from
           the number of neutrons counted.

METHOD     (REC) The second method of determining the relative
           number of neutrons emitted from known masses of 239Pu
           and 235U is based on an entirely different physical
           phenomenon. In this case the fission neutrons were
           detected by their ability to produce fission in
           thorium, whereas the primary neutrons had energies
           less than the 1.2 MeV fission threshold of thorium.
