TITLE      The ratio of the fission cross sections of 49 and 25
           for thermal neutrons and the ration [1+alpha(49)]/
           [1+alpha(25)]

INC-SOURCE (D-BE) A thermalized neutron flux of about 2*10**5
           neutrons/cm2/sec at the center of the 11'*7'*6'8"
           graphite block at the cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The comparison chamber consisted of two
           parallel plate ionization chambers having a common
           high voltage electrode, on which the samples were
           placed.

REACTION   ((94-PU-239(N,F),,SIG,,SPA)/(92-U-235(N,F),,SIG,,SPA))
SAMPLE     Six foils of 235U and four foils of 239Pu were used
           in the experiment. All the foils were deposited on 1
           or 2 mil Pt. All the weights are based on a half life
           for 239Pu of 24,400 years.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) In order to find any systematic errors in
           counting, a 239Pu foil and a 235U foil were compared
           under conditions obtained by separately interchanging
           scalars, amplifiers, and foils, and by moving the
           chamber within the block. No significant change in
           the counting ratio were detected. No further details
           on how the given uncertainty was determined.

            (sigmaf(235U)/sigmaf(239Pu))).
