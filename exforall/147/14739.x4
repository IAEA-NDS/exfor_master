INC-SPECT  Irradiations were performed in the graphite thermal
           column of the Los Alamos "water boiler" (a chain-
           reacting assembly operating mainly on thermal neutrons)
           .  The ratio of activities of an indium foil without
           and with cadmium covering (cadmium ratio) at the
           position of irradiation was of the order of a
           thousand or better. Hence the neutron spectrum was
           predominately thermal.
SAMPLE     Metal samples of both Pu239 and U235 were available
           for this experiment. The metal samples were each
           covered with cadmium save on one face. The samples
           were sufficiently thick so that they could be
           considered essentially infinitely thick for thermal
           neutrons.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) The detector used was a flat parallel plate
           U235 fission chamber which was embedded in the
           paraffin. The paraffin arrangement served to increase
           the counting efficiency for fast neutrons and also
           tended to equalize the counting efficiency for
           neutrons of different initial energies.
METHOD     (INTB) The sample was attached to a string and could
           be pulled out of the center of the thermal column
           into the paraffin geometry for counting. The length
           of time it took for the sample to be pulled from the
           thermal column into the paraffin geometry was just
           under 2 seconds. Counting was therefore started 2
           seconds after the sample began to move (2-second
           runs). A second set of data was taken by starting
           the counter 5 seconds after the sample began to move
            (5-second runs).
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental errors: Errors indicated are
           conservative guesses based on the largest deviation
           observed.
