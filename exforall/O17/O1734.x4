INSTITUTE  (3RUMBUC)
FACILITY   (VDGT,3RUMBUC) IFIN-HH tandem accelerator.
METHOD     (BCINT) The beam current was 150 nA
           (ACTIV)
           (STTA)
SAMPLE     A stick of five Cu-natural targets and one Ti-natural
           foil of 2.7 mg/cm**2 thickness was prepared

           The titanium foil, at the end of the stack, was used
           for beam current calibration using the Ti-48(a,n)Cr-51
           reaction and for catching the recoil Ga-67 radio-
           isotopes from the preceding copper foil in order to
           estimate the recoiled fraction.
MONITOR    (22-TI-48(A,N)24-CR-51,,SIG)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The energy resolution of the HPGe detector was
            1.9 keV at E(g)=1332.5 keV Ga-67.
ERR-ANALYS  Authors appreciated 18% uncertainties for measured
           cross sections, considering all uncertainties of
           detector efficiency calibration, target foil thickness,
           beam current, counting statistics, decay rate and
           recoil fraction.
           (EN-ERR).The uncertainty of energy is reported by
           authors in table.
           (DATA-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors in
           table.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).The yield for Cu-63(a,g) reaction is calculated
           using Eq.4(see text) and considering successive thin
           slices of 1000 A thickness.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 2 from ref.
