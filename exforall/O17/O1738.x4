           proton induced reactions on gadolinium targets

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3EGYCAI) The Inshas variable energy cyclotron.
SAMPLE     The samples of gadolinium were of 7.901 mg/cm**2
            +-2.0% thickness was used as targets.
           Each stack was composed of target Gd, Al and Cu foil
           for flux monitoring. Two stacks were irradiated
           separately, the targets in the stacks consisted of 9,
            10 thin foils of natural Gd of high purity, 99.99%.
           The Al-degraders of suitable thickness were used in
           between the samples in each stack to cover the broad
           energy range and as a catcher.
           Like targets in stacks, sets of thin Al-foils, 10.0 mum
           thickness and Cu-foils, 10.0-25.0 mum thickness, were
           used to monitor the proton flux.

METHOD     (STTA)

DETECTOR   (HPGE) 70% HPGe gamma-ray detector, resolution approx.
            2 keV for 1.33 MeV gamma-ray of Co-60.
CORRECTION  The correction for the activity due to the self-
           absorption of gamma-rays in the targets itself was
           taken into account very carefully.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The root average of total error due to
           all following factors after quadrate sum:
           (ERR-1) The error in half-lives.
           (ERR-2) The error in intensity of gamma-ray.
           (ERR-3,,1.0) Error in self absorption of gamma-rays
           in target foils.
           (ERR-4) The error in absolute efficiency calibration.
           (ERR-5) The error in quality of the monitor data
            (proton fluence).
           (ERR-6,,1.0) The error in mass of monitor foil.
           (ERR-S,1.0,5.0) Statistical uncertainty in net peak
           areas.
           (ERR-7,,1.0) The error in geometry dependent detector
           efficiency.
           (ERR-8) The error in secondary particles contribution
           in nuclides production and beam intensity loss as the
           beam traverses the stack thickness.
           (EN-ERR) The error is reported by authors in table.
            -number of target nuclei in the sample(target mass)
            is negligible.
            -flux fluctuation during irradiation time is
            negligible.
            -irradiation time and counting time is negligible
            -contamination due to recoil losses not considered.
            -self-absorption of gamma-rays in monitor foils is
            negligible
            -dead time and pile-up losses in gamma-spectroscopy is
            negligible.
