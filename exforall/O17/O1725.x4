FACILITY   (CYCLO,2ZZZISP)
SAMPLE     Thick targets W-natural isotopic composition and
           several 500 mg of highly enriched 99.9% W-186 powder
           and W-180 0.001%, W-182 0.01%, W-183W 0.005%, W-184
            0.09% were used.
           The powdered targets were pressed up to 15M Pabyan
           hydraulic crystallography press in between two
           accurately measured high purity Al foils, 10 mm of
           nominal diameter, 120 and 200 mm thick. During the
           irradiation,the Al-W-186-Al stacks were enveloped
           in between other two further calibrated high purity
           12 mm  Al foils, 99.999%, 20*20 mm**2 area in order to
           prevent any losses and contaminations of activated
           W-186 powder during and /or after their radiation, i.e.
           these sheets ware taken away after their radiation.
           The Al foils thickness was chosen in order to obtain
           values of the energies incident on the enriched W-186
           targets comparable for protons  (13.6+-0.2 MeV) and
           deuterons(13.4+-0.2 MeV) beams.
