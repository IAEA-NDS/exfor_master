TITLE      On the photon self-absorption correction for thin-
           target-yields vs. thick-target-yields in radionuclide
           production.

SAMPLE     Thick targets W-natural and W-186 were used.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
METHOD     (SITA)
COMMENT    *By authors*.The correction factor for the
           self-absorption can be used in two ways, either
           correcting the integrated thin target yields by
           considering that part of the photons will be absorbed,
           leading to lower values for the thick target yield vs.
           the proton energy(this will lead to a correct count-
           rate but not to a correct yield) or correcting the
           measured count-rates of the thick target due to the
           fraction of the photons that is absorbed.
           However, since the cross section values with the proton
           energy, the Re-186-g is not homogenously distributed in
           the thick target and the correction must be done by
           summation, dividing the thick target into small layers.
           The thick target was divided into layers of 10 mum.
