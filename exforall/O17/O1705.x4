FACILITY   (CYCLO,2FR GAN)
INC-SOURCE The Ne-26 beam was produced by the ISOL technique
           and accelerated to 9.7A MeV by the CIME cyclotron at
           the SPIRAL facility.A S-36 primary beam at 77.5A*MeV
           was fragmented and stopped in a thick carbon target.
METHOD     (EDE,TOF)
           (COINC)
           (EXTB)
SAMPLE     A solid cryogenic D(2) target, thickness 17 mg/cm**2,
           was used.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) the VAMOS magnetic spectrometer, allowing an
           identification of ejectiles and a counting rate
           measurement of reaction products and Ne-26 beam
           particles.
           (SPEC) Photons were measured in the EXOGAM
           spectrometer. The intrinsic energy resolution of the
           whole system was measured to be 2.6 keV(FWHM) at
            1332 keV and the corresponding photo-peak efficiency
           was estimated to be 4.8%.

           (SCIN)
           To identify Ne-27 beam-like ejectiles in the focal
           plane of VAMOS, was used combinations of following
           parameters:
            -the time of flight(TOF) between a microchannel plate
           device before the target and the plastic scintillator
           VAMOS,
            -the energy loss delta-E in the ionization chamber of
           VAMOS,
            -the horizontal position X on the focal plane of
           VAMOS measured by two drift chambers.

              of VAMOS magnetic spectrometer
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The quoted uncertainties are mainly due to
           statistical error and a 10% uncertainty over the
           absolute photopeak efficiencies of EXOGAM.
