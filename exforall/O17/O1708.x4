                           facility CYCLONE
METHOD     (TOF)
           (COINC) neutron and fission fragments in coincidence
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Three different types of detectors were used-
            Two microchannel Si-diode detector, two large position
            sensitive Multi-Wire Proportional gas Counters(MWPC),
            69 liquid-scintillator cells allowed the determination
            of the neutron energy and angular distributions
            associatted with the fission process(DEMON
            multidetector).Each DEMON counter, consisting of an
            active volume of 16 cm diameter by 20 cm depth, is
            filled with NE213 liquid-type scintillator.
            (SI) In order to monitor the reaction chamber residual
             activity(contamination from the target sputtering
             under the beam impact), up to three thin si detectors
             shielded from the target by thick aluminum bloks,
             allow the detection of the 5 MeV alpha-type particles
             emitted by the eventual actinide material
             contamination in the reaction chamber wall.
            (MWPC) for fission fragments
            (SCIN) Neutrons were detected with the multidetector
             DEMON.
PART-DET   (FF) Fission fragments were detected.
SAMPLE     The targets were sealed between two C-12 layers, thick
           enough(50 mug/cm**2) to stop either the recoiling
           target nucleus or the evaporation heavy residues of the
           reactions but not the fission fragments. The targets
           themselves had the following thickness-Th-232 145 mug/
           cm**2, Np-237 159 mug/cm**2, U-238 180 mug/cm**2,
           Pu-239 106 mug/cm**2, Am-241 124 mug/cm**2.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1).The uncertainty in the target thickness.
           (ERR-2).The uncertainty in the fission fragment masses.

ANALYSIS    The relative contributions of pre-equilibrium neutron
           emission and compound nucleus evaporation, as well as
           of post-scission evaporation from the fission fragments
           were analyzed with moving multisource fits-

           nuclei are described by a Maxwellian type distribution.
            -the spectra for neutron emitted from the FFs are
           described by the Watt distribution.
            -the PE source is not thermally equilibrated, the
           surface source form used to fit the corresponding
           curves and the fitting parameter are non-physical and
           hence inadeqquate to describe PE neutron emission.
           Due to the very weak PE contributions, the preceding
           observation will not significantly affect the results
           of the other source contribution.
