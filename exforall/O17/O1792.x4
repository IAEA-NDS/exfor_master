FACILITY   (LINAC,2GERGSI) The beam of 12C2+ ions was delivered by
           the Universal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) at GSI.
SAMPLE     Th-232 targets were prepared by molecular plating
           The target consisted of three banana-shaped segments on
            15-mum thick Be with thicknesses of 900, 910, and
            1000 mg/cm**2.
           The stationary targets, 360 mg/cm**2 Th on 15 mum Be
           and 1-mum Cu catcher foils were used to confirm that no
           products were lost in the set up with the rotating
           wheel and to further reduce the background.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Actinide separation
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A HPGe gamma-detector with 5% absolute
           efficiency at 188 keV was used to identify 239Cm by
           gamma-spectroscopic measurements.
           (SI) Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon detector.
           Samples were first measured by gamma-spectroscopy to
           monitor the chemical yield of Pm, and then were assayed
           for alpha-activities by 450 mm**2 PIPS detectors
COMMENT    *By* authors*.Cross sections were also calculated from
           the abundance and efficiency-corrected measured alpha-
           activities 238Cm and 240Cm and gamma-activities 239Cm,
           taking into account the number of 232Th atoms in the
           target, the integrated beam intensity, and assuming
           that 100% of the products of interest recoiled out of
           the target and were collected in the copper catcher
           foils.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Two main gamma-lines from the EC decay of
            239Cm were observed at 188.2 and 146.2 keV, with
           absolute abundances of 36% and 12%, respectively, from
           the decay of daughter 239Am. The alpha-branch of 239Cm
           was determined to have an upper limit of less than
            1*10E-5.
REL-REF    (D,,W.Reisdorf+,J,ZP/A,343,47,1992)
            In absolute numbers, all measured cross sections are
           approximately a factor of 20 below the values
           calculated with HIVAP(see REL-REF). This discrepancy is
           not understood. However, the low cross sections
           measured in this work do not appear to be out of line
           with other reported results.
