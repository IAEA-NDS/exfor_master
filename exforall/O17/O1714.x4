SAMPLE     A 200-mug/cm**2 lithium oxide Li(2)O foil supported by
           a 10 mug/cm**2 C-12 backing was used as target.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Two forward mounted telescopes
            each consisting of three separate 50*50 mm elements.
           The first, a 70 mum thick double sided silicon strip
           detector, was segmented into 32 independent 3 mm wide
           strips, the 16 strips on the front face being
           horizontal and the 16 strips on the back face vertical.
           The second stage was comprised of a 500 mum thick
           resistive silicon strip detector segmented into 16
           separate, position sensitive strips.
           The third element in each telescope, a 10 mm thick
           Cs(I)-scintillator, was used to stop any highly
           energetic particles.
           A mylar absorbers were used to stop elastically
           scattered O-18 beam particles from entering the delta-E
           detector, reducing the counting and event pile-up rates
INC-SOURCE  The detectors were calibrated using a combination of
           alpha-particles from a 3-line alpha-source and 25 MeV
           C-12 ions elastically scattered from a Au-197 target.
           The energy resolution was approx. 120 keV (FWHM) for
           the silicon detectors and approx. 1.5%(FWHM) for the
           CsI-crystals.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3AULCBR) The 14 UD tandem Van de Graaff
           accelerator facility of the Australian National
           University.
METHOD     (COINC) decay fragments were detected in coincidence
            in two detector telescopes.
           (EDE)
           (BCINT).The integrated beam exposure at 80 and 100 MeV
           was 2.9 amd 0.93 mC, respectively.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross-section for the
           Li-7(O-18,A+N-15)2-He-6 proton transfer reaction has
           been obtained from the observed yield in the F-19
           excitation energy. The yields, integrated between
           E-EXC=8-17 MeV in the 80 MeV beam data and
           E-EXC=7.5-23 MeV in the 100 MeV beam data,were
           efficiency corrected Monte Carlo simulations, performed
           over these same excitation energy ranges.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR).The error is reported by authors in table.
           The quoted uncertainties are dominated by an estimated
            20% error in the target thickness.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The cross-section obtained for the
           individual peaks. These were obtained by fitting
           Gaussian line shapes to the peaks above smoothly
           varying backgrounds. They yields were then efficiency
           corrected Monte Carlo simulations at the relevant
           excitation energy in F-19.

           cross section for the C-12(O-18,A+2-He-6)Ne-20
           reaction, a number of Monte Carlo simulated events were

           efficiency corrected and the cross sections determined.
           The large difference in upper limits between O-16 and
           C-12 target constituents mainly reflects the very
           different nominal target thicknesses of 10 mug/cm**2
           for the C-12 backing and approx. 107 mug/cm**2 for the
           O-16 content of the Li(2)O foil.
