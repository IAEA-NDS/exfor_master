FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN) the CYCLONE RIB facility
INC-SOURCE  A 13.8 MeV F-18 radioactive beam which was produced
           using the ISOL technique. A first cyclotron, CYCLONE 30
           delivers protons of 15.5 MeV on the production target
           which consists in a 1 cm**3 of water enriched in O-18.
           The F-18 beam is then produced through the
           O-18(p,n)F-18 exchange charge reaction. Then the F-18
           beam accelerated to the relevant energy with the
           CYCLONE 110 cyclotron.
COMMENT    *By authors*.In the present experiment, the O-18
           content was evaluated using the difference of the
           energy loss between F-18 and O-18 in a thick aluminum
           foil, approx. 670 mug/cm** thick, placed before the
           target.
SAMPLE     A 70 mug/cm**2 polyethylene CH2 targets was used.
METHOD     (EXTB) A 18-F radioactive beam, ionized to 2+ state.
           (TOF)
           (COINC) Alpha-particles were detected in coincidence
           with O-15 ions.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The framework of the R-matrix model.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The products of the H(F-18,a)O-15 reaction were
           detected using the multi-strip silicon detector LEDA.
           These detectors are composed of 8 sectors, each
           divided into 16 radial strips.
           The energy calibration of the 256 strips was performed
           with a calibrated 3 alpha-source(Pu-239, Am-241 and
           Cm-244) whereas the TOF calibration was performed with
           a precision pulse generator.
MONITOR    (6-C-12(9-F-18,EL)6-C-12,,DA) The number of incident
           F-18 ions was determined and detected in the LEDA2
           detector.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) For the present data, the error bars mainly
           come from statistical and coincidence efficiency
           uncertainties.
           Each measurement is an average cross section taken over
           the beam energy loss in the target (about 50 keV in
           the center-of-mass).
