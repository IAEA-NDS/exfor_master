FACILITY   (CYCLO,2NEDKVI) The superconducting cyclotron AGOR of
           KVI Groningen
SAMPLE     Sn-124, Ba-138 and Ce-140 was used as targets.
METHOD     (BCINT)
           (TOF)
           (COINC) gammas and alpha particles
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Big-Bite Spectrometer (BBS).
           BBS is a spectrometer of QQD type, two quadrupoles and
           one dipole, it is especially designed for measurements
           at very small angles including 0-degree.
           (HPGE).Six HPGe detectors.
STATUS     (UNOBT).The letter from Janis Endres was received
            18.01.2010- The data of our measurement will be
           sending after publishing in a regular journal.
