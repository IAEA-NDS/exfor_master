FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYPAD) The LNL-tandem XTU accelerator
            An important feature of this system is the large
           secondary beam acceptance of its optics elements and
           its large capability to suppress all the unwanted
           scattered beams.
INC-SOURCE  The F-17 secondary beam was obtained through the
           reaction p(O-17,F-17)n of E(lab)=104 MeV impinging onto
           a gas target filled with pure H-2 at a pressure of
            800 mb and at room temperature, corresponding to a
           thickness of 0.323 mg/cm**2.
SAMPLE     A 1 mg/cm**2 thick Pb-208 self-supporting targets was
           used.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (EXTB)
           (COINC) The exclusive breakup process was studied via
            8-O-16 and p coincidences.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(9-F-17,EL)79-AU-197,,DA) the elastic
           scattering cross section on a 2 mg/cm**2 thick Au-197
           self-supporting target.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The reaction products were detected with EXODET
           array, consisted of 16 solid state Si detectors
           arranged in 8 two-stage delta-E-E telescopes. Each
           EXODET detector had an active ares of 50 mm*50 mm.
           The thickness of the Si detectors was 40(70) mum for
           six (two) delta-E layers and 500 mum for all the E
           layers.

COMMENT    *By authors*.Since the energy resolution did not allow
           to resolve the first F-17 excited state, the data have
           to be considered as quasi-elastic. The contribution of
           this inelastic excitation to the reaction cross-section
           was evaluated around 35 mb.

ADD-RES     The upper limit of the reaction cross-section
           compatible with experimental data that authors call
           quasi-elastic reaction cross-section is 5 mb. This
           cross-section includes all the non-elastic processes
           except the excitation of the first F-17 level.

ANALYSIS   For inelastic cross section calculation was used the
           code FRESCO, within the DWBA approach, using the
           optical model parameters obtained from the previous
           analysis and including the possibility to excite also
           the first F-17 excited state.
PART-DET   (P,8-O-16)
COMMENT    *By authors*.To identify exclusive breakup events in
           the analysis was required the detection of both the
           O-16 and the proton, by imposing the following
           conditions-the total energy of the two detected
           particles was required to be in the elastic peak
           region.
            The breakup cross-section was obtained from the number
           of coincident events taking into account the following
           data:
           - the intrinsic efficiency for protons and 16O ions in
           each stage of the forward telescopes,
           - solid angle coverage from a Monte Carlo simulation
           based on the breakup process kinematics, assuming an
           excitation energy of 0.5 MeV above the breakup
           threshold and including the geometry of the EXODET
           apparatus,
           - normalization of the obtained yield to the Rutherford
           cross-section (at forward angles).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S).The statistical error is reported by authors in
           table.
