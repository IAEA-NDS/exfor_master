            An important feature of this system is the large
           secondary beam acceptance of its optics elements and
           its large capability to suppress all the unwanted
           scattered beams.
INC-SOURCE  The  F-17 secondary beam was obtained through the
           reaction p(O-17,F-17)n induced on a H(2) gas target.
SAMPLE     A 1 mg/cm**2 thick Pb-208 self-supporting targets was
           used.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (EXTB)
           (COINC) The exclusive breakup process was studied via
            8-O-16 and p coincidences.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(9-F-17,EL)79-AU-197,,DA) the elastic
           scattering cross section on a 2 mg/cm**2 thick Au-197
           self-supporting target.
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The reaction products were detected with EXODET
           array, consisted of 16 solid state Si detectors
           arranged in 8 two-stage delta-E-E telescopes. Each
           EXODET detector had an active ares of 50 mm*50 mm.
           The thikness of the Si detectors was 40(70) mum for
           six (two) delta-E layers and 500 mum for all the E
           layers.

COMMENT    *By authors*.To identify exclusive breakup events in
           the analysis was required the detection of both the
           O-16 and the proton, by imposing the following
           conditions-the total energy of the two detected
           particles was rewuired to be in the elastic peak
           region.
