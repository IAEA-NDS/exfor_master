COMMENT    *By authors*.The products of complete and incomplete
           fusion from the interaction of Li-6 with Bi-209 are
           mostly alpha-radioactive. The products of the platinum
           targets are gamma-radioactive. The used target
           thicknesses are optimal for investigating products of
           relatively low yields and for the registration of the
           alpha-activity with satisfactory energy resolution.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The yields necessary for calculating the
           production cross sections of Rn-211 and At-211 were
           determined using the difference in their half-lives in
           the decomposition of the experimental decay curves.
           It was found that the formation of At-211 as the
           daughter of Rn-211 is more preferable than through the
           alpha-transfer from Li-6 channel.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The alpha-spectra, from which the yield of
           Po-208 was determined, were measured after more than
           two  half-life periods of Po-210, whose contribution to
           the spectra was then considerably lowered.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The counting rate due to Po-210 was
           measured a few times during several months following
           the irradiation. In this case, the contribution of
           Po-208 could be neglected because of its long half-life
           of 2.9 years.

SAMPLE     The targets were of natural platinum. The main
           contribution is expected to come from the isotopes-
           Pt-194 33%, Pt-195 33.8%, Pt-196 25.3%, Pt-198 7.2%.
           For this reason,the calculations of the cross sections
           of the different channels had to be done accounting for
           the contribution of the different Pt isotopes according
           to their presence in natural platinum.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After the irradiation, the gamma-activity
           induced in the individual gold foils was measured
           off-line using four energy and efficiency-calibrated
           HPGe detectors (the efficiency was about 4-5% for
           E(g)= 662 keV) of high-energy resolution (1.2 keV for
           the gamma-transition at 1332 keV.
ADD-RES    (G-SPC).For the analysis of the gamma-spectra the
           programme DEIMOS32 was used.
COMMENT    *By authors*.The experimental cross sections of the Tl
           isotopes, formed after the evaporation from the
           compound Tl isotopes of three to five neutrons, were
           calculated on the basis of the measured yields
           accounting for the relevant beam dose and time factors,
           the efficiency of the detectors, the absolute intensity
           of the gamma-transitions and the target thickness.

            The induced gamma-ray activity in the Al degraders
           used in the Pt stack served also to monitor the beam
           dose via the cross section for production of Na-24.

COMMENT    *By authors*.The experimental cross sections of the Tl
           isotopes, formed after the evaporation from the
           compound Tl isotopes of three to five neutrons, were
           calculated on the basis of the measured yields
           accounting for the relevant beam dose and time factors,
           the efficiency of the detectors, the absolute intensity
           of the gamma-transitions and the target thickness.
