FACILITY   (ISOCY,2SF ABA) the external beam of the Abo Akademi
           University 103 cm isochronous variable-energy AVF
           cyclotron (MGC-20).
SAMPLE     Nine Hf-foils, nominal thickness 8 mum, purity 97.0%,
           interleaved with Al, 40 and 80 mum and high-purity Cu
           monitor foils, 7 mum.
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,EXTB,GSPEC,BCINT)
           After the irradiation, the Hf foils were analysed with
           a gamma spectrometer. Two sets of measurements were
           done, the first starting after about 24 h decay time,
           the second after about 3 weeks decay time. The 3-week
           decay time for the determination of 177Lu was needed
           because of interfering gamma lines from 177Ta and high
           background produced by other, short-living Ta isotopes.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detector (Canberra GAMMA-X with
           20.7% relative efficiency) used for determining the
           activity was calibrated using 57Co, 60Co, 137Cs and
           152Eu point sources.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main contribution to the uncertainty
            (one standard deviation) in the cross-section values
           comes from the following sources:
           (ERR-1,3.0,8.0). HPGe efficiency calibration 3-8%,
           depending on the energy and the least-squares nuclide
           fit.
           (ERR-2).Error in the beam intensity is 5%.
           (ERR-3).Error in the number of target atoms in the beam
           is 5%.
           (ERR-4).Error in  the peak-area fitting with
           additional exponential tails and background fitted to
           individual peaks is 1%.
           UniSAMPO- Shaman analysis software given the activity
           of the nuclide and associated uncertainty at the end of
           the irradiation. This reported uncertainty includes the
           uncertainties of the efficiency calibration, peak-area
           fitting, the decay data and the half-life. Therefore,
           the estimated uncertainty of the cross-section values
           was obtained by adding quadratically the activity
           uncertainty from UniSAMPO-Shaman to the beam-intensity
           and target-thickness uncertainties.
           (EN-ERR).Uncertainty in the energy is reported by
           authors in table 1-The beam-energy uncertainty is
           estimated to be +-300 keV in the first foils and
           increase to +-750 keV in the last foil.This uncertainty
           includes the energy uncertainty of the extracted beam,
           the effect of the non-uniform foil thicknesses as well
           as uncertainties in the mean mass thicknesses and the
           initial beam-energy spread.
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).The thick-target yields derived from the
           calculated cross section values.
STATUS     (TABLE) date from the Table 2.
