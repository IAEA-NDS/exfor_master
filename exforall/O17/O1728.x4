COMMENT    -By compiler. If a nucleus has isomer state, but data
           heading  "ISOMER" contains space only, production cross
           section includes isomer state production too.
FLAG       (1.).The presented values of the yields have been
            obtained from experimental data via simple
            calculations.

ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.

           Total determination of the cross section see in
           ISTC#2002.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           efficiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.

COMMENT    -By compiler. If a nucleus has isomer state, but data
           heading  "ISOMER" contains space only, production cross
           section includes isomer state production too.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           efficiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.

COMMENT    - By author. Cumulative cross section is usual sum of
           a nuclide independent cross section and cumulative
           cross section of progenitor.

           Y-87 are "supracumulative" cross  sections. Total
           determination of the cross section see in ISTC#2002.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.

           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.

COMMENT    -By compiler. If a nucleus has isomer state, but data
           heading  "ISOMER" contains space only, production cross
           section includes isomer state production too.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           efficiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.

COMMENT    - By author. Cumulative cross section is usual sum of
           a nuclide independent cross section and cumulative
           cross section of progenitor.
           Production  cross  sections for Pb-201, Tl-201, Tl-199,
           Pb-199, Tl-197, Pb-203, Pb-197-M, Pb-196, Tl-195,
           Hg-197, Hg-195, Hg-190, Au-191, Ir-187, Ir-184,
           Os-183-m, Re-181, Re-179, Re-178, Ta-177, Ta-172,
           Hf-173, Lu-171, Lu-170, Yb-169, Er-161, Er-159, Ho-156,
           Dy-155, Tb-155, Tb-153, Tb-152, Eu-149, Eu-147, Nb-90,
           Y-87 are "supracumulative" cross  sections. Total
           determination of the cross section see in ISTC#2002.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.
FLAG       (1.).The presented values of the yields have been
            obtained from experimental data via simple
            calculations.

COMMENT    -By compiler. If a nucleus has isomer state, but data
           heading  "ISOMER" contains space only, production cross
           section includes isomer state production too.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           efficiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.
FLAG       (1.).The presented values of the yields have been
            obtained from experimental data via simple
            calculations.

COMMENT    - By author. Cumulative cross section is usual sum of
           a nuclide independent cross section and cumulative
           cross section of progenitor.
           Production  cross  sections for Pb-201, Tl-201, Tl-199,
           Pb-199, Tl-197, Pb-203, Pb-197-M, Pb-196, Tl-195,
           Hg-197, Hg-195, Hg-190, Au-191, Ir-187, Ir-184,
           Os-183-m, Re-181, Re-179, Re-178, Ta-177, Ta-172,
           Hf-173, Lu-171, Lu-170, Yb-169, Er-161, Er-159, Ho-156,
           Dy-155, Tb-155, Tb-153, Tb-152, Eu-149, Eu-147, Nb-90,
           Y-87 are "supracumulative" cross  sections. Total
           determination of the cross section see in ISTC#2002.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.
FLAG       (1.).The presented values of the yields have been
            obtained from experimental data via simple
            calculations.

COMMENT    -By compiler. If a nucleus has isomer state, but data
           heading  "ISOMER" contains space only, production cross
           section includes isomer state production too.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.

COMMENT    - By author. Cumulative cross section is usual sum of
           a nuclide independent cross section and cumulative
           cross section of progenitor.
           Production  cross  sections for Pb-201, Tl-201, Tl-199,
           Pb-199, Tl-197, Pb-203, Pb-197-M, Pb-196, Tl-195,
           Hg-197, Hg-195, Hg-190, Au-191, Ir-187, Ir-184,
           Os-183-m, Re-181, Re-179, Re-178, Ta-177, Ta-172,
           Hf-173, Lu-171, Lu-170, Yb-169, Er-161, Er-159, Ho-156,
           Dy-155, Tb-155, Tb-153, Tb-152, Eu-149, Eu-147, Nb-90,
           Y-87 are "supracumulative" cross  sections. Total
           determination of the cross section see in ISTC#2002.
ERR-ANALYS The error in the presented cross sections for
           production of residuals consists of the errors in their
           production rates and the errors in determining the
           proton flux densities. The major uncertainties of
           reaction rates are represented by statistical error,
           by absolute spectrometer effectiveness and by
           uncertainty in absolute abundance, but the absolute
           spectrometer effectiveness alone counts in
           uncertainties of the monitoring reaction rates.
           The uncertainty in proton flux density is determined
           solely by the monitoring reaction cross section
           uncertainty.
           (ERR-S,0.05,71.82).Statistical error of count rate in
           total absorption peak with due allowance for correction
           of unresolved gamma-lines, background under the peak
           and gamma-spectrum transients and allowing for the dead
           time and count loss of the spectrometer.
           (ERR-1,0.00,5.07).Uncertainty of correction for gamma-
           quantum absorption in a sample.
           (ERR-2,3.23,4.32).Uncertainty of absolute detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-3,1.04,3.03).Uncertainty of relative detection
           effectiveness of spectrometer.
           (ERR-4,0.00,16.67).Uncertainty of absolute quantum
           yield of gamma-lines.
           (ERR-5,0.03,0.10).Uncertainty of the number of
           experimental sample nuclei.
           (ERR-T).Total uncertainty.
FLAG       (1.).The presented values of the yields have been
            obtained from experimental data via simple
            calculations.
