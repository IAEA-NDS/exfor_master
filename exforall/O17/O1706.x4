TITLE      Production of the Auger emitter Sb-119 for targeted
           radionuclide therapy using a small PET-cyclotron.
AUTHOR     (H.Thisgaard, M.Jensen)

INSTITUTE  (2DENRIS)
           (2DENCOP)
SAMPLE     Sn-119 metal, enriched to 97.4%, was rolled to two thin
           foils with mean thicknesses of 5.34 and 11.73 mg/cm**2,
           respectivily. The thicknesses were determined from the
           weight and area of the foils.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2DENRIS) The PET cyclotron
DETECTOR   (GE) A calibrated Ge detector was used for measuring
           the monitor foils and the enriched Sn-119 foils for any
           produced Sb-118-m and other impurities.
           (SILI) For determining the produced Sb-119 activities
           a calibrated Si(Li) detector or a low-energy Ge
           detector was used.
CORRECTION  The Sb-119 activities were corrected for any
           simultaneously produced Sn-119-m(T(1/2)=293.1 d), which
           emits a single gamma-ray of the same energy-23.87 keV,
           by measuring the targets after the Sb-119 had decayed.
           The attenuation of the 23.87 keV gamma-ray in the
           Sn-119 foils was calculated to be maximum 8%.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (ACTIV)
           (EXTB) three stacks were irradiated for 20 min using
           the external proton beam.
           (BCINT)
           (CHSEP)
MONITOR    (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-63,,SIG)
           (29-CU-0(P,X)30-ZN-62,,SIG) precision Cu monitor foils
            were used in all stacks to determine the energy of the
            beam via the monitor reactions.
ADD-RES     The measured beam current from the Faraday-cup-like
           target holder is reported also.
           A calculation of the thick target Sb-119 yield in
           saturation per muA based on the fit to the measured
           cross sections was made and reported on figure 4.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The total uncertainty of each cross section is
            6-7% and was calculated by combining the contributing
           errors in quadrature-
           (ERR-1).Error in beam current.
           (ERR-2).Error in target foil thickness.
           (ERR-3,4.0,6.0).Error in activity measurement is 4-6%,
            including detector efficiency 3%.
           (ERR-4).Error in detector efficiency .
           (ERR-5,3.0,5.0).Error in nuclear data is 3-5%.
           (ERR-6).Errors due to counting statistics.
           (EN-ERR).The energy error is reported in table.
