METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After the irradiations, the targets
           were subjected to adaptations of standard
           radiochemical procedures. Absolute beta or gamma
           counting was accomplished with proportional counter
           and NaI crystal.

SAMPLE     Reagent-grade CsCl powder deposited on glass-fiber
           paper.
ANALYSIS   These data have been expanded and corrected as
           follows: (1) additional bombardments have been
           performed, (2) the total (d,2n) cross-sections
            (i.e., for the isomer + ground state) have also been
           obtained, a procedure which required counting the
           7.2y Ba133 after all of the isomer had decayed, and
            (3) a re-evaluation of the Ba133m yields on the basis
           of newer internal conversion coefficients which
           differ appreciably from those used in the earlier
           calculations.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The data processing included a detailed
           evaluation of the errors in both the cross sections
           and the bombarding energies, as well as a
           re-evaluation of all previously reported results.
DECAY-DATA (56-BA-133-G,7.2YR)  Today's value is 10.5 yr.

ANALYSIS   No additional work has been undertaken on the
           previous measurement. However, the cross sections
           which were given in last year's TID-21525 report
            (Table XVIIl) have been re-evaluated on the basis of
           newer decay-scheme information. The corrected cross
           sections, which differ by 11% from those reported
           earlier, are shown.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The data processing included a detailed
           evaluation of the errors in both the cross sections
           and the bombarding energies, as well as a
           re-evaluation of all previously reported results.
