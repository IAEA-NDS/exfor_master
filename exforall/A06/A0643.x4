SAMPLE     (54-XE-124,ENR=0.999) Six thin gaseous targets
            [16.6 mg/cm2] enriched to 99.9% 124-Xe were irradiared
           simultaneously.
MONITOR    (29-CU-65(P,N)30-ZN-65,,SIG,,,EVAL)
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge (Li)-detector and a multichannel analyzer
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFEI)
METHOD     (STTA)
           (GSPEC) Activity 123-I was measured at 16, 42, and 64
           hours after irradiation.
           (ACTIV)
           (EXTB)  Beam current was 0.5 mu-Ampere.

REACTION   (54-XE-124(P,X)53-I-123,CUM,TTY,,PHY)
COMMENT    - By compiler - Main channel reaction is
           54-Xe-124(P,2N)55-Cs-123.
           -By author - 121-Te activity was observed. The activity
           is product of radioactive decay of 121-I produced by
           124-Xe(P,A)121-I reaction.
           *by compiler* the angle between X and Y axes
           on this figure is not equal 90 degr.
            This deviation is -2.62E-02 radians.
DECAY-DATA (53-I-123,,DG,153.97,0.834)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error in determining the yield values.
           No information about partial uncertainties.
