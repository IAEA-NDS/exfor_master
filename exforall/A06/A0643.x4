SAMPLE     Six Thin Gaseous Target [16.6 Milligramm/Cm-Sq]
           Enriched to 99.9% 124-Xe were Irradiared
           Simultaneously.

DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFEI)
METHOD     (STTA)
           (GSPEC) Activity 123-I was Measured at 16, 42, and 64
           Hours After Irradiation.
           (ACTIV)
           (EXTB)  Beam Current was 0.5 Mu-Ampere.

REACTION   (54-XE-124(P,2P)53-I-123,CUM,TTY,,DT,EXP)
COMMENT    - By Compiler - Main Channel Reaction is
           54-Xe-124(P,2N)55-Cs-123.
           -By Author - 121-Te Activity was Observed. The Activity
           Is Product of Radioactive Decay of 121-I Produced by
           124-Xe(P,A)121-I Reaction.
           *by Compiler* the Angle Between X and Y Axes
