           Calcutta.
METHOD     (STTA) Stacks of self-supporting metallic foils
           (GSPEC)
           (ACTIV) Beam currents of the order of 250 nano-amperes
           for vanadium stacks and 450 nano-amperes for cobalt
           stacks were maintained for 3 and 2 hours, respectively.

ANALYSIS   (AREA)
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE) 95 cm3 Ge(Li) and 50 cm3 HPGe detectors
           having a resolution of 2 keV for 1332 keV photons.
           The energy and efficiency calibration of the detectors
           were performed by using a standard 152Eu source
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T).The overall error in the cross-section
           measurement is less than 15%, which composed of:
           (ERR-1,2.,5.).Uncertainty in the photopeak area.
           (ERR-2,3.,4.).Uncertainty in the detection efficiency.
           (ERR-3,1.,2.).Uncertainty in the Foil Thickness.
           (ERR-4,0.02,3.94).Uncertainty in the spectroscopic
           data.
           (ERR-5).Uncertainty in the flux monitor
SAMPLE     Natural vanadium and cobalt, purity better 99.99%)
           was used for making the targets.  See Method also.
