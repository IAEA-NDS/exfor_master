ADD-RES    (COMP) Pre-Equilibrium Model, Geometry Dependent
           Hibrid Model.
SAMPLE     Rhodium foils of thickness 1.24 mg/cm**2. The purity
           of the material was better than 99.9% specpure.
           Aluminium degraders of thickness 6.25 mg/cm**2 were
           used for degrading the alpha-particle beam incident
           on individual foils.
DETECTOR   (GELI) A high resolution (FWHM 2 keV at 1.33 MeV)
           100 cm3 ORTEC Ge(Li) detector, coupled with a
           precalibrated 4096 channel CARBERRA-88 analyzer and
           associated electronics. 152Eu standard gamma source of
           known strength was used for energy and efficiency
           calibration, by keeping it at target position.
FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDVEC) Variable Energy Cyclotron at VECC,
           Calcutta,India.
METHOD     (STTA) Six rhodium foils were used.
           (BCINT)
           (ACTIV) Irradiation and cooling times are unknown
           (GSPEC) Number of measurements and duration its are
           unknown.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information about source of uncertainties
           (EN-ERR) Alpha-particle energy spread within the target
           thickness along with the inherent uncertainty in the
           alpha-particle beam
STATUS     (TABLE) Tbl.1 from IMP/E,5,345,1996
COMMENT    The measured excitation functions for the reactions
           are the weighted average of the cross sections values
           corresponding to various identified gamma-rays, weak
           gamma-rays, as well as gamma-rays having energies
           higher than 1.5 MeV, are not taken into consideration
           because of their low detection efficiencies.
