            (p,alpha) reactions on 10-B and 11-B at thermal
           energies.

PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 4 surface barrier Si-detectors were positioned
           at 130 degrees [lab-system] around the beam axis at a
           mean distance of 40 mm, approximately.
           The detectors were covered by nickel foils to stop
           the intense flux of scattered particles.
           Characteristics of detectors:  active area - 6 cm-sq,
           effective thickness - 300 mu-m, energy resolution -
           22 keV at 5.5 MeV alpha-particles.
FACILITY   (CCW,2GERBOC) 100 and 400 kV accelerators.
INC-SPECT   Uncertainty in energy depends on accelerator:
                               100 kV                 400kV
             absolute energy:   +- 26eV               +- 1.keV
             energy spread:        20eV                  1.keV
            This uncertainty was taken into account in ERR-1
METHOD     (EXTB) The 100 and 400 kV accelerators provided H1+,H2+
           and H3+ ion beams in the proton energy range 17-150 keV
           (SITA)
           (BCINT) Secondary electrons were suppressed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Errors arise from uncertainties in number of
           counts, effective energy, and target deterioration.
           (ERR-2) Uncertainties due to solid angle
           (ERR-3) Uncertainties due to effective stopping power
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty of beam current.
ADD-RES    Electron screening potential for H+B system was
           determined as 430+/-80 eV.
           The paper contains very much experimental details,
           which could not be included in the compilation.
COMMENT    - By authors.  Effective energy (En-cm) in data
           sections corresponds to that energy within the  target,
           at which one-half of the reaction yield is obtained.
           - By authors - in the measurements at low energies, the
           target chamber was surrounded by a 5 cm thick lead
           shield and a plastic scintillator of 1.2 m2 area and
           5 cm thickness was placed above the taget chamber.
           Both components were used to identify and reduce the
           contributions of cosmic rays and room background.

SAMPLE     Boron targets were enriched to 93% in B-10. Three
           targets with thicknesses 100, 107, and 86 mu-g/cm2
           were used.
REL-REF    (O,A0638002,C.Angulo+,J,ZP/A,345,333,1993) Cross
           section for first excited state (429 keV) of Be-7
           production.
CORRECTION The resulting count rates were corrected for dead time
           effects (< 2%) as well as for the observed yield
           decrease as a function of accumulated charge of target.
COMMENT    - By compiler - the authors measured cross section for
           ground state of Be-7 production only.
