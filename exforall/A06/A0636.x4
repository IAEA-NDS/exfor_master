PART-DET   (A)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) 4 surface barrier Si-detectors were positioned
           at 130 degrees [lab-system] around the beam axis at a
           mean distance of 40 mm, approximately.
           The detectors were covered by nickel foils to stop
           the intense flux of scattered particles.
           Characteristics of detectors:  active area - 6 cm-sq,
           effective thickness - 300 mumeters, energy resolution -
           22 KeV at 5.5 MeV alpha-particles.
FACILITY   (CCW,2GERBOC) 100 and 400 KeV accelerators.
METHOD     (EXTB) The 100 and 400 KeV accelerators provided H1+,
           H2+, and H3+ ion beams in the proton energ range 17-150
           KeV.
           (SITA)
           (BCINT) Secondary electrons were suppressed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Errors quoted arise from uncertainties in
           number of counts, effective energy, and target
           deterioration.
           (ERR-2) Common error due to uncertainties in proton
           fluence, solid angle, and effective stopping power.
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty of beam current.
           (EN-ERR1) Uncertainty in absolute laboratory energy of
           proton beam for 100 KeV accelerator.
           (EN-ERR2) Uncertainty in absolute laboratory energy of
           proton for 400 KeV accelerator.
           (ERR-4) Energy spread for 100 KeV accelerator.
           (ERR-5) Energy spread for 400 KeV accelerator.

ADD-RES    Electron screening potential for H+B system was
           determined as 430+/-80 eV.
           The paper contains very much experimental details,
           which could not be included in the compilation.
COMMENT    - By authors.  Effective energy (en-cm) in data
           sections corresponds to that energy within the  target,
           at which one-half of the reaction yield is obtained.
           - By authors - in the measurements at low energies, the
           target chamber was surrounded by a 5 cm thick lead
           shield and a plastic scintillator of 1.2 m-sq area and
           5 cm thickness was placed above the taget chamber.
           Both components were used to identify and reduce the
           contributions of cosmic rays and room background.

SAMPLE     Boron targets were enriched to 93% in B-10. Three
           targets with thicknesses 100, 107, and 86 mugramm/cm-sq
           were used.

           production.
CORRECTION The resulting count rates were corrected for dead time
           effects (< 2%) as well as for the observed yield
           decrease as a function of accumulated charge of target.
COMMENT    - By compiler - the authors measured cross section for
           ground state of Be-7 production only.
