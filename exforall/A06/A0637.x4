TITLE      The differential cross section of elastic proton-proton
           scattering at 50 MeV.

SAMPLE     Solid target consisting of a small pastille (diameter=
           2mm  and 7 mumeters thick) of polyethylene deposited on
           a self-supporting thin carbon foil.  The polyethylene
           is pure to better than 0.2%.
           in order to subtract the background due to the C(p,2p)x
           reaction a carbon target (100 mu-gramm/cm-sq) was
           measured also.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 3mm and 1mm thick silicon superconductor detect
           used as transmission counters.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2SWTNEU)
METHOD     (COINC) the outgoing protons.  Both the forward and the
           recoil were detected in coincidence.
           (SITA) see sample
           (EXTB) the beam divergence was less than 0.1 Degree.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) errors are statistical only and include errors
           due to background subtraction and to the monitoring.
           (ERR-1) an additional common error is due to the
           normalization uncertainty.
           (EN-ERR) beam energy uncertainty.
