TITLE      A study of pre-equilibrium emission in alpha-induced
           reactions on 121,123Sb.

INSTITUTE  (3INDMUA)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3INDVEC)  Variable Energy Cyclotron Center,
           Calcutta.
METHOD     (STTA) Energy degrading aluminium foils were used
           to get the desired alpha-particle energy incident on
           each foil.
           (GSPEC) The reaction cross section is determined
           individually for each of emitted gamma rays and finally
           their weighted average is taken.
           (ACTIV) Beam currents of the order of 100 nano-amperes
           were used. the irradiation period was about 2 hours.
           (EXTB) 60-MeV diffused beam.
           (BCINT) The flux of the a beam calculated from the
           charge collected in the Faraday cup was
                           =8.47 x l10**11 (alpha particles/s/cm2.
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY)
DETECTOR   (GELI) A high-resolution 100 ml Ge(Li) detector coupled
           to a multichannel analyzer was used. Detector was
           calibrated using various standard gamma sources
           including a 152Eu source..
CORRECTION Needed correction for dead time were included.
SAMPLE     Natural antimony of spectroscopic purity better 99.9%
            (natural abundance 121Sb = 57.3% and 123Sb = 42.7%)
           was used for ma king the targets.
           Targets were prepared using a vacuum evaporation
           technique, to a thickness of 1mg/cm2 of antimony on
           an aluminium backing of thickness 6.75 mg/cm2.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Preequilibrium model. Code "ACT" based on the
           lines of code "STAPRE".
CRITIQUE   The authors do not give production yields on natural
           target of antimony but deduced yield for separate
           isotopes.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors are given on figs (the size
           of the circle includes the magnitude of the statistical
           errors if no error bar is plotted.)
           (ERR-1,,1.) Errors in the estimation of the number of
           target nuclei and nonuniform deposition of sample.
           (ERR-2,,4.) Fluctuation in the beam current,
             * Uncertainty of detector efficiency, straggling
           effects may introduce certain errors but are neglected
           because for alpha particles the energy straggling at
           the end of the stack is always much smaller than the
           energy loss of beam in the target foil itself.
           The influence of low-energy neutrons is also negligible
           (EN-ERR) Energy spread in the alpha-particle beam
           facing each foil given as horizontal bars on figs.
