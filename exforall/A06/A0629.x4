TITLE      A Study of Pre-Equilibrium Emission in Alpha-Induced
           Reactions on 121,123Sb.
AUTHOR     (B.P.SINGH, H.D.BHARDWAJ, R.PRASAD)

INSTITUTE  (3INDMUA)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDIND)  Variable Energy Cyclotron Center,
           Calcutta.
METHOD     (STTA) Energy Degrading Aluminium Foils were Used
           To Get the Desiried Alpha-Particle Energy Incident on
           Each Foil.
           (GSPEC) The Reaction Cross Section is Determined
           Individually For Each of Emmited Gamma Rays and Finally
           Their Weighted Average is Taken.
           (ACTIV) Beam Currents of the Order of 100 Nano-Amperes
           Were Used. The Irradiation Period was About 2 Hours.
           (EXTB) 60-MeV Diffused Beam.
           (BCINT)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
           (DECAY)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
CORRECTION Needed Correction For Dead Time were Included.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy Spread in the Alpha-Particle Beam
           Facing Each Foil was Calculated.
HISTORY    (19990606C) By F.C.
           (19990615U) Last checking has been done.
           (19990621A) DATE is corrected
SAMPLE     Natural Antimony of Spectroscopic Purity Better 99.9%
           Was Used For Making the Targets.
           Targets were Prepared Using a Vacuum Evaporation
           Technique, to a Thickness of 1Mg/Cm-Sq of Antimony on
           An Aluminium Backing of Thickness 6.75 Mg/Cm-Sq.
ADD-RES    (COMP) Preequilibrium Model. Code "Act" Based on the
           Lines of Code "Stapre".
CRITIQUE   The Authors do not Give Production Yields on Natural
           Target of Antimony But Deduced Yield For Separate
           Isotopes.

           The Errors Includes:
           1. Errors in the Estimation of the Number of Target
           Nuclei and Nonuniform Deposition of Sample Material.
           2. Fluctuation in the Beam Current,
           3. Uncertainty of Detector Efficiency,
           Stragling Effects May Introduce Certain Errors But are
           Neglected Because For Alpha Particles the Energy

           Itself.
