FACILITY   (VDGT,2BLGNAM) The 2.5 MV Van de Graff accelerator
SAMPLE     Two silicon samples cut out of a silicon wafer with
           orientation (100) were used as substrates. A thin
           film of alpha-Si-C:H was deposited simultaneously onto
           these two substrates by means of plasma enhanced
           chemical vapor deposition. The standards were
           transferred in air to the analysis chamber, in which
           the typical pressure was 2E-8 mbar during the analysis.
           The composition of the Si-C:H film was measured by
           means of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy on the
           Si-C:H film. The measured ratio was Si/C =0.50.
           The stability of hydrogen contents during the
           bombardment with high energy He-3 beam was verified.
           Prior to the cross section measurement of the
           H-1(He3,p)2-He-3 reaction, a very thin layer of gold
           2.86*10E+15 atoms/cm**2 was evaporated on the
           standard in order to normalize the results.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Three detectors were placed in the analyzing
           chamber pumped down with a turbomolecular pump and the
           residual pressure was lower than 5*10E-7 mbar.
           The first detector was placed at 100 mm from the beam
           impact at 20 or 30 degrees relative to the incident
           beam.
           The second surface barrier detector was placed 70 mm
           from the beam impact at 90 degree relative to the
           incident beam.
           The third detector placed at the backscattering angle
           of 140 degree, was used to measured the integrated beam
           charge with the signal due to the evaporated layer
           of gold on the standard.
METHOD     (BCINT)
STATUS     (TABLE,,G.Terwagne,W,TERWANGE,19990113)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The absolute error on the cross sections
           H-1(He3,p)He3 measured relative to gold is due to three
           different factors. The overall error has been estimated
           to be less than 8%.
           (ERR-S) Statistical errors on the determination of the
           area under the peak due to the nuclear reaction and the
           area under gold information.
           (ERR-2) Systematical errors on the measurements of the
           solid angles.
           (ERR-3) Experimental errors due to the measurement of
           the number of hydrogen atoms and the number of gold
           atoms.
