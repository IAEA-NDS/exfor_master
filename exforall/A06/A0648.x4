           Cs-134 is shielded nuclide.
METHOD     (ASEP).The cesium isotopes produced in small quantities
           in the irradiated targets were separated directly
           inside a surface ionization ion source of an
           electromagnetic isotope separator.  In the apparatus
           chemical separation was based upon the differences of
           volatility and ionization potentials of the elements.
           a first chemical separation took place in the oven
           because of the volatility of these elements. A second
           drastic separation occurred along the heated tantalum
           pipe where only the alkali atoms were ionized.
           an electric field accelerates these ions which are then
           electromagnetically mass separated.  The tantalum was
           selected as the ionizing surface because it is easily
           machined though the electron work function  (W  =  4.19
           eV) is not very large;  nevertheless it is large enough
           to ionize cesium atoms which present a low ionization
           potential (W= 3.89 eV)
           (GSPEC) for the 134-Cs isomeric pair (T1/2(m) = 2.9Hr),
            (T1/2(g) = 2.1 Yr), the population of the two states
           were determined directly by measuring the gamma
           activity of 134-Cs, mass separated and collected  on  5
           mum-thin  aluminum foil.  In this case, the irradiated
           targets were immediately introduced in the graphite
           crucible of the ion source and were progressively
           brought to the melting temperature in order to
           facilitate the diffusion of the alkali element.

REACTION   (57-LA-139(P,X)55-CS-135-M/T,CUM,SIG/RAT)
METHOD     (ASEP) the cesium isotopes produced in small quantities
           in the irradiated targets were separated directly
           inside a surface ionization ion source of an
           electromagnetic isotope separator, or a mass
           spectrometer according to the half-life of the isotopes
           under consideration.  In both apparatus chemical
           separation was based upon the differences of volalility
           and ionization potentials of the elements.
           (GSPEC) for the 135-Cs isomeric pair only the
           population  of the metastable state (T1/2=55min) can be
           determined with this method (isotopic separation,
           collection and gamma-spectroscopy).  Indeed, the very
           long half-life of the ground state (T1/2=2x10**6 yr)
           prevents any activity measurement.  So we used a mass
           spectrometry technique to measure the total cross
           section for production of 135-Cs.  In these two
           determinations, the 132-Cs, also produced in the
           target, was used as an internal monitor and permitted
           the determination of the ratio 135-m-Cs/132-Cs with the
           separator and 135-m+g-Cs/132-Cs with the mass
           spectrometer.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Random error from error bars. For the
           Cs-135 isomeric ratio determination which need at
           same time gamma-counting and mass spectrometry
           techniques, the principal error arise from
           simultaneous collection of very pure Cs-135 and Cs-132
           isotopes in the separator. Random error can
           affect the isomeric ratios by about +-20%.
