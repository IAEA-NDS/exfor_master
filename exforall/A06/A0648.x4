           Cs-134 is Shielded Nuclide.
METHOD     (ASEP) The Cesium Isotopes Produced in Small Quantities
           In the Irradiated Targets were Separated Directly
           Inside a Surface Ionization Ion Source of an
           Electromagnetic Isotope Separator.  In the Apparatus
           Chemical Separation was Based Upon the Differences of
           Volalility and Ionization Potentials of the Elements.
           A First Chemical Separation Took Place in the Oven
           Because of the Volalility of these Elements. A Second
           Drastic Separation Occurred Along the Heated Tantalum
           Pipe Where Only the Alkali Atoms were Ionized.
           An Electric Field Accelerates these Ions Which are Then
           Electromagnetically Mass Separated.  The Tantalum was
           Selected As the Ionizing Surface Because It is Easily
           Machined Though the Electron Work Function  (W  =  4.19
           EV) Is not Very Large;  Nevertheless It is Large Enough
           To Ionize Cesium Atoms Which Present a Low Ionization
           Potential (W= 3.89EV)
           (GSPEC) For the 134-Cs Isomeric Pair (T1/2(M) = 2.9HR),
            (T1/2(G) = 2.1 YR), the Population of the Two States
           Were Determined Directly by Measuring the Gamma
           Activity of 134-Cs, Mass Separated and Collected  on  5
           Mum-Thin  Aluminium Foil.  In this Case, the Irradiated
           Targets were Immediately Introduced in the Graphite
           Crucible of the Ion Source and were Progressively
           Brought to the Melting Temperature in Order to
           Facilitate the Diffusion of the Alkali Element.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Uncertainty is Shown on Figure. The Error
           Are  Essentially Attributable to the Low Gamma-Activity
           Measurement on the Ground State and the Counting
           Efficiency of the Gamma-Ray Detector.

METHOD     (ASEP) The Cesium Isotopes Produced in Small Quantities
           In the Irradiated Targets were Separated Directly
           Inside a Surface Ionization Ion Source of an
           Electromagnetic Isotope Separator, or a Mass
           Spectrometer According to the Half-Life of the Isotopes
           Under Consideration.  In Both Apparatus Chemical
           Separation was Based Upon the Differences of Volalility
           And Ionization Potentials of the Elements.
           (GSPEC) For the 135-Cs Isomeric Pair Only the
           Population  of the Metaslable State (T1/2=55MIN) Can be
           Determined with this Method (ISOTOPIC SEPARATION,
           COLLECTION AND GAMMA-SPECTROSCOPY).  Indeed, the Very
           Long Half-Life of the Ground State (T1/2=2X10**6 YR)
           Prevents any Activity Measurement.  So We Used a Mass
           Spectrometry Technique to Measure the Total Cross
           Section For Production of 135-Cs.  In these Two
           Determinations, the 132-Cs, Also Produced in the
           Target, was Used As an Internal Monitor and Permitted
           The Determination of the Ratio 135-M-Cs/132-Cs with the
           Separator and 135-M+G-Cs/132-Cs with the Mass
           Spectrometer.

COMMENT    - By Author - For the Cs-135 Isomeric Ratio
           Determination Which Need at Same Time Gamma-Counting
           And Mass Spectrometry Techniques, the Principial Error
           Arise from Simultaneous Collection of Very Pure Cs-135
           And Cs-132 Isotopes in the Separator. Random Error can
           Affect the Isomericratios by About +-20%.
