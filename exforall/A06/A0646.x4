TITLE      Production of 155-Tb for nuclear medicine in the
           reactions 155-Gd(p,n), 156-Gd(p,2n), and 155-Gd(d,2n)

           (M,A0094001,P.P.Dmitriev+,J,AE,48,402,1980) Methods of
           product activity and irradiation current measurement.
MONITOR    Copper foils were used to measure the integrated
           bombardment current
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFEI)
METHOD     (EXTB)
           (ACTIV)
           (GSPEC) Gamma spectra were measured at 20 days after
           end of bombardment.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total uncertainty from error bars on figs.
           Uncertainties of measured yields are:
           1. For Tb-155 - 14-17%.
           2. For Tb-156 - 12-15%.
           Main sources of the uncertainties are uncertainties of
           activity and beam current measurements.
SAMPLE     Gd(2)O(3), natural.
