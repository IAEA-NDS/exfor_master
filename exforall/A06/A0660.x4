REL-REF    (I,A0661001,A.Korejwo+,J,JP/G,26,1171,2000) Data for
           3.66 GeV/nucleon and more detailed description of
           experimental device. Positions of some detectors were
           changed only.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,4ZZZDUB) Slow extraction beam VP-1
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The ANOMALON magnetic spectrometer is based on a
           system of multiwire proportional chambers (MWPC) and an
           analyzing magnet. It also includes a Cherenkov
           hodoscope for determining fragment charges, a trigger
           system consisting of scintillation and Cherenkov
           detectors, and a beam monitor. For the beam
           fragmentation cross section measurements the ANOMALON
           set-up was equipped with a liquid hydrogen target.
           MWPCs constitute a coordinate detector for determining
           The positions of the charged-particle tracks.

SAMPLE     The target is 59 mm in diameter and 136 mm long
            (equivalent to 0.94 g/cm2). The total thickness of
           the two Mylar windows is 67 mg/cm2.
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,COINC)
CORRECTION The background correction factor has been calculated
           separately for each isotope using the results of
           measurements with an empty target and with hydrogen.
           Cross-section results have been corrected by a constant
           factor connected with the obtained value of the
           inelastic cross section (250+-2 mb).
ADD-RES    (COMP) Comparison of the results with other
           experimental data and predictions.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty
           At 2.69 GeV/n a simplified method of error calculation
           has been applied because of the absence of background
           measurements; in this case only the total errors were
           estimated - the systematic and statistical errors
           together.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error.
           (ERR-1) The systematic errors are due mainly to
           uncertainty regarding the efficiency of track
           reconstruction (varying with Z). Other factors being
           negligible.
