FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDTRM)
           (VDGT,3INDIND) The experiments for the measurement of
           excitation functions were  carried  out  partly  (50-71
           MeV) at the Nuclear Science Center pelletron facility,
            New Delhi and partly (76-84 MeV) at the BARC pelletron
           accelerator at Mumbai.
SAMPLE     Self-supporting ~600 mug/cm2 rhodium metal foils.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY,AREA)
METHOD     (EXTB) 12-C beam.
           (ACTIV) An irradiation time of about 1-2 hours was
           selected according to the half lives of the
           radioisotopes produced. The total charge collected for
           each irradiation was about 400-600 microCoulombs.
           (BCINT)
           (STTA) The stacks of three self-supported rhodium metal
           target foils interspersed with 2-mg/cm2-thick Al foils.
           (GSPEC)
HISTORY    (20040705C)
           (20040713R) Data tables were recieved from S.Mukherjee
           (20050120A) Reaction line is corrected in A0682008
           (20050120U) Last checking has been done.
STATUS     (TABLE)
ADD-RES    (COMP) PACE2 code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the cross section arises mostly
           from:
           1.  The counting statistics (1-4%),
           2.  Target thickness (5 - 8%),
           3.  Detection efficiency (4%),
           4.  Beam fluence (<5%),
           5.  Gamma-ray intensity values (5-10%).

COMMENT    -By authors.  The excitation functions for the 111Sn
           agree well with the PACE code calculations.  It is
           quite obvious as the Sn products originate from
           the Complete Fusion process.

           and 110-In agree with the theoretical predictions while
           those of 109-In show an enhancement.  It can be

           the Complete Fusion  process while 109-In have
           contributions from the Incomplete Fusion involving the
           breakup of 12-C into alpha+8Be and the subsequent
           fusion of 8Be with target forming 111In*.  This
           incompletely fused composite nucleus emits further
           neutrons forming 109-In.
