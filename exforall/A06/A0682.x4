SAMPLE      In NSD experiment stacks of three self-supporting
           ~600 mug/cm2 rhodium metal foils  interspersed  with
           2-mg/cm2-thick Al foils were used.
            In TRM targets of metallic rhodium of thickness
           around 100 mu-gm/cm2 with 100 mu-gm/cm2 Al backing
           were used. The catchers used were evaporated aluminum
           foils, typically 100 mugm/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) precalibrated 60cc HPGe detector coupled
                  to a 4 K MCA.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY,AREA)
METHOD     (EXTB) 12-C beam.
           (ACTIV) An irradiation time of about 1-2 hours was
           selected according to the half lives of the
           radioisotopes produced. The total charge collected for
           each irradiation was about 400-600 microCoulombs.

STATUS     (TABLE) Data were received from authors.
ADD-RES    (COMP) PACE2 code.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the cross section arises mostly
           from:
           (ERR-S,1.,4.) Uncertainty in counting statistics (1-4%)
           (ERR-1,5.,6.) Uncertainty in target thickness (5 - 8%),
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in detection efficiency (4%),
           (ERR-3,,5.) Uncertainty in beam fluence (<5%),
           (ERR-4,5.,10.) Uncertainty in gamma-ray intensity
                                                   values (5-10%).

COMMENT    -By authors.  The excitation functions for the 111Sn
           agree well with the PACE code calculations.  It is
           quite obvious as the Sn products originate from
           the Complete Fusion process.

           contributions from the Incomplete Fusion involving the
           breakup of 12-C into alpha+8Be and the subsequent
           fusion of 8Be with target forming 111In*.  This
