SAMPLE     Natural gallium oxide deposits of thickness 0.9 mg/cm2
           were made on thin aluminium backing of thickness
           6.75 mg/cm2. Energy degrading aluminium foils of
           thickness 20.387 and 6.75 mg/cm2 whenever required, to
           get the desired alpha-particle energy incident on
           each foil.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Total energy spread associated with each
           incident alpha-particle energy (horizontal bars
           on figs)
           (ERR-S) Statistical error. The statistical error
           given in the results is the larger one of the internal
           and external errors (see REL-REF). In general these are
           less than 12%, except for a few points.
           Straggling effects are expected to be negligibly small.

REACTION   (31-GA-69(A,2N)33-AS-71,,SIG)
COMMENT    - By Author - Below the threshold the Ga-71(alpha,4n)
           reaction [i.e., 33.920 MeV], the measured excitation
           function is due to the Ga-69(alpha,2n) reaction only.
           Therefore, the measured excitation function for
           Ga-69(alpha,2n) reaction, below the threshold for
           Ga-71(alpha,4n) reaction, was reproduced first from the
           theoretical calculations.  The calculated excitation
           function was then extended in the region of overlap
            [>33.920 MeV] using the same set of parameters.

COMMENT    - By Author - For natural gallium one more reaction
           channel Ga-71(alpha,5n)As-70 opens at the offset of
           available alpha-particle energy [ i.e., at 46.2 MeV],
           whereas the same product nucleus is produced.  By
           theoretical  calculation we find that the cross section
           for the reaction Ga-71(alpha,5n) is of the order of a
           few millibarns up to 60 MeV, and hence the contribution
           from Ga-69(alpha,3n) is predominant.
