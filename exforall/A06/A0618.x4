SAMPLE     Natural silicon (92.17% Si-28, 4.71% Si-29, 3.12%
           Si-30) was used as a target. The thickness of the
           targets was determined by weighting. Target thickness
           was 40 mg/cm2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error. Sum error of cross section
           depended on statistical error (~15-20%).
