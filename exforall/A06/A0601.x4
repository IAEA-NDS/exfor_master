           The details of the measurement of efficiency of the
           detector and the measurement of different quantities
           and their uncertainties in the determination of
           gamma-ray cross sections.

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDIND) The 14UD Pelletron accelerator at the
            Nuclear Science Centre, New Delhi.
METHOD     (SITA) The target was Si-O/2 (self-supporting) having
           oxygen content (18.0+/-1.1)E+17 nuclei/cm2, measured
           from the elastic scattering data obtained with heavy
           ion detectors.
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC) The total g-ray yield was obtained by summing
           the cross sections of 0.332 (21-Na), 0.351, 1.121,
           1.395 (21-Ne), 0.937 (18-F), 1.634 (20-Ne), and
           5.270+5.299 (15-N) MeV gamma-rays.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector was placed at 90 degree with
           respect to the beam axis.
COMMENT    - By authors.  The anisotropy of the angular
           distribution of the gamma rays used in the
           determination of fusion cross section was investigated,
           and was found to be negligible.
