           The details of the measurement of efficiency of the
           detector and the measurement of different quantities
           and their uncertainties in the determination of
           gamma-ray cross sections were described in all refs.

FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) The 14UD Pelletron accelerator at the
            Nuclear Science Centre, New Delhi.
METHOD     (SITA) The target was Si-O/2 (self-supporting) having
           oxygen content (18.0+/-1.1) x 10**17 nuclei/cm2,
           measured from the elastic scattering data obtained
           with heavy ion detectors.
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detector was placed at 90 degree with
           respect to the beam axis.

ANALYSIS   The total gamma-ray yield was obtained by
           summing the cross sections of 0.332 (21-Na), 0.351,
           1.395 (21-Ne), 0.937 (18-F), 1.634 (20-Ne), and
           1.121, 5.270 + 5.299 (15-N) MeV gamma-rays.
            The total fusion cross sections were obtained from
           the total gamma-ray cross sections, dividing the
           latter by the correction factor Fg, as described
           in ref.(see REL-REF).
           The anisotropy of the angular distribution of the
           gamma rays used in the determination of fusion cross
           section was investigated, and was found to be
           negligible.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Uncertainty in fusion cross section includes:
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty in Fg;
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in gamma-ray cross sections
