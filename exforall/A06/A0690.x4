           scattering of 6Li+28Si at near-barrier energies.
           Details of measurement method
FACILITY   (VDGT,2GRCATH)
SAMPLE     A 180-ug/cm2-thick, self-supported natural silicon
           target, tilted by +/- 40 degree (depending on the
           detector position). A liquid-nitrogen cold trap close
           to the target holder reduced the target contamination
           on carbon to minimum.
MONITOR    (14-SI-28(3-LI-6,EL)14-SI-28,,DA) The scattering at
           +/- 15 degree, concerning the present bombarding
           energies, can be considered as being pure Rutherford.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) The dE silicon detector was 10 um
           thick, while the E detector was 300 um thick
           measuring the forward-angle scattering. The alpha
           group was well discriminated in the forward detectors
           with the dE-E technique.
           (SIBAR) A thin, 20- or 25- um - thick silicon
           detector measuring the backward scattering. The
           choice of the thickness of the backward detector was
           such as to allow light particles, like alphas from
           breakup transfer and other contaminant reactions
            (6Li+12C), to go through while Li particles stop in
           the detector.
           (SILI) two monitor Si(Li) detectors, 300 um thick, at
           15.degr., fixed on a top table concentric to the
           bottom rotating one and measuring the elastic
           scattering of lithium.
METHOD     (EXTB) 6Li+ beam. Beam currents were of the order of
           30 nA.
           (EDE) The alpha group was well discriminated in the
           forward detectors with the DE-E technique.
