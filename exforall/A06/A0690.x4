           scattering of 6Li+28Si at near-barrier energies.
           Details of measurements method
SAMPLE     A 180-mug/cm2-thick, self-supported natural silicon
           target, tilted by +/- 40 degree (depending on the
           detector position).  A liquid-nitrogen cold trap close
           to the target holder reduced the target contamination
           on carbon to minimum.
MONITOR    (14-SI-28(3-LI-6,EL)14-SI-28,,DA)  The scattering at
           +/- 15 degree, concerning the present bombarding
           energies, can be considered as being pure Rutherford.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) The DE silicon detector was 10
           micrometers thick, while the E detector was 300
           micrometers thick measuring the forward-angle
           scattering. The alpha group was well discriminated in
           the forward detectors with the DE-E technique.
           (SIBAR)  A thin, 20- or 25- micrometers - thick silicon
           detector measuring the backward scattering.  The choice
           of the thickness of the backward detector was such as
           to allow light particles, like alphas from breakup
           transfer and other contaminant reactions (6Li+12C), to
           go through while Li particles stop in the detector.
METHOD     (EXTB) 6Li+ beam.  Beam currents were of the order of
           30 nA.
           (EDE) The alpha group was well discriminated in the
           forward detectors with the DE-E technique.
