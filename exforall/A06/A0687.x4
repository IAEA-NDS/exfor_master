SAMPLE     The 232-Th target was either a 1.8 mg/cm2 rolled
           thorium foil or a 250 mug/cm2 thin layer of thorium,
           deposited on a 600 mug/cm2 aluminum foil.
           The 235-U target was of thickness 300-400 mug/cm2,
           electrodeposited on a 600 mug/cm2 aluminum  foil.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) E-DE Silicon surface barrier
           telescopes.   DE Detectors are fully depleted silicon
           detectors having an active area of 70-100 mm2 and of
           thickness 10-12 microns.  The E detectors are either
           fully  depleted or partially depleted silicon detectors
           having an active area of 150 mm2 and a thickness of 300
           microns.
           (SIBAR) Two the detectors were used to monitor beam
           intensity.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDNSD) 15UD Pelletron accelerator was used for
           the measurements of the 14N+232Th system.
           (VDGT,3INDTRM) 14UD Pelletron was used to measure
           fission of 11B+235U.
METHOD     (EXTB) 12-C beam.  All beam energy values are corrected
           for energy loss in the target.
           Clearly separated from the rest of the reaction
           products.

ADD-RES    (COMP) The measured fission fragment anisotropies for
           the systems are compared with the different model

           saddlepoint model.  Fitted angular distributions were
           integrated to get the total cross sections.

STATUS     (DEP,A0687003)
ANALYSIS   (INTAD)  The angular distributions were measured at six
           energies spanning the entire energy region from 52 to
           72 MeV.  Saddle-point model expression of angular
           distribution was used to fit the angular distribution
           data.
REL-REF    (R,,J.D.BIERMAN+,J,PR/C,54,3068,1996)
COMMENT    -By authors.  Cross sections at other energies were
           determined by measuring the fission cross section at
           one particular angle and employing the procedure, as
           discussed in REL-REF.
           It has been shown that there is little change in the
           shape of the angular distribution curve over the
           barrier region.  Therefore the ratio of the total cross
           section to the differential cross section remains
           constant or varies slowly over this entire energy
           domain.  On the basis of these results, it is clear
           that, if the differential cross section is measured
           only at this crossover angle, it is possible to
           determine total cross section.
