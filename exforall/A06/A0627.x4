TITLE      Electron Screening in the D+3-He Fusion Reaction.
COMMENT             -Abstract-
           Cross Section Measurements of the D(3-HE,P)4-He
           Reaction have Been Extended to an Energy As Low As
           E-Cm=5.4 KeV.  The Data have an Improved Accuracy
           Compared with Previous Work and Confirm the Existence
           Of Electron Screening.  The Combined Analysis of the
           Present and Previous Data Leads to an Electron
           Screening Potential of U = 123+/-9 eV.  A Similar
           Analysis of Previous Data For 3-He(D,P)4-He Leads to U=
           186+/-9 eV.  Both Screening Potentials Differ Due to
           The Molecular and Atomic Aggregate State of the Targets
           Involved in these Investigations and are  Significantly
           Larger Than Expected from Available Atomic Physics
           Models, Supporting the General Trend in Studies of
           Electron Screening.

FACILITY   (CCW,2GERBOC)
           A Compact High-Current 50 Kv Ion Accelerator Facility
           Including a Windowless Gas Target System, a Beam
           Calorimeter,  and Detector Telescopes in Close Geometry
           Has Been Built and Tested at the Ruhr-Universitat
           Bochum and is Presently Installed at the Laboratori
           Nazionali Del Gran Sasso (LNGS).  This Facility,
           Called "Laboratory For Underground Nuclear
           Astrophysics" (LUNA), is a Pilot Project Exploiting the
           Possibility of Cross Section Measurements Within the
           Thermal Energy Region of Stars, Mainly Due to the
           Reduction of Cosmic Ray Muons by Six Orders of
           Magnitude.   During the Test Phase of the Luna Facility
           At Bochum, Improved Low-Energy Data have Been  Obtained
           For the D(3-HE,P) He Reaction (Q =  18.35  MEV),  Which
           Are Reported Here.

           (BCINT)
           The Beam Current in the Target Area was Determined to
           An Accuracy of 3% Using a 2-W Beam Calorimeter:  the
           Beam is Stopped in the Calorimeter, Where the Kinetic
           Energy of the Projectiles is Converted Into Heat  Which
           Is Measured by the Calorimeter.  The Total Integrated
           Beam Power L(T) At the Calorimeter Over a Time Period T
           Yields the Total Number of Incident Projectiles N(T),
           N(T) = L(T)/E.  This Method Ignores the Charge State
           Of the Incident Ions and, When Combined with an
           Accurate Energy Determination (INCLUDING THE ENERGY
           LOSS IN THE TARGET GAS), It Gives an Accurate
           Determination of the Number of Incident Particles in  a
           Given Run.  The Problem of Heat Losses, E.G.  Via
           Conduction and Convection Transport Mechanisms, has
           Been  Minimized in the Design of a Constant Temperature
           Gradient.  The Calorimeter was Placed at Such a
           Distance from the Target Area That Angle Straggling of
           The Incident Ion Beam in the Gas Results in a Beam
           Profile Smaller Than the 200 mm**2 Active Area of the
           Calorimeter.

DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST)
           In the Present Approach Four Delta-E-E Telescopes are
           Placed (IN THE RECTANGULAR TARGET CHAMBER) Around the
           Beam Axis at a Distance of 2.5 and 3.5 Cm from the Beam
           Axis. Each Telescope Consists of Transmission Surface
           Barrier Detectors with a 0.25 Mu-Meters Al Layer
           Deposited on Both Sides of the Detectors.  The Delta-E
           And E Detectors (MICRON) Have Both an Active (SQUARE)
           Area of 2500 mm**2;  the Delta-E Detector (105 KEV
           ENERGY RESOLUTION AT E-ALPHA= 5.5 MEV) Has a  Thickness
           Of 140 Mumeters and the E Detector (55 KEV ENERGY
           RESOLUTION AT E-ALPHA= 5.5 MEV) Has a Thickness of 1000
           Mumeters (MAXIMUM AVAILABLE THICKNESS).  A Mylar Foil
           And an Al Foil (EACH OF 1.5 MUMETERS) Are Placed in
           Front of Each Telescope.  They Stop the Intense Elastic
           Scattering Yields and Shield the Detectors from
           Beam-Induced Light.
