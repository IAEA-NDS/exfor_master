FACILITY   (VDGT,2GERLMU) The experiment was done with the 9-Be
           beam.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           (ASSOP) The cross sections were deduced by the in-beam
           observation of the alpha-particles emitted in the
           ground state decay of the evaporation residues.
REL-REF    (N,A0564001,C.SIGNORINI+,J,EPJ/A,2,227,1998) The same
           experimental setup and technique previously utilized
           were adopted
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Four 100 mumeters thick Si detectors with 415
           mm2 effective surface.
SAMPLE     Two types of targets were utilized:  ~190 mug/cm2 Bi
           backed by 150 (450) mug/cm2 carbon (gold).  Backings
           were necessary to stop the evaporation residues recoils
           at the target site and to achieve the same geometry for
           the alpha-particles detection.

COMMENT    -By authors. The complete 9-Be plus likely 8-Be fusion
           cross sections were calculated adding the 2N+P3N,
           3N and 4N channels and the fission taken from E1658.
           The results are in agreement with A0564 and
           consequently show the same discrepancy with E1658.  For
           This reason the fusion cross section were calculated as
           the weighted average of the data from the present
           experiment and from A0564.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall accuracy of the cross sections is <
           5% down to Ecm = 36.3 MeV and < 11% for the other
           points except the lowest at Ecm = 34.4 MeV (20%).
