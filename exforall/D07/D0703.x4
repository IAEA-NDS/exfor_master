INC-SPECT  Two target assemblies were irradiated with a deuteron
           beam of initial energy 11.7 and 16.4 MeV,
           respectively. The accelerated deuteron beam was
           focused to the size 5x5 mm. The energy of deuterons
           was determined with a magnetic monochromator. The
           initial energy spread of the beam was less than 100
           keV. The mean energy of incident deuterons and their
           energy spread in each foil were calculated using the
           SRIM 2011 code and the LISE++ program.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC)
MONITOR    (22-TI-0(D,X)23-V-48,,SIG) For additional control over
           the intensity of the deuteron flux.
           The current of the deuteron beam passing through the
           assembly was measured with a Faraday cup.

           titanium foil substrate 2.1 mu-m  thick. The material
           was deposited on a substrate with an area of 1.22 cm2.
            Upon deposition of the material, each target was

           weighing and  converted to the isotope 194Pt content.
