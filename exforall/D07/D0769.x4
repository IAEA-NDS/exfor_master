FACILITY   (VDGT,3BZLUSP) Pelletron
SAMPLE     Molybdenum oxide (typically 0.15 mg/cm2 of Mo oxide)
            on Au backing (0.7 mg/cm2)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 55 deg and 125 deg, 19 cm from the target.
            Typical energy resolution of ~2.3 keV.
PART-DET   (G) Prompt gamma detection:
            1249 keV of 31S, 1266 keV of 31P,  2235 keV of 30Si,
             709 keV of 30P, 1779 keV of 28Si, 1015 keV of 27Al,
            1369 keV of 24Mg
ANALYSIS   Prompt gamma yields were normalized by using the 279
            and 536 keV gamma production cross sections due to
            Coulomb excitation of 197Au and 100 Mo calculated by
            FRESCO at each incident energy and summed.
           Finally the summed cross sections were normalized to
            the coupled-channel fusion cross sections at the
            highest energy.
COMMENT    By author: The 1779 keV gamma line could not be used
            due to overlapping with the 1808 keV gamma line from
            26Mg from 12C+16O reaction. Therefore data published
            in J.Thomas et al (1986) were adopted.

              Feshbach statistical model
