INC-SPECT  The beam energy was monitored using two methods:
            1 Time-Of-Flight (TOF), using two phase probes at the
           SARAF diagnostic plate;
            2 Detection of deuterons Rutherford Backscattered
              from a thin gold foil
SAMPLE     Natural copper evaporated on a 12.5 um thick Mylar
           sheet. A typical thickness of the surface copper
           oxide and the copper layers was of 0.016 and 0.218 um,
           respectively
METHOD     (SITA)
           (BCINT) Typical beam currents used during the
           irradiations were in the range of 250-300 nA.
