TITLE      Radiochemical measurement of neutron-spectrum
           averaged cross sections for the formation of 64Cu and
           67Cu via the (n,p) reaction at a TRIGA Mark-II
           reactor: Feasibility of simultaneous production of
           the theragnostic pair 64Cu/67Cu

INC-SPECT  The fast neutron spectrum of TRIGA reactor reported
           in previous publication and received by Dr. Uddin is
           given in entry 31733.
           The neutron flux above 0.5 MeV = 8.86x10**12 n/cm2/s.

           neutron spectrum unfolding of a TRIGA Mark II reactor.
SAMPLE     ZnO powder (99.9% purity) with natural isotopic
           composition of zinc was used as target material.
             30-ZN-64,NAT=0.4917
             30-ZN-67,NAT=0.0404
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,GSPEC,STTA)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The measurement was performed at 12 cm from
           the detector surface

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty obtained by quadratic
           summing if the following partial uncertainties:
           (ERR-S,0.1,3.) Counting statistics
           (ERR-1,2.,3.) Peak area analysis
           (ERR-2) Detector efficiency 5.0%
           (ERR-3,,0.1) Half-life of product
           (ERR-4) Sample mass 0.01%
           (ERR-5,0.6,6.0) Gamma-ray intensity
           (ERR-6) Coincidence loss 1%
           The uncertainty in the chemical separation yield was
           not relevant because the 67Cu activity was determined
           relative to 64Cu activity.
