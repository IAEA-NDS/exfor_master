           the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission
SAMPLE     (56-BA-138,NAT=0.717)
           A 10 ppm standard solution of barium. The certified
           concentration of the barium in the barium standard
           solution was 9.92 +/- 0.03 mg/g
           Comparator isotope Mn-56, was also contained in a
           10 ppm standard solution of manganese. The certified
           concentration of manganese in the manganese standard
           was 10.01 +/- 0.03 mg/g.
           About 10 ml of the solution was poured into
           a polyethylene capsule (12.00 mm in outer diameter and
           24.00 mm in outer length) for the irradiation within a
           Cd capsule.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After the irradiation, induced radioactivity
           in the target samples were counted from a distance of
           7.20 cm from the detector using a high purity Ge-
           detector (ORTEC) with relative efficiency of 25% and
           an energy resolution of 1.8 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV of
           60Co.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
           (CADMB) Cadmium ratio method. The samples were
           irradiated with and without cadmium cover of 1 mm
           wall thickness.
           (SITA) Single-target irradiation

INC-SOURCE Irradiations of samples were performed at a thermal
           power level of 15 kW, which corresponds to thermal
           neutron flux value of 1x10**11 n/cm**2/s. The epitherma
           neutron shaping factor (a) of the inner irradiation
           channel 2 which was used for the measurement is
           0.961 +/- 0.034 and the Cadmium ratio are 3.47 +/- 0.07
            and 2.36 +/- 0.01 for 94Zr and 197Au respectively.
