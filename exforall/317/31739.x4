FACILITY   (REAC,3BANSAV) TRIGA Mark II reactor at Dhaka.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Monochromatic neutron beam from the Savar Neutron
           Diffractometer installed at the reactor.
           The neutron beam intensities at the entrance and exit
           of the target 4.30x10**4 n/cm2s and 2.66x10**3 n/cm2s
SAMPLE     (62-SM-152,NAT=0.27) 99.99% purity Sm2O3 sample of
           natural isotopic composition.
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,STTA) Irradiation time 10 h.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detector with 15% relative efficiency.
           The samples were placed directly on the surface of
           the detector.
MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)
           The value of the monitor cross section at 0.0334 eV
           was determined by authors by fitting to cross sections
           from literature.

CORRECTION Data were corrected for efficiency, coincidence loss,
           overlapping peak, neutron and gamma attenuation, real
           coincidences.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties were determined from
           the following partial uncertainties:
           (ERR-S,1.,3.) statistical uncertainty (1%-3%)
           (ERR-1) peak area analysis (2%)
           (ERR-2) half-life (0.21%)
           (ERR-3) efficiency calibration (4%)
           (ERR-4) sample mass (0.01%)
           (ERR-5) neutron flux (11%)
