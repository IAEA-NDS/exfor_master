FACILITY   (REAC,3HUNKFI) Budapest Research Reactor
SAMPLE     Total mass: 236.4 +/- 0.5 mg.
           Am-241 metal sintered on a 0.196 mm thick Ag backing
            and covered by 2.33-um Au layer.
           Am mass was determined by 60 keV gamma ray intensity
            9.27 MBq (+/- 1.8%) ~ 73.1 mu-g.
           Ag thickness was determined by 60 keV gamma ray from
            Am-241 layer.
           Au thickness was determined by its activity after
            irradiation using 62.02 mg Au monitor activity
            considering flux attenuation.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) thermal equivalent neutron flux: ~1e+9 n/cm2/s
DETECTOR   (LEGE) CANBERRA0215R in a Pb cage
            Efficiency determined at 22.7 cm distance from 133Ba,
             152Eu and 241Am source.
            Resolution: 0.5 keV at 100 keV.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 90120 sec.
           (GSPEC) Measured at 22.7 cm from target
            Au: Measured for 26847 sec after 11.7 days cooling
            Am: Measured for 97 hrs after 66308 sec cooling

ANALYSIS   Unweighted average of 99.5 and 103.4 keV X-rays data
COMMENT    - Tamas Belgya (in article):
            The mean value of 591 +/- 35 b of our total capture
             cross section for 241Am is at the low end of the
             most recent values, but is in agreement with most of
             them within its uncertainty.
            The uncertainty is mainly coming from the systematic
             uncertainty of the 242Pu X-ray production probability
             in the electron conversion of the 242Am ground state.
           - Tamas Belgya (2012-01-31):
            We could measure only the ground state cross section,
             but the MCNP can give only the g+m cross section.
