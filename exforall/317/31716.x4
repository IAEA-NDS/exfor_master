TITLE      Measurement of thermal neutron and resonance integral

INC-SOURCE (AM-BE)20 Ci 241Am-Be isotopic neutron source,
           moderated with water.
SAMPLE     (23-V-51,NAT=0.9975) 10 ppm standard solution of
           vanadium, and the  comparator isotope Mn-55 as also
           contained in a 10 ppm standard  solution of manganese.
           The certified concentration of manganese in  the
           manganese standard solution was 10.01 +/- 0.03 mg/g
           and that of  vanadium was 4.86 +/- 0.02 mg/g in the
           vanadium standard solution.
INC-SPECT  The extent of non-ideality of epithermal flux shape,
           alpha-factor at the sample irradiation position was
           experimentally determined to be 0.134 +/- 0.01 by
           dual monitor method using 197Au and 95Zr. The thermal
           neutron flux is (1.46+/-0.01)x10**4 n/cm**2/s and the
           epithermal neutron flux is
            (7.23+/-0.02)x10**2 n/cm**2/s.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Induced radioactivity in the samples were
           counted by HPGe coaxial detector, which has a
           relative efficiency of 25%.
