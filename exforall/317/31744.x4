TITLE      Investigation of the gamma-ray spectrum from the
            resonance neutron capture in 35Cl
AUTHOR     (F.Becvar, J.Honzatko, Z.Kosina)
INSTITUTE  (3CZRUJV)
REFERENCE  (R,UJV-1705,1966)
FACILITY   (REAC,3CZRUJV) VVR-S 2MW research reactor
INC-SOURCE (REAC) with fast chopper and rotating collimator
SAMPLE     Carbon chloride (CCl4) in a vessel (20x10x10 cm3)
DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal (100 mm x 100 mm) shielded by
            boron carbide (B4C).
           The response function was determined by the 7.64 MeV
            gamma transition from irradiation of an iron target
            by thermal neutrons under the same condition.
ANALYSIS   The following assumptions were adopted:
           - Only transitions leading to levels known from the
             thermal capture study were expected in the resonance
             capture.
           - The response functions of the NaI(Tl) spectrometer
             for two near energies of monoenergetic gamma-rays
             are only shifted keeping their shape.
