FACILITY   (REAC,3CZRUJV) LVR-15 research reactor.
           The thermal neutron equivalent flux of the beam
           is 10**7 cm-2 s-1.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) The charged particle spectra were taken with a
           fully depleted surface barrier detector with a 300 um
           sensitive depth and 50 mm2 active area.
SAMPLE     The 7Be target was fabricated using 7Be chemically
           extracted from the cooling water of the SINQ facility
           at PSI. After mass separation the 7Be ion beam was
           focused loss free through a 5 mm diameter diaphragm and
           implanted into a 1.5 um thin Al foil. The beam spot had
           about 3 mm diameter. This Al foil was mounted between
           two 1.5 mm thick Al frames, with the external
           dimensions of 112 x 50.5 mm2.
           6LiF standard was supplied by the Institute for
           Reference Materials Measurements (IRMM) Geel. The
           standard sample was prepared by magnetron sputtering as
           a 6LiF homogeneous layer with a thickness of 30.2(2)
           um/cm2 deposited on a 1.5 um Al foil.
           The targets were tilted by 15 degree with respect to
           the neutron beam plane.
           An eight-day measurement with 7Be and a three-day
           measurement with 6LiF with a delimited area of 11 mm in
           diameter were combined.
           The 7Be sample and the 6LiF standard were irradiated
           with a collimated thermal neutron beam in a large
           vacuum chamber.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG)
CORRECTION Geometry correction factor (see also ERR-ANALYS)
           was calculated to be 14.7(7)%.
ANALYSIS   Taking into account a perfect 1/v dependence of the
           neutron cross sections for both 6Li and 7Be up to 100
           keV, the cross section of the 7Be(n,p0) reaction at
           thermal energy (0.0253 eV), could be determined by
           sig(6Li) of the 6Li(n,alpha)t reation and 1-3.
            1. Ratio of areas of the p0 and t peaks in the
             7Be(n,p0) and 6Li(n,alpha)t spectra.
            2. Ratio of the neutron flux monitor values for the
             7Be(n,p0) and 6Li(n,alpha)t measurements.
            3. Ratio of numbers of 6Li atoms in the delimited
             area of the 6LiF standard and an effective number
             of the 7Be atomsin the sample.
            4. geometry correction factor.

ANALYSIS   Combining following three data, a final value for the
           partial cross section of the 7Be(n,p0) reaction at
           thermal energy was obtained.
           The main measurement:
            43500 +/- 700(ERR-S) +/- 1700(ERR-SYS) b.
           Two additional comparative measurements:
            3mm of 6LiF standard
             44900 +/- 1100(ERR-S) +/- 3500(ERR-SYS) b.
            20mm of 6LiF standard
             43500 +/- 700(ERR-S) +/- 1700(ERR-SYS) b.
COMMENT    The final value combining three data for 7Be(n,p0)
           mentioned as 43600 +/- 1600 b is typo. The value 43800
           +/- 1400b mentioned both in last part in the main text
           and in the abstract is correct. (confirmed by author)
