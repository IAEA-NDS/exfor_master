INC-SPECT  The total neutron fluence was between 7.2x10**13 and
           2.8x10**14 n/cm**2
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,NAT=0.0072) Two samples of natural uranium
           were prepared from material from IRMM (BC02061) and
           specified  in its isotopic composition, with a well
           known stoichiometry (pure U3O8), and which was
           measured to contain low 236U and 239Pu concentrations.
           The U3O8 powder of typically 50-70 milli-g was
           homogeneously mixed with a few milli-g Au powder and
           press to pellets of 6 mm diameter. The sample was
           placed between two thin Au foils.
METHOD     (AMS,MOMIX) The AMS measurements were carried out at
           the VERA (Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator)
           facility.

MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,G)79-AU-198,,SIG)  The 197Au(n,gamma)
           thermal cross section value was used for the
           determination  of the neutron fluence, assuming the
           same 1/v energy dependence of the capture  cross
           sections from thermal to cold energies for uranium and
           gold.
