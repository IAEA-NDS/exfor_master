DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proton-recoil spectrometer with LND-281
           proton-recoil counter and CANBERRA multichannel
           analyzer. The LND-281 counter is made by a stainless
           steel tube of 0.8 mm wall thickness, 38.1 mm diameter,
           177.8 mm effective length and filled with H2 + CH4+N2
           mixed gases at a pressure of 3240 Torr.
SAMPLE     Several samples from niobium cylindrical rod
            (diam. 2.044 +/- 0.005 cm) were prepared. Properties
           of samples:

METHOD     (FNB)
ANALYSIS   Cross sections for each sample thickness were averaged.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)          Total uncertainty of experiment.
           (ERR-S,1.2,6.)   Error of counting statistics.
           (ERR-1,0.3,0.5)  Error in sample thickness.
           (ERR-2,0.03,2.3) Error in fitting.
