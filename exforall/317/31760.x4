SAMPLE     226Ra solution in nitric acid (~5 ug of 226Ra,
            equal to 185 kBq) in quartz capsule in Al can
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiated for 24 days by thermal neutron flux
            of 5E+13 n/cm2/sec, and cooled for ~2 months

REACTION   (88-RA-226(N,G)88-RA-227,,SIG,,SPA)
ANALYSIS   227Ac decay gamma was not applicable due to its low
            branching ratio (0.0092% for Egamma=100 keV).
           Daughter nuclei activities were subjected to back-
            calculation which resulted in ~19.09 kBq of 227Ac at
            EOB
