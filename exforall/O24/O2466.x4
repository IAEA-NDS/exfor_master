TITLE      A nuclear simulation experiment for the International
           Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF)

FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK) 3 muA deuteron beam of 52 MeV and 2.5
           mm diameter incident on an internal target.
METHOD     (INTB,BCINT) Beam current was registered by a
           calibrated current-to-frequency converter. It was
           corrected for the effect of deuterons absorption in
           the steel target entrance wall assuming that only (85
           +/- 5) % of the beam deuterons have reached the
           lithium.
SAMPLE     Metallic natural lithium of 21.8 mm thickness was
           enclosed in a stainless steel container (the drawing
           of the target is available in reference). The
           upstream 1.1 mm thick side of container takes away 12
           MeV. Target was positioned inside the cyclotron
           magnet gap and was cooled by water. A separate
           measurement with empty steel container was made to
           subtract the neutron background.

METHOD     (ACTIV) The tritium in the irradiated lithium target
           was measured by releasing it from the target at
           several hundred degrees Celsius within a quartz tube
           through which a gas stream of 95% Ar + 5% H2 was
           flowing at 50 ml/min. The gas was subsequently
           oxidized in passing through a CuO bed. The resulting
           H2O+HTO gas was absorbed in a molecular sieve. The
           molecular sieve was periodically changed and eluted
           with water.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The tritiated water was analyzed for the
           amount of tritium in an automated liquid
           scintillation system Beckman Instruments LS 6000TA.
CORRECTION The measured data were corrected for the H-3 decay
           and for the neutron background produced in the steel
           container wall of the Li target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The 7% uncertainty derives from the
           scatter (5%) of H-3 measurements with two targets and
           correction for the target wall thickness.

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The Be-7 yield was determined by
           measuring the 478 keV g-ray line from the irradiated
           target with a g-ray spectrometer. It was done after a
           cooling time of about 100 days, but prior to
           destroying the target for the tritium measurement.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma spectrometer was positioned at
           distance 65 cm from irradiated sample and was
           protected by a lead collimator in its front to
           reduce the counting efficiency. Spectrometer was
           calibrated with Eu-152 g-ray source.
CORRECTION The measured data were corrected for decay and for
           the neutron background produced in the steel target
           wall, as well as for the gamma ray absorption in the
           steel wall and in the lithium by about 8%.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The 12% uncertainty derives from the
           scatter of several Be-7 and calibration measurements
           and the uncertainties of the corrections.
