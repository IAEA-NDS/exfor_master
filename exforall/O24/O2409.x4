FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYFSN) Experiment was performed at the CIRCE
           laboratory using the recoil separator ERNA
SAMPLE     300 mm long differentially pumped windowless gas
           target was used. The He-4 target section was operated
           at 4 mbar. The effective target thickness was (0.54+/-
           0.03) *10**18 atoms/cm**2. After the He-4 target cell,
           an Ar post-stripper was used with thickness
           of (4.5+/-0.5)*10**16 atoms/cm**2.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,TELES) ionziation chamber with fractioned anode
           (SIBAR) in 2. pumping stage to monitor scattering
           rate of N-15 on Ar post-stripper
METHOD     (EDE,EXTB,REC,TTM,SITA) Measurement was performed in
           inverse kinematics. The target profile was determined
           by measruement of the 7Li(a,ga')7Li resonance yield
           at 3325 keV. Transmission of recoils was 100%. A
           post-stripper after the target chamber was used so
           that the recoils could reach charge state equilibrium.
ANALYSIS   Values for the gamma and alpha widths were obtained by
           Monte Carlo sampling the measured yield curve, and
           fitting it with a Breit-Wigner shape convulated with
           the target profile.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty was estimated by Monte Carlo
           approach considering the following components:
           (ERR-1) charge integration (3%)
           (ERR-2) stopping power (5%)
           (ERR-3,2.1,3.2) charge state probability
           (ERR-4,2.2,4.0) number of incident projectiles
ADD-RES    (COMP) Results were compared to the data available
           from the literature.
