FACILITY   (VDGT,2ITYLNS)
SAMPLE     Evaporated Sn targets with typical thickness of 500
           ug/cm2. The targets were prepared on 93Nb or 165Ho
           catcher foils of 2.5 mg/cm2 thickness.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two 1000 um Si surface barrier detectors,
           placed at +/- 20 degrees with respect to the beam
           axis to monitor beam intensity
           (SILI) Two Si(Li) detectors with diameter of 16 mm,
           and an active thickness of 5 mm were used for
           activity measurements. Both detectors had 50 microns
           thick Be windows, and were surrounded by 5 cm thick
           lead shielding.
METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,ACTIV,EDEG,XSPEC,STTA) The beam first
           crossed a thin Au foil (100 ug/cm2) before hitting
           the target. Both single target and stacked target
           irradiations were used to measure the excitation
           function of 6Li + 120Sn and 7Li + 119Sn. In both
           cases, the compound nucleus 126I is created, which
           produces 124I and 123I isotopes via 2n and 3n
           evaporation channels. Both isotopes then decay via EC
           into tellurium, which is followed by emission of
           atomic x-ray lines.
           In addition, production cross sections for 120Sb were
           also measured by detecting the characteristic x-rays
           of Sn.
ANALYSIS   In the analysis, only the k-alpha lines of Te and Sb
           were used, taking into account the corresponding
           fluorescence probabilities. The yields were
           determined from the analysis of the measured activity
           as function of the time.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Final uncertainty of the data, combining
           statistical and systematic uncertainties.
           The systematic uncertainty includes the following
           components:
           (ERR-1) x-ray detection efficiency (5%)
           (ERR-2) target thickness (2%)
           (ERR-3) k-alpha fluorescence probability for I-123 (2%)
           (ERR-4) k-alpha fluorescence probability for I-124 (5%)
ADD-RES    (COMP) The results were compared with theoretical
           predictions from coupled channels calculations with
           the FRESCO code.
