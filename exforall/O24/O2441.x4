DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,BAF2) a 5-mm-thick plastic scintillator
           BC-400-like and a 14-cm-thick BaF2 scintillator.
METHOD     (EDE)
           (TRN)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The measured cross sections are given for
           the energy at the center of the thickest target used
           with an uncertainty interval covering the energy loss
           before and after the target center.
