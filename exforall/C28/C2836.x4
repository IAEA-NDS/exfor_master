DETECTOR   (PROPC) Gamma-ray activities from the Na24 generated
           in the individual foils were measured on a calibrated
           platinum screen wall counter shielded with 1/16" lead,
           and compared with a 10-microgram radium standard to
           obtain the absolute disintegration rates. Decays of
           several foils were also followed for a few days as a
           check on the identity of the activity. The Na22
           positrons in the foils were measured with a bell-type
           thin window counter after the shorter-lived component
           had died away.
SAMPLE     The magnesium disks, because of their fragility, were
           sealed between layers of aluminum foil (0.00025") and
           stacked, resulting in a series of 24 absorbers whose
           average individual thickness was 7.7 mg/cm2 and whose
           total thickness, 185 mg/cm2, was approximately equal to
            the distance of penetration of the 14-MeV deuterons
           used.
METHOD     (CHSEP,STTA,ACTIV) The stack of foils was bombarded
           for 1.5 hours, 47.5-microampere minutes, with a
           deuteron beam whose initial energy was 14.20 MeV
            (range 184.5 mg/cm2 Al). After bombardment the
           targets should be allowed to age for about a week to
           allow the Na24 to decay, thus reducing the radiation
           hazard. The aged target is weighed and dissolved in
           50 percent excess of glacial acetic acid. With the
           metal the reaction is slow in starting but becomes
           very vigorous as it proceeds. After the reaction
           subsides, the solution is diluted with an equal
           volume of 50 percent alcohol. The last traces of
           metal are dissolved after 15-30 minutes. If any
           insoluble residue remains, it is removed by filtration.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Even though individual thicknesses
           varied as much as 20 percent, the data could be
           corrected for these variations to reduce errors from
           this source to about 2 percent.
CORRECTION Target thickness corrections.
