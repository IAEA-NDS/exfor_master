DETECTOR   (IOCH) The methane-filled cloud chamber.
METHOD     (REC) The energy distribution of the neutrons was
           obtained by observing a large number of recoil
           protons in a cloud chamber. From the stopping power
           of the gas in the chamber and the range-velocity
           curve, the energy of the recoil protons was computed.
ANALYSIS   All observed tracks were counted, regardless of their
           orientation. When the voltage was increased from 0.5
           MeV to 0.9 MeV the average number of tracks per
           expansion increased from 2.7 to 42 with the Be target,
           and from 7.1 to 13.4 with the H3PO4 target. These
           data have been reduced to an absolute yield.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,500.,1000.) The relative yields are much
           more accurate than the absolute ones; the latter may
           be in error by as much as a factor of 5 or possibly 10.
