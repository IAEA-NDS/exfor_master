FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88-Inch Cyclotron at Berkeley.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3-in. diam 3-in. long NaI(Tl) crystal and a
           400-channel pulse-height analyzer. A collection of
           threshold detectors was used: 58Ni(n,p)58Co,
           59Co(n,alpha)56Mn, 65Cu(n,p)65Ni, 27Al(n,alpha)24Na,
           203Th(n,2n)202Tl, 127I(n,2n)126I, and 58Ni(n,2n)57Ni.
SAMPLE     The target was made of tantalum, and measured 2.5 in.
           in diameter and 0.25 in. thick. This dimension was
           adequate for stopping the alpha particles and for
           covering the end of the copper Faraday cup in which
           it was mounted.
METHOD     (TTM) The experiment involved a target of a selected
           material, a means of measuring the beam particle
           current, the selected threshold detectors, a device
           to mount the detectors at predetermined positions,
           and a means to suppress secondary emission electrons
           from escaping the current-measuring device. Each
           threshold detector was counted at 3.0 cm from the
           actual face of the NaI crystal. The resultant
           gamma-ray spectra were used during the reduction of
           the data.
CORRECTION The total counts in the photopeak were corrected for
           decay and saturation. A correction was made for the
           abundance of the gamma ray for the decay scheme for
           each type of disintegration. The data were corrected
           for counting geometry and total absolute efficiency
           for the size of the NaI crystal, gamma-ray energies
           distance of the sample from the crystal, and sample
           size and thickness.

CORRECTION Conversion from photopeak counts to neutron flux is
           considered to be +-15%. All variations affect the
           entire set of threshold detector data and do not
           change the shape of the curve. The beam current was
           known to +-3%, and detector angular location was +-1%.
