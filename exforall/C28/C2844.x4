DETECTOR   Cloud chamber.
METHOD     In order to determine the ratio of the number of
           gamma-rays to the number of neutrons from the
           reaction, the target holder was placed directly
           within the cloud chamber and surrounded by a foil of
           Cellophane 0.1 mm thick. From the number of proton
           tracks coming from this foil the neutron intensity
           could be estimated using the known cross section for
           neutron-proton scattering. The gamma-ray intensity
           was determined simultaneously by counting the Compton
           electrons produced in a sheet of carbon in the center
           of the chamber. From the ratio of Compton electrons
           to protons obtained in this way it was calculated
           that there is not more than one gamma-ray for every
           200 neutrons.

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The energy of
           "greater than 15 MeV" was actually detected for
           protons. Authors argue that they must be due to
           neutrons, "possibly" from the T(d,n) He-4 reaction.
           In fact, it is a first observation of 14 MeV neutrons
           for D-D reactions.
