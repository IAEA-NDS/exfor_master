METHOD     (MANGB) The neutron yield from thick targets of Be,
           B,C,Al,Ni,Cu,Mo,Ta,W,Pt, and Au, bombarded with
           10-MeV deuterons, has been determined by comparing
           the manganese activity (MnSO4 in solution, in a 1arge
           tank) after bombardment, with the activity produced
           by a standard Ra-Be source placed at the same
           position as the target. After a bombardment was
           completed, the activity in the tank was observed with
           the Geiger counter, and its decay was followed for at
           least one half-life (2.59 hr) of the Mn-56 activity.

           10-MeV deuterons, has been determined by comparing
           the manganese activity (MnSO4 in solution, in a 1arge
           tank) after bombardment, with the activity produced
           by a standard Ra-Be source placed at the same
           position as the target. After a bombardment was
           completed, the activity in the tank was observed with
           the Geiger counter, and its decay was followed for at
           least one half-life (2.59 hr) of the Mn-56 activity.
