REACTION   (1-H-1(P,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
METHOD     The differential p-p elastic scattering cross section
           at 419 MEV was measured from 90 to 54 degrees
           baricentral angle by the method in which the two
           elastically scattered protons were detected in
           coincidence with the incident proton.

REACTION   (1-H-1(P,EL)1-H-1,,DA)
METHOD     From 54 to 28 degrees a second method was used which
           counted all charged particles scattered at the angle
           in question in coincidence with an incident proton
           provided that no charged particle was simultaneously
           scattered near the forward direction. This method
           depended on several facts. First, the only reaction
           which seriously interferes with detection of
           scattered protons is (a) p+p->pi+ + D. The related
           reaction (b) P+P->pi+ + P+N probably occurs less than
           1/5th as frequently. In the case of (a) all deuterons
           and in the case of (b) many protons are scattered
           forward close to the beam.

REACTION   (1-H-1(P,X)1-PP-0,,DA)
METHOD     From 54 to 28 degrees a second method was used which
           counted all charged particles scattered at the angle
           in question in coincidence with an incident proton
           provided that no charged particle was simultaneously
           scattered near the forward direction. This method
           depended on several facts. First, the only reaction
           which seriously interferes with detection of

           reaction (b) P+P->pi+ + P+N probably occurs less than

           and in the case of (b) many protons are scattered
           forward close to the beam. In a reversal of this
           method the pi+ production cross section at 45
           laboratory angle was measured by counting charged
           particles scattered in coincidence with an incident
           proton and with a charged particle scattered
           simultaneously near the forward direction.
