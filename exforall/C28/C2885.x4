TITLE      Deuteron-induced Spallation and Fission Reactions in
           Plutonium Isotopes
AUTHOR     (E.V.Luoma)
REFERENCE  (R,UCRL-3495,1956)
INSTITUTE  (1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.
DETECTOR   (IOCH,GEMUC,PROPC) An argon-filled ionization chamber
           attached to a scaling circuit was used for gross
           alpha counting of tracers and plutonium assays. This
           instrument has a counting efficiency of 52% for thin
           samples. All the fission products were beta-particle
           emitters and counted on a Geiger-Muller counter. The
           counting unit used was an end window Amperex 100 C
           tube filled with a mixture of chlorine and argon.
           Isotopes decaying by electron capture were counted in
           a Nucleometer. This instrument contains a methane
           flow-type windowless proportional counter.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Extensive chemical procedures are necessary
           because of the many possible reactions induced in the
           target material Itself and in the aluminum backing
           plate. Because of the small amount of valuable target
           material available and the low counting rates that
           were present in products in many cases, it was not
           possible to take aliquots. A known amount of
           alpha-emitting isotope was added to the target
           solution for each actinide that was to be taken out.
           Yield was determined from the amount of that
           particular isotope remaining in the isolated actinide.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Energy and half-life data were used to
           identify isotopes. Energy data was used solely in
           determining the amount, on each counting plate, of
           alpha-emitting isotope that was added for yield
           determination. Usually the beta-particle emitters and
           electron-capture isotopes were identified by their
           half-lives which were resolved from decay curves.
           This could not be done for Am237 and Am238. These
           isotopes were separated by the method of least
           squares, an analytical method of separating decay
           curve components.
CORRECTION Air-Window, Counting Efficiency, Backscattering,
           Self-Scattering and Self-Absorption (SSSA), and
           Geometry corrections.
