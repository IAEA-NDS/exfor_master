DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The yields of beta- and gamma-rays were
           measured with Geiger counters filled with a self
           quenching mixture of argon and alcohol.
SAMPLE     Thin targets of LiCl, LiOH, and metallic lithium were
           used. They were produced by evaporation from a
           tungsten filament onto a polished disk of pure silver
           or copper. The LiC1 targets blackened rapidly during
           bombardment and the yield of neutrons increased with
           time as a result of the deposition of carbon. These
           targets were made thicker (50-100 keV) than the
           metallic lithium targets which were used later so
           that the carbon would have a relatively small effect.
METHOD     (COINC) The single counter was used to take a lead
           absorption curve under good geometrical conditions
           and the radiation seemed to be homogeneous. The
           450-keV radiation was too feeble to give a noticeable
           effect under our conditions. The single Geiger
           counter did not respond appreciably to neutrons. A
           block of paraffin which reduced the neutron intensity
           to half, did not affect the counting rate in the
           Geiger counter. The neutrons produced radioactivity
           in the counter walls, but this was subtracted as part
           of the natural effect. To detect 4.9-MeV gamma-rays
           in the presence of 450-keV gamma-rays, coincidence
           counters were used, the wall thickness being
           sufficient to prevent detection of gamma-rays of less
           than 2-MeV energy. However, this procedure was found
           unnecessary and a single Geiger counter was used for
           the final data.

ANALYSIS   Resonances were found at 0.65, 1.02, and 1.35 MeV
           corresponding to excited states of the intermediate
           nucleus (Be9) at 17.14, 17.43, and 17.69 MeV. The
           resonance at 1.35 MeV was found only for the
           formation of radioactive Li8 accompanied by the
           emission of a proton. Apparently proton emission is
           permitted and neutron emission forbidden from the
           17.69-MeV state.
