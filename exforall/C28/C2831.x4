INSTITUTE  (1USACHI)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The Chicago synchrocyclotron.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) Five scintillation counters.
SAMPLE     The scatterer was a 4-in. vertical cylinder of liquid
           hydrogen contained in styrofoam walls.
METHOD     (COINC) The p-p differential elastic scattering cross
           section at 90 degree baricentral angle has been
           measured for three proton energies and has been found
           to be independent of energy in this range. Sizable
           intensities of proton beams of a wide range in energy
           were obtained by the proper azimuthal positioning of
           a beryllium scattering target at 76 in. radius in the
           Chicago synchrocyclotron. The protons collimated by a
           channel in the heavy shield were of definite energy
           for a given target position. They were further
           analyzed by an additional magnet. The analyzed
           collimated beam was defined and measured before the
           scatterer by a telescope of 2 scintillation counters
            (1-2). Two scintillation counters (3 and 4) were
           placed on opposite sides of the beam, connected in
           coincidence with counters 1 and 2 in such a way that
           they counted the two elastically scattered protons in
           coincidence with the incident proton.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
CORRECTION In order to avoid counting loss corrections, a fifth
           counter which counted protons scattered out of the
           main beam was used to normalize the incident flux at
           low-beam intensities and to normalize the quadruple
           coincidence rate at high beam intensity.
