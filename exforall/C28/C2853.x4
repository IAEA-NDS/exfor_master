FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Expriment performed at the K500
           superconducting cyclotron using Momentum Achromat
           Recoil Spectrometer (MARS) .
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Evaporation residue were first momentum
           analyzed in MARS spectrometer, consisting of two
           dipole magnets, Wien filter and several correcting
           quadrupoles and sextupoles.
           (SISD) At the MARS focal plane a position sensitive
           Si strip detector was placed. Evaporation residues
           were implanted in SiSD and identified acording their
           alpha decay energies.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Evaporation residues were implanted in Si
           strip detector and identified by their characteristic
           alpha decay energies.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty, determined mainly by
            low MARS transmision efficiency at low energies
           (ERR-S) Statistical uncertainty
COMMENT    Decay data measured by author.

COMMENT    By NDS (2024-04-05):
            No answer from C.M.Foldern III about the isomeric
            states considered.
SAMPLE     (64-GD-156,ENR=0.954) The targets were prepared in
           house using the molecular plating method. The Gd(NO3)3
           solution was plated onto a 2 mu-m Ti backing by
           applying a bias of 400-700 V for 30-60 min. The targets
           were then baked at 200 deg C under atmospheric
           conditions.
