FACILITY   (VDG,1CANCRC) The Chalk River electrostatic
           accelerator.
METHOD     A gas target was used in a large scattering chamber.
           Angular distributions were determined by measuring
           the scattered intensity at eleven different angles in
           the range 50 to 153 degrees, at about ten different
           energies near the resonances.

FLAG       (1.) The 1.72-MeV resonance is not adequately
           resolved in energy, but a probable assignment of 3/2-
           with only channel spin 1/2 contributing has been made.
