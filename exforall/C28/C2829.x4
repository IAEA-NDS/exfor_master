TITLE      Total Interaction Cross Section of Hydrogen for
           Positive and Negative 200-700 Mev Pions

INSTITUTE  (1USABNL)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Cosmotron.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) A fast triple coincident scintillation
           counter telescope.
METHOD     (COINC) Measurements of the total interaction cross
           section of hydrogen for positive and negative pions
           of several energies have been made. A direct meson
           beam from the Brookhaven Cosmotron was incident upon
           a fast triple coincident scintillation counter
           telescope containing an analyzing magnet arranged to
           select either negative or positive particles of the
           required momentum. A large liquid scintillation
           counter was placed behind the third counter in
           quadruple coincidence with the monitor telescope.
           Good geometry attenuation measurements were made for
           both polyethylene and carbon absorbers placed between
           the third and fourth counters.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
