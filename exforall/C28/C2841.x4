TITLE      Two Radioactive Substances from Magnesium after
           Deuteron Bombardment

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The large cyclotron in the Radiation
           Laboratory.
SAMPLE     The target was in all cases a piece of magnesium
           ribbon of 99.97% purity.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     (ACTIV) A thick target of magnesium was bombarded in
           air for about 10 minutes by an ion beam of 3 MeV
           energy and about 0.9 microampere intensity. At the
           end of the exposure the target was at once placed at
           the window of the electroscope. The measured activity,
           as a function of time, was plotted on a logarithmic
           scale. The half-life determined from the linear
           portion, after due allowance for the natural leak and
           background activity of longer life. Several runs were
           made to determine the transmutation functions by
           using the now standard method of exposing a pile of
           thin magnesium foils to the action of the deuteron
           beam and then separating the foils and measuring
           their activity separately.
ANALYSIS   The variation in the yield of transmutations as a
           function of the energy of the incident particle has
           been called the excitation function, or more properly
           the voltage transmutation function. The Gamow formula
           for the variation in number of transmutation, N, with
           voltage, V, is the following: N=k*V**(-1)*exp(-S)
           where k is a constant of proportionality and S is
           calculated using kinematic parameters and binding
           energies.
