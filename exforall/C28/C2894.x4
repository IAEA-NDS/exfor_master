FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     Two targets were used simultaneously. A 9Be target
           with thickness of 370 mg/cm and 181Ta target with
           thickness of 2158mg/cm2 separated by 25 mm.
PART-DET   (G,10-NE-29)
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between gamma-rays and reaction
           products was required.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted in-flight were detected
           using GRETINA array, which consisted of 11 modules
           arranged with four modules located at 58 deg and
           seven at 90 deg relative to the beam axis. Each
           GRETINA module is made of four 36-fold segmented
           high-purity Ge detectors. The TRIPLEX plunger device
           was located about 13 cm upstream of the center of
           GRETINA in order to facilitate the clear
           identification of the Be and Ta reaction
           contributions using two Doppler-shifted peaks.
           (MAGSP) Reaction products were identified event-by-
           event by time-of-flight and energy-loss measurements
           from the S800 spectrograph.
CORRECTION All gamma rays were Doppler-corrected
INC-SOURCE A 140 MeV/A 48Ca primary beam was impinged on a 9Be
           production target. A 100.1 MeV/A secondary 29Ne beam
           was produced and selected by the A1900 fragment
           separator, with a purity of 25% and a typical
           intensity of 60 pps. A secondary beam of 32Mg at
           117.4 MeV/u was produced as part of the secondary
           cocktail beam with a purity of 25% and a typical
           intensity of 60 pps.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties include the statistical
           uncertainty, uncertainty in the fit, uncertainty of
           the S800 acceptance and uncertainty of the absolute
           efficiency of GRETINA array
