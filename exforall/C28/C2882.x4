TITLE      Fission and spallation competition from the
           intermediate nuclei americium-241 and neptunium-235
AUTHOR     (W.M.Gibson)
REFERENCE  (R,UCRL-3493,1956)

DETECTOR   (PROPC,GEMUC) Windowless proportional counter
            (Nucleometer) for spallation. The fission products,
           all of which were beta minus emitters, were counted on
           a standard Geiger-Mueller counter.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Due to the large number of possible nuclear
           reactions induced in the target nuclei and in the
           aluminum backing plate, extensive chemical procedures
           were necessary to purify the products for which
           yields were to be determined. The chemical yields of
           the various products were determined by the addition
           of standardized weights of carriers for each of the
           fission products and known disintegration rates of
           alpha-emitting tracers for the spallation products.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The disintegration rate, hence the number of
           atoms, of a given product nuclide was determined by
           resolution of decay curves or when possible by
           resolving radiations of a given unique energy. Four
           types of counters were used, the first three being
           used to determine the disintegration rates or the
           yields for the spallation products, the latter being
           used for fission product determinations.

ANALYSIS   The total fission cross section was obtained by summing
           the individual fission yield curves over the mass
           numbers from A=70 to A=170.
           The cross sections for 20.2 and 20.6 MeV deuterons
           have been averaged and plotted for 20.4 MeV deuterons
           since these two bombardments fall within the limits
           of error of the energy determination of being at the
           same energy.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.

SAMPLE     With neptunium, considerable difficulty was
           encountered in obtaining acceptable target plates.
           Frequently, targets containing only 0.06 to 0.1
           mg/cm2 of neptunium were used although on occasion up
           to 0.4 mg/cm2 could be plated successfully.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,20.) The limits of error are estimated
           to be about 10-20%.
