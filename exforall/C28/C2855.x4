FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment carried out using the
           DRAGON recoil separator at TRIUMF, Vancouver
SAMPLE     Helium-filled DRAGON windowless gas target with
           effective length of (12.3+-0.1) cm and He pressure
           between 4.92 and 7.9 torr.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) For mass and momentum selection an
           electromagnetic mass separator was used, which
           consists of two magnetic (M) and two electric dipoles
            (E) in a MEME configuration.
           (BGO) Prompt gamma rays were detected using an array
           of 30 BGO scintillators with phototubes covering
           covering 89-92% of the 4Pi solid angle. It was used
           also fore tagging of the associated recoil particles
           for additional background reduction in the focal
           plane detectors.
           (MCPLT,SISD) Focal plane detector consisting of
           microchannel plate and a double-sided silicon-strip
           detector. The microchannel plate provided the
           starting timing sig nalfor a local time-of-flight. In
           the Si strip detector the recoils are stopped, their
           kinetic energy and position are measured, and the
           stopping timing signal is recorded.
METHOD     (TOF)
INC-SOURCE Beams of 7Be+ were produced using the ISOL technique
           by bombarding thick ZrC and graphite targets with 55
           muA 500 MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron. 7Li
           and 7Be were extracted from the target through a
           high- resolution mass separator, and the beryllium
           ionization was enhanced using the TRIUMF Resonant
           Ionization Laser Ion Source. After the ion source,
           the beam was transported through the ISAC
           high-resolution mass separator and then accelerated
           through the ISAC-I radio frequency quadrupole and
           drift-tube linac to final energy.
