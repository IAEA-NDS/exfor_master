FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The Experiment was carried out in
           inverse kinematics using the HELIOS spectrometer at
           the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Laboratory
SAMPLE     A deuterated polyethylene target with thickness of
            (124+-70) mu-g/cm2 was used. The estimated hydrogen
           content was around 6%.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The solenoidal HELIOS spectrometer with the
           central field of 2T was used for momentum separation
           of reaction products.
           (SI) Protons from the (d,p) reaction emitted at
           forward center-of-mass angles (backwards in the
           laboratory) for both 14C and 14N were detected using
           the Si array, placed at a distance 125 - 475 mm on axis
           and subtending 10 deg < theta(cm) < 40 deg (the
           c.m. angle and the detector position along the axis
           are related to one another).
           (TELES) Counter telescope located 900 mm from the
           target was used as a recoil detector for reaction
           trigger and to determine 14C/14N beam ratio.
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used
INC-SOURCE A cocktail beam of 14C and 14N was accelerated to 10
           MeV/A at a total intensity (14C + 14N) of approximately
           300 000 particles per second. A time-averaged ratio
           of 1:1 was determined within 3%, or approximately
           1.5E+5 particles per second of both 14C and 14N on
           average
