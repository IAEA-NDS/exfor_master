SAMPLE     As solid targets of D-compounds did not last long
           under bombardment, we used liquid D3PO4 for longer
           series of measurements, which proved to be very
           satisfactory.
DETECTOR   (IOCH)
METHOD     The protons produced in the D-D reaction penetrate
           thin aluminum windows and are counted by means of an
           ionization chamber, linear amplifier and a
           scale-of-eight thyratron counter. The neutrons are
           recorded with the same apparatus, by the use of a
           paraffin lined chamber for the fast neutrons, a
           boron-lined chamber for slow neutrons, or a simple
           air chamber (for calculating absolute values) . The
           yield of the neutrons was compared with that of
           neutrons from a 15 mg radium-beryllium source
           replacing the target.
ANALYSIS   The total number of protons produced in D3PO4,
           measured at 90 degrees from the direction of the ion
           beam, is 7x10**4 /sec at 100 keV and 1 microA on the
           assumption of isotropic emission in all directions.
           Actually appreciably more neutrons were found in the
           direction of the beam than at 90 degrees. Multiplying
           the yield by 50/3, the ratio of the number of
           electrons in D3PO4 and the number of D-atoms, one
           gets as yield for the D-D reaction 1 proton for
           6x10**6 impinging deuterons.
ERR-ANALYS Solid targets -(ND4) 2SO4, ND4C1, KOD - give within
           20% the same yield after correcting for the stopping
           power in the same way as for the D3PO4 target.
