SAMPLE     Powdered samples of rhodium and ruthenium in
            5 ml polystyrene. In irradiations of enriched
           ruthenium isotopes, powdered Al(2)O(3) was thoroughly
           mixed with each sample prior to irradiation to surmount
           the difficulty of exact reproduction of the geometry in
           irradiations of milligram quantities of materials.

ANALYSIS   The cross section for the 96Ru(n,2n)95Ru reaction was
           measured by determining the amount of 20 h 95Tc that
           grew in from the 99 min 95Ru during irradiation and
           before chemical separation of the technetium fraction
           was completed.

COMMENT    The contribution from 100Ru(n,d)99mTc could not be
           measured; hence only the total cross section for the
           reactions 99Ru(n,p)99mTc+ 100Ru(n,d)99mTc was
           determined. Assuming an internal conversion
           coefficient (see Nuclear Data Sheets) of 0.095 for the
           142 keV gamma this total cross section was determined.
