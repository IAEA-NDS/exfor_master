TITLE      Studies of Plutonium, Neptunium, and Uranium Produced
           in the 244Pu + 136Xe Reaction

SAMPLE     (94-PU-244,ENR=0.986) The target 215 micrograms of
           244Pu electrosprayed onto a 12.5 micrometers Be foil.
           The diameter was 6.3 mm yielding the average target
           thickness of 672 micrograms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,SOLST) Beta proportional counter and alpha
           proportional counter were used to measure beta and
           alpha activities, respectively. Alpha pulse analysis
           of Pu sample was carried out using gold-plated
           surface barrier detector.
PART-DET   (B-,A)
METHOD     (CHSEP,BSPEC,ASPEC) Reaction products were collected
           on the aluminum catcher foil and dissolved with 10M
           sodium hydroxide then removed rare earths and
           transition elements with lanthanide fluoride
           precipitation method. The residual alpha and beta
           activities were measured with proportional counters.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) From the observed decay curves isotopes were
           identified. The cross section for each isotope was
           calculated as: sigma = m/(I*N*(1-exp(-lambda tb))*(1-
           exp(-lambda tc))*c*gc*gb), where m is counting rate
           after the cooling, I is intensity of Xe ion per min,
           N is initial counting rate, tb is bombardment time of
           244Pu target, tc is chemical separation and cooling
           time, lambda is decay const for each isotope, c is
           counting efficiency, gc is chemical yield for each
           element, gb is ratio of total activity to given
           activity.

COMMENT    There is a typo in the article abstract, it should be
           237U as in the Table 2. Listed in the Table 2
           half-life agrees with 237U. 245U is not observed yet
           according to ENSDF database.
