FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was performed using the
           DRAGON (Detector of Recoils And Gammas Of Nuclear
           reactions) recoil separator located at the Isotope
           Separator and ACcelerator (ISAC) radioactive beam
           facility at the TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver, Canada.
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target was used. The target consisted
           of 7.3 - 8.1 mbar of H2 gas with pressures regulated
           to 0.04 mbar or better during each hour-long run.
           These pressures resulted in energy losses across the
           target of 16-20 keV/nucleon.
DETECTOR   (BGO) target volume was surrounded by 30 bismuth
           germanate (BGO) detectors which detected the gamma
           rays emitted during the reaction
           (MAGSP) Downstream of the target, the reaction
           products were separated from the unreacted beam by a
           recoil separator consisting of two magnetic (M) and
           two electrostatic (E) dipoles, arranged in an MEME
           configuration. Charge state, q, selection was
           performed after the first magnetic dipole and A/q
           selection was performed after the first electrostatic
           dipole.
           (SISD) The recoils transmitted through the separator
           were detected in a double-sided silicon strip
           detector (DSSSD)
           (MCPLT) Local time-of-flight (TOF) system, consisting
           of two microchannel plate (MCP) detectors, was used
           to increase the beam suppression through improved
           particle identification
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to increase the beam
           suppression through improved particle identification
           (COINC) coincidence between gamma rays in BGO and
           reaction products, detected by Si strip detector was
           used to reduce background.
