FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at
           Michigan State University
SAMPLE     Deuterated polyethylene target with thickness of
           435 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)14Be reaction products were deflected by a
           large-gap dipole magnet set to a magnetic rigidity of
           3.55 Tm.
           (DRFTC) Two cathode readout drift chambers with
           dimensions of 30cm x 30 cm separated by 1.88 m was
           used to determine position and angle of charged
           particles.
           (SCIN) Energy loss and total energy of charged
           particles were measured in 5 mm and 150 mm thick
           plastic  scintillators, respectively.
           (SCIN) Coincident neutrons were measured with the
           Modular Neutron Array. The 144 plastic scintillator
           detectors of the array were arranged into 18 walls
           each 80 cm tall. The walls were assembled into two
           close-packed blocks located at 0deg and 23deg from
           the secondary beam direction, with their respective
           distances from the target being 650 cm and 470 cm.
METHOD     (COINC,EDE)
INC-SOURCE A 120 MeV/u 18-O primary beam from the Coupled
           Cyclotron Facility bombarded a 3196 mg/cm2
           9Be production target. The A1900 fragment separator
           in conjunction with a 1050 mg/cm2 aluminum achromatic
           wedge degrader was used to separate and select for
           the 14Be secondary beam. The final energy of the beam
           was 59 MeV/u with a momentum spread of 2%, an
           intensity of approximately 1000 pps, and a purity of
           96.5%.
ANALYSIS   The energy and momentum vector of the fragments were
           reconstructed from a transformation matrix based on
           the magnetic field map.
