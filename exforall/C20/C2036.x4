SAMPLE     Differentially pumped windowless gas target. The
           target which contains Deuteron gas was cylindrical, 5
           cm in inner diameter, with its axis perpendicular to
           the incident beam direction.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,PROPC) Q-D magnetic spectrometer for detection
           of 4 MeV 6Li ions and incident 6 MeV alpha particles.
           The counter was filled with propane (C3H8) gas at a
           pressure of about 1/20 atmosphere and operated in the
           proportional counter region.

METHOD     (PHD,ASPEC,REC) Particles were identified on the base
           of their ranges together with pulse height
           discrimination. The field of the magnetic
           spectrometer was set to select triply charged 6Li ions.
ANALYSIS   (CHGDS) The present result gives the total cross
           section as sigma = Y/ N*I, where I is the number of
           incident particles, Y is yield and N is number of
           target nuclei. The final result had to be corrected
           for two factors: only 84% of 6Li ions were triply
           charged; 10% beam current increase due to emission of
           secondary electrons.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error factor is the root of the quadratic
           sum of all the possible  errors in the present
           experiment.
           (ERR-S) statistical error.
           (ERR-1) solid angle error.
           (ERR-2) current calibration error.
           (ERR-3) target pressure error.
           (ERR-4) pulse height calibration error.
