REFERENCE  (J,NIM/A,743,5,2014)
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWMU) Experiment was carried out at Western
            Michigan University tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
SAMPLE     Natural carbon foil with thickness of (93+-0.5)mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The setup consisted of active collimator,
           constructed from a 1/8in. plastic scintillator 3in.
           in diameter with a 0.511in. diameter hole in the
           center. The scintillator was coupled to a fast PMT.
           (SI) Two segmented n-type silicon detectors with
           annular rings on the junction side and pie shaped
           sectors on the ohmic side 249 mu-m and 305 mu-m thick
           covered the angular region of 11.3 deg - 21.8deg and
           3.53deg - 10.8deg.
           (IOCH) The final detector in the setup was the zero
           degree gas ionization chamber (ZDIC) that measured
           the energy loss of the beam as well as fusion
           residues in the angular region of theta lab less than
           3.52 deg.
METHOD     (TOF) Reaction residues were identified using
                 energy x time of flight method
CORRECTION Corrected for charge trapping in segmented Si detector
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty associated with correction for
                   charge trapping.

DETECTOR  1(MCPLT) Two  electrostatic micro-channel plate
           detectors were used for time of flight measurement.
           First detector utilizes a conventional electrostatic
           mirror to reflect secondary emission electrons
           generated by the passage of the beam through a carbon
           foil to MCP. The 18mm MCP detector also served as an
           active target in the experiment.
          2(MCPLT) Two  electrostatic micro-channel plate
           detectors were used for time of flight measurement.
           Gridless detector utilizes a crossed electric and
           magnetic fields to transport secondary  electrons
           to the MCP detector, which served as an active.
           target in the experiment.
