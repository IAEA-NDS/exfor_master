           (J,JP/CS,420,012050,2013) Preliminary data
FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at the ISAC-I
           accelerator at TRIUMF using DRAGON spectrometer
SAMPLE     (6-C-12,ENR=0.999) Self-supporting 99.9% enriched 12C
           foils with thickness of 50 mu-g/cm2
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)The DRAGON spectrometer was employed to
           separate radiative capture residues from the primary
           beam and the fusion-evaporation residues. The recoils
           were detected at the spectrometer focal plane
           (SISD) The 28Si recoils with a charge state q = 8+
           were detected at the focal plane by a double-sided
           silicon strip detector (DSSD).
           (BGO) Gamma rays were detected in the BGO gamma-ray
           array.
METHOD     (TOF) Unambiguous identification of the 28Si compound
           nucleus (CN) was performed using the recoil time-of-
           flight measured between the BGO array and the DSSD,
           together with the energy of the recoils recorded at
           the focal plane.
