FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed using Dragon
            facility at TRIUMF
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Reaction products were momentum analyzed in
           0deg recoil spectrometer Dragon and identified in
           focal plane detector.
           (SISD) Recoiling nuclei were detected in a double-
           sided silicon strip detector (DSSSD) at the focal
           plane of the Dragon spectrometer
           (BGO) Gamma rays were detected using 30 BGO detector-
           array.
METHOD     (COINC) Radiative channel was identified by
           coincidence of selected time gate in time of flight
           spectrum of DSSSD and gamma rays in the BGO array.
           Dragon spectrometer allowed a rejection factor of the
           incident beam above 1E+12
