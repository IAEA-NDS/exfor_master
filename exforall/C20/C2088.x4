SAMPLE     The CH2 target was prepared from commercially
           available polyethylene sheets, stretched to achieve
           an areal density of 226 mu-g/cm2. The thickness of
           each target was measured using the energy loss of
           5.805-MeV alpha particles from the decay of 244Cm.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) A new dual microchannel plate (DMCP) detector
           was employed for heavy recoil detection. The DMCP
           utilizes two conventional MCP detectors viewing
           opposing sides of a single carbon or metallized foil.
           (SI) SuperORRUBA detectors, which are segmented for
           1.2-mm position sensitivity, were used at angles
           forward of 90deg for the proton scattering measurements

SAMPLE     The CD2 targets were prepared from deuterated
           polyethylene powder with areal densities of 94, 143,
           162, and 185 mu-g/cm2. The thickness of each target

           was employed for heavy recoil detection. The DMCP

STATUS     (TABLE) Data presented in fig. 4 of the reference taken
           from tabulated data given in Supplemental Material at

SAMPLE     The CD2 targets were prepared from deuterated
           polyethylene powder with areal densities of 94, 143,
           162, and 185 mu-g/cm2. The thickness of each target
           was measured using the energy loss of 5.805-MeV alpha
           particles from the decay of 244Cm.
DETECTOR   (MCPLT) A new dual microchannel plate (DMCP) detector
           was employed for heavy recoil detection. The DMCP
           utilizes two conventional MCP detectors viewing
           opposing sides of a single carbon or metallized foil.
           (SI) For the data taken with deuterated targets, the
           angles and energies of light ion ejectiles were
           measured using the Silicon Detector Array (SIDAR) and
           the first full implementation of the Oak Ridge
           Rutgers Barrel Array (ORRUBA). ORRUBA detectors (1000
           mu-m thick) were mounted at a radius of 87 mm from
           the beam axis at theta(lab) > 95 deg and at 76 mm at
           more forward angles. SIDAR array was mounted in
           lampshade configuration at backward angles to cover
           angles between 135deg and 165deg.
