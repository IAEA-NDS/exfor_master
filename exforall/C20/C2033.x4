FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed using DRAGOON
           recoil separator of the ISAC radioactive beam facility
           located at the TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Differentially pumped windowless gas target
           containing hydrogen at the pressure of 7.5 torr.
DETECTOR   (BGO) Gas target chamber was surrounded by a high
           efficiency Bismuth Germanate (BGO) array to detect
           prompt gamma rays
           (MAGSP) High suppression two-stage electromagnetic
           separator to momentum analyze the recoiling beam
           (MCPLT,IOCH) The heavy ion detection system, located
           downstream of the final focus of the separator,
           consists of two microchannel plate detectors used for
           measuring recoil time of flight, and a multianode
           ionization chamber, used for measuring recoil energy
           loss.
INC-SOURCE The 18F beam was produced using a 500 MeV
           proton beam incident on a silicon carbide target.
           Mass 18 products were extracted, ionized in a FEBIAD
           ion source and filtered using a high resolution mass
           separator.An average 18F(4+) beam intensity of
           1.74E+6 ions/sec was delivered to the experiment.
