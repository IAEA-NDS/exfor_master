FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment performed at the Holifield
           Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) using the
           isotope separation online (ISOL) technique. The 134Te
           fragments were accelerated using the 25-MV tandem
           electrostatic accelerator.
SAMPLE     (20-CA-40,ENR=0.9) 40CaF2 target with thickness of
           0.466 mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (MCPLT,IOCH) The setup consisted of two microchannel
           plate timing detectors (MCPs) placed upstream from the
           target that monitored the beam rate and served as a
           timing references. Downstream from the target, a
           position-sensitive MCP was mounted followed by a
           zero-degree ionization chamber containing three anodes.
METHOD     (TOF) Particle were identified by dE1-dE2 method from
           signals from the ionization chamber
INC-SOURCE A 10- to 15 mu-A proton beam produced by the Oak
           Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron bombarded a uranium
           carbide target. The fragments produced from the
           proton-induced fission of the uranium were ionized
           using a plasma ionization source. The 134Te fragments
           were selected using mass separators and passed to the
           25-MV tandem electrostatic accelerator, which
           accelerated the beam to energies between 535 and 619
           MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainty due to variation in
                     the ER selection gates
