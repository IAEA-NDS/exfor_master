            was used as target, Rubidium and Bromine have atomic
            number 37 and 35, respectively, which makes it
            impossible to determine the target nucleus of the
            spallation reaction
SAMPLE     Pellets fabricated from 99.9%-pure RbBr powder Each
           packet typically contained a target and a number of
           monitor and recoil-catcher foils. Elemental Al, with
           a purity of 99.997% and thickness of 0.025 mm, was
           used for the beam monitors and the forward and
           backward recoil catchers. RbBr tablets had
           thicknesses of 5-6 mm. Foil and RbBr pellet diameters
           were approximately 1.3 cm.
