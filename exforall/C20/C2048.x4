METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) For the thin targets, the activity of
           229Pa was measured using the 117.2 and 119.0 keV
           gamma rays post chemical separation of the
           protactinium from fission products and other actinides.

SAMPLE     Targets consisted of four assemblies of stacked
           foils. The first two assemblies were considered the
           thin targets (0.0125 mm thick). The first assembly
           consisted of eight natural thorium foils (18.5-21.6 mg

           foils. Each of the thorium foils was mounted on a
           thin (0.025 mm) high-purity aluminum foil disk. The
           thorium foils were 1.25 x 1.25 cm squares, whereas
           the aluminum foil disks had a diameter of 4 cm.

           the aluminum foil disks had a diameter of 4 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Direct analysis of the thorium foils after
           irradiation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total errors were obtained as the square root
           of the sum of squares of the errors mentioned above
           and ranged between 7 and 13%.
           (ERR-1,,5.) systematic uncertainty in gamma ray assay
           (ERR-2,,5.) systematic uncertainty in detector
           efficiency
           (ERR-3,1.5,10.0) systematic uncertainty in proton
           beam current
           (ERR-4,,5.)  For the cross sections from Th targets,
           an error for the chemical separation yield.
