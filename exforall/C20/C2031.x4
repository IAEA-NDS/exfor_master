FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM)Experiment performed at the K500
           cyclotron at the Texas A&M University cyclotron
           facility
SAMPLE     9Be sample with thickness of 45.6mg/cm2
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Particles of interest were
           detected in a multihit dE-E telescope located at 0deg,
           18 cm downstream of the target. The dE element
           consisted of a large-area double-side Si strip
           detector which also provided the angular measurements.
           This 300 mu-m Si detector had dimensions of 10 cm x 10
           cm with 128 strips on both the front and back sides.
           Behind this was placed a 32-element array of 10-cm-
           thick CsI(Tl) scintillator E detectors to stop the
           particles.
METHOD     (EDE)
INC-SOURCE A primary 14N beam with energy of 38 MeV/A
           and of intensity 80 pnA was extracted from the K500
           cyclotron. This beam impinged on a hydrogen gas cell
           held at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres at liquid
           nitrogen temperature. A secondary beam of 13-O with
           intensity of 2000 - 4000 part./s and energy of 30.3
           MeV/A was separated from the other reaction products
           using the MARS spectrometer

ANALYSIS   Reaction rates were determined using level
           properties determined in this work. Properties of
           excited levels of both 13-O and 12N nuclei were
           determined using the invariant mass analysis of proton
           decays of unbound states of 13-O and 12N. Energies and
           widths of observed states are as follows
