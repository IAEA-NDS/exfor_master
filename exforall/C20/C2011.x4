TITLE      Absolute cross sections for the 27Al(p,3pn)24Na
           reaction at 28 and 0.8 GeV

FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Experiment performed using fast
           external beam (FEB) from the Alternating Gradient
           Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory
SAMPLE     The standard target assembly consisted of a central
           20 mg/cm2 high-purity Al foil guarded on each side by
           5 mg/cm2 Al. The guard foils were sufficiently thick
           to compensate for 24Na recoil losses from the central
           foil. Targets for early experiments contained
           polyethylene foils to measure the
           27Al(p,3pn)24Na/12C(p,pn)11C ratio
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma rays from decay of 24Na were detected
           with Ge(Li) detectors in two geometries, at nominal 5
           and 10 cm distances from the cryostat face.
METHOD     (ACTIV) A raw cross section for each experiment was
            calculated from the mean 24Na disintegration rate
            extrapolated to the midpoint of the irradiation and
            the proton fluence determined by the current
            transformers.

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from text p.42,43 of the reference
ANALYSIS   Final result was determined from set of 32
           independent measurements. From these measurements
           unweighted mean value and standard deviation were
           determined.

           generated secondary particles were made
