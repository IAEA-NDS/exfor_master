FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Data measured using the DRAGON recoil
           mass spectrometer, part of the ISAC facility at TRIUMF
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with H2 gas at an
           average pressure of 4.81+-0.01 Torr.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The 21Na recoils resulting from resonant
           proton capture were transmitted to the end of DRAGON
           recoil mass spectrometer, where they were detected by
           Si strip detector
           (SISD) Reaction products were detected in a double-
           sided silicon strip detector, placed in focal plane
           of DRAGON.
ANALYSIS   Total yield was calculated from measured number of
           reaction products detected in DRAGON focal detector
           and integrated beam current.
