FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was performed at ISAC I
           facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver using the TUDA
            (TRIUMF-U.K. Detector Array) chamber
SAMPLE     The target was 25mu-g/cm2 7LiF on a 10 mu-g/cm2
           carbon backing. Elastic scattering on F nuclei was
           used for calibration of detectors.
DETECTOR   (SISD) TUDA chamber contained Louvain-Edinburgh
           Detector Array (LEDA), which consists of eight
           separate azimuthal sectors, each with 16 radial
           elements. This annular detector is 300 mu-m thick and
           its active area spans radii from 50mm to 129.9mm. LEDA
           was placed at a distance of 7.2 cm form the target
           (SISD) The S2 is a double sided silicon strip
           detector consisting of a single element that is
           divided into 16 azimuthal sectors on the back side
           and 48 rings on the front. This 500 mu-m thick
           detector has inner radius of 11.5 mm and an outer
           radius of 35 mm. S2 detector was placed at the
           distance of 13 cm from the target
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between LEDA and S2 detectors was
           required to identify the selected events.
INC-SOURCE Radioactive 8Li(2+) beam at an energy of 11 MeV with an
           intensity of (9 - 16)*E+6/s was produced using ISAC 1
           facility. Protons with energy of 500 MeV and current
           up to 100 mu-A were steered onto production targets to
           produce 8Li nuclei which are separated by mass
           separator and accelerated.
