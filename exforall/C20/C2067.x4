REL-REF    (M,,N.D.Scielzo+,J,PR/C,81,034608,2010) Information
            about enriched sample used in present experiment.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The experiments were carried out at
           the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National
           Laboratory.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) Energy and angle of charged
           particles were measured using Si telescope consisting
           of 140 mu-m dE detector Si-strip detector and 1000
           mu-m thick Si-strip E detectors. The angular range of
           both detectors was 36 - 62 deg. The p-side of these
           detectors are segmented into 48 concentric rings each
           0.5mm thick. The n-side has 16 wedge-shaped sectors
           each spanning 22.5deg.
           (HPGE) Coincident gamma rays were detected using an
           array of five Compton-suppressed clover Ge detectors,
           the Livermore Berkeley Array for Collaborative
           Experiments (LIBERACE)
METHOD     (EDE) Deuterons were identified using E-dE method
           (COINC) Coincidence between charged particles and gamma
            rays was required
