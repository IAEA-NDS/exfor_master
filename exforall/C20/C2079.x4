SAMPLE     (7-N-15,ENR=0.994) Nitrogen gas target in a thin-
           window gas cell.
METHOD     (MASSP) The target was nitrogen gas enriched to 99.4%
           in 15N, contained in a thin-window rotating gas cell.
           The reaction protons were analysed in a 65 cm radius
           broad-range magnetic spectrograph, and recorded in
           Ilford K2 nuclear emulsions 50 microm thick.

           in Ilford K2 nuclear emulsion plates at 24 angles.
           Plate scanning and data analysis were performed at

SAMPLE     An adenin (C5H5N5) solid target on a thin carbon
           backing.
METHOD     (MASSP) The reaction protons were analysed in a multi-
           angle, broad-range magnetic spectrograph and recorded
           in Ilford K2 nuclear emulsion plates at 24 angles.
           Plate scanning and data analysis were performed at
           the University of Pennsylvania.
