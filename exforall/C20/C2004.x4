TITLE      Excitation functions for deuterons and protons on Mg
AUTHOR     (F.O.Bartell,S.Softky)

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK,1USAUCX)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Irradiations were performed using 60-
           inch and 184 inch cyclotrons at Berkeley radiation
           laboratory.
SAMPLE     Stack of 22 Mg metal foils, each 9 mg/cm2 thick.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Activities were measured with the thin mica
           window Geiger-Muller counter.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Excitation curves were measured by bombarding
           stacks of foils and measuring the induced activities
           in the foils as a function of time in order to
           identify the radioactive products by their half-lives.
           The absorber thickness that the incident particles
           passed through in order to reach a given foil in the
           stack was an indication of the particle energy for
           that foil as found from a range-energy curve.

COMMENT    Data points in subentries 2-4 are digitized from
           best available figures, but of poor quality. All data
           points were digitized and compiled , but some data
           points are probably incorrect, as mentioned in
           corresponding subentries. Different scales for two
           data sets may also contribute.

SAMPLE     Stack of "foils" prepared by pressing the oxide of
           separated 24Mg isotope into 0.015-in. thick beryllium
           masks. Foils were about 40 mg/cm2 thick.In the
           bombardments Cu absorbers of accurately known thickness
           were inserted between the target foils in order to
           degrade the beam energy.
FLAG       (1.) Measured at 20MeV beam energy using 60in.

COMMENT    Comment by compiler. Data points at 9.6 MeV and
           17.4 MeV are taken from figure, but are probably not
           correct.

COMMENT    Comment by compiler: There is a contradiction between
           curves I (0-20 MeV) and II (0-190 MeV) vertical
           scales and corresponding results, two curves would
           not match. To overcome this problem I assumed that
           both curves are in mb (effectively divided curve II
           by factor 10). New values are more consistent with
           the TENDL-2015 library for 12-Mg-24(d,2p)11-Na-24.
HISTORY    (20170619A) BP: Redigitized the curves using the memo
           CPD926 recommendations.
