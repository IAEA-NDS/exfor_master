FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACAR) Experiment performed using internal
           circulating proton beam of the Carnegie Institute of
           Technology synchrocyclotron
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Activities were measured using a 3in. x 3in.
            NaI(Tl) connected to 256 multichannel analyser.
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG)
MONIT-REF  (,J.B.Cumming,J,ARN,13,261,1963)
ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined from analysis of decay
           curve relative to the monitor cross section
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Standard deviation of duplicate determination
           (ERR-T) Total estimated uncertainty
           (ERR-1) Systematic uncert. in detection efficiency
           (ERR-2) Syst. uncertainty in monitor cross section
           (ERR-3) Syst. uncertainty in X-ray branching ratio
