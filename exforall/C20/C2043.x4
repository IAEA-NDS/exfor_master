FACILITY   (CYCLO,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at ISAC facility
           at TRIUMF using DRAGON recoil separator
SAMPLE     Windowless hydrogen gas target with an effective
           length of 12.3 cm. The pressure in the target can be
           regulated within the range of 0.2 - 8 Torr.
           Differential pumping between the target and the
           separator provides pressure reduction to 10-6 Torr at
           the separator entrance.
           Hydrogen target pressure was maintained at 5.3Torr,
           corresponding to a target thickness of 4.18E+18
           atoms/cm2.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Recoiled reaction products were momentum
           analyzed in series of magnetic dipoles and
           quadrupoles and electrostatic dipoles. Recoils were
           identified in focal plane detector
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber is a 25 cm long isobutane-
           filled volume separated from the beam line by a thin
           Mylar window. The anode of the chamber is divided
           into three segments, providing additional energy loss
           information for recoil identification. The first
           segment provides the primary energy loss measurement,
           while the total energy is obtained from the sum of
           all three ion chamber segments.
           (BGO) The target was surrounded by an array of thirty
           hexagonal BGO detectors arranged in close-packed
           geometry. The gamma rays detected by the BGO crystals
           provide a timing signal for the separator time of
           flight.
           (MCPLT) To further increase the beam suppression
           through improved particle identification a local
           time-of-flight system was used. The system consisted
           of two timing detectors, each of which consists of a
           carbon foil, an electrostatic mirror and a
           microchannel plate.
METHOD     (EDE,COINC,TOF)
