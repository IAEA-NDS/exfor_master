TITLE      Production of polarized 8Li with the
            7Li(d-pol,8Li-pol)p reaction.
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAWIS)
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Polarized ion source used to provide a
            momentum analyzed,variable energy, beam of
            vector polarized deuterons with polarization
            py or pz = 0.59 (0.01). The maximum py or pz
            for a purely vector polarized beam is  +-2/3.
            The tenzor polarization of the beams were
            pyy and pzz < 0.05.
SAMPLE     Targets were typically 1-mm thick Li metal wafers,
            enriched to 99.9 % in 7Li, and held near
            liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Target was activated for 1 s and activity
            counted as function of time for 4 s.  The sign of
            the deuteron polarization was reversed, and the
            cycle repeated.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) Plastic scintillators or detector
            telescopes sufficiently thick to stop 16-MeV
            electrons for detecting of beta-particles.
DECAY-DATA (3-LI-8,,B) Nominal endpoint energy is 13 MeV with
            2.94-MeV level of 8Be rapidly decaying into two alpha
            particles.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 1 of reference.

CORRECTION Since transient depolarization contributions were not
            included in analysis, results are more precisely
            lower bounds on polarization transfer coefficients.
