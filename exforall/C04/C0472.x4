TITLE      T20 measurements for 1H(d(pol),g)3He and the p-wave
            component of the nucleon-nucleon force
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) By a type FN Tandem the beam after
            ABPIS was accelerated to desired energy.
INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Tensor polarized deuteron beam from the TUNL
            Atomic Beam Polarized Ion Source. Beam source was
            allowed to fast spin flip between two tenzor
            polarized deuteron spin states (respectively, 0%  and
            66% population of the mj=0 substate) at rate of 10
            Hertz.
SAMPLE     Pure 2H gas target with lenght 10.8 cm.
METHOD     (COINC,FPGAM,REC) Direct gamma-ray spectroscopy with
            monitoring of coincidences with the 3He recoils.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gammas detected using anticoincidence shielded
            25.4 cm x 25.4 cm cylindrical NaI(Tl) detector
            surrounded with lithium carbonated paraffin.
           (SCIN) To further reduce neutron background, a 3He
            recoil detection system consisting of a dipole bending
            magnet and two plastic scintillators was used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties are due mainly to counting
            statistics; beam polarization uncertainties are
            included, but contribution is negligible.
STATUS     Data taken from Table 1 of reference.
           No reply received from H. Weller to author proof.
