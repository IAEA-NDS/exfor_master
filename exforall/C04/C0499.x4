TITLE      Measurement of the cross section of 22Ne(p,n)22Na
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMHG) PET facility at U. Michigan Medical
            School.
INC-SPECT  Metallic absorbers of Ta, Ni, and stainless steel used
            at entrance window of cell to degrade initial proton
            energy of 26 MeV.  Energy controlled by adjusting
            thickness of absorbers.
SAMPLE     Natural Ne (9.2% 22Ne) gas cell with aluminum internal
            walls, a removeable Monel liner, and copper end
            flange.
           (10-NE-22,NAT=0.092)
METHOD     (ACTIV) All 22Na produced was bound to Monel liner in
            cell. Liner was removed from cell after activation
            for counting.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN)
MONITOR    Sealed 22Na calibration sources.

           (ERR-2)  intensity of calibration sources (6%),
           (ERR-3)  pressure reading (5%),
           (ERR-4)  measurement of integrated charge (3.5%),
           (ERR-S)  statistical uncertainties (3%).
