INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron neutrons emerging from the
           water boiler had a cadmium ratio of about 500 and, at
           a power of 5.5 kilowatts, the flux at a position of
           the foil was 6x10**5 neutrons/cm2/sec.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford C2 nuclear emulsion plates, 100 microns
           thick.
SAMPLE     A 10-mil thickness of 235UO3 was coated on a 1/32-inch
           thick aluminum strip measuring 1x4 inches.
METHOD     (REC) The uranium foil was placed approximately
           perpendicular with the aluminum side facing the beam.
           Nuclear emulsion plates were placed outside of the
           neutron beam at a distance of 16 cm from the nearest
           edge of the foil. A 15-hour run at a power of 5.5 kW
           gave an appropriate proton recoil density on the
           nuclear plates. A background experiment was performed
           by removing the 235U foil and substituting a piece of
           aluminum.
ANALYSIS   The nuclear plates were analyzed by the method of
           measuring recoils about the a small angle of the
           forward neutron direction. In order to obtain the
           true number of proton recoil tracks, the number of
           measured tracks must be corrected for those tracks
           leaving the emulsion surfaces. The number of
           corrected proton recoil tracks is proportional to the
           collision cross section of hydrogen (sigma p) and to
           the incoming neutron flux. The neutron spectrum or
           N(E) can then be obtained after correcting the
           measured tracks for recoils leaving the emulsion
           surface and sigma p. Since it is desirable to plot the
           spectral curve in terms of neutron energy E rather
           than proton recoil energy Ep, it is necessary to
           convert the track data from Ep to E. Tracks on the
           background plate were less than 5% of the number of
           measured tracks on the regular data plate. Therefore,
           the background was neglected in the analysis of the
           data. Unfortunately, this method does not allow to
           discriminate between prompt and delayed neutrons.
