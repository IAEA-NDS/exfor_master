                                 gamma transitions
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the
           Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)using 800
           MeV proton linac
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma rays were detected with the GEANIE
           spectrometer, located about 20 m from the neutron
           source on the 60deg right flight path. For this
           experiment, the GEANIE spectrometer consisted of 11
           planar and 15 25% High- purity Ge (HPGe) coaxial
           detectors. All of the planars and 9 of the coaxial
           detectors were equipped with Compton suppression
           shields. The detectors were situated at a distance of
           approx. 14 cm from the focal point where the
           scattering sample was located.
METHOD     (TOF) neutron energy determined by time of flight
           method. Detection time of the "flash" of gamma rays
           caused by the spallation reaction was used as a
           reference marker. The detection time of the gamma rays
           produced by neutrons interacting with the sample was
           used to calculate the time of flight.
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)
           (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG)
            A fission chamber containing  235,238U located 2m
            upstream from the GEANIE spectrometer was used to
            determine the neutron flux.
           (26-FE-56(N,INL)26-FE-56,PAR,SIG,G) Cross section for
             production of 847 keV gamma transition was used
             for checking purposes in several runs. For this
             purpose the 150Sm sample was sandwiched between
             0.2mm Fe foils.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed neutron beam was produced via
           spallation on a natural W target by an 800-MeV proton
           linear accelerator beam. The average proton beam
           current at the spallation target was about 1 - 2
           mu-A. The neutron beam structure contained 625 mu-s
           long 'macropulses' driven by two of every three such
           macropulses from the accelerator for an average rate
           of 40/s. Each macropulse consisted of 'micropulses'
           spaced every 1.8 mu-s, each <1 ns long. The pulsed
           beam allowed incident neutron energies to be
           determined using the time-of-flight technique.
SAMPLE     (62-SM-150,ENR=0.956) The 150Sm sample with thickness
           of 1550 mg/cm2
CORRECTION Corrected for internal conversion and deadtime and
           multiple scattering. The internal conversion
           coefficients were taken from the NUDAT database
COMMENT    Cross sections for several discrete gamma rays i.e.
           334 keV gamma line was already published in 2007 and
           compiled in 14148.002.
