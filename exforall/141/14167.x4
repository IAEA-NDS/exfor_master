TITLE      Measurement of Threshold Reaction Cross Section
           Ratios in Fission Neutron Fields
AUTHOR     (R.Fleming,V.Spiegel)
REFERENCE  (S,NUREG/CP-0004,(3),953,1979)
INSTITUTE  (1USANBS)
DETECTOR   (GELI) 66 cm3 detector.
SAMPLE     SRM-1158 nickel/iron alloy foil (36.03% Ni and 63.15%
           Fe).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) Not fully investigated systematic effects
           during the irradiation and counting.
           (ERR-S,,1.) The purely statistic uncertainty is less
           than 1%.
