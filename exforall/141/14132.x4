TITLE      Thermal Neutron Capture Cross Sections of Zirconium-91
            and Zirconium-93 by Prompt gamma-ray Spectroscopy
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) The experiments were performed using the
            internal target facility at the 8-MW Los Alamos Omega
            West Reactor.
INC-SPECT  The target was positioned at the center of the graphite
            thermal column about 1.5m from the edge of the reactor
            core, where the thermal neutron flux was about 6 x1E11
            n/cm2, with a Maxwellian distribution corresponding to
            a temperature of 350 K. The Cd(In) ratio was about
            2 x 1E3.
SAMPLE     The Zr sample weighed 114.0 +/- 0.1 mg (22.8 +/- 0.1 mg
            of 93ZrO2), and its isotopic composition is
                                     Atomic percent
             90Zr                     2.29 +/- 0.05
             91Zr                    18.61 +/- 0.1
             92Zr                    18.95 +/- 0.1
             93Zr                    19.98 +/- 0.1
             94Zr                    20.50 +/- 0.1
             96Zr                    19.67 +/- 0.1
           The largest chemical contaminants were 1.0% Mo and
            0.3% Fe.
DETECTOR   (GE) The gamma rays emitted in the (nth,g) reaction
            were measured with a 26-cm3 coaxial Ge(Li) detector
            positioned inside a 20 cm-outer diameter x 30 cm-long
            NaI(Tl) annulus.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
MONITOR    A 100.0 +/- 0.1 mg sample of (CH2)n was placed at the
            target position together with the Zr sample in the
            thermal column. All capture cross sections obtained in
            this work are based on sigma0 = 332.6 +/- 0.7 mb
            for 1H.
