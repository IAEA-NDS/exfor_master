TITLE      Burnup Determination of Nuclear Fuels
AUTHOR     (F.L.Lisman,W.J.Maeck,J.E.Rein)
REFERENCE  (R,IN-1178,1968)
INSTITUTE  (1USAMTR)
FACILITY   (REAC,1USAMTR)
INC-SPECT  Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) at an unperturbed
           flux of 6 x 10**13 neutrons/cm2-sec (accumulated
           nvt=1.7 x 10**20).
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.991633)
           (92-U-234,ENR=0.004677)
           (92-U-236,ENR=0.000603)
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.003087) Standard burnup capsule CPP-6-
           5-3, which contained 122.0 mg of highly enriched U3O8
           mixed with high-purity aluminum powder and welded in
           a high-purity aluminum tube.
METHOD     (CHSEP,BURN) The capsule was irradiated for two fuel
           cycles (1290 Mwd)in the MTR. The cadmium ratio for
           cobalt for this irradiation was 15. The capsule was
           discharged from the reactor July 20, 1964, and
           allowed to cool for about three years before
           dissolution.

COMMENT    Due to a power failure during recycling of the
           krypton through the gas chromatograph, no error can
           be assigned to the volume of krypton obtained and
           hence to the various krypton fission yields.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error associated with each value for
           the xenon isotopes is the standard deviation.
COMMENT    No attempt was made to distinguish those atoms of Xe-
           136 resulting from Xe-135(n,gamma)Xe-136 reactions
           and hence no Xe-136 fission yield can be reported.

METHOD     To calculate the yield of the 85 mass chain, the
           number of determined Rb-85 atoms was added to the
           determined atoms of 10.76-yr Kr-85.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The method of calculation and the error
           propagation for the determined number of Rb-85 and

METHOD     (CHSEP) The absolute thermal fission yields of four
           ruthenium isotopes, Ru-101, -102, -104, and -106,
           were determined by isotope dilution mass
           spectrometry. The atoms of Ru-106 also were measured
           radiometrically. Four 1000-microl aliquots from the
           dissolver solution were spiked with known amounts of
           Ru-106 and carried through the separation and
           analysis procedure.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
