FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Experiment performed at white neutron
           source of the Lujan Center, based on spallation
           reactions on a tungsten target using a pulsed
           800-MeV proton beam, accumulated in the proton
           storage ring.
DETECTOR   (BAF2) DANCE BaF2 array consisting of 160 BaF2 crystals
           arranged in a 4pi geometry. Each crystal has a depth
           of 15 cm and a volume of  approx. 734 cm3.DANCE
           provides the total gamma ray calorimetry and the
           multiplicity information of the gamma cascade
           following neutron capture.
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy determined by time of
           flight.
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed 800-MeV proton beam impinging on W
           target. The bunch length was 125 ns and the
           repetition rate 20 Hz. Sample and detector were
           placed at a distance of 14 m.
