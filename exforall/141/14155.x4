FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) Oak Ridge Electron Linear
            Accelerator (ORELA)
SAMPLE     55Mn sample with dimensions of 2.54x5.08x0.317cm.
           41K sample in form of KCl enriched to 99.17% in
           41K with a thickness of 0.005617 at/b.
           39K target was natural potassium carbonate sample
           with a thickness of 0.0088 at/b.
DETECTOR   Pair of deuterated benzene (C6D6) detectors by
           employing the pulse-height- weighting method. Sample
           and detector were on the flight path 7 at a distance
           of 40 m from the neutron producing target
           (SCIN) 6Li glass scintillator 0.5-mm-thick placed at a
           distance of 39.695 m from the neutron target was used
           to measure neutron flux
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used to determine incident
           neutron energy
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutrons were produced by photoneutron
           reaction using Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator.
           ORELA was operated at a repetition rate of 525 Hz, a
           burst width of 8 ns, and a power of 5 to 6 kW.
ADD-RES    Transmission was measured for K, Cl, and KCl
            (preliminary data given in Fig.5)
