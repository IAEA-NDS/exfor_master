SAMPLE     Natural tantalum targets of 2.54 cm diameter and 0.12
           mm thickness with mass of 1.2 g containing only 140
           microg of 180mTa.
METHOD     (ACTIV) De-excitation cross section of the isomeric-
           state nuclide 180mTa has been measured with
           mono-energetic photon beams in the 1.56 MeV to 3.70
           MeV energy range. After irradiation for typically 20
           h with photon fluxes ranging from 0.3*10**7
           gamma/(cm2*s) to 3.2*10**7 gamma/(cm2*s), the 180mTa
           de-excitation cross section was obtained from the
           yield of the Kalpha1 and Kalpha2 X rays of 180mHf at
           55.79 keV and 54.61 keV, respectively, produced after
           electron capture on the unstable 180mTa ground state.
           The tantalum disks were gamma-ray counted with a
           planar HPGe detector. For this purpose the disk was
           attached directly to the front face of the 30 mm
           diameter detector. Its efficiency was measured in the
           region of interest with a calibrated multi-isotope
           gamma-ray source, including 241Am with X rays at
           59.54 keV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty assigned to the data include
           the statistical uncertainties plus an estimated 25%
           uncertainty in bremsstrahlung correction, except at
           Egamma=1.8 MeV, where a 18% uncertainty was used.
           The latter two uncertainties are estimates based on
           the present single-electron and two-electron bunch
           tests and past experience. All individual
           uncertainties were added in quadrature.
           (ERR-1,18.,25.) Bremsstrahlung correction.
CORRECTION A sizable attenuation correction of 1.3 had to be
           applied, using the X-ray attenuation factor. A small
           correction was applied to account for the slightly
           different electron beam currents used at some of the
           energies. The bremsstrahlung correction.
