TITLE      2H(p,gamma)He3 reaction using polarized and

INSTITUTE  (1CANSAS,1USAFLA,1USADKE,1USATNL)
FACILITY   (ACCEL,1USATNL) The capture gamma-ray facility at the
           Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 25.4 x 25.4 cm NaI crystal having a plastic
           anticoincidence shield.
SAMPLE     (1-H-2,ENR=0.92) CD2 ~1 mg/cm2 and ~0.2 mg/cm2
           deuterium gas targets.
METHOD     Measured was the energy distribution over an
           excitation range in 3He of Ex=7.5 to 15.4 MeV or direct
            absolute cross section from E = 3.0 to 14.8 MeV. The
           energy distribution was to 12 MeV with the CD2 target,
           while for the higher energies a deuterium gas cell
           was used and normalized to the solid target results
           at several overlapping energies. Since the
           spectrometer efficiency was determined at 15.1 MeV,
           the efficiencies at other energies have been obtained
           by correcting for the experimentally determined
           energy dependence of (1) the crystal response
           function, (2) the attenuation of the gamma-rays by
           the shielding in front of the crystal, and (3) the
           rejection rate due to the anticoincidence shield. For
           the lowest energy the efficiency was taken as 14.5%
            (a 15% correction relative to the calibration point).
           The energy loss of the primary proton beam in the
           target was also taken into account.
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL) The cross sections have been converted to
           that for photo disintegration using detailed balance.

FLAG       (0.) Standard description
           (1.) The cross section is nearly zero at 0 and 180 deg.
           A second fit was performed in which the cross section
           was constrained to be essentially zero at these angles
           but with errors taken to be indicative of the errors in
           the present experiment.
