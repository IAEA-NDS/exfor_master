FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the HIgS
           facility at TUNL
SAMPLE     Gas mixture of CO2 (80%) + N2 (20%) at pressure of
           100 torr in sensitive volume of the optical time
           projection chamber with dimensions of 30 x 30 x 21 cm3.
DETECTOR   Time projection chamber with working gas mixture
           serving at the same time as reaction target.
           Ionization electrons drift towards a double
           parallel-grid avalanche multiplier, yielding charge
           multiplication and light emission. Avalanche-induced
           photons from N2 emission are collected, intensified
           and recorded with a Charge Coupled Device (CCD)
           camera, providing two-dimensional track images. The
           event's time projection (third coordinate) and the
           deposited energy are recorded by photomultipliers and
           by the TPC charge-signal, respectively. Detector has
           nearly 100 % efficiency and negligible background.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monoenergetic gamma-rays were produced
           by Compton backscattering of photons of the
           free-electron laser. Beams of circularly polarized
           gamma rays with energies between 9.1 and 10.7 MeV
           were used with energy spreads of 300-350 keV and
           on-target intensities of 2E+8 photons/sec.

ANALYSIS   From measured total width of 10.025 MeV state and
           3 alpha particle decay width ratio, an upper limit on
           3 alpha decay of Hoyle state was determined from
           R-matrix theory, which gives relation of width and
           penetrability of a state. Three alpha penetrability
           ratios were calculated using Monte Carlo code with
           WKB approximation.
