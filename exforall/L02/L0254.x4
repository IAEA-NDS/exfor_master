FACILITY   (LASER,1USALRL) Petawatt laser facility. 260 J of
           1.05 mu-m laser light, in a 450 fs long pulse, was
           focused onto a solid gold target, after being
           reflected from a plasma mirror. The focal spot size
           was 20 mu-m, producing an average intensity of
           greater than 10.E+20 W/cm2, corresponding to a
           ponderomotive energy of 3 MeV. A lower intensity
           prepulse of <100 mu-J was focused on the target 2 ns
           prior to the main pulse. The prepulse created a
           plasma at the target surface, which from a plasma
           hydrodynamic calculation is expected to have
           undergone a two-dimensional expansion with a rapidly
           decreasing plasma density extending away from the
           target. The density scale length is estimated to be
           50 mu-m, in which the main laser pulse experiences
           relativistic self-focusing or filamentation. The gold
           target was mounted on a cylindrical copper sample
           holder, which contained an additional quantity of
           197Au (0.3 g) and 238U .
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The low energy portion of the electron spectrum
           resembles a Maxwellian with a 3 MeV mean energy. The
           high energy tail extends up to 100 MeV.
SAMPLE     238U 1.2 g
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A shielded high purity germanium gamma-ray
           spectrometer
ANALYSIS   The time-resolved gamma-ray information was used to
           identify decay products from the photoinduced fission
           of 238U. The nuclides were identified by their
           gamma-ray line energies and half-lives include 87,88Kr,
           92,93Sr, 93,94,95Y, 101,104Tc, 105Ru, 107Rh, 128Sb,
           128Sn,134Te, 135I, 138Xe, 138Cs, 141Ba, and 146Ce.
CORRECTION The direct contribution to the yield of a given nuclide
           by the fission process was obtained from the total
           yield, after making corrections for contributions from
           other decay chains.
MONITOR    (92-U-228(G,F)53-I-135,CUM,FY,,BRA)
           It was estimated a total yield of (1.8+-0.2)E+07
           fission events.
