TITLE      Photofission cross-section ratio measurement of
           235U/238U using monoenergetic photons in the energy
           range of 9.0 - 16.6 MeV

FACILITY   (SRING,1USATNL) Measurements were carried out at the
           High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIgS) facility
           located on the campus of Duke University
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.99835) mass = (160.36+-1.60) mu-g
           (92-U-238,ENR=0.99954) mass = (121.90+-1.22) mu-g
           The reference foils of 235U and 238U are electroplated
           on 0.013 cm thick Ti disks. The active area of the
           deposit was 1.27 cm in diameter, which is about 7.0 mm
           smaller than the gamma beam diameter at the target.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The facility has a 0.24-1.2 GeV storage ring
           where quasi-monoenergetic gamma-beam is produced by
           the intracavity Compton back-scattering of the free
           electron laser photons from the electron bunches.
           For this experiment 450 and 540 nm FEL wavelength
           settings and 400 - 650 MeV electron energy settings was
           used to provide high-energy photon beams between 8.0
           and 17.0 MeV.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Dual fission ionization chamber was used.
           Reference foils of 235U and 238U were used in the
           downstream (FC1) and upstream (FC2) fission chamber,
           respectively. By taking the ratio of the number of
           fissions in each chamber, one can remove the necessity
           of knowing the photon flux, as the same collimated
           photon flux is seen by both of the chambers. P-10 gass
           -(90% argon and 10% methane) was used as the DFC
           fill gas.
ANALYSIS   Pulse-height fission spectra produced by the DFC during
           photon irradiation were each integrated to give the
           total number of fissions measured in the individual
           chamber for a given photon energy. From these numbers,
           the fission cross-section ratio was deduced
