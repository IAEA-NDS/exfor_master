INSTITUTE  (1CANSAS)
FACILITY   (BETAT,1CANSAS) The University of Saskatchewan 25-MeV
           betatron.
INC-SOURCE (BRST)
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The samples were counted with Victoreen IB85
           cylindrical Geiger counters.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated in the betatron
           beam with the cylindrical axis parallel to the beam.
           Each sample was given a definite irradiation dose as
           measured by an ionization chamber whose output was
           integrated. The time of irradiation for each sample
           was carefully measured.

SAMPLE     The carbon samples were cut from polystyrene tubes
           2.6-cm outside diameter and 2-mm wall thickness. They
           were 7.5 cm long.

REACTION   (8-O-16(G,N)8-O-15,,INT)
SAMPLE     For the oxygen activation curve cylindrical samples
           of boric acid (H2B407) were used. These were formed
           by compressing the boric acid powder without binder,
           under a pressure of about 7 ton/in. The cylinders
           were about 5 cm long, 2.2-cm inside and 4.0-cm
           outside diameter.
