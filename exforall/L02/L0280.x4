TITLE      Scattering of High-Energy Electrons from Ca40, V51,

DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The single-channel detector used with the
           36-in. magnetic spectrometer was replaced by a
           multichannel detector that allowed simultaneous
           collection of data at ten different values of
           electron momenta.
SAMPLE     Authors used targets of Ca40, V51, Co59, In115, Sb121,
           123, and Bi209. The targets used were thin enough so
           that multiple scattering and straggling could not
           cause part of the beam to miss either the secondary
           emission monitor or the Faraday cup which were used
           to integrate the primary electron beam.
METHOD     The cross sections were obtained by comparison with
           scattering from the proton.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The standard deviations arising from counting
           statistics only in the determinations of the
           target-nuclei elastic peak areas and of the proton
           calibration peaks.

SAMPLE     The Ca40 target was prepared at Stanford Research
           Institute by heating commercial-grade calcium chips
           and molding under an argon atmosphere. The final
           thickness of 0.090 in. was achieved by milling under
           kerosene. The target contained 96% Ca40. It was
           stored in diffusion pump oil to retard oxidation of
           the surface. Approximately 1% oxygen was observed in
           the scattering experiments. Because of recoil of the
           target nucleus, the elastic peak from oxygen lies
           about 0.7% lower in momentum than the peak from Ca40,
           and the yield of electrons scattered from oxygen
           could be identified and subtracted.
FLAG       (1.) There are multiple measurements at some angles.
