FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at High
           Intensity gamma-ray Source (HIgS) at Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory, Durham
SAMPLE     Active fluid target (C4F10) contained within a
           cylindrical glass vessel with an overall length of
           102mm, inner diameter of 30 mm and an outer diameter
           of 36mm. The density of the liquid at superheated
           conditions was 1.45g/cm3. Target thickness was 30 mm.
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) Active target with C4F10 liquid in
           superheated state read out using two 100 Hz
           high-sensitivity CMOS area scan cameras
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The gamma-rays are produced through inverse
           Compton scattering of a two-bunch electron beam
           circulating in an electron storage ring with the
           photons from a high-power free electron laser (FEL)
           beam. The energy of the electrons was typically 400MeV
           with a 532 nm wavelength of the laser light. With this
           technique intensities up to about 10E+8 gamma/s can be
           achieved. The gamma-ray beam was collimated to a
           diameter of 10 mm with a series of oxygen-free Cu
           collimators.

           (ERR-2) Systematic uncertainty in target thickness
CORRECTION  Corrected for background caused by Bremsstrahlung
            radiation component produced by the electrons and the
                                 residual gas in the beam line.
