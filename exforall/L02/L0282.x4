FACILITY   (BETAT,1USAORL) The 22 MeV betatron.
DETECTOR   (BF3) Gated BF3 proportional counters.
SAMPLE     Separated lead isotopes.
METHOD     The experimental apparatus utilized the electron beam,
           focused on copper sample holders at about eleven feet
           from the betatron. This reduced the background
           neutrons from the betatron to a negligible amount.
           Gated BF3 proportional counters were used to detect
           the neutrons after each electron burst. Two samples
           were rotated synchronously in front of the beam, so
           that each was irradiated on alternate bursts.
ANALYSIS   The yield versus energy data could, in each case, be
           represented as a parabola with the vertex at the
           respective threshold.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.
