FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at Duke University, generated circularly polarized
           and monoenergetic photon beams.
SAMPLE     The liquid 4He target was used. The target cell was a
           Kapton cylinder with 0.13-mm-thick walls and
           dimensions 20 cm long x 4 cm diameter.The liquid was
           maintained in the cell at 3.17 K for a target
           thickness of (4.22+-0.04) x1E+23 nuclei/cm2
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Energy spectra were obtained using seven
           NaI(Tl) detectors positioned at angles ranging from
           40. to 159. with the front face of each detector
           approximately 58 cm from the target center.
           The core crystals, measuring 25.4 cm in diameter
           and ranging in length from 25.4 to 30.5 cm, were
           surrounded by a 7.5-cm-thick segmented anticoincidence
           shield consisting of eight NaI(Tl) crystals 30.5 cm
           in length.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free-
           electron laser (FEL) .
