FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory
SAMPLE     Cryogenic liquid 4He target in form of cylinder with
           length of 20 cm and 4 cm in diameter. The cylindrical
           axis of the target cell was aligned along the beam
           axis.The liquid 4He was maintained at 3.4 K with a
           target thickness of (4.17+-0.04)E+23 nuclei/cm2. The
           walls and end windows of the cell were made from
           0.125-mm-thick Kapton foil.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The Compton scattered photons were detected
           by an array of eight NaI(Tl) detectors with core
           diameter of 25.4 cm surrounded by eight annular
           segments of 7.5-cm-thick NaI(Tl) crystals. The
           lengths of the core NaI crystals ranged from 25.4 to
           30.5 cm. The annular segments were used as an
           anticoincidence shield to veto the cosmic-ray
           background. Detectors were placed at scattering
           angles of theta = 55deg, 90deg and 125deg in the
           laboratory frame.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasimonoenergetic
           Compton backscattered photon beam tunable in wide
           energy range with either linear or circular
           polarization. The gamma-ray beam pulses have a width
           of about 300 ps FWHM and are separated by 179 ns.
