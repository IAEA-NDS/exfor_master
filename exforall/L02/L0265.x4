INC-SOURCE (THRDT) X-rays.
DETECTOR   (BF3,GEMUC)
METHOD     The essential features of the experiment are the use
           of high voltage x-ray to produce the disintegrations
           and a boron-trifluoride filled proportional counter
           to detect the resulting neutrons.
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The present day threshold values
           are 1.66 MeV and 2.2 MeV for 9Be and 2H, respectively.

ANALYSIS   Reaction thresholds were measured in the present
           work: High voltage x-rays have been used to
           redetermine the thresholds for the
           photodisintegration of beryllium and deuterium nuclei,
           giving 1.627+-0.010 MeV and 2.183+-0.012 MeV,
           respectively. The cross section ratio was deduced by
           comparing neutron counting rates 15 keV above the
           reaction thresholds. Therefore, the beryllium cross
           section energy was 1.642 MeV and deuterium cross
           section energy is 2.198 MeV.

ANALYSIS   For quantum energies ranging from 0 to 0.25 MeV above
           threshold or 2.183-2.433 X-ray energy. With even less
           precision it is possible to estimate the order of
           magnitude of the total cross section: reasonable
           guesses as to the effective number of quanta and the
           sensitivity of neutron detection lead to a value of
           about 10**(-28) cm2.
