            (JLab).
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremsstrahlung flux was induced by an electron
           linac and a 1-mm tungsten radiator.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometer.
SAMPLE     The target crucible had a depression drilled on the
           face to house approximately 50.9 mg of gallium oxide
           powder, or 60 mg for the compressed pellet. Kapton
           tape held the powder in place. Then, the remaining
           two foils were stacked atop this so as to receive a
           nearly identical bremsstrahlung flux. The vanadium
           foil was 100 microm thick while the nickel foil was
           10 microm thick. The stack was placed 1 cm beyond the
           radiator on the beam axis.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Post-irradiation and cooling, the target was
           transported to a gamma-ray spectrometer to analyze
           the samples individually. The JLab Radiation Control
           Department performed a series of HPGe gamma
           spectroscopy measurements on the foils in order to
           estimate activation. The HPGe detector has a 23%
           relative efficiency for 60Co, a beryllium window with
           a thickness of 57 mm, and a 49-mm active diameter.
           Calibrations for the various foils were determined
           via Canberra In-situ Object Counting System Software
            (ISOCS).

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties in this paper regarding the
           bremsstrahlung weighted cross section of the
           58Ni(g,n)57Ni cross section were not propagated. The
           reason for this lies in the normalization via the
           photon flux. The systematic errors from this flux are
           calculated the same. Then, as we normalize to that
           flux [i.e., take the ratios], errors stemming from
           this largely cancel and do not contribute
           substantially to the errors reported. Furthermore,
           note that the random statistical uncertainties of the
           simulations are very small in comparison to the
           experimental statistical uncertainties.

SAMPLE     V target mass 0.050 g.
METHOD     (ACTIV) First Irradiation, 3600 sec. Measurements for
           the first irradiation were carried out in two
           different configurations: a full stack of foils and
           the gallium oxide powder individually. The stack
           measurement was initially made at 30 cm for 1 h. The
           stack was then measured at 30 cm for 12 h. A final
           1-h measurement was made at 10.5 cm. The gallium
           oxide powder was measured once for 3.35 h at 1.3 cm.
