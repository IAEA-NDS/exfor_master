           Identical data as given in present reference tab.3,were

FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at Duke University, which produces quasimonoenergetic
           Compton backscattered photon beam
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Dual-fission ionization chamber was used in
           experiment. In the ionization chamber only two
           reference foils were placed in two ionization chambers.
           The body of the dual-fission chamber has an outer
           diameter of 2.50 cm and an overall thickness of
           1.73 cm. The dimensions of the active gas volume
           of each chamber was 2.21 cm diameter and 0.495 cm
           thickness.The FC fill gas used for counting is P-10
            90% argon and 10% methane.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free-
           electron laser (FEL).For this experiment 450 and 540 nm
           FEL wavelength photons and 400-650 MeV electrons were
           used to provide high-energy photon beams between  9.0
           and 17.0 MeV.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty
           in the ratio of the mass densities of the DFC foils
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty computed by adding
           statistical and systematic uncertainties in
           quadrature.
