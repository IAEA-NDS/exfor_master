INC-SOURCE Protons interact with CF2 target. The notation
           19F(p,gamma) is a convenient but inexact designation
           for the gamma-rays from fluorine bombarded with
           protons, since it has been shown that most of the
           high energy rays are emitted from an excited state of
           16O derived from (20Ne)* by emission of an alpha
           particle. The energy of the gamma-rays has been
           measured to be 6.3 MeV and the character of the
           gamma-rays does not seem to change when the proton
           energy is varied from 0.33 to 1.36 MeV.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,IOCH)
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: There is a 6.0484 MeV in the
           ground-state band of 16O.

SAMPLE     The first film was gray, and was assumed to be U308,
           while the second was black, assumed to be UO2. The
           weight of the first film was 4.06 mg, giving N = 0.87x
           10**19. The second, black, film (UO2) weighed 5.75 mg,
           giving 1.27X10**19 atoms from the weight.
METHOD     (REC) The cross section for the photo-fission process
           was measured by using a uranium film thin enough so
           that every fission process could be observed in the
           ionization chamber. Since each fission produces a
           pair of recoil atoms having roughly the same mass,
           one of the particles will be in a direction to be
           recorded by the ionization, while the other will be
           absorbed in the backing plate on which the uranium is
           deposited. The evaporated films we used contained
           approximately 1 mg/cm2, which is roughly 1/4 cm air
           equivalent in stopping power. Fifteen runs were taken
           in the determination of the fission rate per proton
           current. Two uranium films were used, the proton
           energy and current were varied as well as the
           distance of the uranium to the target. In a sample
           run, 41 fissions were observed in 295 seconds from a
           uranium film containing 1.22x10**19 atoms placed so
           that 1/4*pi*r**2 was 0.0134 cm2 when the CaF2 target
           was bombarded with 0.91 microa of 3.0-MeV protons.
ANALYSIS   The mean value of these fifteen determinations of the
           uranium cross section.

SAMPLE     Thick target of uranium and thorium. The thorium used
           was spectroscopically free of uranium, and the
           uranium had less than a few percent of thorium
           contamination.
METHOD     We were unable to get such a good check in the
           analogous procedure for a thin evaporated film of
           thorium. Therefore, the cross section for thorium was
           obtained by comparing the fission yields from thick
           targets of uranium and thorium. In each case the same
           exposed area of freshly sandpapered metal was used.
           This is the average of several runs at different
           proton energies.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainty arises mainly from the
           statistical fluctuations involved.
