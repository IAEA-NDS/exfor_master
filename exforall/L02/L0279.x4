INC-SOURCE (BRST) 322-MeV bremsstrahlung from the Berkeley
           synchrotron.
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,THRES) Short bombardments of silver, copper,
           and polystyrene detectors result in activities
           produced primarily by (gamma,n) processes:
           Ag107(gamma,n) Ag106, 24 min (counting was started
           after the 2.3-min activity of Ag108 had died out);
           Cu63(gamma,n)Cu62 10.1 min; C12(gamma,n)C11, 20 min.
METHOD     (ACTIV) After bombardment the foils were rolled into
           cylinders having a diameter of 7/8 in., placed over
           Eck and Krebs thin-walled glass Geiger counters, and
           their activities compared. The consecutive
           interchange of samples compensated for the different
           counter efficiencies.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves were then taken for each sample
           and the different product activities separated. The
           irradiation time depends, of course, on the half-life
           and the yield of the product activity, but it was in
           general of the same order as the half-life. The
           values of effective photon energy (W), as obtained
           from the transition curves were used.

REACTION   (30-ZN-0(G,TOT),,INT)
ANALYSIS   A lower limit to the total integrated cross section
           sigma int tot for photon absorption by the Zn nucleus
           can be estimated. Adding the integrated cross
           sections, for the (gamma,n), (gamma,2n),(gamma,p),
            (gamma,pn), and (gamma,p2n) reactions, a
           value of 1.2 MeV*barns is obtained. The relative
           yields, but not W are known for the (gamma,3n),
            (gamma,p3n), and (gamma,p4n) processes. By
           estimating the corresponding effective photon energies
           from the number of ejected nucleons, an additional
           contribution of about 0.2 MeV*barn is obtained. The
           fact that not all of the observed reactions started
           from the same Zn isotope should not greatly affect
           this result since the excited nuclei were all of the
           even-even type.
