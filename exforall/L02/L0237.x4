TITLE      Measurement of the 115In(g,g')115mIn inelastic

FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at Duke University, generated circularly polarized
           and monoenergetic photon beams.
SAMPLE     The natural In targets in the disk form with diameter
           of 1 in.(2.54cm) with total mass of approximately 2 g.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Activated In foils were gamma counted with a
           Canberra HPGe detector and standard data-acquisition
           hardware and software.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. In foils were
           irradiated for 20 h at each energy
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free-
           electron laser. Infrared photons with wavelength of
           1070 nm were backscattered of relativistic electrons
           circulating in a 1.2-GeV electron storage ring with
           currents between 60 and 90 mA. The electron energy
           was adjusted between 384 and 455 MeV and the current
           in the wiggler electromagnets was changed to provide
           the photon beam energies of interest.

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab. 1 of the reference
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,15.,20.) Systematic uncertainty in photon flux
           determination is governing the overall uncertainty. Up
           to 1.5E+7 photons /(cm2 x s)  the uncertainty was
           estimated at 15%, at higher flux the uncertainty was
           estimated at 20%.
