REFERENCE  (J,PR/C,92,044603,2015)
FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the High
           Intensity gamma-ray Source (HIgS) at Triangle
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory, Durham
SAMPLE     Natural Li target
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons were detected using the Blowfish
           Neutron Detector Array. Blowfish is a segmented
           fast-neutron detector using 88 neutron detecting
           cells filled with BC-505 liquid scintillator. The
           cells are arranged in a sphere with the front face of
           each cell at a radius of 40.6 cm from the center.
           Blowfish has an angular acceptance of approximately
           1/4 of 4Pi.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Using Blowfish it is possible to measure
           for each event the light-output, time-of-flight for
           neutron energy determination and pulse-shape
           discrimination spectra for neutron identification.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) At HIgS nearly monoenergetic gamma-rays were
           produced by Compton backscattering of photons on
           relativistic electrons in electron storage ring
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given
HISTORY    (20151106C) Compiled by S.H.
CORRECTION Corrections for neutron scattering and finite geometry
           were calculated with the help of GEANT4 simulations
