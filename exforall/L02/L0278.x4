METHOD     (COINC) Protons emitted at a given laboratory angle
           are counted in a coincidence-anticoincidence
           telescope, which defines a given range interval for
           charged particles and identifies them by their
           specific ionization. The only process in deuterium
           which can give rise to protons in the range of angles
           and energies investigated is photodisintegration. No
           proton production is possible from hydrogen over this
           range, The energy of the proton determines the energy
           of the photon responsible for the disintegration, so
           that we are able to measure the cross section of the
           reaction as a function of photon energy and of proton
           angle.
