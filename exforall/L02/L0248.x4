FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at TUNL where quasimonoenergetic circularly
           polarized, and highly intense beams of real photons
           of selectable energy were produced.
DETECTOR   (PROPC,HE3SP) Neutrons were detected using an assembly
           of 18 tubular proportional counters, filled with 3He
           gas at approx. 6 atm. The tubes are arranged in two
           concentric rings of radii 7.24 cm and 10.60 cm, each
           containing nine equally spaced counters. The counters
           are embedded in a cylindrical polyethylene body 46.2cm
           long and 30.5 cm in diameter which serves as a neutron
           moderator.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free-
           electron laser (FEL).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty
           in the ratio of the mass densities of the DFC foils
           (ERR-T) Total uncertainty computed by adding
           statistical and systematic uncertainties in
           quadrature.
