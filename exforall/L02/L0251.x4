INC-SOURCE The photons produced in the neutron capture reaction of
           nine different targets were used to give an energy
           range of 5-l1 MeV. The targets, the energies of their
           principal photons(Eg), their relative intensities(I)
           and the total number of photons(N) presented.

           The maximum energy spacing is 40 keV and the average
           spacing is 10 keV.
SAMPLE     The uranium and thorium targets weighed 10 g each.
METHOD     (EXTB)
           Three physical processes were identified that could
           lead to systematic errors. These  are  spontaneous
           fission, thermal neutron fission in 235U and
           attenuation of fragments in the oxide layer of the 238U
           foil. A calculation for both 238U and 232Th with
           spontaneous fission half-lives of 1.02e16 y and
           1.39e18 y would account for only 0.072% and 0.00053% of
           the expected number of fission events. To estimate
           thermal neutron fission in 235U, 93% enriched 235U foil
           was placed in the beam produced by a Cr target in a
           manner identical to that of the depleted 238U foil. The
           resulting track density did not vary by more than one
           standard deviation from the results obtained with the
           depleted 238U foil. To estimate attenuation of fission
           fragments in the black oxide layer, two separate runs
           were made in gamma ray beams produced by the Cr and Ti
           targets with a uranium foil that had its oxide layer
           removed. The results from these two runs did not
           deviate from the other results by more than one
           standard deviation.
           state nuclear track detectors, the photoneutrons
           from (gamma,n) and (gamma,f) reactions were detected
           by 4pi long counter of  a Halpern type with  4 BF3
           detectors immersed  in paraffin. The efficiency of the
           detector was determined by placing a 1.0Ci PuBe source
           and was calculated to be 2.15%.
DETECTOR   (TRD,BF3) The fission events are recorded with solid
           state nuclear track detectors, the photoneutrons
           from (gamma,n) and (gamma,f) reactions were detected
           by 4pi long counter of  a Halpern type with  4 BF3
           detectors immersed  in paraffin. The efficiency of the
           detector was determined by placing a 1.0Ci PuBe source
           and was calculated to be 2.15%.

           and Al to the capture gamma ray spectra.
           The  intensity of the beam was monitored with LiF
           thermoluminescent dosimeters.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on sources of uncertainties
CORRECTION The background of the system was taken with each change
           of the neutron capture target. To account for any
           potential scattering of neutrons in the beam by the
           fissile target, a copper foil of equal mass was  placed
           in the detector during the background measurements.
