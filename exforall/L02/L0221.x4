FACILITY   (SRING,1USATNL) Experiment was conducted at TUNL's
           High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source HIgS
SAMPLE     The previously unirradiated 239Pu target was
           provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory.
           Target of 1.24 cm diameter and mass of
           0.2337 g was sandwiched between Au foils of the same
           diameter and thickness of 0.01 cm.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors of 60% efficiency in TUNLs low-
           background counting facility were used for the
           gamma-ray counting of the 239Pu target and gold
           monitor foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample was irradiated for 9 hours. After
           irradiation, the 239Pu target was gamma-ray counted
           over a period of 2 months for a number of different
           counting cycles ranging from hours (at the very
           beginning) to days to measure the decay of the
           induced activity of the fission products.

INC-SOURCE (LCS) Quasi monoenergetic polarized gamma rays were
           obtained by Compton backscattering of photons from
           free electron laser on high energy electrons in
           electron storage ring. The target assembly was
           irradiated for about 9 h with approximately
            1E+7 gamma/(cm2s).
