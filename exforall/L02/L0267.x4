FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USADKE)  High Intensity gamma-ray Source
           facility.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) A laser Compton back-scattering (LCS). The LCS
           gamma-beam was generated with almost 100% circularly
           polarized photons with an energy of 2.475 MeV and an
           average flux of approximately 3x10**5 gamma/s/keV.
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector array.
SAMPLE     Four different thicknesses of 238U, namely 1.287,
           2.703, 4.117 and 5.563 mm consisted of 2, 4, 6 and 8
           foils, respectively. Eight disks of depleted uranium
            (DU), which has a density of 19.1 g cm-3. Each disk
           of DU is 25.4mm in diameter and approximately 0.6 mm
           in thickness with a mass of approximately 6.5 g, and
           each disk is encased within a thin plastic sealant.
METHOD     (GSPEC) The HIgammaS facility is based on the Compton
           backscattering of free electron-laser (FEL) photons
           with electrons stored in the storage ring. Nuclear
           Resonance Fluorescence (NRF): The scattering NRF
           gamma-ray spectra were collected with an HPGe
           detector array with a total hours on-beam of LCS
           gamma-ray source of 32.5 h. This work is based on the
           atomic and nuclear absorption of the incident and/or
           scattered NRF gamma-rays.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mostly statistical uncertainties.
           Attenuation factors helped to avoid many systematic
           errors that occur in the NRF experiments, such as the
           flux measurements and the detector detection
           efficiency.

METHOD     Saturation curve (New method). The total attenuation
           factor of the resonant and non-resonant gamma-ray
           energies on a direct NRF measurement (without an
           absorber target/material) of the resonant states of
           the isotope of interest (IOI) provides a new method
           to extract the absolute values of the integrated NRF
           cross section. The total attenuation factor can be
           deduced from a fitting function of the experimental
           saturation curve of the NRF yield against the target
           thickness.
