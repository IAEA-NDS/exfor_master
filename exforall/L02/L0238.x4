FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility
           at Duke University, generated circularly polarized
           and monoenergetic photon beams.
SAMPLE     (34-SE-80,ENR=0.9945) The selenium target consisted of
            2.99 g of enriched 80Se powder, encased in a plastic
            cylinder. The volume containing the 80 Se powder was
            20-mm diameter x 5-mm long.The front and back ends of
            the plastic cylinder were 1.5 mm thick each, and the
            surrounding circular wall was 5.5 mm thick.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Three liquid-scintillation detectors filled
           with BC501-A fluid were placed around the target.
           The front of each detector was covered with a 2.4 mm
           thick lead disk to desensitize the scintillators to
           the prompt gamma ray flash.
           Position of individual detectors with respect to
           sample and gamma ray beam was as follows
           Detector   Distance(cm)     Theta(deg)     Phi(deg)
              1.       55.3+-0.2          90            180
              2.       55.6+-0.2          90            270

           (SCIN) The number of photons incident on the target
           was measured with the thin plastic scintillator paddle
           that was located upstream.
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Energy of emitted neutrons were determined
           using time-of-flight. Excellent pulse shape properties
           of BC501-A was used to identify neutrons. Gamma ray
           peak position was used as internal time reference.
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free-
           electron laser. The 15.6-MeV gamma ray beam was
           produced by Compton backscattering of FEL photons with
           wavelength 454.7 nm off 624-MeV electrons. The gamma
           ray beam at the HIGS is pulsed with a bunch width of
           300 ps FWHM and a period of 180 ns between pulses.
           This time structure enables neutron energy
           determinations by time-of-flight methods.
ANALYSIS   Angle-integrated differential cross-section data were
           integrated with respect to excitation energy. Due to
           the 600-keV energy threshold, measured cross section
           data were extrapolated from the maximum excitation
           energy of the measurements to the theoretical maximum
           excitation energy.
