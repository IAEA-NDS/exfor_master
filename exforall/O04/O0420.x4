           To Obtain Cocentrated Deposit For the
           Mass-Spectrometric Analysis.

SAMPLE     About 30g of Pure Water was Used As Target.
           Three Deposited Sample Plates of the Water Concentrates
           After Irradiation and Mass-Spectrometric Analysis were
           Used- A, B and C Samples.  Since Samples A and B (see
           TABLE 1) Were Irradiated on the Same Date with 135 MeV
           Protons and the Expected Be-10 Activity was Small in
           Each Case, the A and B Samples were Combined.
DETECTOR   (NAICR).A Flat 5.08 Cm Diameter NaI(Tl) Crystal.
           The Be-7 Gamma-Activities As Well As the Total Activity
           Monitored by the Gas-Flow B-Counter Decreased with a
           Half-Life of 54 D in Agreement with the Expectations
           For Be-7 (HALF-LIFE=53.6 D).
           (GEMUC) Beta Counting was Carried Out Using a Flow-Gas
           Type Low-Level Geiger Counter of Background About 5
           Counts Per Hour and Having a 38% Efficiency For K-40
           Beta-Rays.
ADD-RES    (DECAY) The Net B-Activities Observed in Samples A+B
           And C. For the Samples Obtained After First Chemical
           Extraction As Well As Subsequent First and Second
           Chemical Recyclings was Measured.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2FR PAR).135 MeV Proton Beam of the Orsay
           Synchrocyclotron.
           (SYNCY,2ZZZCER).550 MeV Proton Beam of the Cern
           Synchrocyclotron.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.In the Case of the Radiochemical Method,
           A Measurement of the Amount of Be-10 Formed in a Given
           Irradiation is Difficult Due to the Fact That the
           Activity of the Short-Lived Be-7 (HALF-LIFE=53.6 D)
           Interferes with the Measurements of the B-Activity
           Of Be-10 (E(MAX)=0.55 MEV), the Interference is
           Appreciable in Spite of the Fact That Be-7 is a Gamma-
           Emitter. Therefore, It Becomes Necessary to Wait For
           Several Years After an Irradiation to Allow the Be-7
           Activity to Decay to a Level Where Its Presence Does
           Not Contribute any Significant Counting in the
           B-Counter Employed For Detection of Be-10.
