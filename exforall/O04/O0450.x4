HISTORY    (19980902C)
           (20040630A) Reference is corrected. Updated too
           (20071128A).Reference was changed from
            PR,B138,572,1965 to PR,138,B572,1965 as it coded in
            Phys.Rev.
SAMPLE     Three types of targets were used. The targets for which
           the beam intensity was monitored consisted of a Cu
           target foil, a 0.001-inch Al monitor foil and two or
           three alumimum guard foils.
           The foils for the cosmotron targets were aligned with
           shears prior to irradiation except for one guard foil
           which protruded 0.5-1 mm beyond the leading edge of the
           aligned foils. Alignment of the foils in the monitored
           ags targets was achieved by punching a 7/16-inch-diam.
           Circle through the foil stack about 1 mm back from the
           leading edge after irradiation.
           When only the sigma (Ni-65)/sigma (Ni-57) was to be
           measured, the target consisted of a Cu foil and two Al
           guard foils.
           The targets for the recoil measurements consisted of  a
           Cu target foil, two 0.00025-inch Mylar catcher foils,
           one 0.00025-inch Mylar foils for an activation blank
           and two 0.00025-inch Mylar guard foils.
           All of the Cu targets from which cross sections for
           the production of Ni-65 were measured, either directly
           or relative to the cross section for Ni-57, were taken
           from the same stock of 0.00033-inch Cu foil whose
           purity was greater than 99.99%.  The thicker targets
           were made up of several layers of this foil.

           Results of individual experiments for cross sections
           and effective recoil ranges.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL) The cosmotron.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) End-window, methane-flow (Ni-57 and Ni-65) and
           argon-methane-flow (Na-24) proportional counters. The
           calibration of the detector for Ni-57 was performed
           with the positron annihilation coincidence method with
           the number of positrons per decay taken to be 0.47.
           The Ni-65 calibration was based on standards whose
           disintegration rates were determined in a 4-pi beta-
           counter. The disintegration rates of Na-24 in the
           aluminum monitor foils were determined with end-window,
           argon-methane-flow proportional counters which had been
           calibrated for Na-24 in 0.001-inch Al foil by the
           beta-gamma coincidence method.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The standard deviations were obtained from rms
           combinations of 7% for the monitor cross sections, 2%
           for the Na-24 counting efficiency, 3% for the counting
           efficiencies of each of the Ni isotopes, 1-3% for
           secondary corrections and an estimated 5% for chemical
           yields, monitoring technique and counter variations.
           The 12% uncertainty in the positron branching ratio for
           Ni-57 was not included in the error estimated for the
           Ni-57 cross sections.
CORRECTION Production cross section of Ni-65 was corrected on
           Cu-65(n,p)Ni-65 reaction.

COMMENT    -By authors- the impurities contribute less than 1
           mu-barn to the production of Ni-65 in the copper foil
           used.
