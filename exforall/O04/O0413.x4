TITLE      Formation of Na-24 in the interaction of 12 GeV protons
           with isotopes of uranium and lead
AUTHOR     (A.Juliano,N.T.Porile)
INSTITUTE  (1USAPUR)

DETECTOR   (SCIN) A scintillation spectrometer consisting of a
            3 in. * 3 in. NaI(Tl) detector.
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USAANL) The Argonne Zero Gradient Synchrotron.
SAMPLE     The target assembly usually consisted of three target
           foils. The middle foil was used for analysis while the
           outer foils compensated for the loss of recoils from
           the targets.
           The target stack was surrounded on either side by
           three 0.001-in. thick aluminum monitor foils.
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation times had durations of 15-30
           minutes.
           (INTB) The circulating beam.
           (SITA)
           (CHSEP) The chemical yields were determined after the
           completion of the activity measurements by flame
           photometry. The yields ranged from 10 to 50%.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviation.
            These values are consistent with the random error of
           10% estimated on the basis of the uncertainties in foil
           alignment, chemical yield determinations, thickness
           measurements, and counting statistics.
           (MONIT-ERR) Uncertainty in monitor reaction
           (ERR-1,,10.) Possible error to secondary reactions.
MISC-COL   (MISC) Number of individual determinations.

SAMPLE     Metallic foils of U-233,the isotopic purity 99.7%,
           thickness-0.003 in., were used.
           The U-233 foils were too thick to permit the use of
           three foils and a single foil, surrounded by the
           aluminium stacks, was used.
