TITLE      Investigation of light ion induced activation cross
           sections in iron. Proton induced activation cross
           sections.
AUTHOR     (E.Daum)
INSTITUTE  (2GERKRU)
REFERENCE  (P,INDC(GER)-043,4,1997)
           ((T,DAUM,1996)=(R,FZKA-5833,1996)) In German.
            All data were taken from the thesis.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERKFK).The Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe
           Compact Cyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA,BCINT,ACTIV,INTB,EXTB,EDEG)
            The protons used had a primary energy of 30 MeV which
           could be moderated by carbon or steel degraders
           to 10 MeV.
SAMPLE     Pure iron (5.8% 54Fe, 91.8% 56Fe, 2.15% 57Fe,
           0.25% 58Fe) thin rolled high purity iron foils. The
           average thickness was determined to (16.41 +-0.18) mum.
DETECTOR   (HPGE).A Liquid nitrogen cooled high purity Ge detector
            The cylindrical crystal has a diameter of 5.45 cm and
           a length of 6.44 cm this results in a volume
           of 150.25 cm3.
ADD-RES    (COMP).The ALICE code uses the Hybrid model and the
           Weisskopf-Ewing evaporation model. Additionally,
           different nuclear level densities, the Fermi level
           density (FLD) and the Kataria-Rarnamurthy level
           density (KRLD), were used.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
            * Uncertainty of the efficiency of the
              gamma-spectrometer
           (ERR-1) Uncertainty target thickness (measured using
                    weighing method) 1.1%
           (ERR-2) The relative error of the integral of the
                   beam current (2.%)
           (ERR-S,1.,50.) The statistical errors determined by
           the activities of the gamma-lines was < 1% for the high
           activity of the target films and ranged up to about
           50% for the lowest activities the catcher slides, etc.

COMMENT    - By compiler - Mn-52g is dauther of short-lived
           Fe-52m (T1/2=46 sec).  As 1.79% isomer transition
           only, Mn-52-G Prodyction Due to isomer transition is
           negligible.
