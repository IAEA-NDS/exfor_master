SAMPLE     Targets Used in this Experiment Consisted of
           Cylindrical Pilot B Plastic Scintillators 1/8 in. Thick
           And 5/8 in. Diameter, Containing 91.55% Carbon by
           Weight.
           For Each Irradiation a Target was Carefully Aligned
           With and Taped Directly to the Upstream Side of
           Scintillation Counters C,Which was the Same Size As
           The Target.
           Each One of the Targets was Irradiated in the Proton
           Beam For Approximately 20 Min.
DETECTOR   (TELES).A Scintillation Counter Telescope.
           (SCIN).1/8-In.-Thick Plastic Scintillator.
           (NAICR)
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USAANL).The Argonne Zero Gradient Synchrotron.
METHOD     (ACTIV).Starting About 10 Min After the End of an
           Irradiation,the C-11 Activity was Measured Either by
           Internal Scintillation Counting or by Positron-
           Annihitillation Radiation Counting.
           (BCINT)
           (EXTB) Pi+ Mesons Contamination of the Beam was Less
           Than 4%.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Each Decay Curve was Analyzed.
ERR-ANALYS The Errors Assigned to a Measurement are Made Up of
           The Standard Deviation of the Counting Rate, the
           Uncertainty in Counting Efficiency and an Estimated 1%
           Error in Aligning the Target with the Counter
           Telescope.
           In Addition, an Estimated Error 1.5% was Assigned to
           Represent the Accuracy of the Coincidence Method of
           Source Calibration.
CORRECTION /by Authors/. A Secondary-Effect Correction was Then
           Calculated As a Function of Target Thickness.
           After the Target Thickness Correction was Made, the
           Cross Section was Then Corrected For the Pi+
           Contamination of the Beam by Using the C-12(PIN,PIN+N)
           Cross Section and Assuming That the Pi+ Cross Section
           Is the Same As the Pi- Cross Section and the Pion Cross
           Section is the Same at 8.5 GeV/C.
