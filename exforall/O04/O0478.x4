           (20001121A) Subentry O0478002 has Been Corrected
           According to O.Schwerer's Remarks.

SAMPLE     The Target was Oxygen confined in an Ultra-Thin-Window
           Gas Cell.
DETECTOR   (SOLST). After traversing a Flight Path D=27 Cm in a
           time 'T' Reaction Products were stopped in a Silicon
           Surface Barrier Detector which yielded a timing pulse
           as well as signal proportional to the Particle Energy
           'E'. The relationship 'E*T**2=M*D**2/2' then identified
           the Mass 'M' of the Particles.

ANALYSIS   (INTED)
COMMENT    /by Authors/.Since Be-10 has a Life-Time of about
           1.0E+6 Years and hence does not necessarily decay to
           B-10 on Astrophysical Time Scale, it is in principle
           necessary to distinguish it from the other Mass-10
           Isobars.
           Thus the Present Measurements at 30.0 and 33.7 MeV are
           entirely unaffected and Be-10 contributes perhaps 4% of
           the Mass-10 Yield at the Higher Energies.

           At Each Angle the Statistical Error of the Yield and
           The Low Energy Cutoff Error were Combined in
           Quadrature. These Errors were Then Summed Linearly Over
           Angle and 0.5 of the Yield Extrapolation to Unmeasured
           Back Angles of Angular Distribution and 0.2 of the
           Yield Extrapolation to Forward Angles were also Added
           Linearly to obtain a Total Uncertainty. The
           uncertainties in Detector Solid Angle, Current
           Integration and Gas Density Totaled About 3.3% and
           Were Generally Negligible Compared to the Extrapolation
           Errors.
