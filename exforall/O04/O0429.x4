TITLE      C-12(p,pn)C-11 cross section at 1.0 GeV.

HISTORY    (19980427C)
           (20040630A) Reference is corrected. Updated too
           (20071128A).Reference was changed from
            PR,B133,1507,1964 to PR,133,B1507,1964 as it coded in
            Phys.Rev.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of plastic scintillator disks
           1/8 inch thick from which the C-11 gas loss is
           negligible.
           In the first experiment the diameter was 1 1/2 inch and
           in the later experiments 3/4 inch the carbon content of
           the scintillators was taken to be 92% and, as is
           customary, the cross sections were calculated on the
           basis of the total carbon content of the targets, not
           just the C-12 content.
DETECTOR   (SCIN)
           A 100-mu thick Ilford G-5 emulsion was mounted on the
           upstream side of each scintillator. The emulsions were
           perpendicular to the beam so that the plunging track
           method was used in scanning. In the later experiments
           pellicules were used instead of glass backed emulsions.
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABNL) The Cosmotron
METHOD     (ACTIV) Time of irradiation was 2 minutes.
           (EXTB).The external beam was partially defocused in an
           attempt to make the incident flux uniform across the
           target.

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
           (ERR-T).The uncertainty is reported by authors.
           The sources of systematic errors which have been
           mentioned are-C-11 counting efficiency, secondary
           correction, scanning efficiency and rectangular area.
           Root-mean-square combination of these errors is 3.6%.
           Thus the total error is 4.4%.
