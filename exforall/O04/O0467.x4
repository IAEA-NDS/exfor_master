TITLE      Production of Na-24 and Mg-28 by the interaction of
           uranium with 15-600 MeV protons

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP) At 15-170 MeV.
           (SYNCY,2ZZZCER) At 160-570 MeV.
SAMPLE     The targets were uranium foils, delivered as high
           purity material. Three different foils of thickness
           2.54 mm, 0.127 mm and 0.0254 mm, respectively, were
           used during the course of the experiments.
           Before irradiation, the uranium foils were cleaned with
            approx. 6m HNO(3) for a few minutes to remove the
           oxide layer, washed with ethanol and dried.
           The Uppsala irradiations were performed with the
           uranium foil of thickness approx. 2.54 mm, the CERN
           with foils of thicknesses 0.127 mm and 0.0254 mm.
           table 2 of the paper contains results of analysis of
           different uranium foils for contaminations.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
METHOD     (INTB)
           The duration of the internal irradiations was in
           Uppsala 4 hr and the beam intensity 0.25-0.45 uA,
           at CERN 1 hr and 0.84-1.00 uA.
           (CHSEP)
           (ACTIV) At 600 MeV the activities of Na-24 and Mg-28
           were measured by direct gamma-counting of the
           irradiated target, using the fission product I-135 as
           internal monitor and/or using separate aluminium
           monitor foils.

COMMENT    /by authors/ The measured cross sections are averages
           based on two or more runs and corrected for
           contributions from impurities in the target.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The over-all uncertainty in the measured
           cross sections, including the counting statistics and
           errors in detector efficiency, chemical yield
           determination, branching ratio and contribution from
           impurities is estimated to about 10% for Mg-28 and
           about 10-20% for Na-24.
           However, the cross section values for Na-24 for
           energies of less than 160 MeV will have a greater
            uncertainty, due to the large discrepancies in the
           determination of the impurities in the targets used
           in these experiments.
