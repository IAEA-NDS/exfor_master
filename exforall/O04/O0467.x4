SAMPLE     The Targets were Uranium Foils,Delivered As High Purity
           Material. Three Different Foils of Thickness 2.54 mm,
           0.127 mm and 0.0254 mm, Respectively, were Used During
           The Course of the Experiments.
           Before Irradiation,the Uranium Foils were Cleaned with
            Approx. 6M HNO(3) For a Few Minutes to Remove the
           Oxide Layer, Washed with Ethanol and Dried.
           The Uppsala Irradiations were Performed with the
           Uranium Foil of Thickness Approx. 2.54 mm, the CERN
           with foils of thicknesses 0.127 mm and 0.0254 mm.
           Table 2 of the Paper Contains Results of Analysis of
           Different Uranium Foils For Contaminations.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2SWDUPP).At 15-170 MeV.
           (SYNCY,2ZZZCER).At 160-570 MeV.
METHOD     (INTB)
           The Duration of the Internal Irradiations was in
           Uppsala 4 Hr and the Beam Intensity 0.25-0.45 MuA,
           At CERN 1 Hr and 0.84-1.00 MuA.
           (CHSEP)
           (ACTIV).At 600 MeV the Activities of Na-24 and Mg-28
           Were Measured by Direct Gamma-Counting of the
           Irradiated Target, using the Fission Product I-135 as
           Internal Monitor and/or using separate aluminium
           monitor foils.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.The Measured Cross Sections are Averages
           Based on Two or More Runs and Corrected For
           Contributions from Impurities in the Target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Over-All Uncertainty in the Measured Cross
           Sections,Including the Counting Statistics and Errors
           In Detector Efficiency, Chemical Yield Determination,
           Branching Ratio and Contribution from Impurities is
           Estimated to About 10% For Mg-28 and About 10-20% For
           Na-24.
           However,the cross section values for Na-24 for energies
           of less than 160 MeV will have a greater uncertainty,
           due to the large discrepancies in the determination
           of the impurities in the targets used in these
           experiments.
