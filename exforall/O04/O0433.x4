REL-REF    (N,,A.M.POSKANZER+,J,PR,129,374,1963).Experimental
           Procedure.
SAMPLE     The Targets Consisted of 0.5-In. Squares of Cu-65
            (ENRICHED TO 99.6%) Vacuum Deposited to a Thickness
           Of 2-3 Mug/Cm**2 onto 25-30 Mug/Cm**2 Formvar Films.
           An Additional Angular Distribution was Obtained at 2.8
           GeV from Targets with 6-Mug/Cm**2 Cu-65 on 50-Mug/Cm**2
           Formvar in Order to Estimate the Effect of Scattering
           Of the Cu-64 Recoils in the Target and Backing.
           In Some Irradiations an Extra 0.00025-In. Mylar Foil
           Was Included Under the Catcher Foil in Order to
           Determine the Activation Blank of Cu-64 from Mylar
           Impurities in the Mylar.

ERR-ANALYS The Standard Deviations of the Values are Estimated
           To be 4% and Result from an RMS Combination of
           Uncertainties of 1-2% For Counting Statistics,2% For
           Relative Foil Areas,2% For Counter Variations and 2%
           For Chemical Yields.There is Also a Systematic
           Uncertainty of 5% Between the Differential Cross
           Sections in the Forward and Backward Directions of Each
           Angular Distribution Because of the Normalization at
            90 Degree.
           An Additional Systematic Uncertainty of 5% is
           Contributed to Each of the Angular Distributions by the
           Uncertainty in the Total Cross Sections.
CORRECTION /by Authors/.A Correction For 10 Degree Resolution of
           The Collector Foils was Applied to All of the Data
           Obtained with the 2-3 Mug/Cm**2 Targets.This Correction
           Was Computed at Each Angle from a Quadratic Function
           Fit to the Differential Cross Sections at That Angle
           And the Two Immediately Adjacent Angles.
           The Largest Correction is Seen to be About 2%.
