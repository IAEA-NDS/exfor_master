TITLE      Angular distributions of the recoil nuclei from the
           Cu-65(p,pn)Cu-64 reaction at 0.37, 1.0 and 2.8 GeV

REL-REF    (M,,A.M.Poskanzer+,J,PR,129,374,1963) Experimental
           procedure.
SAMPLE     The targets consisted of 0.5-in. squares of Cu-65
            (enriched to 99.6%) vacuum deposited to a thickness
           of 2-3 ug/cm**2 onto 25-30 ug/cm2 formvar films.
            An additional angular distribution was obtained at
           2.8 GeV from targets with 6 ug/cm2 Cu-65 on 50 ug/cm2
           formvar in order to estimate the effect of scattering
           of the Cu-64 recoils in the target and backing.
            In some irradiations an extra 0.00025-in. mylar foil
           was included under the catcher foil in order to
           determine the activation blank of Cu-64 from mylar
           impurities in the mylar.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S,1.,2.) Uncertainty of counting statistics

           (ERR-2) Uncertainty of counter variations
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in chemical yields
           (ERR-4) Systematic uncertainty between the differential
           cross sections in the forward and backward directions
           of each angular distribution because of the
           normalization at 90. degr.
           (ERR-5) An additional systematic uncertainty is
           contributed to each of the angular distributions by
           the uncertainty in the total cross sections.
CORRECTION  A correction for 10 degree resolution of
           the collector foils was applied to all of the data
           obtained with the 2-3 ug/cm2 targets. This correction
           was computed at each angle from a quadratic function
           fit to the differential cross sections at that angle
           and the two immediately adjacent angles.
           The largest correction is seen to be about 2%.
