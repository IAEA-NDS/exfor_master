SAMPLE     Uranium-238 (99.9%) Metallic Disks,of 0.0025 and 0.005
           Cm Thickness and 2.5 Cm Diameter,were Interlaced with
           Aluminum and Copper Foils.Three Aluminum Foils,with
           Different Thickness,were Always Used Between the
           Uranium Disks-The Thinner One (0.0005 CM),was Used to
           Stop the Fission Products,the Second One,was Used to
           Degrade the Proton Energy (WITH DIFFERENT THICKNESSES
           ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS),the Last Foil (0.01 CM),was
           Used As a Beam Monitor.Copper Foils (0.005 CM) Were
           Also Used to Check the Proton Beam Current Along the
           Target Stack.
DETECTOR   (GE-IN,HPGE).The Np Sample was Counted in a Ge Low
           Energy Photon Detector and Also in a Gamma High Purity
           Ge-Detector.
           (SOLST).The Plutonium Fraction was Counted in a Silicon
           Surface Barrier Detector.
           (SCIN).An Alpha Liquid Scintillation Detector For
           Plutonium Fraction.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK HAR).The Variable Energy Cyclotron.
METHOD     (STTA)
           (BCINT)
           Two Irradiations were done-The First with a 37 MeV
           Proton Energy Beam, 0.5 Mu-Ampere Current and 8 Hours
           Duration, the Second one with a 56 MeV Proton Energy
           Beam,1 Mu-Ampere Current and Duration of 7 Hours.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.To Obtain a Very Pure Np-235 Sample, the
           Irradiated Target Must be Left to Cool For About 50
           Days After the Irradition to Get Rid of the Np-234,
           Which Emits the Same X-Rays As Np-235, and of the
           Other Short Half-Lived Neptunium Isotopes.
           The 237-Np Activity will be Negligible.
DECAY-DATA (93-NP-235,396.D) Other Decay-Data are Absent.
