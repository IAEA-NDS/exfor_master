TITLE       Measurement of neutron activation cross
            sections by generalized intermittent radiation

INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Thermal neutron flux between
            1. and 17. * 10**9 neutrons/S*cm**2.
SAMPLE      Foils enclosed in a small aluminum capsule,
            rigidly positioned within a cylindrical nylon
            container (length 10 cm, diameter 2 cm) used
            as a 'RABBIT'.
            Au-foil,   1% Au and 99% Al,
                       diam 10 mm, thickn. 0.1 mm, mass 20 mg.
            In-foil 1, 100% in,
                       diam 1.5 mm, thickn. 0.18 mm, mass 2.25 mg
            in-foil 2, 0.7% in, 99.3% Pb,
                       diam 3 mm, thickn. 0.19 mm, mass 15 mg.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation was done in intermittent
            irradiations by rapidly inserting the sample into
            a triga reactor core and by rapidly withdrawing it
            while the neutron flux in the core was changed.
            Neutron flux during irradiations was measured with
            a gamma-compensated ionization chamber. Several
            patterns of intermittent irradiations were tested.
            The gamma-compensated ionization chamber was
            calibrated by single irradiations of bare
            and cadmium-covered gold plates.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3 Inch * 3 inch NaI scintillator,
                   HARSHAW 12S12/GR, phototube RCA8054.
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were determined from measured activitied
            number of target atoms and 'ft' (called 'flux-time
            factor', containing all information of neutron fluxes
            and timing of intermittent irradiation).
MONITOR     The gamma-compensated ionization chamber was
            calibrated by single irradiations of bare
            and cadmium-covered gold plates.
