TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF NEUTRON ACTIVATION CROSS
            SECTIONS BY GENERALIZED INTERMITTANT RADIATION-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2ITYCAS) TRIGA REACTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX BETWEEN
            1. AND 17. * 10**9 NEUTRONS/S*CM**2.
SAMPLE     .FOILS ENCLOSED IN A SMALL ALUMINUM CAPSULE,
            RIGIDLY POSITIONED WITHIN A CYLINDRICAL NYLON
            CONTAINER (LENGTH 10 CM, DIAMETER 2 CM) USED
            AS A 'RABBIT'.
            AU-FOIL,   1 PER-CENT AU AND 99 PER CENT AL,
                       DIAM 10 MM, THICKN. 0.1 MM, MASS 20 MG.
            IN-FOIL 1, 100 PER CENT IN,
                       DIAM 1.5 MM, THICKN. 0.18 MM, MASS 2.25 MG
            IN-FOIL 2, 0.7 PER CENT IN, 99.3 PER CENT PB,
                       DIAM 3 MM, THICKN. 0.19 MM, MASS 15 MG.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION WAS DONE IN INTERMITTANT
            IRRADIATIONS BY RAPIDLY INSERTING THE SAMPLE INTO
            A TRIGA REACTOR CORE AND BY RAPIDLY WITHDRAWING IT
            WHILE THE NEUTRON FLUX IN THE CORE WAS CHANGED.
            NEUTRON FLUX DURING IRRADIATIONS WAS MEASURED WITH
            A GAMMA-COMPENSATED IONIZATION CHAMBER. SEVERAL
            PATTERNS OF INTERMITTANT IRRADIATIONS WERE TESTED.
            THE GAMMA-COMPENSATED IONIZATION CHAMBER WAS
            CALLIBRATED BY SINGLE IRRADIATIONS OF BARE
            AND CADMIUM-COVERED GOLD PLATES.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3 INCH * 3 INCH NAI SCINTILLATOR,
                   HARSHAW 12S12/GR, PHOTOTUBE RCA 8054.
ANALYSIS   .CROSS SECTIONS WERE DETERMINED FROM MEASURED ACTIVITIE
            NUMBER OF TARGET ATOMS AND 'FT' (CALLED 'FLUX-TIME
            FACTOR',CONTAINING ALL INFORMATION OF NEUTRON FLUXES
            AND TIMING OF INTERMITTANT IRRADIATION).
MONITOR    .THE GAMMA-COMPENSATED IONIZATION CHAMBER WAS
            CALLIBRATED BY SINGLE IRRADIATIONS OF BARE
            AND CADMIUM-COVERED GOLD PLATES.
