TITLE       Neutron-proton scattering in the energy range
            70 to 170 MeV

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2UK HAR) Harwell synchrocyclotron.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) Protons from synchrocyclotron with
            a maximum energy of 170 MeV impinging onto
            a Be-target of 0.25 inch thickness. The n-beam
            was confined to a diameter of 2 inches by
            means of a concrete shielding.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum ranged from about 50 to 170 MeV,
            with a peak near 140 MeV. A graph of the spectrum
            is given in figure 8 of the main reference.
            The quantity 'En-mean' is a spectrum averaged
            energy between the limits 'En-min' and 'En-max'.
            it is called the 'effective energy' in the main
            reference. The quantity 'En-err' is the error in
            'En-mean' and arises from the error in the
            measured spectrum.
SAMPLE      Both samples (polyethylene and carbon) were
            5 inches long an 1.5 inches wide. They were
            100-200 microns thick.
            The polyethylene sample was cut from a sheet
            of about 100 microns thickness. It consisted
            of 100% pure (C-H(2))(n). The thickness
            was 10.54 +-0.01 mg/cm**2.
            The carbon sample was prepared by drying out
            of aquadag which had been diluted in water,
            in a metal mould. Removal of the dry C-film
            was facilitated by the use of a wet sheet of
            cellophane tightly stretched over the base of
            the mould. Its thickness was 13.62 +- 0.03 mg/cm**2
            and was chosen so as to produce the same energy
            loss as the polyethylene target film. It consisted
            of 93.4% carbon, 1% hydrogen and 5.6% oxygen.
METHOD     (REC) Measurement of the angular distributions of the
            recoiling particles from a carbon scatterer and from
            a polyethylene scatterer.
            The difference yields the amounts of protons recoiling
           from hydrogen nuclei as a function of the recoil angles
            From these amounts the hydrogen elastic scattering
            angular distributions can be derived.
            The proton angles are determined by the analysis
            of the proton tracks in a photographic emulsion.
            The proton energies are determined from
            the ranges of the protons in this emulsion.
            From this proton energy the neutron energy
            can be derived.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Scattering chamber under a pressure of
            1.E-2 cm Hg containing four 1.5 um thick glass plates
            coated with a 600 micron layer of Ilford C2
            photographic emulsion and a 25 micron supercoat of
            Ilford G5 emulsion.
            The four plates were held at angles of 54, 44, 34
            and 24 degrees to the neutron beam.
            The plates at 44,34 and 24 degerees were behind
            aluminium absorbers designed to bring most of
            recoils to rest in the emulsion. Unfortunately
            the effect of multiple scattering in the
            aluminium was too large, and it was not possible
            to use the measurements on the plates at 34 and
            24 degrees.
CORRECTION  Background from scattering by the nylon
            thread used to suspend the samples.
            Interactions of the neutrons with the C-nuclei.

COMMENT     The data is derived from measurements on
            the photographic plate at 54 degrees.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Standard deviations arising mainly
            from the statistical error in the number
            of tracks counted.
            The error involved in the normalization has not been
            included.
