TITLE      -ON NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENTS
            WITH THE ACTIVATION TECHNIQUE IN THE MEV
            REGION.-
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDLND) 3 MV TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (P-T  ) PROTON-TRITIUM REACTION AND
           (D-T  ) DEUTERON-TRITIUM REACTION.
            THE PROTONS AND THE DEUTERONS WERE ACCELERATED
            BY THE VAN DE GRAAFF MACHINE.
            SEVERAL TARGETS WERE USED AND INVESTIGATED WITH
            RESPECT TO THE PRIMARY NEUTRON BACKGROUND.
            - THIN TITANIUM LAYERS, ABOUT 2 MG/CM**2
              THICKNESS IN WHICH THE DEUTERIUM OR TRITIUM
              WAS ABSORBED, EAVAPORATED ONTO A 0.5 MM
              THICK BACKING. IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE TI(T)
              CANNOT BE USED ANYMORE BEYOND 4.5 MEV
              NEUTRON ENERGY, AND THAT DEUTERIUM TARGETS
              ARE PREFERABLE ABOVE 3.0 MEV. THE ENERGY
              RANGE CAN THAN BE EXTENDED BY 1. MEV.
            - DEUTERIUM GAS TARGET WITH A 4.2 MG/CM**2
              THICK MO-FOIL AS ENTRANCE WINDOW AND GOLD
              AS A BEAM STOP. THIS WAY THE NEUTRON ENERGY
              RANGE CAN BE EXTENDED BY SEVERAL MEV.
            - ALSO A T(ZR-90) TARGET WITH NATURAL ZR
              HAS BEEN TESTED.
SAMPLE     .PLACED AT DISTANCES SUCH THAT THE SOLID ANGLE
            SUBTENDED BY THE SAMPLES AT THE TARGET WAS THE
            SAME IN ALL CASES. FOR THE STUDIES OF THE
            THICKNESS DEPENDENCE OF THE ACTIVATION YIELDS,
            INDIUM SAMPLES WERE USED WITH A DIAMETER OF 10.
            MM AND A THICKNESS RANGING FROM 0.18 TO 1.66
            GRAMS/CM**2. THE TARGET-SAMPLE DISTANCE DEPENDENCE
            WAS DETERMINED USING 0.6 GRAMS/CM**2 SAMPLES WITH
            DIAMETERS RANGING FROM 5.0 TO 20. MM.
METHOD     .ACTIVATION.
           .DEPENDENCE OF THE ACTIVATION YIELDS ON SAMPLE
            THICKNESS AND EFFECTIVE TARGET-SAMPLE DISTANCE
            HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED TO ALLOW DETAILED
            CORRECTIONS.

            FROM THE TARGET.

            RELATIVE EFFICIENCY WAS DETERMINED WITH A

CORRECTION .PRIMARY NEUTRON BACKGROUND, I.E. NEUTRONS
            PRODUCED BY (P,N) AND (D,N) REACTIONS IN THE
            TARGET BACKING AND ABSORPTION MATERIALS AND
            IN THE APERTURES ALONG THE BEAM LINE. THIS WAS
            DONE BY USING TARGETS WITH NATURAL HYDROGEN
            IN STEAD OF D OR T. (EMPTY TARGETS).
           .SECONDARY NEUTRON BACKGROUND. IT CONSISTS OF
            SEVERAL CONTRIBUTIONS ,
            - NEUTRONS PRODUCED BY INELASTIC SCATTERING
              IN THE SAMPLE. THIS WAS CORRECTED FOR BY
              STUDYING THE ACTIVATION YIELD AS A FUNCTION
              OF THE SAMPLE THICKNESS.
            - NEUTRONS PRODUCED BY INELASTIC SCATTERING
              IN STRUCTURAL MATERIALS NEAR THE TARGET-
              SAMPLE ASSEMBLY AND NEUTRONS SCATTERED BY
              THE WALLS OF THE ROOM. THIS WAS CORRECTED
              FOR BY THE STUDYING THE ACTIVATION YIELD
              AS A FUNCTION OF THE TARGET-SAMPLE DISTANCE.
            BOTH EFFECTS PRODUCE NEUTRONS WITH LOWER
            ENERGIES WITH HIGHER (N,G) CROSS SECTIONS
            AND ARE THUS IMPORTANT.
