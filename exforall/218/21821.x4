TITLE      -Absolute measurement of the Pu-240(N,F),
            Pu-242(N,F) and Np-237(N,F) cross sections
            at 2.5 MeV incoming neutron energy.- (In French) -
FACILITY   (VDG,2FR BRC) 4 MV Van de Graaff machine
            operated at 2.5 MHz, proton burst width 1 ns.
INC-SOURCE (P-T)   Tritiated titane deposit on a gold backing.
METHOD     (ASSOP) The neutron flux is measured by the
            detection of the recoil protons from the monitor
            reaction in a telescope detector.
           (EDE)   These protons are identified by putting
            the events into a biparametric E-DE array.
           (TOF)   Time of flight is used to select only
            fission events associated with the neutron burst.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) 2-PI ionisation chamber filled with 90
            percent argon and 10 percent methane for the
            detection of the fission fragments.

SAMPLE     .Np-O(2) produced by Bruyeres-le-Chatel by
            sputtering onto a tantalum backing of 0.3 mm
            thickness. The isotopic composition is given
            in table 1 of the main reference, and is
            100 atomic %  Np-237. The thickness of the
            layer was 74.49 micrograms/cm**2. The number
            of atoms was determined by alpha counting in
            a well determined geometry.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,SIG) Value not given.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) Proton recoil telescope
            detector consisting of an E- and a DE- solid
            state detector. It has a 10 microns thick
            polyethylene radiator. The solid state detectors
            are completely depleted with thicknesses of
            respectively 50 and 100 microns. The analysis of
            the number of atoms in the radiator was done by
            Huffman (Colorado).
            It is used for absolute neutron flux deter-
            mination.
