TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF PROMPT NU-BAR AND VARIANCE FOR
            THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252 AND PU-242.
FACILITY   .OIL MODERATED ASSEMBLY OF BF3 COUNTERS.
METHOD     .SPONTANEOUS FISSION EVENTS AND FISSION NEUTRONS
            WERE COUNTED OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) THE SPONTANEOUS FISSIONING SAMPLE WAS
           (BF3  ) INCORPORATED IN AN IONISATION CHAMBER
                   PLACED AT THE CENTRE OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY
                   NEUTRON DETECTOR CONSISTING OF 56 BF3
                   COUNTERS CONNECTED IN 5 RINGS AND
                   IMMERSED IN AN OIL MODERATOR.
MONITOR    .THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEUTRON DETECTOR
            ASSEMBLY WAS DETERMINED USING AM-241/LI,
            /F,/B AND /BE SOURCES CALIBRATED AT THE

REACTION   (94-PU-242(0,F),PR,NU)
SAMPLE     .A PU-O2 source containing 1.092E-02 g of
            fissionable material on a 0.13 milli-m thick
            platinum backing. the isotopic composition was -
             PU-242  89.37 %          PU-241  0.93 %
             PU-240   4.57 %          PU-239  5.13 %
ANALYSIS   .The data was obtained from an extrapolation
            to 100 per cent fission fragment detection
            efficiency based on the results of 15 runs.
CORRECTION .The only impurity isotope contributing to
            spontaneous fission neutrons was Pu-240. since
            this isotope has a nu-bar value very similar to
            that of Pu-242 the associated correction is
            negligibly small.
           .the fission fragment detection efficiency,
            deduced from a measurement of the total neutron
            output of the sample ( corrected for (alpha,n)
            reactions ) varied between 62 and 88 per cent,
            as the gas pressure was varied. an extrapolation
            to 100 per cent efficiency was made.

REACTION   (98-CF-252(0,F),PR,NU)
SAMPLE     .An oxide sample of high purity containing
            7.36e-11 g of fissionable material on a
            0.13 milli-m thick platinum backing.
           .The sample initially had the following
            isotopic composition -
             CF-252  74.48 %,        CF-250  25.52 %
DECAY-DATA (98-CF-252,2.63YR)
ANALYSIS   .The data was obtained from a weighted mean of the
            Results of 7 runs.
CORRECTION .The generation of Cm-244, Cm-246 and Cm-248
            Daughter impurities in the sample before
            Measurement began led to a 0.025 %
            Correction in the nu-bar value.
           .The fission fragment detection efficiency, deduced
            From the measured alpha activity, was in excess of
            99 %
