TITLE      -MEASUREMENTS OF PROMPT NU-BAR AND VARIANCE FOR
            THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252 AND PU-242.
FACILITY   .OIL MODERATED ASSEMBLY OF BF3 COUNTERS.
METHOD     .SPONTANEOUS FISSION EVENTS AND FISSION NEUTRONS
            WERE COUNTED OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) THE SPONTANEOUS FISSIONING SAMPLE WAS
           (BF3  ) INCORPORATED IN AN IONISATION CHAMBER
                   PLACED AT THE CENTRE OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY
                   NEUTRON DETECTOR CONSISTING OF 56 BF3
                   COUNTERS CONNECTED IN 5 RINGS AND
                   IMMERSED IN AN OIL MODERATOR.
MONITOR    .THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEUTRON DETECTOR
            ASSEMBLY WAS DETERMINED USING AM-241/LI,
            /F,/B AND /BE SOURCES CALIBRATED AT THE

CORRECTION .THE ONLY IMPURITY ISOTOPE CONTRIBUTING

            THIS ISOTOPE HAS A NU-BAR VALUE VERY SIMILAR TO
            THAT OF PU-242 THE ASSOCIATED CORRECTION IS
            NEGLIGIBLY SMALL.
