AUTHOR     (K.KUDO)
TITLE      -FE-56(N,P)MN-56 CROSS SECTION AT 14.60 MEV.-
FACILITY   .NOT SPECIFIED.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) T-TI TARGET.
SAMPLE     .FE FOILS OF 99.99 PERCENT PURITY, 25.4 MM
            DIAMETER, 0.1 MM THICKNESS AT 45 DEGREES
            WITH RESPECT TO THE NEUTRON BEAM AND 153.30
            +- 0.25 MM FROM THE TI-T TARGET.
METHOD     (ASSOP) ASSOCIATED ALPHA PARTICLES DETECTED AT
            89 AND 131 DEGREES. THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS
            DEDUCED BY USING THE INFORMATION FROM BOTH
            ANGLES.  THE FLUX WAS DETERMINED BY USING
            ONLY THE 89 DEGREE DATA.
           .THE ABSOLUTE ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED BY A
            4*PI BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE METHOD.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SURFACE BARRIER AT 999.3 +- 0.5 MM
            FROM THE TARGET WITH A TANTALUM DIAPHRAGM OF
            5.000 +- 0.005 MM DIAMETER.
           (D4PI ) 4*PI BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE METHOD,
            NO FURTHER DETAILS GIVEN.
MONITOR    .ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT.
PART-DET   (DG)    DECAY GAMMAS,
           (B)     BETAS.
COMMENT    .THE VALUE AT 14.73 MEV FOR THE CROSS SECTION
            HAS BEEN CALCULATED FROM THE PRESENT DATA TO BE
            109.3 +- 1.5 MB, WHICH COMPARES WELL WITH RYVES'
            EVALUATION OF 109.2 +- 1.0 MB.(79KNOX).
CORRECTION .PROTONS FROM D-D REACTION.
           .N ATTENUATION IN CU BACKING AND IN THE
            AIR BETWEEN THE TI-T TARGET AND THE SAMPLE.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) NO DETAILS GIVEN.
