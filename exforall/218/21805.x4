INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT   Fission neutron spectrum.
SAMPLE      Th-232 100%, Th(NO3)4.x H2O.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Radiochemical separation of the fission
            products from Th-232(n,f). The irradiation time
            varied between 1 hr and 10 hrs depending on the
            half-life of the nuclide to be measured. Samples
            were counted several times, and more than one
            gamma-line used for yield determination.

DETECTOR   (GELI ) Ge(Li) detector. 45 cm3 and 54 cm3.
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)
            Gaussian peak fit and decay curve analysis.
ADD-RES     By taking the chain yields of Erten (see REL-REF),
            fractional yields were calculated, and the charge
            distribution parameters in the reactor-neutron-induced
            fission of Th-232 determined width-parameter 0.52+-0.1
                                   delta Z(P) 0.45+-0.02
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error given, including the statistical
            error and systematic errors due to uncertainties in
            the standard yield and detector efficiencies.

DECAY-MON  (42-MO-99,66.0HR,DG)
FLAG       (1.) The total independent yield of Sb-128 is
                (5.6+-1.4)E-3%.
           (2.) The given yield represents un upper limit.
           (3.) The large error in Br-82 is due to A
              uncertain correction for the Br-81(n,gamma) reaction
CORRECTION .For Sb-128-g the measured yield was corrected
            for contributions due to precursors. The
            contribution of independently formed Sb-128-m
            to the correction was small.
