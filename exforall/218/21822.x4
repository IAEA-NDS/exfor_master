METHOD     (EDE) Measurement of binary and ternary
            events by a telescope detector without
            using a coincidence.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Telescope consisting of an E- and
            a dE- detector. The dE-detector was a Si(Au) surface
            barrier with a depleted zone of 26.7 microns
            thickness, a surface of 300. mm**2 and a resolution
            FWHM for the 5.486 MeV alpha-line of Am-241 of 35 keV.
            The E-detector had a depleted zone of 500 microns,
            a surface of 450 mm**2, and  a resolution of 40. keV.
           It was also a Si(Au) surface barrier detector.
COMMENT    .With this thickness of the dE-detector the signal for
            the Z=1 ternary particles is completely different
            from the one for the alpha particles which allows
            thus still particle identification.
           .Differences with formerly reported values are
            explained by the extrapolation to the lower energies
            of the alpha particle spectra which deviate
            from a Gaussian.
CORRECTION .In some cases the telescope was shielded with an
            Al-absorber of 20 microns thickness in order to reduce
            the damage by the fission fragment bombardment.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error, no further details given.
