TITLE      -TERNARY FISSION OF U-233,U-235,NP-237 AND
            PU-239 INDUCED BY THERMAL NEUTRONS.-
            (IN DUTCH) -
FACILITY   (REAC,2FR ILL) 87 M CURVED NEUTRON GUIDE OF THE
            HIGH FLUX REACTOR. FLUX 1.E+08 N/CM**2/SEC,
            CADMIUM RATIO 1.0E+6, GAMMA BACKGROUND REDUCED
            BY A FACTOR OF 1.0E+06.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  THERMAL MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM FROM HFR.
METHOD     (EDE  ) MEASUREMENT OF BINARY AND TERNARY
            EVENTS BY A TELESCOPE DETECTOR WITHOUT
            USING A COINCIDENCE.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) TELESCOPE CONSISTING OF
            AN E- AND A DE- DETECTOR. THE DE-DETECTOR
            WAS A SI(AU) SURFACE BARRIER WITH A DEPLETED
            ZONE OF 26.7 MICRONS THICKNESS, A SURFACE
            OF 300. MM**2 AND A RESOLUTION FWHM FOR
            THE 5.486 MEV ALPHA-LINE OF AM-241 OF 35
            KEV. THE E-DETECTOR HAD A DEPLETED ZONE OF
            500 MICRONS, A SURFACE OF 450 MM**2, AND
            A RESOLUTION OF 40. KEV. IT WAS ALSO A
            SI(AU) SURFACE BARRIER DETECTOR.
COMMENT    .WITH THIS THICKNESS OF THE DE-DETECTOR THE
            SIGNAL FOR THE Z=1 TERNARY PARTICLES IS
            COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE FOR THE
            ALPHA PARTICLES WHICH ALLOWS THUS STILL
            PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION.
           .DIFFERENCES WITH FORMERLY REPORTED VALUES
            ARE EXPLAINED BY THE EXTRAPOLATION TO
            THE LOWER ENERGIES OF THE ALPHA PARTICLE
            SPECTRA WHICH DEVIATE FROM A GAUSSIAN.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM MAIN REFERENCE.

CORRECTION .IN SOME CASES THE TELESCOPE WAS SHIELDED
            WITH AN AL-ABSORBER OF 20 MICRONS THICKNESS
            IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE DAMAGE BY THE FISSION
            FRAGMENT BOMBARDMENT. THIS WAS CORRECTED FOR.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) TOTAL ERROR, NO FURTHER DETAILS GIVEN.
