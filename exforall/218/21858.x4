TITLE       Elastic scattering of 14 MeV neutrons at small
            angles
FACILITY   (VDG,2BLGLVN) Van de Graaff accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The H-3(d,n)He-4 reaction at 90 degrees.
SAMPLE     .Ring shaped natural samples with a thickness of
            about 3.5 cm and with an inner diameter of 5 cm and
            an outer diameter of 12 cm.
METHOD     (PHD) Pulse high discrimination set at 11.5 MeV
            in the proton recoil spectrum in the organic
            scintillators, which make them practically
            insensible to inelastic scattered neutrons and
            gamma-rays.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) One plastic NE102 scintillator ( 5 cm long
            and 2 cm in diam.) to detect the scattered
            neutrons. Another organic scintillator(2. x 2. x 1.cm)
            to monitor the neutron flux. The efficiency of the
            detectors have been studied at different angles and
            found to be almost constant within 1%.
CORRECTION .Multiple scattering corrections has been performed.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in the detector effeciency
           (DATA-ERR) Data uncertainties are taken from graphs,
            no information given.
STATUS     .Data read from graphs except one value for Al-27
            which is given in text.
