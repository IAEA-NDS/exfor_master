TITLE      -EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE CROSS SECTIONS
            OF PU,AM AND CM ISOTOPES IN A LIGHT WATER
            REACTOR NEUTRON SPECTRUM. (IN FRENCH).
FACILITY   (REAC ) SWIMMING POOL REACTOR 'MELUSINE',
                   CONTAINING AN ASSEMBLY OF 5 BY 5 FUEL PINS.
                   THE FUEL WAS URANIUM DIOXIDE ENRICHED TO
                   2.8 PER CENT AND CLAD IN ALUMINIUM.
INC-SOURCE (REAC )
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL REACTOR SPECTRUM. THE WATER TEMPERATURE WAS
            32 DEGREES CELSIUS.
            A 4-GROUP REPRESENTATION OF THE SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED
                F1 = FLUX BETWEEN 0.9 MEV AND 10 MEV
                F2 = FLUX BETWEEN 5 KEV AND 0.9 MEV
                F3 = FLUX BETWEEN 0.625 EV AND 5 KEV
                F4 = FLUX BETWEEN 0.0 EV AND 0.625 EV
             F1/F4 = 1.7   F2/F4 = 2.6   F3/F4 = 1.8
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE ISOTOPES WERE PRESENT AS TRACE ELEMENTS
            (0.1 PER CENT BY MASS) IN CERTAIN FUEL PELLETS IN
            THE CENTRAL FUEL PIN.
METHOD     (ACTIV) SAMPLES IRRADIATED FOR 1021.5 HOURS AT FULL
                   POWER. THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE DEDUCED FROM
                   GAMMA,ALPHA AND MASS SPECTROMETRY OF THE
                   IRRADIATED AND NON RADIATED PURE AND DOPED
                   FUEL PELLETS.
DETECTOR   .GAMMA,ALPHA AND MASS SPECTROMETERS. NO FURTHER
            DETAILS GIVEN IN THE REFERENCE.
ANALYSIS   .THE MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS CORRESPONDED TO THE
            NEUTRON SPECTRUM AT THE CENTRAL PIN OF A 5 BY 5
            LATTICE. THEY WERE CONVERTED INTO CROSS SECTIONS
            FOR THE CENTRAL PIN OF A PWR 17 BY 17 LATTICE.
            THIS CALCULATION USED A 4-GROUP REPRESENTATION
            OF THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM IN THE CENTRE OF A
            17 BY 17 LATTICE-
              F1/F4 = 1.7   F2/F4 = 2.4   F3/F4 = 1.5
            THE GROUP FLUXES F1,F2,F3,F4 ARE DEFINED UNDER
            KEYWORD INC-SPECT.
COMMENT    .THE REFERENCE CONTAINS A COMPARISON OF THE
            MEASURED RESULTS TO AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS
            CALCULATED FROM DATA IN A LIBRARY IN USE AT
            CADARACHE.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.

CORRECTION .MODULE 'EVOGENE' OF THE 'KAFKA' SYSTEM WAS USED TO
            CALCULATE COORECTION FACTORS FOR THE GAMMA AND ALPHA
            ACTIVITIES OF HEAVY ISOTOPES AND CERTAIN FISSION
            PODUCTS PRESENT IN THEIRRADIATED SAMPLES. 'EVOGENE'
            USES 1-GROUP CROSS SECTIONS BASED ON THE RESULTS
            OF THE NEUTRONICS CODE 'APOLLO'.
ERR-ANALYS .NO DETAILS GIVEN.
