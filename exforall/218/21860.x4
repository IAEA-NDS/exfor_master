TITLE      -.KINETIC ENERGY AND FRAGMENT MASS DISTRIBUTION
            FOR THE SPONTANEOUS AND PHOTO-INDUCED
            FISSION OF PU-244.-
FACILITY   (LINAC) SF MEASUREMENTS WERE DONE DURING
                   SHUT-DOWN PERIODS OF THE LINAC
           (REAC,2BLGMOL) FOR PU-241(N-TH,F) CALIBRATION RUNS
                          A COLLIMATED N-BEAM OF THE REACTOR BR1
                          OF SCK/CEN WAS USED
SAMPLE     .PU-244, ENRICHMENT 88 PER CENT,CONSISTING OF A
                    LAYER OF 29 MICROGRAM/CM**2 PU SANDWICHED
                    BETWEEN TWO 30 MICROGRAM/CM**2 THICK
                    POLYIMIDE BACKINGS WITH 20 MICROGRAM/CM**2 AU
           .PU-241, ENRICHMENT 91 PER CENT,USED FOR CALIBRATION,
                    THICKNESS 40 MICROGRAM/CM**2
           .TARGETS WERE PREPARED BY ELECTROSPRAYING
            OF PU-ACETATE.
METHOD     (COINC)
           .TWO HEAVY ION DETECTORS WERE MOUNTED SYMMETRICALLY
            ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FISSION TARGET AT 90 DEGREES

ANALYSIS   .THE NUMBER OF FISSION EVENTS WAS 7990
           .FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE AVERAGE TOTAL PRENEUTRON
            KIN.ENERGY THE MEASURED VALUE OF 2.30+-0.19
            (C.J.ORTH,J,NSE,43,54,71) FOR THE AVER.NUMBER
            OF EMITTED NEUTRONS WAS USED.
MONITOR    .EACH MEASUREMENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A CALIBRATION
            RUN WITH 20-MEV BREMSSTRAHLUNG. THESE RUNS WERE
            CALIBRATED WITH PU-241(N-TH,F) DATA.
