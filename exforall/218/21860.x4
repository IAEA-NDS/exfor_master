TITLE      -.Kinetic energy and fragment mass distribution
            for the spontaneous and photo-induced
            fission of Pu-244.-
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) For Pu-241(N-Th,F) calibration runs
                          a collimated N-beam of the reactor BR1
                          of SCK/CEN was used
SAMPLE     .Pu-244, enrichment 88 per cent,consisting of a
                    layer of 29 microgram/cm**2 Pu sandwiched
                    between two 30 microgram/cm**2 thick
                    polyimide backings with 20 microgram/cm**2 Au
           .Pu-241, enrichment 91 per cent,used for calibration,
                    thickness 40 microgram/cm**2
           .Targets were prepared by electrospraying
            of Pu-acetate.
METHOD     (COINC)
           .Two heavy ion detectors were mounted symmetrically
            on both sides of the fission target at 90 degrees
           .Schmitt et Al. Calibration method (j,Pr,137,B837,65)
           .Detector calibration constants of neiler et Al.
            (J,Pr,149,894,66)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Surface barrier detectors
ANALYSIS   .The number of fission events was 7990
           .For the calculation of the average total preneutron
            kin.Energy the measured value of 2.30+-0.19
            (C.J.Orth,j,nse,43,54,71) for the aver.Number
            of emitted neutrons was used.
MONITOR    .Each measurement was accompanied by a calibration
            run with 20-MeV bremsstrahlung. These runs were
            calibrated with Pu-241(N-Th,F) data.
PART-DET   (FF)
ADD-RES    .Photo-fission data of Pu-244 with 12,15,20 and
            30 MeV bremsstrahlung.
           .Comparison with the fissioning system Pu-240.
CORRECTION .For the contamination of Pu-244(sf) with Pu-240(sf)
            and Pu-242(sf) data,
           .Calculated to be 0.5% and 3.4%, respectively.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) .Given uncertainties are the root-mean-
            square deviations for at least five experimental runs.
