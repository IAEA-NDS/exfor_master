INC-SOURCE (CF252) ABOUT 100 FISSIONS/SEC.
           (CM244) ABOUT 200 FISSIONS/HOUR (1.2 MICROCURIE)
METHOD     (COINC)
           .SAME GEOMETRY WAS USED FOR BOTH CF AND CM SOURCE
           .ENERGY CALIBRATION BY THE METHOD OF SCHMITT ET AL.
           .FOR THE CM-244 DATA THE PULSE-HEIGHT DEFECT WAS
            NOT CONSIDERED. THE ENERGY CALIBRATION IS BASED
            ON THE U-235(N-TH,F) EXPERIMENT OF FRASER ET AL,

ERR-ANALYS .NO DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS GIVEN
           .FOR THE ERRORS OF THE CF-252 MEAN KINETIC ENERGIES
            THE AUTHORS POINT OUT, THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN THOSE
            OF H.W.SCHMITT ET AL,PHYS.REV.141,1146,1966 BECAUSE
            THEY USED THE SAME CALIBRATION METHOD.
           .FOR THE CM-244 ENERGIES THEY RAISED THE ERRORS
            SLIGHTLY DUE TO RADIATION DAMAGE EFFECTS.
            NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS GIVEN.
