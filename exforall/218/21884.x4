TITLE      -SEARCH FOR BE-7 AND SI-32 AS PRODUCTS OF TERNARY
            FISSION OF U-235 BY THERMAL NEUTRONS-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2GERMUN) THE MUNICH RESEARCH REACTOR.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED IN THE
            GRAPHITE REFLECTOR OF THE REACTOR.
INC-SPECT  .THE THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX WAS 1.6E+13 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ*SE
            AND 1.4E+13 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ*SEC FOR THE TWO SAMPLES,
            RESPECTIVELY.
SAMPLE     .TWO SAMPLES OF ABOUT 555 MG URANIUM ENRICHED TO ABOUT
            90 PER CENT U-235. EACH SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 9 CHIPS
            OF 55-65 MG OF URANIUM METAL. EACH CHIP WAS WRAPPED IN
            ALUMINUM FOIL (20 MICRO-M THICK). THE CHIPS WERE PLACE
            IN LARGER ALUMINUM CANS, THREE BY THREE, AND THREE SUC
            CANS FORMED ONE SAMPLE.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION. IRRADIATION TIME WAS ABOUT 30 DAYS.
           (CHSEP) CHEMICAL SEPARATION
DETECTOR   (GELI ) A COAXIAL GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH A 16.9 PER CENT
            PHOTOPEAK EFFICIANCY RELATIVE TO A 3 INCH * 3 INCH
            NAI(TL) CRYSTAL AND A RESOLUTION OF 2.1 KEV FOR THE
            1.33 MEV GAMMA-RAY OF CO-60 WAS USED FOR DETECTION OF
            THE 478. KEV GAMMA-RAY OF BE-7 AND RADIATION FROM
            BA-140 USED A MONITOR FOR THE NUMBER OF FISSIONS.
           .THE BE-SAMPLES WERE ALSO COUNTED IN A CALIBRATED
            LOW-BACKGROUND GAS FLOW WINDOW COUNTER PROVIDED WITH
            AN ANTICOINCIDENCE GUARD COUNTER TO MEASURE POSSIBLE
            BETA ACTIVITY OF 1.6E+06 YR BE-10. THE SAME BETA-
            COUNTER WAS USED TO MEASURE THE BETA ACTIVITY OF SI-32
            AND ITS DAUGHTER P-32 WITH HALF-LIFE 14.28 D.
ANALYSIS   .THE NUMBER OF FISSIONS IN THE IRRADIATED U-235 SAMPLE
            WAS DETERMINED FROM THE AMOUNT OF BA-140 PRODUCED IN
            THE SAMPLE. THIS NUMBER WAS DETERMINED TO BE
            1.5E+19 AND 0.9E+19 FOR THE TWO SAMPLES, RESPECTIVELY
           .SINCE NO OR VERY SMALL EVIDENCES FOR EXCISTANCE
            OF ACTIVITY WERE OBSERVED, ONLY UPPER LIMITS FOR
            FISSION YIELDS ARE GIVEN.
