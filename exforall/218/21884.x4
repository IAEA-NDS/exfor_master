TITLE       Search for Be-7 and Si-32 as products of ternary
            fission of U-235 by thermal neutrons

FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) The Munich Research Reactor.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The samples were irradiated in the
            graphite reflector of the reactor.
INC-SPECT   The thermal neutron flux was 1.6E+13 neutrons/cm-sq*Se
            and 1.4E+13 neutrons/cm-sq*sec for the two samples,
            respectively.
SAMPLE      Two samples of about 555 Mg uranium enriched to about
            90% U-235. Each sample consisted of 9 chips
            of 55-65 Mg of uranium metal. Each chip was wrapped in
            aluminum foil (20 um thick). The chips were place in
            larger aluminum cans, three by three, and three such
            cans formed one sample.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time was about 30 days.
           (CHSEP) Chemical separation
DETECTOR   (GELI) A coaxial Ge(Li) detector with a 16.9%
            photopeak efficiancy relative to a 3 inch * 3 inch
            NaI(Tl) crystal and a resolution of 2.1 keV for the
            1.33 MeV gamma-ray of Co-60 was used for detection of
            the 478. keV gamma-ray of Be-7 and radiation from
            Ba-140 used a monitor for the number of fissions.
            The Be-samples were also counted in a calibrated
            low-background gas flow window counter provided with
            an anticoincidence guard counter to measure possible
            beta activity of 1.6e+06 yr Be-10. the same beta-
            counter was used to measure the beta activity of Si-32
            and its daughter p-32 with half-life 14.28 d.
ANALYSIS    The number of fissions in the irradiated U-235 sample
            was determined from the amount of Ba-140 produced in
            the sample. This number was determined to be
            1.5e+19 and 0.9e+19 for the two samples, respectively
            Since no or very small evidences for excistance
            of activity were observed, only upper limits for
            fission yields are given.

COMMENT     The results show that ternary fission giving rise to
           fragments of mass greater than that of the alpha
           particle is extremely rare if it occurs at all.
