TITLE      -THERMAL CROSS SECTION RATIO SIGMA(H)/SIGMA(MN).-
INC-SOURCE (CF252) 5.4 MILLI-CURIE AT THE CENTRE OF AN
            ALUMINIUM SPHERICAL SHELL OF 9.1 CM DIAMETER
            WHICH WAS PLACED IN ITS TURN AT THE CENTRE OF
            THE MAGNESIUM BATH VESSEL. THE NEUTRONS ARE
            THERMALISED BY THE BATH. THE SPECTRUM IS
            EVALUATED BY THE GOLD-ACTIVATION METHOD, USING
            ALSO CADMIUM FOILS.
INC-SPECT  .THERMAL MAXWELLIAN SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .THE BATH ITSELF.
METHOD     (MANGB) MANGANESE BATH INSIDE A SPHERICAL SUS316
            VESSEL, 1.5 MM THICK AND WITH AN INTERNAL DIAMETER
            OF 98.4 CM.
           .ACTIVATION. THE CONCENTRATION OF MN-S-O(4) INSIDE
            THE BATH IS CHANGED. THE CROSS SECTION IS OBTAINED
            FROM A STRAIGHT LINE EQUATION RELATING THE ACTIVATION
            OF THE BATH TO THE CONCENTRATION. THE ACTIVATION
            IS MEASURED BY PUMPING THE SOLUTION FROM THE
            BATH AND COUNTING IT IN
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 2 NA-I CRYSTAL DETECTORS, RESP. 2.5 CM DIAM *
            2.5 CM LONG AND 5.1 CM DIAM * 5.1 CM LONG, BOTH
            COUPLED TO TEMPERATURE COMPENSATED PM BASES. THE
            EFFICIENCY OF THE BATH WAS DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS -
            MN-055 WAS ACTIVATED IN A REACTOR. A PART OF SUCH A
            SAMPLE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE BATH AND COUNTED,
            ANOTHER PART WAS COUNTED IN A
           (D4PI ) 4*PI B-G COINCIDENCE MEASUREMENT.
           (LONGC) A STANDARD LONG COUNTER OF THE HANSON AND
            MCKIBBEN TYPE WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE NEUTRON
            ESCAPE FROM THE BATH. AND A
           (BF3  ) BF3 COUNTER WAS USED TO MEASURE THE THERMAL
            NEUTRONS AT THE SURFACE OF THE BATH.
PART-DET   (DG)    DECAY GAMMAS. ALL GAMMAS WITH AN ENERGY
            GREATER THAN 20 KEV WERE INTEGRATED.
COMMENT    .METHOD ALSO DESCRIBED IN AEJ,23,1(1980)62.
CORRECTION .NEUTRON ABSORPTION IN SOURCE AND SOURCE MOUNTING.
