TITLE       Average cross sections and half-lives of Au-197m
            and Y-89m excited by inelastic scattering of
            reactor neutrons.
FACILITY   (REAC,2GERMUN) The 1 MW, H2O moderated, enriched
            U-fuelled reactor FRM at Munich.
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The reactor FRM spectrum.
INC-SPECT  .Fast reactor spectrum, no details given.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation techniques, using the fast
            rabbit system to transfer samples.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 5.08 cm x 2.54 cm NaI(Tl) detector,
            absolute efficiency calibrated against a 7.62 cm
            times 7.62 cm scintillation detector of known
            efficiency characteristics, using different
            radioactive sources.
DECAY-DATA .Half-life measured in the experiment. The uncertainty
            quoted is the standard error of the mean.
MONITOR    (14-SI-28(N,P)13-AL-28,,SIG,,SPA) The weighted mean
            value of the cross section for this reaction
            averaged over the FRM spectrum above 0.1 MeV was
            calculated.
STATUS     (TABLE) .Data taken from the text of JNE,22,632,1968.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty, includes:
           (ERR-1) uncertainties in flux measurement,
                  detector efficiency,
                  time-dependent errors and
             * uncertainties in monitor cross section and
            reactor spectrum.

SAMPLE     .Gold foil, about 0.06 mm in thickness.
           .The sample was enclosed in very thin polyethylene
            sheet and placed inside a polyethylene capsule with
            a wall thickness of 1mm, internal diameter 4 mm and
            effective length about 1 cm.
CORRECTION .For -
             -dead-time, ranging from 23 to 11%,
             -gamma-ray self-absorption, 3% for the sample and
              about 0.5% for the monitor,
             -the internal conversion effect, a value of
              0.343 used for alpha.
           .Corrections for flux-depression and multiple
            scattering of neutrons in the target were very
            small and have been omitted for both the sample
            and the monitor.
