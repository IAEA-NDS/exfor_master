TITLE      -AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS AND HALF-LIVES OF AU-197M
            AND Y-89M EXCITED BY INELASTIC SCATTERING OF
            REACTOR NEUTRONS-.
FACILITY   (REAC ) THE 1 MW, H2O MODERATED, ENRICHED
            U-FUELLED REACTOR FRM AT MUNICH.
INC-SOURCE (REAC ) THE REACTOR FRM SPECTRUM.
INC-SPECT  .FAST REACTOR SPECTRUM, NO DETAILS GIVEN.
SAMPLE     .GOLD FOIL, ABOUT 0.06 MM IN THICKNESS.
           .Y2O3 POWDER.
           .THE SAMPLES WERE ENCLOSED IN VERY THIN POLYETHYLENE
            SHEET AND PLACED INSIDE A POLYETHYLENE CAPSULE WITH
            A WALL THICKNESS OF 1MM, INTERNAL DIAMETER 4 MM AND
            EFFECTIVE LENGTH ABOUT 1 CM.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION TECHNIQUES, USING THE FAST
            RABBIT SYATEM TO TRANSFER SAMPLES.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 5.08 CM TIMES 2.54 CM NAI(TL) DETECTOR,
            ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY CALIBRATED AGAINST A 7.62 CM
            TIMES 7.62 CM SCINTILLATION DETECTOR OF KNOWN
            EFFICIENCY CHARACTERISTICS, USING DIFFERENT
            RADIOACTIVE SOURCES.
DECAY-DATA .HALF-LIFE MEASURED IN THE EXPERIMENT. THE UNCERTAINTY
            QUOTED IS THE STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEAN.
MONITOR    (14-SI-28(N,P)13-AL-28,,SIG,,SPA) THE WEIGHTED MEAN
            VALUE OF THE CROSS SECTION FOR THIS REACTION
            AVERAGED OVER THE FRM SPECTRUM ABOVE 0.1 MEV WAS
            CALCULATED.
STATUS     .DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE.

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) TOTAL UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING UNCERTAINTIES
            IN FLUX MEASUREMENT, DETECTOR EFFICIENCY, TIME-
            DEPENDENT ERRORS, MONITOR CROSS SECTION AND
            REACTOR SPECTRUM. IF THE LAST TWO MENTIONED
            UNCERTAINTIES ARE NEGLECTED THE ERROR IN THE
            CROSS SECTION WOULD BE ABOUT 13 PERCENT.
