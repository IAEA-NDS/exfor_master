TITLE      -EXCITATION FUNCTIONS OF (N,T) REACTIONS ON
            AL-27, CO-59 AND NB-93.
FACILITY   (VDG  ) VAN DE GRAAFF.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) WATER COOLED TI(T) TARGET, BOMBARDED
            WITH 3 MEV DEUTERONS AT 50 MICRO-AMP.
INC-SPECT  .EACH SAMPLE SEGMENT COVERED A CERTAIN ANGULAR RANGE,
            AND A CORRESPONDING PRIMARY NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE.
            A MONTE CARLO CALCULATION WAS PERFORMED TO CALCULATE
            THE SPECTRUM SEEN BY EACH SEGMENT, TAKING INTO
            ACCOUNT SINGLE ( BUT NOT MULTIPLE ) SCATTERING IN
            THE TRITIUM TARGET, COOLING WATER AND SURROUNDING
            CAPSULE.
METHOD     (ACTIV) VACUUM EXTRACTION AND GAS COUNTING
                   OF TRITIUM. ACTIVATION REACTIONS USED
                   AS INTERNAL MONITORS.
DETECTOR   (PROPC) GAS COUNTING TUBE TO MEASURE TRITIUM ACTIVITY
                   USING LOW-LEVEL ANTICOINCIDENCE BETA- COUNTING
                   IN THE GAS PHASE.
                   PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE 80 CM FROM THE NEUTRON
                   SOURCE IN THE 130 DEGREE DIRECTION, USED AS AN
                   EXTERNAL FLUX MONITOR.
           (GELI ) LARGE SIZE GELI DETECTOR TO MEASURE GAMMA
                   ACTIVITY INDUCED BY THE MONITOR REACTIONS.
PART-DET   (B-   ) BETA PARTICLES FROM TRITIUM DECAY.
           (DG   ) DECAY GAMMAS FROM MONITOR REACTIONS.

           (DATA-ERR) STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN
                       QUADRATURE.
                   THE STATISTICAL ERRORS VARIED BETWEEN +/-0.6
                   AND +/-2.9 PER CENT. THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS

            TWO EXTERNAL MONITORS WERE ALSO USED -
            1) A PROTON RECOIL COUNTER TO MEASURE THE
               NEUTRON FLUX DIRECTLY
            2) THE ACTIVITY INDUCED IN A PIECE OF COBALT
               PLACED 25 CM FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE IN THE

            THE RESULTS FROM THESE EXTERNAL MONITORS WERE
            NOT VERY ACCURATE BECAUSE THE IRRADIATION
            GEOMETRY WAS NOT WELL KNOWN.
