CORRECTION .TRITIUM PRODUCTION BY FAST NEUTRONS ON LI-6 MAY BE
            NEGLECTED DUE TO THE HIGH ENRICHMENT OF THE SAMPLE.
            THE EFFECT OF EPITHEMAL AND THERMAL NEUTRONS WAS
            SHOWN TO BE ALSO NEGLIGIBLE BY IRRADIATING ADDITIONAL
            LITHIUM SAMPLES ( ENRICHED TO 95.7 +/- 0.5 PER CENT )
            AT THREE NEUTRON ENERGIES - 5.23 6.49 AND 7.73 MEV.
           .FOR THE D-D NEUTRON SOURCE, THE FLUX AT THE POSITION
            OF THE HYDROGEN RADIATOR WAS CORRECTED FOR THE
            TRANSMISSION OF THE SAMPLE. THIS WAS CALULATED FROM
            THE LI-7 TOTAL CROSS SECTION, BUT WAS ALSO VERIFIED
            EXPERIMENTALLY AT THREE NEUTRON ENERGIES USING A
            SPARE LITHIUM SAMPLE.
           .DURING SOME OF THE LONG IRRADIATION RUNS THE DATA
            ACQUISITION OF THE PROTON RECOIL COUNTER WAS
            INTERRUPTED BY ACCIDENT AND THE FLUX DURING THESE
            INTERRUPTIONS HAD TO BE CALCULATED FROM THE ION BEAM
            CHARGE ASSUMING PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN CHARGE AND
            NEUTRON PRODUCTION.
           .FROM THE FLUX AT THE POSITION OF THE RADIATOR FOIL
            THE FLUX AVERAGED OVER THE SAMPLE VOLUME WAS
            DETERMINED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GEOMETRY AND THE
            ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOURCE NEUTRONS.
            CORRECTIONS FOR NEUTRON SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION
            WITHIN THE SAMPLE WERE PERFORMED.
           .THE SPECTRUM OF SECONDARY NEUTRONS WAS DETERMINED
            WITH A CALIBRATED NE-213 TOF SPECTROMETER AND WAS
            FOUND TO BE CONSISTENT WITH RESULTS WHICH WERE
            DEDUCED FROM THE LOW ENERGY TAIL OF THE OBSERVED
            PROTON RECOIL SPECTRA. THE EFFECT OF THESE
            SECONDARY NEUTRONS ON THE TRITIUM BREEDING CROSS
            SECTION IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO BELOW 6.5 MEV PRIMARY
            NEUTRON ENERGY AND INCREASES TO ABOUT 3.5 PER CENT
            AT 8 MEV.
