TITLE       Kinetic energy and fragment mass distributions for
            Pu-240(0,f),Pu-239(n,f) and Pu-240(g,f)
FACILITY   (REAC,2BLGMOL) The reactor BR1 of the SCK/CEN MOL,
            Belgium.
           (LINAC) Bremsstrahlung produced by electron beam
            from a linear accelerator.
SAMPLE     .The Pu-240 sample consisted of a 109 micro-g/cm-sq
            PuF3 layer on a 40 micro-g/cm-sq polyimide backing
            with 10 micro-g/cm-sq gold. The isotopic composition
            was 0.68% Pu-239, 98.47% Pu-240,
            0.48% Pu-241 and 0.37% Pu-242.
            The Pu-239 sample consisted of a 118 micro-g/cm-sq
            PuF3 layer on the same backing as Pu-240. The
            isotopic abundance of Pu-239 was 99.98%.
            The diameter of the active layer was 25 mm in both
            cases
METHOD     .Each spontaneous fission experiment was accompanied
            by a calibration Pu-240(g,f) run with 20-MeV
            bremsstrahlung. The Pu-240 photofission runs were
            calibrated by Pu-239(n,f) with thermal neutrons
            using a calibration procedure according to (PR,
            137,B837,1965) and parameters from (PR,149,894,1966).
            These Pu-239(n,f) measurements were done with a
            well-thermalized and collimated neutron beam
            from the reactor.

           (R,,J.N.Neiler+,J,PR,149,894,1966)
DETECTOR   (SOLST)2 Ortec F-series heavy ion detectors (CF090-600
            -60) mounted symmetrically on both sides of the
            fission sample at a distance of 7 cm from the sample
            and at the angle of 90 degrees to the bremsstrahlung
            or neutron beam axis.
ANALYSIS   .Off line, the data were sorted in two-dimensional
            provisional mass (My) and total kinetic (Ek) arrays,
            120 * 120 channels.
COMMENT    .The reference also contains data on Pu-240(g,f)
            using gammas from bremsstrahlung.
CORRECTION .For
            - spontaneous fission of other Pu-isotopes
            - drift in the measuring system
STATUS     (COREL,L0105001) Pu-240(g,f) using gammas from
                             bremsstrahlung.
