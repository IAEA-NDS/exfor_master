TITLE      -Kinetic energy and fragment mass distributions for
            Pu-240(0,F),Pu-239(N,F) and Pu-240(g,F)-
FACILITY   (REAC ,2BLGMOL) The reactor Br1 of the sck/cen mol,
            belgium.
           (LINAC) Bremsstrahlung produced by electron beam
            from a linear accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
SAMPLE     .The Pu-240 sample consisted of a 109 micro-g/cm-sq
            puf3 layer on a 40 micro-g/cm-sq polymide backing
            with 10 micro-g/cm-sq gold. The isotopic composition
            was 0.68 per cent Pu-239, 98.47 per cent Pu-240,
            0.48 per cent Pu-241 and 0.37 per cent Pu-242.
            The Pu-239 sample consisted of a 118 micro-g/cm-sq
            puf3 layer on the same backing as Pu-240. The
            isotopic abundance of Pu-239 was 99.98 per cent.
            The diameter of the activ layer was 25 mm in both
            cases
METHOD     .Each spontanious fission experiment was accompanied
            by a calibration Pu-240(g,F) run with 20-MeV
            bremsstrahlung. The Pu-240 photofission runs were
            calibrated by Pu-239(N,F) with thermal neutrons
            using a calibration procedure according to (j,Pr,
            137,B837,65) and parameters from (j,Pr,
            149,894,66). These Pu-239(N,F) measurements
            were done with a well-thermalized and collimated
            neutron beam from the reactor.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)2 ortec F-series heavy ion detectors (Cf090-600
            -60) mounted symmetrically on both sides of the fissio
            sample at a distance of 7 cm from the sample and at
            an angle of 90 degrees to the bremsstrahlung or
            neutron beam axis.
ANALYSIS   .Off line, the data were sorted in two-dimensional
            provisional mass (my) and total kinetic (ek) arrays,
            120 * 120 channels.
COMMENT    .The reference also contains data on Pu-240(g,F)
            using gammas from bremsstrahlung.
CORRECTION .For
            - spontaneous fission of other Pu-isotopes
            - drift in the measuring system
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Uncertainty in target thickness was about
                   2 per cent
