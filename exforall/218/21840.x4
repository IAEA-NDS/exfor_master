TITLE       Neutron activation cross section of
            molybdenum isotopes at 14.8 MeV.
FACILITY   (VDG,2JPNNAG) 2 MeV Van de Graaff.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron flux was about 10**9 n/cm2/s.
METHOD     (ASSOP) Associated particle counting to
                   monitor neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (GELI)  Coaxial 55 cm3 Ge(Li) detector, with FWHM
                   resolution of 2.0 keV at 1332 keV.
           (SIBAR) Silicon surface barrier detector about
                   50 cm from the tritium target at an angle
                   of 179 degrees to the beam, used to monitor
                   the neutron flux by counting alpha particles
                   from the d-t reaction.

MONIT-REF  (20799001,J.C.Robertson+,J,JNE,27,531,1973)
CORRECTION .Self absorption of gamma rays in the sample.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes:
           (ERR-1,,5.) uncertainty in detector efficiencies
           (MONIT1-ERR) uncertainty in Al-27(n,alpha) monitor
                         cross section;
           (MONIT2-ERR) uncertainty in Al-27(n,p) monitor
                         cross section;
            * counting statistics;
            * The samples were weighed to an accuracy  < 0.03%
              This error is negligible compared to the others.
            The quoted error does not include contributions from
            uncertainties in the half lives or the gamma
            intensity per disintegration.
