TITLE       The Pu-241(n,f) cross section and its normalization
FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) 100 MeV Electron Linac at Geel.
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Natural uranium target.
SAMPLE     .Pu-241 and B-10 samples mounted back to back.
             A 550 micro-g/cm**2 plutonium acetate layer
              was electrosprayed onto an aluminum disc.
              Isotopic composition in atom per cent-
                Pu-241   91.02     Pu-238    0.03
                Pu-239    1.17     Pu-240    4.48
                Pu-242    3.30
             a 184 micro-g/cm**2 elemental boron-10 layer
              of isotopic enrichment 93 per cent was
              prepared by evaporating boron in a vacuum.
METHOD     (TOF) Measurements made at a flight path of 9.3 m
                   with and without a Cd overlap filter, and at
                   30.45 m with a B-10 overlap filter.

                   detectors.

            Cross section assumed to have a 1/V shape.

COMMENT    .The main reference contains a detailed
            comparison of the data with the
            measurements of other workers.
CORRECTION .Background determination performed using Cd
            Rh Au Co and Mn neutron filters, together
            with a permanent Al neutron filter.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The total error consists mainly of the
                   following five components -
             1) error on the normalization to the 2200 m/s
                value of the Pu-241 cross section.
             2) Background determination for both Pu-241(n,f)
                and B-10(n,alpha) reactions.
             3) Error on the correction for sample impurities.
             4) The uncertainty in the shape of the
                B-10(n,alpha) cross section. This is more
                more important above 1 keV, since at lower
                energies the shape has an almost perfect
                1/V behavior.
             5) Statistical error.
