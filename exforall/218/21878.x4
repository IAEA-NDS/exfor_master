TITLE      - Cyclotron production of short-lived P-30 -
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERJUL) The Juelich Isochronus Cyclotron .
INC-SOURCE (D-BE) 53 MeV deuterons on a 1 cm thick Be target.
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum in the forward direction extends
            over the energy range of 11.5 - 43.5 MeV. The maximum
            intensity occurs at a neutron energy of about 22.5MeV
            and the FWHM of the spectrum is 15.8 MeV. Neutron flux
            densities were calculated from the integrated charge
            at the Be converter using Faraday cup.
            The neutron flux densities available at irradiation
            geometry were about 8.E+10 neutrons/cm**2/sec.

MONITOR    (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24,,SIG) As a flux monitor.
SAMPLE      The sample material, PCl5 or S, was sealed under
            vacuum in polyethylene tubes and monitor aluminum
            wrapped around it.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation
           (GSPEC)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Annihilation radiation from decay of P-30 as
           well as radiation from the monitor foil was counted on
            Ge(Li) detector and gamma-ray spectra analyzed on a
            4096 channel analyzer. The given yields are the mean
            of three determinations.
CORRECTION .Corrections are described in REL-REF JIN,36,3639,1974.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total errors range between 12 and 15 % .
            Errors due to presence of impurities, which could lead
            to formation of O-15 (also beta+ emission, half-life
            2.03 min), amounting up to 5% may be inherent in
            measurement.
