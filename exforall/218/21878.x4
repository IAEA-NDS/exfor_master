TITLE      -CYCLOTRON PRODUCTION OF SHORT-LIVED P-30-
FACILITY   (ISOCY) THE JUELICH ISOCHRONUS CYCLOTRON (JULIC).
INC-SOURCE (D-BE ) 53 MEV DEUTRONS ON A 1 CM THICK BE TARGET. THE
            NEUTRON SPECTRUM IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION EXTENDS OVER
            THE ENERGY RANGE OF 11.5 - 43.5 MEV. THE MAXIMUM
            INTENSITY OCCURES AT A NEUTRON ENERGY OF ABOUT 22.5 ME
            AND THE FWHM OF THE SPECTRUM IS 15.8 MEV. NEUTRON FLUX
            DENSITIES WERE CALCULATED FROM THE INTEGRATED CHARGE A
            THE CONVERTER AND THE (13-AL-27(N,A)11-NA-24) REACTION
            WAS USED AS A FLUX MONITOR. THE NEUTRON FLUX DENSITIES
            AVAILABLE WERE ABOUT 8.E+10 NEUTRONS/CM-SQ*SEC.
SAMPLE     .THE SAMPLE MATERIAL, PCL5 OR S, WAS SEALED UNDER
            VACUUM IN POLYETHYLENE TUBES AND MONITOR ALUMINUM
            WRAPPED AROUND IT.
METHOD     (ACTIV) ACTIVATION
DETECTOR   (GELI )
ANALYSIS   .ANNIHILATION RADIATION FROM DECAY OF P-30 AS WELL AS
            RADIATION FROM THE MONITOR FOIL WAS COUNTED ON A
            GE(LI) DETECTOR AND GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA ANALYSED ON A
            4096 CHANNEL ANALYZER. THE GIVEN YIELDS ARE THE MEAN
            OF THREE DETERMINATIONS.
