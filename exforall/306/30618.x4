TITLE      The determination of Ni-65 average projectional recoi l
           ranges in Cu-65(n,p)Ni-65 reaction with 13.9-15.6 MeV
           neutrons.
FACILITY   (CCW,3CPRBNU)
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
SAMPLE     Natural Cu disk foil, thickness about 15 mg/cm2, high
           purity(less than 0.01% for Zn,Ga,Ni and Th.
           U-content was less than 0.05% weight).
METHOD     (ACTIV) Thick target-thick catcher method. (For recoil
           range determination)

REACTION   (29-CU-65(N,P)28-NI-65,,SIG,,AV)
INC-SPECT  Neutron flux was about 5. x 10**9 n/cm2/sec.
           Average neutron energies between
           13.9 and 15.6 MeV.
            Compiler's note ===
            The cross-section curve of Cu-65(n,p)Ni65 is rather
            flat in this energy range. ===
DETECTOR   (GELI)Resolution for 1332keV gamma of Co-60 was 1.88keV
