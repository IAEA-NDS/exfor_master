TITLE      Measurement of fission cross section for U-238 induced
           by fast neutron.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP) 2.5MV Van de Graaff.
INC-SOURCE (D-D)
            Deuterium target 500 micro-g/cm2.
SAMPLE      99.99% enriched U-238 as U(3)-O(8).  Electro-plating
            on platinum foil.  The mass of U-238 was
           determined by method of residue weighing.
METHOD     Recoil proton semiconductor detector telescope and
           U-238 deposit and myler film (radiator) are put in a
           back and back geometry in the fission chamber.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission ionization chamber.
           (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) Recoil proton telescope,
                                     semiconductor detector.
MONITOR    Absolute, recoil proton telescope.
