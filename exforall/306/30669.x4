TITLE      Measurement of fission cross section for 238U induced
            by fast neutron

INSTITUTE  (3CPRAEP)
REFERENCE  (J,CNP,5,158,1983)
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP) 2.5MV Van de Graaff
INC-SOURCE (D-D) 500 ug/cm2 deuterium target
SAMPLE     99.99% enriched 238U as U3O8.  Electro-painting
            on Pt foil.
           The mass of 238U was determined by method of residue
            weighing.
METHOD     Recoil proton semiconductor detector telescope and
            238U deposit and myler film (radiator) are put in a
            back-to-back geometry in the fission chamber.
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Fission ionization chamber.
           (TELES,SOLST,SOLST) Recoil proton telescope
