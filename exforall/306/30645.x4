FACILITY   (CCW) Neutron generator (No information on location)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) at angles 0 and 105 degrees
INC-SPECT  The neutron energy was calculated allowing for the
           following considerations
            1) The angle of emission of the neutron
            2) The existence of two groups of neutron energies
               due to the presence of atomic and molecular ions
               in the deuteron beam that is not analyzed.
            3) The energy spread due to the profile of the
               tritium in the titanium layer the energy spread
               due to the final angular apertures spanned by the
               beam spot and samples dimensions
SAMPLE     Thin foils of 1 cm diameter and placed at 11 cm from
           the center of the Ti-T target
METHOD     (ACTIV)
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   The method of the neutron energy determination by
           using of the cross section ratio measurement was
            tested for some threshold reactions.

COMMENT    The results of the determination of the neutron energy
           by using the above ratio were neither consistent nor
           reproducible. The reason for that is apparently due to
           the large sensitivity of the annihilation process of
           b+ used to determine 63Cu(n,2n) cross section on the
           spatial arrangements of masses during the measurements.
