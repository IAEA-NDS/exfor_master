TITLE      MEASUREMENT OF THE CROSS SECTIONS RATIOS FOR THE
           REACTIONS ZR-90(N,2N)ZR-89-M+G BY NB-93(N,2N)NB-92-M,

FACILITY   (CCW) NEUTRON GENERATOR
INC-SOURCE (D-T) AT ANGLES 0 AND 105 DEGREES
INC-SPECT  THE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS CALCULATED ALLOWING FOR THE
           FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS
               THE ANGLE OF EMISSION OF THE NEUTRON
               THE EXISTENCE OF TWO GROUPS OF NEUTRON ENERGIES
           DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR IONS IN
           THE DEUTERON BEAM THAT IS NOT ANALYZED
               THE ENERGY SPREAD DUE TO THE PROFILE OF THE
           TRITIUM IN THE TITANIUM LAYER
               THE ENERGY SPREAD DUE TO THE FINAL ANGULAR
           APERTURES SPANNED BY THE BEAM SPOT AND SAMPLES
           DIMENSIONS

ANALYSIS   THE METHOD OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY DETERMINATION BY
           USING OF THE CROSS SECTION RATIO MEASUREMENT WAS
           TESTED FOR SOME THRESHOLD REACTIONS

COMMENT    THE RESULTS OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY
           BY USING THE ABOVE RATIO WERE NEITHER CONSISTENT NOR
           REPRODUCIBLE. THE REASON FOR THAT IS APPARENTLY DUE TO
           THE LARGE SENSITIVITY OF THE ANNIHILATION PROCESS OF
           B+ USED TO DETERMINE CU-63(N,2N) CROSS SECTION ON THE
           SPATIAL ARRANGEMENTS OF MASSES DURING THE MEASUREMENTS
