TITLE      The fission neutron spectrum from the spontaneous
           fission of Cf-252
METHOD     (TOF). Flight distance = 3 m
DETECTOR   (FISCH). As start signal
           (SCIN) NE102 plastic scintillator for neutrons,
                  as stop signal
CORRECTION Data corrected for
              .time-dependent and independent backgrounds
              .dead-time
              .neutron detection efficiencies

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error includes statistical and systematical
           errors, in particular
              .accuracy of meas.of flight path (about 1 mm),
           (ERR-1) accuracy of timing calibration (0.25%)
           (ERR-2) error contribution due to accuracy of

ANALYSIS   Experimental spectrum was fitted to Maxwellian.
           No systematic deviations from Maxwellian shape were
           found between 1 and 13 MeV. Between 1 and 6 MeV
           experimental data are consistent with the Maxwellian
           shape to better than +- 2%.
           The Maxwellian temperatures found from 6 experimental
           runs are (in MeV)
               1.4096 +- 0.0047   (statistical error)
               1.4262 +- 0.0034
               1.4410 +- 0.0044
               1.4140 +- 0.0041
               1.4150 +- 0.0061
               1.4513 +- 0.0075
           The weighted average of these values is 1.424 +- 0.010.
           The average kinetic energy is = T * 3/2.
COMMENT    According to private communication by Boldeman 1981,
           the measurements in the low-energy region from 0.1 to
           1 MeV have not yet been fully evaluated but seem to
           show no significant deviation from the Maxwellian
           shape.
