ANALYSIS   EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRUM WAS FITTED TO MAXWELLIAN.
           NO SYSTEMATIC DEVIATIONS FROM MAXWELLIAN SHAPE WERE
           FOUND BETWEEN 1 AND 13 MEV. BETWEEN 1 AND 6 MEV
           EXPERIMENTAL DATA ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MAXWELLIAN
           SHAPE TO BETTER THAN +- 2 PERCENT.
           THE MAXWELLIAN TEMPERATURES FOUND FROM 6
           EXPERIMENTAL RUNS ARE (IN MEV)
               1.4096 +- 0.0047   (STATISTICAL ERROR)
               1.4262 +- 0.0034
               1.4410 +- 0.0044
               1.4140 +- 0.0041
               1.4150 +- 0.0061
               1.4513 +- 0.0075
           THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THESE VALUES IS 1.424 +- 0.010.
           THE AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY IS = T * 3/2.
COMMENT    ACCORDING TO PRIVATE COMMUNICATION BY BOLDEMAN 1981,
           THE MEASUREMENTS IN THE LOW-ENERGY REGION FROM 0.1 TO
           1 MEV HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY EVALUATED BUT SEEM TO
           SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM THE MAXWELLIAN
           SHAPE.
