TITLE      Absolute measurements of U-235 and Pu-239 fission
           cross section induced by 14.7 MeV neutrons
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 220.keV deuterons
SAMPLE     Fissile material electrodeposited on platinum backings.
           The method of direct weighing,alpha counting in a low
           solid angle equipment and titration for U-235 sample
           and alpha counting technique and the constant current
           Coulomb method for Pu-239 sample were used to determine
           the quantity of fissile material in a sample.
           The nonuniformity of the deposited layer was tested
           by alpha counting through small diaphragm.
METHOD     (ASSOP) Associated particle method with time-
           correlation technique
DETECTOR   (FISCH) Cylindrical fission ionization chamber
           100.mm in diameter,50.mm in length filled with
           methan of one atmosphere, composed of two identical
           halves for registration of fission fragments
           (SCIN) Thin film scintillation counter for
           registration of alpha-particles produced in
           T(d,n)He-4 reaction and placed in the direction
           135.Ang-deg. With respect to the incident neutron
           beam.Pulses from registration of protons from parasitic
           reaction D(d,p)T have been subtracted. The proton
           yield did not exceed 1 per-cent of the alphas

CORRECTION Correction at the attenuation of neutron flux was
           calculated according to transmission consideration
           and was equal 2.68 Per-cent
           correction at the fission events due to the other
           isotopes contained in the samples was calculated
           according to the isotope composition and was 5.92
           per-cent for U-235 and 3.00 Per-cent for Pu-239
           corrections at the factors reducing the efficiency
           of fission detector
