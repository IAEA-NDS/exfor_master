TITLE      THE ND-143(N,A)CE-140 REACTION WITH 2 KEV NEUTRONS
FACILITY   (REAC) VVR-S REACTOR.
            N-FLUX =(2.4+-0.4)*E+6, AT 6MW.
INC-SOURCE FILTERED BEAM.   FILTER OF PURE METALLIC SCANDIUM.
INC-SPECT  QUASI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON BEAM WITH A MEAN ENERGY OF
           2KEV AND A DISTRIBUTION HALF-WIDTH OF 900 EV.
SAMPLE     DEPOSITING 19.8 MG OF ND(2)-O(3),(ENRICHED TO 83.2 PERC
            IN ND-143 ISOTOPE), ON A 15 MICRO-M THICK AL FOIL.
METHOD     (PHD)
            THE ALPHA SPECTRUM WAS ACCUMULATED DURING 590 HOURS
            WITH THE FILTERED NEUTRON BEAM.
DETECTOR   (SOLST)
              A PARTIALLY DEPLETED DETECTOR WITH 100MICRON
             DEPLETION DEPTH AND SENSITIVE AREA OF 800MM2.
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG,,,DERIV)  =3.23B AT 2KEV.
           THE VALUE WAS OBTAINED BY EXTRAPOLATION OF THE MEASURED
           THERMAL CROSS-SECTION ACCORDING TO 1/V LAW.  YU.P.POPOV
