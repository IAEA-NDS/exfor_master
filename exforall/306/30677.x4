           Research Institute of Physics,Budapest and

ANALYSIS   Experimentally measured K0-factors and evaluated values
           for isotopic abundance and absolute gamma-intensities
           were used for determination 2200 m/sec cross-sections.
           Theoretical definition of K0 relative Au cross-section
           is K0=m(Au)*t*S0*g/(m*t(Au)*S0(Au)*g(Au)),where
               m-atomic weight,t-isotopic abundance,S0- 2200 m/sec
               (n,g) cross-section,g-absolute gamma-ray-intensity
           Experimental K0 value is
           K0=asp/asp(Au)*(F+q0(Au))/(F+q0)*Ep(Au)/Ep,where
               asp-specific count rate,F-thermal (subcadmium) to
               epithermal neutron flux ratio,q0-resonance integral
               to 2200 m/sec cross-section ratio corrected for
               non-ideal epithermal flux distribution,Ep-full
               energy peak detection efficiency.(Au) means
               respective value for Au-197 standard
