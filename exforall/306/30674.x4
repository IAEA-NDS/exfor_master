REACTION   (66-DY-162(N,P)65-TB-162,,SIG)
SAMPLE      Dy(2)-O(3) and Fe(2)-O(3) mixed homogeneously
            Samples were prepared with different Dy to Fe ratios
            and weights of 200 and 500 mg, respectively.

           interpolation with the results of Ryves and Kolkowski

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Following uncertainties were
                      taken into account:
           -Neutron flux monitor in reaction cross section
           -Gamma-ray peak areas
           -Detector efficiency calibration
           -Self-absorption in the samples
           The uncertainties in the sample weight determination
           and those due to mixing of the monitor and samples
           were negligible.
           Error due to uncertainties in the decay characteristics
           of the investigated nuclides were not taken into
           account.
