TITLE      Charge distribution in the spontaneous fission of
           252Cf. Determination of fractional cumulative yields
           of 138Xe and 139Cs
SAMPLE     7 microgram 252Cf sample, prepared by
           electrodeposition on platinum planchet.
METHOD     Fission fragments collected on catcher foil or pellet
           the collection time varied from 5 to 10 min
DETECTOR   (GELI) 60 c.c.Ge(Li) detector
ANALYSIS   Solution of the decay equations for isobaric decay
           chains
MONITOR    Absolute measurements
PART-DET   (DG) Gammas after beta-decay
STATUS     Data from table 1 of the first reference
HISTORY    (19820701C) Data compiled by VP.

METHOD     (REC) Aluminium catcher foil was used for collecting
           the fission products

           measurements

           (55-CS-138-M,2.9MIN,DG,79.9,0.81) was used for
           analysis.
COMMENT    The ratio of the independent yields for 138mCs to
           138gCs to take into account the partial decay
           of 138Xe through 138mCs was taken 1.3 (see D.C.

ADD-RES    A value of 54.28 for the most probable charge for
           mass 139 is obtained from this experiment and a cor-
           rected (for independent yield of 139Ba) value of 0.67
           for the fractional cumulative yield of 139Xe based on
           the value from A.C. Wahl et al., Phys.Rev.126,1112,1962
           the value of the sigma parameter describing of the
           charge distribution obtained from experiment is 0.59
CORRECTION All activities were corrected for chemical yield in
           barium precipitation
