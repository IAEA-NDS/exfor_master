TITLE      DIFFERENTIAL ELASTIC SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS OF
           SULPHUR FOR 14.8 MEV NEUTRONS BY SURFACE OF REVOLUTION
           TECHNIQUE
INC-SOURCE (D-T) DEUTERON-TRITIUM
SAMPLE     THE SCATTERER IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE SHAPE OF A SURFACE
           OF REVOLUTION OBTAINED BY ROTATING THE ARC OF A CIRCLE
           PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRES OF TRITIUM TARGET AND
           DETECTOR. THE DIRECT BEAM FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
           DETECTOR IS ELIMINATED BY A PROPERLY SHAPED BEAM
           STOPPER
METHOD     SEE EXPLANATION UNDER SAMPLE AND DETECTOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN) SMALL SPHERICAL RECOIL PROTON PLASTIC
           SCINTILLATOR WITH DISCRIMINATION OF ELASTICALLY
           SCATTERED NEUTRONS FROM INELASTICALLY SCATTERED ONES
