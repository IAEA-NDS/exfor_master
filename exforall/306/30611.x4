TITLE      Differential elastic scattering cross sections of
           sulphur for 14.8 MeV neutrons by surface of revolution
           technique
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron-tritium
SAMPLE     The scatterer is distributed in the shape of a surface
           of revolution obtained by rotating the arc of a circle
           passing through the centres of tritium target and
           detector. The direct beam from the source to the
           detector is eliminated by a properly shaped beam
           stopper
METHOD     See explanation under SAMPLE and DETECTOR
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Small spherical recoil proton plastic
           scintillator with discrimination of elastically
           scattered neutrons from inelastically scattered ones
STATUS     (TABLE,APRVD) Numerical data were received from
           A.Chatterjee (19810610), approved.
