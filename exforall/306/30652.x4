TITLE      Cross section determination of the (n,a) reactions for
           the average weight nuclei in neutron energy region
           about 3 MeV by activation analysis method
AUTHOR     (G.Helfer,U.Jahn,M.Florek,J.Oravec,I.Sarka)
INSTITUTE  (2GERDRE) The first two authors
           (3SLKUB )The last three authors.
REFERENCE  (J,CZJ/B,34,30,1984) Final data
           (C,82SMOLEN,383,1982)
           (S,ZFK-459,150,198109) Preliminary data
           (C,79SMOLENIC,103,197906) Preliminary results. Only
           upper limits of the cross sections are given
MONITOR    (49-IN-115(N,INL)49-IN-115-M,,SIG) The decay data which
           authors used for flux determination are not given
           (16-S-32(N,P)15-P-32,,SIG) The decay data and cross
           section values which authors used for flux
           determination are not given.
           Yield of protons from neutron source due to the
           associa ted reaction D(d,p)T was used also for neutron
           flux determination.
           All three methods of neutron flux determination
           gave consistent results.
FACILITY   Description of the high sensitive and low background
           spectrometer is given by M.Florek et al.Physics and
           Applications,vol.6,(1980),103.
INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutron generator of TU Dresden with yield of
           5*10**8 neutrons/sec/4pi ster.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
INC-SPECT  Average energy and energy resolution were calculated
           with taking into account the geometry of experiment
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,PROPC) Two proportional counters placed
           between two scintillation counters
CORRECTION It was found that it is possible to neglect by
           contribution from (n,a) reaction caused by 14 MeV
           neutrons from T(d,n) reaction from tritium accumulated
           at the deuterium target as well as by contribution
           from slow neutrons
STATUS     Numerical data were taken from the first reference
HISTORY    (19830422C) VP.
           (19840221A) Numerical data in subentries 2 and 3 were
           corrected on those taken from the first reference
           (19890717U) VOF- Reference added + inst. code corrected
           (20040311U) SD:changed to 4-dig. year and lower case
