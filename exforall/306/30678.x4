INC-SOURCE (P-T) Neutron flux was of the order of 10**7 n/cm2/s
METHOD     (ACTIV) Samples were placed between two standard
                   samples of KI of similar size to get the
                   average neutron flux.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Ge(Li) detector (FWHM of 2keV at 1.33MeV) 50 cm3
PART-DET   (DG)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Following sources of uncertainties were taken
                   into account:
           -Systematic errors
           (ERR-1) Fluctuation in the proton-beam current +-6%
           (ERR-2,2.,6.) Detection efficiency of Ge(Li)
                                                   detector 2-6%
           (ERR-3,0.5,2.) Self-absorption of gamma-rays in the
                              samples between 0.5 and 2%
           (ERR-4) Estimation of the number of nuclei, less than
              +-0.3%. The weighing was done up to an
              accuracy of 0.01 mg
           (ERR-5) Non-reproducibility of the geometries at
                   the times of irradiation and counting +-2%
           (ERR-6,1.,5.) Integration of the pulse-height spectrum,
                               1 - 5%
           (ERR-7) Pulse-summing effect less than 0.2%
           (ERR-8) Various measurements of the standard reaction
              cross-section had an uncertainty of about 7%
           (ERR-S,1.,10.) Statistical errors in the counts under
                          the photopeaks between +-1 and +-10%
            * Error in the decay properties were not taken into
            account.
           (EN-ERR) Total neutron-energy spread 200-150 keV from:
            1. Energy spread in the proton beam 20 keV
            2. Degradation of incident beam in the T target
              210 to 140 keV for a proton-beam energy of between
              1 and 3 MeV. The corresponding neutron-energy spread
              lies between 190 and 130 keV
            3. Angle subtended by the sample at the neutron source
              22 - 55 keV.
