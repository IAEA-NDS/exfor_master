COMMENT    The spin-cut-off parameter for fermi-gas level
           density model was derived from isomer ratio values.
            the derived values as ratios to rigid-body
            values are
              91Mo      0.98
              89Zr      0.87
              85Sr      0.90
              74Se      0.87
           Isomer ratios were measured for (g,n) reaction
           at microtron with maximum energy of bremsestrahlung
           spectrum 14.5 MeV. the values are
              target nucleus    isom.ratio
                 92Mo             1.54+-0.15
                 90Zr             1.52+-0.04
                 86Sr             0.70+-0.07
                 74Se             7.5 +-1.0
            The calculations of isomer ratio in case of 74Se
           have supported the scheme IG=9/2+ ,IM=3/2-

           It was measured the decay curve of the 34-Se-73-G
           which included the curve of Se-73-G decay formed
           directly after (n,2n) reaction plus decays of Se-74-G
           formed after internal gamma transitions from Se-74-M1
           state to Se-74-G state and then equation of the
           decay was solved relative isomer ratio
