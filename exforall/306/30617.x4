TITLE      Isomer ratio and cross-section for the
           Ge-74 (n,2n) Ge-73-m reaction at 14.4 MeV

INSTITUTE  (3INDPOO)
REFERENCE  (J,RRL,49,(3),199,198110)
SAMPLE     Five samples of mixed uniformly pure (99.9%)
           powders of germanium and PbO with ratios on weight
           of metal Ge/Pb as 1 to 1,2 to 1,2 to 1.5,3 to 1
           and 2 to 3. Total weight of each sample was about
           100 mg.
FACILITY   (CCW)
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 14-MeV neutron generator with a flux of
           2.*10**8 neutrons/cm**2/sec
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method with characteristic times for
           one cycle, using fast pneumatic transfer system:
               Irradiation 1.5 sec
               Transfer (including cooling) 0.2 sec
               Counting time 1.5 sec
               Waiting time 5.sec
           and 100 cycles for each sample
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3.inch*3.inch NaI(Tl) detector
ANALYSIS   Usual solution for equation of decay with taking
           into account of self-absorption correction
CORRECTION Self-absorption correction was introduced
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Total error that includes uncertainties in
               estimating photopeak area
               relative detection efficiency
               sample weighting
               self-absorption
               timing
COMMENT    Theoretical evaluations of isomer production cross-
           section is given in paper
