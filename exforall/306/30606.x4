TITLE      Excitation of the U-238-m shape isomer by neutron
           bombardement
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Deuteron on tritium
SAMPLE     Deposited over a circular area of 1.5 cm diam. on a
           stainless steel disc which was mounted at the center
           of a circular sheet of plastic trac detector -macrofol-
DETECTOR   (TRD) Plastic track detectors. Efficiency of the
           detectors was calculated by numerical integration.
           Decay in flight, effect of slowing down of recoils in
           the target and limitation on the grazing angle have
           been taken into account.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from p.1630 of publication
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Same authors published same result
           in 1977, see report BARC-978, p.26 (EXFOR 30440.002).
           It is not clear whether these are two separate
           measurements.

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Includes all the uncertainties in the
           track detection and geometrical efficiency
