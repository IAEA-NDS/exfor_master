TITLE      -DELAYED FISSION FOR THE U-238(N,N)U-238-M1
            REACTION AT 14.5 MEV NEUTRON ENERGY-
INC-SOURCE (D-T) DEUTERON ON TRITIUM
SAMPLE     DEPOSITED OVER A CIRCULAR AREA OF 1.5 CM DIAM.ON A
           STAINLESS STEEL DISC WHICH WAS MOUNTED AT THE CENTER
           OF A CIRCULAR SHEET OF PLASTIC TRAC DETECTOR -MACROFOL-
DETECTOR   (TRD) PLASTIC TRAC DETECTORS-EFFICIENCY OF THE
           DETECTORS WAS CALCULATED BY NUMERICAL INTEGRATION.
           DECAY IN FLIGHT,EFFECT OF SLOWING DOWN OF RECOILS IN
           THE TARGET AND LIMITATION ON THE GRAZING ANGLE HAVE
           BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
STATUS     DATA WERE TAKEN FROM P.1630 OF PUBLICATION
