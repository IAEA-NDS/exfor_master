TITLE      Isomer ratio and activation cross section for the
           Ba-137(n,2n)Ba-136-m reaction at 14.4 MeV
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron generator with flux 5*10**8 n/cm2/sec
SAMPLE     Five samples prepared by mixing uniformly pure (99.9%)
           powders of BaOo and PbO in the ratios 1 to 1,
           2 to 1, 2 to 1.5, 3 to 1, 2 to 3. Each powder mixture
           with weight about 0.1 g was sealed in polyethylene
           container of about 6.mm in diameter and 20.mm length
METHOD     (MOMIX) Activation method with typical activation
           cycle
               Irradiation - 1.sec
               Transfer (including cooling time) - 0.15 sec
               Counting time - 1.sec
               Waiting time - 5.sec
           Fast pneumatic transfer system was developed
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3.*3.inch NaI(Tl) detector coupled with
           4096-channel analyzer
ANALYSIS   The solution of the radiation decay equation with
           number of counts evaluated after substracting of
           background activity, smoothing the spectrum and
           Gaussian function fitting
STATUS     (TABLE) Data were taken from Table 1 of the reference
HISTORY    (19830530C) VP.
           (20090725A) SD:Updated to new date formats,lower case.
CORRECTION The correction due to self-absorption in the sample
           and dead time correction are neglected because of the
           small size of the sample and low count rate

COMMENT    It was assumed that contribution from (n,inel) reaction
           to the formation of Ba-136-m in natural mixture of
           barium isotopes for 14.MeV neutrons was negligible
