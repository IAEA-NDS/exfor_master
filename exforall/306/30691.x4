TITLE      THE MEASUREMENT OF ABSOLUTE FISSION PRODUCT YIELD FOR
           SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF CF-252
SAMPLE     CF-252 SOURCE,DIAMETER 8MM,WEIGHT ABOUT 0.3 MICRO-GRAM,
           ELECTROPLATED ON A 0.1MM THICK PLATINUM FOIL,COATED
           WITH A 15 MICRO-GRAM/CM2 VYNS LAYER.
METHOD     FISSION PRODUCTS COLLECTED ON ALUMINIUM CATCHER FOIL
           IN 0.374 PI GEOMETRY. THE COLLECTION EFFICIENCY
           WAS DETERMINED EXPERIMENTALLY. MEASUREMENT OF FISSION
           PRODUCT ACTIVITY BY GAMMA COUNTING.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 130 CM3 CO-AXIAL GE(LI) DETECTOR(FWHM 1.85KEV AT
           1332.5KEV) TOGETHER WITH A SCORPIO-3000 MULTICHANNEL
           ANALYSIS COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR GAMMA RAY MEASUREMENTS.
           GAMMA-RAY STANDARD SOURCES USED FOR DETECTOR ENERGY AND
           EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION WERE AM-241, ND-147, CE-144,
           CE-141, MO-99, AG-111, NA-22, CS-137, ZR-95, SC-46,
           CO-60, TA-182, EU-152.
           2 DIFFERENT GEOMETRIES WITH DIFFERENT EFFICIENCY(SOURCE
            DETECTOR DISTANCES 2 CM AND 6 CM RESPECTIVELY) WERE
           USED.
ANALYSIS   AUTOMATED ON-LINE GAMMA-SPECTRUM ANALYSIS AND PEAK AREA
