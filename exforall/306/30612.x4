INC-SOURCE (D-T) MONOENERGETIC D-T NEUTRONS.E-DEUT=120.KEV
METHOD     (ACTIV) SIGMA DETERMINED FROM ABSOLUTE VALUES OF
           NEUTRON FLUX AND POSITRON ACTIVITY OF IRRADIATED
           SAMPLE
INC-SPECT  THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED AT THREE DIFFERENT

           ANGLES WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT DEUTRON BEAM
DETECTOR   (SCIN) PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR 1.25 CM IN HEIGHT AND
           2.5 CM IN RADIUS WAS USED FOR N-FLUX MEASUREMENT
