TITLE      Relative yields of stable tellurium isotopes in neutron
           induced fission
FACILITY   (REAC,3AULAUA) Hifar reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum.
           Thermal neutron flux exceeds 1.x10**13 n/cm2/s (details
                    for individual samples in subentries 2 and 3)
           Fast neutron flux less than 4.x10**11 n/cm2/s
           The fast neutron fission rate was less than 0.01%
           of the thermal fission rate for all samples.
SAMPLE     U3O8,purified as follows. Samples were first dissolved
           in 6m HCl with a minimum of nitric acid, evaporated to
           dryness and redissolved in 6 m HCl. In order to remove
           any possible Te contamination, the solution was placed
           on a small anion exchange column (dowex Ag1-x8), the
           uranium eluted with 2m HCl and the eluant collected
           directly into small, long-necked quartz vials. The
           samples were slowly evaporated to dryness and the vials
           were then sealed under vacuum.
METHOD     Chemical separation of tellurium from other species.
           Mass-separation by a solid source mass spectrometer
           with Re-filament (thermal ionization technique).

COMMENT    Uncorrected individual results for 3 samples, yields
           are given relative to that of Te-130.
FLAG       (1.)Since Sn-126 has a half-life of about 1.E5 years
               its decay can be neglected. Therefore the
               measured yield of Te-126 is practically the
               sum of independent yields of Sb-126 and Te-126.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 2 of first reference
CORRECTION The data are not corrected for mass discrimination and
           decay.

STATUS     (TABLE)
           (DEP,30650002) Weighted average of corrected data
           the statistical error is taken from Table 2 of the
           first reference, all other data from Table 3.
CORRECTION A mass discrimination of 0.625% per mass unit
           was used to correct the data given in subentry 2, based
           on a value of 0.68% per mass unit determined
           earlier for cadmium isotopes (see Rosman and de Laeter,
           Int.J.Mass Spectrom.Ion Phys. 16(1975)385).
           The Te-125 data were corrected for radioactive trans-
           formations in the mass 125 decay chain. No details are
           given.Only a half-life of 2.7 years for Sb-125 is given
           in the text.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical error of the weighted average
                   of the raw data,except for Te-125 where no
                   weighted average was taken, given as 2 sigma
                   (see compiler's note below)
           (ERR-T) The total error,given as 2 sigma. It includes
                   the uncertainty in the estimated correction
                   factor for mass discrimination.
                   For Te-125 the uncertainty of the corrections
                   for the decay of precursors is also included,
                   but no details are given.
           Compiler's note - The assumed 2 sigma nature of the
           statistical error was confirmed by the author.
