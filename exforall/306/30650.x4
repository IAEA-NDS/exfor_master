TITLE      RELATIVE YIELDS OF STABLE TELLURIUM ISOTOPES IN NEUTRON
           INDUCED FISSION
FACILITY   (REAC,3AULAUA) HIFAR REACTOR
INC-SPECT  THERMAL REACTOR SPECTRUM.
           THERMAL NEUTRON FLUX EXCEEDS  1.E13 N/CM2/S (DETAILS
                    FOR INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES IN SUBENTRIES 2 AND 3)
           FAST NEUTRON FLUX LESS THAN 4.E11 N/CM2/S
           THE FAST NEUTRON FISSION RATE WAS LESS THAN 0.01 PERC
           OF THE THERMAL FISSION RATE FOR ALL SAMPLES.
SAMPLE     U3O8,PURIFIED AS FOLLOWS.SAMPLES WERE FIRST DISSOLVED
           IN 6M HCL WITH A MINIMUM OF NITRIC ACID,EVAPORATED TO
           DRYNESS AND REDISSOLVED IN 6 M HCL. IN ORDER TO REMOVE
           ANY POSSIBLE TE CONTAMINATION, THE SOLUTION WAS PLACED
           ON A SMALL ANION EXCHANGE COLUMN (DOWEX AG1-X8),THE
           URANIUM ELUTED WITH 2M HCL AND THE ELUANT COLLECTED
           DIRECTLY INTO SMALL, LONG-NECKED QUARTZ VIALS. THE
           SAMPLES WERE SLOWLY EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND THE VIALS
           WERE THEN SEALED UNDER VACUUM.
METHOD     CHEMICAL SEPARATION OF TELLURIUM FROM OTHER SPECIES.
           MASS-SEPARATION BY A SOLID SOURCE MASS SPECTROMETER
           WITH RE-FILAMENT (THERMAL IONIZATION TECHNIQUE).
