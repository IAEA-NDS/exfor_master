ANALYSIS   The collection efficiency for Kr and Xe were checked by
           measuring the activities of I-135 and Xe-135 (trapped
           in different columns) and was found almost 100%.
           Gamma spectra were analysed and fission yields
           calculated from genetic relationships in beta-decay
           mass chains using relevant decay data.
DECAY-DATA Precursor data for Kr isotopes are neglected

           A=133. TE-133-G and I-133-M ignored. Data for genetic
               relationships were taken from S.Spirodon, J.Inorg.

               (1976)243.
           ((5.)53-I-135,6.7HR) Branching to Xe-135-m = 0.155
                                          to Xe-135-m = 0.845
           ((5.)54-XE-135-M,15.7MIN,DG,527.,0.80)
               Internal transition to Xe-135-g given as 0.75 (see
               Compiler's Comment)
           ((5.)54-XE-135-G,9.14HR,DG,250.,0.92)
           Compiler's comment: The internal transition of 0.75 for
           Xe-135-m contradicts the gamma-ray abundance of 0.80.

           taken from M.E.Meek and B.F.Rider, NEDO-12154 (1972)
MISC-COL   (MISC) Number of determinations
FLAG       (1.) Reference yield value.
           (2.) Cumulative yield of both isomers together.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Table 2 of first reference.
CORRECTION Chemical yield, counting geometry and neutron flux were
           regarded as common factors and no corrections applied.
           Corrections were applied for detector efficiency and
           for decay.
           For mass chains 133 and 135 the growth and decay of
           precursors was also considered.
           Compiler's comment: It is assumed that the authors'
           statement 'Since the time elapsed from the end of
           irradiation to the time of target dissolution is 15 min
           or longer, no decay correction for Kr85m is necessary'
           refers to its precursors.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Quoted uncertainties are one standard
           deviation based on the agreement between replicates.
           The uncertainty for the reference fission yield of
               Kr-85-m is 12% relative, but not included in
               the error given in the data Table.
           Compilers comment:  No information is given whether the
               uncertainties of corrections (efficiency,decay) is
               included in the quoted errors.
