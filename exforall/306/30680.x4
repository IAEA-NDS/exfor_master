TITLE      Decay of the new 2.5 min Pt-201
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) Reactor APSARA at Trombay
INC-SPECT  Neutrons of fission spectrum
SAMPLE     Natural mercury, 1.to 2.g in form of HgO
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method. Time of irradiation was
           equal 3.min, time of platinum fraction separation was
           equal 5.min
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3.in.dia*3.in. coupled to a Dumont 6363 photo-
           multiplier and a 512 channel pulse-height analyser.
ANALYSIS   2.5 min half-life of the 78-Pt-201 decay was obtained
           in this experiment
