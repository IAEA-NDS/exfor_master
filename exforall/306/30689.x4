TITLE      Measurement of the neutron radiative capture cross-
           section of Au-197 at 30 keV.
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
SAMPLE      99.9% gold; thickness = 0.03 cm,diam. = 1.9 cm.
METHOD     (ACTIV) Be-7 activity is used as reference.
           .Neutron flux was determined by measuring produced Be-7
           in Li-F target. (478 keV gamma of Be-7).
           .Using gamma standard sources, Au-198,Cs-137,Mn-56,
            Sc-46 and Na-24 as detector efficiency calibration,
            15.65% detector efficiency was obtained for
           Be-7 detection.
           .4Pi-beta coincidence was used for Au-198 activity
            measurement, and its detection efficiency was 38.87%
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  7.5cm dia. * 7.5 cm long, NaI(Tl) detector
           (BF3) for 7Be activity measurement
MONITOR    Absolute.  See 'METHOD'.
STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from Chinese J.Nucl.Phys.,6(1984)23.
CORRECTION Corrected for neutron scattering and attenuation in the
           target and sample.
           Detail is given in the text.
