TITLE      -MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRON RADIATIVE CAPTURE CROSS-
           SECTION OF AU-197 AT 30 KEV.-
FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRAEP)
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)
SAMPLE      99.9PERC. GOLD. THICKNESS = 0.03 CM,DIAM. = 1.9 CM.
METHOD     (ACTIV)
           BE-7 ACTIVITY IS USED AS REFERENCE.
           .NEUTRON FLUX WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING PRODUCED BE-7
           IN LI-F TARGET. (478 KEV GAMMA OF BE-7).
           .USING GAMMA STANDARD SOURCES, AU-198,CS-137,MN-56,SC-
            46 AND NA-24 AS DETECTOR EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION,
            15.65 PERCENT DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS OBTAINED FOR
           BE-7 DETECTION.
           .4PI-BETA COINCIDENCE WAS USED FOR AU-198 ACTIVITY
            MEASUREMENT, AND ITS DETECTION EFFICIENCY WAS 38.87
            PERCENT.
DETECTOR   (NAICR)  7.5CM DIA. * 7.5 CM LONG WELL TYPE NAI(TL)
           DETECTOR
MONITOR    ABSOLUTE.  SEE 'METHOD'.
STATUS     DATA TAKEN FROM CHINESE J.NUCL.PHYS.,6(1984)23.
HISTORY    (841212C) KO.-
CORRECTION CORRECTED FOR NEUTRON SCATTERING AND ATTENUATION IN THE
           TARGET AND SAMPLE.
