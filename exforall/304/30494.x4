TITLE      TFSD response to fragments from light charged particle
            accompanied fission of 236U
AUTHOR     (N.N.Ajitanand, K.N.Iyengar, S.R.S.Murthy)
INSTITUTE  (3INDTRM)
REFERENCE  (C,77PUNE,2,241,1977)
SAMPLE     235U (250 ug/cm2 thick) electrodeposited on Al foil
            (6 mg/cm2)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE Collimated thermal beam
METHOD     Binary and ternary fission measured simultaneously,
            processed in different parts of multichannel analyzer.
DETECTOR   (SI) for long range charged particles
           (SCIN) Thin film scintillation detector (TFSD) for
            fission fragments
ANALYSIS   Most probable masses, element numbers and energies of
            fragments from binary fission were used for
            calibration of the light pulses which the ternary
            fission fragments produced in the scintillation
            detector.

           (PRELM) Final results awaiting experimental
            determination of detector response functions.
