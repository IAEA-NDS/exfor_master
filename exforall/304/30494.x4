REFERENCE  (C,77PUNE,2,241,1977)
SAMPLE     235U (250 ug/cm2 thick) electrodeposited on Al foil
            (6 mg/cm2)
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SOURCE Collimated thermal beam, 5*10**7 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     Binary and ternary fission measured simultaneously,
            processed in different parts of multichannel analyzer.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) for long range charged particles
           (SCIN) Thin film scintillation detector (TFSD) for
            fission fragments
ANALYSIS   Most probable masses, element numbers and energies of
            fragments from binary fission were used for
            calibration of the light pulses which the ternary
            fission fragments produced in the scintillation
            detector.
            Energy of the binary fragments:
             LF: 100.42 MeV, HF: 69.91 MeV
            Energy of the light charged partivle accompanied
            fission fragments: LF: 92.32 MeV, HF: 64.77 MeV

           (PRELM) Final results awaiting experimental
            determination of detector response functions.
