TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF THE CROSS-SECTION OF CL-37(N,P)S-37
           REACTION FOR FISSION NEUTRONS.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC) RESEARCH REACTOR AT INSTITUT FUER KERNFORSCHUNG
           U. KERN ENERGETIK, SOFIA.  N-FLUX = 4.E+12 N/SEC/CM2.
INC-SPECT  THE FLUX RATIO OF THERMAL TO FISSION NEUTRONS,F(T)/F(S)
           WAS DETERMINED TO BE ' 5.7 ' USING THE REACTIONS OF
           S-32(N,P)P-32 (=69 MB FOR FISSION NEUTRONS) AND
           P-31(N,G)P-32 (=190MB FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS),AND THEIR
           CADMIUM RATIOS, 1 AND 68, RESPECTIVELY.
SAMPLE     150-200 MG NH(4)-CL, AND 150-300 MG (NH(4))*2-SO(4)
           AS SULPHUR STANDARD IN POLYETHYLEN CAPSULE.
METHOD     (CHSEP,MOMIX)
           NH(4)-CL WAS IRRADIATED 5 MIN WITH (NH(4))*2-SO(4).
           AFTER CHEMICAL SEPARATION, 3.13 MEV GAMMA PEAK FROM
           S-37 WAS MEASURED WITH GE(LI) DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 18 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR WITH DIDAC 4000 MULTI-
           CHANNEL ANALYZER.

           VA-V-100,VA-G-120 AND VA-G-24A,( VEB MESSELEKTRONIK,
           DRESDEN), FOR BETA COUNTER.
PART-DET   (DG,B-)
            DECAY GAMMA OF 3.13 MEV FROM S-37 AND
            B- OF P-32.
