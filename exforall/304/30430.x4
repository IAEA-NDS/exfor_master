FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL)
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two non-hydrogenous liquid scintillators.
           The efficiency of the detector is proportional to the
            total gamma-ray energy release and is independent of
            the nature of spectra.
           (GLASD) Thin (0.5 mm) Li-6 glass detector as the
            neutron flux monitor.
