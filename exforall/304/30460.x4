TITLE      DETERMINATION OF ABSOLUTE NEUTRON CAPTURE CROSS
           SECTIONS OF URANIUM-238 BY SPHERICAL SHELL TRANSMISSION
           MEASUREMENTS
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)
           (MICRT)
           'IBR-30' PULSED REACTOR WITH MICROTRON INJECTOR
INC-SOURCE (REAC) TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE WITH
           FACILITY WORKING IN 'REACTOR REGIME'. THE 'LINEAR
           ACCELERATOR REGIME' WAS USED FOR METHODICAL CHECKS ONLY
SAMPLE     SPHERICAL SHELL TARGETS (THICKNESS FROM 7.5 TO 55 MM)
           OF U-238 CONTAINING 0.35 PERCENT U-235
METHOD     SPHERICAL SHELL TRANSMISSION, INVERSE GEOMETRY
           (TOF)
DETECTOR   (PROPC) HE-3 PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS, CYLINDRICAL TUBE
             TYPE SNM-50. REACTOR-REGIME= BATTERY OF 10 COUNTERS
                         INJECTOR-REGIME= BATTERY OF 91 COUNTERS
ANALYSIS   SPHERICAL TRANSMISSIONS AS A FUNCTION OF THE CROSS
           SECTION WERE CALCULATED BY MONTE CARLO PROGRAMS.
           USING THIS CURVE AND THE EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION
           VALUE, THE CROSS SECTION WAS DETERMINED GRAPHICALLY.

             U, REACTOR, RECYCLYC AND SCATTERED NEUTRONS)
           -ABSORPTION IN THE DETECTOR
           -ANISOTROPY OF DETECTOR EFFICIENCY
           -INFLUENCE OF DETECTOR AND TARGET SUPPORTS
