TITLE      Determination of absolute neutron capture cross
           sections of uranium-238 by spherical shell transmission
           measurements
FACILITY   (REAC,4ZZZDUB)
           (MICRT)
           'IBR-30' pulsed reactor with microtron injector
INC-SOURCE (REAC) Transmission measurements were made with
           facility working in 'reactor regime'. The 'linear
           accelerator regime' was used for methodical checks only
SAMPLE     Spherical shell targets (thickness from 7.5 to 55 mm)
           of U-238 containing 0.35% U-235
METHOD     (SHELT) Spherical shell transmission, inverse geometry
           (TOF)
DETECTOR   (HE3SP) He-3 proportional counters, cylindrical tube
             type SNM-50. Reactor-regime= battery of 10 counters
                         Injector-regime= battery of 91 counters
ANALYSIS   Spherical transmissions as a function of the cross
           section were calculated by Monte Carlo programs.
           Using this curve and the experimental transmission
           value, the cross section was determined graphically.
MONITOR    Absolute measurement

CORRECTION Corrections and/or checks have been applied for
           -homogeneity and parallelity of neutron beam
           -background from different sources (room,spont.fiss.of
             U, reactor, recyclyc and scattered neutrons)
           -absorption in the detector
           -anisotropy of detector efficiency
           -influence of detector and target supports
           -influence of the U-235 content
           -multiple scattering and resonance-selfshielding
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical and systematical errors included

INC-SPECT  Effective incoming neutron spectrum (including energy
           dependence of detector efficiency) = prop. 1/E**1.4
           Data are corrected so that average cross sections given
           are valid for 1/E reactor spectrum.
           The energy boundaries correspond to  'ABBN'
           energy groups.
