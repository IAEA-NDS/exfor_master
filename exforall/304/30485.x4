ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error consists of:
            * the statistical error,
            * the uncertainty of neutron flux,
            * the error of Ge(Li) detector efficiency,
            * the error of the sample weight
            * the uncertainty in reference cross sections.
           .The neutron energy spreads were calculated with a
           Monte Carlo method using the computer code 'LOS'.
