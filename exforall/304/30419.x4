TITLE      -DETERMINATION OF CROSS-SECTIONS OR SR-88(N,P)RB-88
           WITH FISSION NEUTRONS.-
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
           RESEARCH REACTOR AT INSTITUT FUER KERNFORSHUNG U. KERN-
           ENERGETIK, SOFIA.
           N-FLUX = 4.E+12 N/S/CM2.
INC-SPECT  THE RATIO OF THERMAL AND FAST COMPONENT IN THE NEUTRON
           FLUX WAS DETERMINED TO BE '' 5.7 '' USING THE REACTION
           OF S-32(N,P)P-32 ( = 69MB FOR FISSION NEUTRONS) AND
              P-31(N,G)P-32 ( = 190MB FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS) AND
           THEIR CD-RATIOS.(1 FOR S-32(N,P) AND 68 FOR P-31(N,G))
SAMPLE     SR-CO(3), 450 TO 500 MG, TOGETHER WITH RB-NO(3) OF 10
           TO 15 MG AS THE STANDARD SAMPLE.
METHOD     (CHSEP,MOMIX)
            (N,G) REACTION LEADING TO THE SAME RESIDUAL NUCLIDE
           WAS USED FOR COMPARISON.(SR-88(N,P)RB-88, RB-87(N,G)RB-
           88).
            AFTER IRRADIATION OF THE SAMPLE (SR-CO(3)) AND OF THE
           STANDARD (RB-NO(3)),RADIO-CHEMICAL SEPARATION WAS PER-
           FORMED.  AND THEN 899 AND 1837 KEV GAMMA PEAKS FROM
           RB-88 WERE MEASURED BY GE(LI) DETECTOR.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 18 CM3 GE(LI) DETECTOR.
ANALYSIS    THE CROSS-SECTION OF SR-88(N,P)RB-88 FOR FISSION-
           NEUTRONS, SIG(S),IS DEDUCED FROM THE FOLLOWING EQUATION
            SIG(S)=SIG(T)*(F(T)/F(S))*(1/P)*(R/(R-1))*(1/R'),
           WHERE
            SIG(T), (N,G) CROSS-SECTION FOR 'THERMAL' NEUTRONS,
            F(T)/F(S),  FLUX RATIO OF THERMAL TO FISSION NEUTRONS,
            P,  ISOTOPIC DISTURBING COEF. WHICH CAN BE DETERMINED
             IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE RELATIVE ACTIVITY OF TARGET
             AND STANDARD, (TO BE FOUND AS 15.9)
            R,  CADMIUM RATIO OF (N,G) REACTION (=3.84 RB-87(N,G))
            R', CADMIUM RATIO OF THRESHOLD REACTION (= 1 FOR
             SR-88(N,P)RB-88).
PART-DET   (DG) DECAY GAMMA OF 899-KEV AND 1837-KEV FROM RB-88.
