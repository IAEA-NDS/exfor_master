TITLE      Rapid radiochemical separation of radiogold from
           thallium target and existence of the nuclear reaction
           Tl-203(n,a)Au-200m.

REFERENCE  (J,RRL,30,(5/6),397,197709)
SAMPLE     Natural sample, 250 g of thallous-acetate in 800 ml
           aqueous solution.
FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNDEB) 150 keV neutron generator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation.
           After 1hr irradiation, the target solution was filtered
           through gold-coated filter.  In the course of the
           filteration, the radioactive gold isotopes were
           efficiently collected by isotope exchange onto the
           large gold surface of the filter, while thallium
           isotopes were not collected at all.
           The extraction yield (activity on filter/activity in
           target solution) for gold isotopes was of the order of
           magnitude 40 to 60%.
DETECTOR   (GELI) 100 cm3 Ge(Li) detector.
PART-DET   (DG) 368keV gamma from Au-200g(t(1/2)=48.4m) and
            Au-200m (T(1/2)=18.7 hr).

           Abundances of gamma are not given.  The half life of
           Au-200m was measured by the authors themselves as to be
                 T(1/2) = 19 +-2 hours.

COMMENT    Au-200m is a level of very high spin state,''12-''.
           and it is interesting that such high spin state can be
           produced by 14 MeV neutrons.
           Typical gamma lines from Au-200m decay are
           181.18, 255.87, 497.77, 579.29, 759.5 and 368 keV.

           .Half-life of 18.7hr for Au-200m is reported by
