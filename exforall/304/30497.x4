TITLE      YIELDS AND ENERGY SPECTRA OF LIGHT CHARGED PARTICLES
           EMITTED IN KEV-NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-235.
FACILITY   (VDG).2MV.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) NEUTRON-ENERGY SPREAD ABOUT 40KEV.
           (P-T) NEUTRON-ENERGY SPREAD ABOUT 160KEV.
SAMPLE     5 MG/CM2 U-235(ENRICHMENT=93.9 PC) FOIL,AREA=4 CM2.
METHOD     THE NATURAL ALFAS AND THE FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE
           STOPPED IN AN ALU-FOIL BEFORE REACHING THE LCP-
           DETECTOR.
           (COINC).OF FISSION FRAGMENTS AND LCP. AFTER EACH COINC-
           RUN,UNGATED LCP-SPECTRA WERE RECORDED IN ORDER TO
           DETERMINE CHANCE COINCIDENCES.
           BEFORE AND AFTER EACH FAST-NEUTRON RUN, THERMAL RUNS
           WERE PERFORMED TO CHECK THE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE AND
           FOR NORMALIZATION OF THE LCP-SPECTRA.
DETECTOR   (IOCH).FILLED WITH HIGH PURITY ARGON,PRESSURE=1.1 ATM.
           (SOLST).SURFACE-BARRIER,DEPLETION DEPTH 400MICRO-M,
           MOUNTED INSIDE THE IONIZ.CHAMBER.TO DETECT THE LIGHT
           CHARGED PARTICLES ('LCP').
ANALYSIS   A GAUSSIAN WAS FITTED BY LEAST SQUARES METHOD TO THE
           MEASURED SPECTRA BEYOND 12MEV. THE LCP-YIELDS ABOVE
           12MEV WERE ATTRIBUTED TO ALFA-PARTICLES ALONE. THE
           DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEASURED SPECTRA FROM 6.5 TO 12MEV
           AND GAUSSIAN WAS ASSUMED TO BE DUE TO TRITONS. THE
           QUOTED ALFA AND TRITON YIELDS -RELATIVE TO THERMAL-
           WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THIS ASSUMPTION.
MONITOR    LOW INTENSITY AM-241 AND NP-237 SOURCES WERE USED FOR
           ENERGY CALIBRATION.
STATUS     THE NUMERICAL DATA WERE COMMUNICATED FROM G.K.MEHTA.
HISTORY    (790712C) TL.
CORRECTION THE OBSERVED SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR CHANCE COINC.,
           THEN FOR ENERGY LOSSES IN THE SOURCE,GAS AND ALU-FOIL.
ERR-ANALYS NO DETAILS GIVEN.

INC-SPECT  THERMAL NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY PLACING A 5CM
           PARAFFINE BLOCK IN THE NEUTRON PATH.
