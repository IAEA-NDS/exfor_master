TITLE      Yields and energy spectra of light charged particles
           emitted in keV-neutron induced fission of U-235.
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDITK).2MV.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutron-energy spread about 40keV.
           (P-T) Neutron-energy spread about 160keV.
SAMPLE     5 mg/cm2 U-235(enrichment=93.9%) foil,area=4 cm2.
METHOD     The natural alfphas and the fission fragments were
           stopped in an alu-foil before reaching the LCP-
           detector.
           (COINC).of fission fragments and LCP. After each coinc-
           run, ungated LCP-spectra were recorded in order to
           determine chance coincidences.
           Before and after each fast-neutron run, thermal runs
           were performed to check the detector performance and
           for normalization of the LCP-spectra.
DETECTOR   (IOCH).Filled with high purity argon,pressure=1.1 atm.
           (SIBAR).Surface-barrier,depletion depth 400micro-m,
           mounted inside the ioniz.chamber.to detect the light
           charged particles ('LCP').
ANALYSIS   A Gaussian was fitted by least squares method to the
           measured spectra beyond 12MeV. The LCP-yields above
           12MeV were attributed to alpha-particles alone. The
           difference between measured spectra from 6.5 to 12MeV
           and Gaussian was assumed to be due to tritons. The
           quoted alpha and triton yields -relative to thermal-
           were obtained through this assumption.
MONITOR    Low intensity Am-241 and Np-237 sources were used for
           energy calibration.
STATUS     (TABLE) The numerical data were communicated
                                                from G.K.Mehta.
HISTORY    (19790712C) TL.
           (20090312A) SD:Updated to new date formats,lower case.
CORRECTION The observed spectra were corrected for chance coinc.,
           then for energy losses in the source,gas and alu-foil.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
