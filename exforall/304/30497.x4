INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons were produced by placing a 5 cm
           paraffine block in the neutron path.
           (P-LI7) Neutron-energy spread about 40 keV.
           (P-T) Neutron-energy spread about 160 keV.
           The average fission rate ~2.5 X 10**3 sec-1 and
           neutron flux was estimated about 5 X 10**7 n/cm2/sec.
SAMPLE     A 235U target (5 mg/cm2 thick, ~4 cm2 area).
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Filled with high purity argon, pressure of
           1.1 atm.
           (SIBAR) Surface-barrier, depletion depth 400 um,
           mounted inside the ionization chamber to detect the
           light charged particles ('LCP').
METHOD     The natural alphas and the fission fragments were
           stopped in an aluminum foil before reaching the
           LCP-detector.
           (COINC) After each coinc- run, ungated LCP-spectra
           were recorded in order to determine chance
           coincidences. Before and after each fast-neutron run,
           thermal runs were performed to check the detector
           performance and for normalization of the LCP-spectra.
ANALYSIS   A Gaussian was fitted by least squares method to the
           measured spectra beyond 12 MeV. The LCP-yields above
           12 MeV were attributed to alpha-particles alone.
           The difference between measured spectra from 6.5 to
           12 MeV and Gaussian was assumed to be due to tritons.
           The quoted alpha and triton yields relative to thermal
           were obtained through this assumption.
CORRECTION The observed spectra were corrected for chance coinc.,
           then for energy losses in the source, gas and aluminium
           foil.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information on source of uncertainties.
