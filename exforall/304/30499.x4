FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS-reactor
SAMPLE     200 micro-g/cm2 235U electrosprayed on VYNS-film.
            area=1 cm2.
METHOD     (COINC) Fragments and LRA for the ternary fission.
           Binary data were collected simultaneously.
           Fragment masses were calculated from the measured
            energies through the conservation of momentum. Thus,
            for the binary events a 2-dimensional fragment-mass
            and energy matrix, and for the ternary events a 3-
            dimensional fragment mas/fragment energy/LRA energy
            matrix was obtained.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Back-to-back gridded ionization chamber,filled
            with a mixture of argon (97pc) and methane (3pc),
            press=1.5 atm. The 235U source served as cathode,
            the two collector plates were formed of Al foils
            (3 mg/cm2).
           (SOLST) 2 semiconductor detectors were placed behind
            the collector windows, to detect LRA.
STATUS     (TABLE) Table 1 of Pramana 6(1976)64
CORRECTION LRA energies were corrected for the loss of energy in
            the gas and in the collector foil.
