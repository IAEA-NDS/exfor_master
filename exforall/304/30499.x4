TITLE      FISSION FRAGMENT AND ALFA PARTICLE CORRELATIONS IN THE
           THERMAL NEUTRON INDUCED FISSION OF U-235.
FACILITY   (REAC) CIRUS-REACTOR
SAMPLE     200 MICRO-G/CM2 U-235 ELECTROSPRAYED ON VYNS-FILM.
           AREA=1 CM2.
METHOD     (COINC). OF FRAGMENTS AND LRA FOR THE TERNARY FISSION
           DATA.
           BINARY DATA WERE COLLECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY.
           FRAGMENT MASSES WERE CALCULATED FROM THE MEASURED
           ENERGIES THROUGH THE CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM.
           THUS, FOR THE BINARY EVENTS A 2-DIMENSIONAL FRAGMENT-
           MASS AND ENERGY MATRIX, AND FOR THE TERNARY EVENTS
           A 3-DIMENSIONAL FRAGMENT MASS - FRAGMENT ENERGY -
           LRA ENERGY MATRIX WAS OBTAINED.
DETECTOR   (IOCH) BACK-TO-BACK GRIDDED IONIZATION CHAMBER,FILLED
           WITH A MIXTURE OF ARGON (97PC) AND METHANE (3PC),PRESS=
           1.5 ATM. THE U-235 SOURCE SERVED AS CATHODE, THE TWO
           COLLECTOR PLATES WERE FORMED OF ALU-FOILS (3 MG/CM2).
           (SOLST) 2 SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTORS WERE PLACED BEHIND
           THE COLLECTOR WINDOWS, TO DETECT THE LONG RANGE ALFAS.
STATUS     THE DATA WERE TAKEN FROM BARC-843,53. THIS REPORT DOES
           NOT INCLUDE NUMERICAL VALUES FOR THE ACTUAL MASS-ENERGY
           -LRA CORRELATIONS.
HISTORY    (790713C) TL.
CORRECTION LRA ENERGIES WERE CORRECTED FOR THE LOSS OF ENERGY IN
           THE GAS AND IN THE COLLECTOR FOIL.
