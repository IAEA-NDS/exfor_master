TITLE      Angular distribution of fragments in the fission of
           U-238 induced by neutrons in the range 2 to 14 MeV.
FACILITY   (CCW) 400 KV accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  14.1MeV. N-flux was about 8.3 x 10**8 n/cm2/sec.
METHOD     Measurement of the angular distribution of fragments
           by means of solid-state track detector.
           After etching in 6n NaOH solution, the fission tracks
           were observed by an optical micro-scope.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Solid state track detector,
           cylindrical Lexan sheet.
ANALYSIS   The angular distribution of fragments is approximately
           given by
               W(theta) = 1 + B*cos(theta)**2
           where (theta) is the angle between the fission fragment
           and the incident neutron. B is found to be 34.
