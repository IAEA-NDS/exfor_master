TITLE      ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF FRAGMENTS IN THE FISSION OF
           U-238 INDUCED BY NEUTRONS IN THE RANGE 2 TO 14 MEV.
FACILITY   (CCW)
           400 KV ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-T)
INC-SPECT  14.1MEV. N-FLUX WAS ABOUT 8.3E+8 N/CM2/SEC.
METHOD     MEASUREMENT OF THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF FRAGMENTS
           BY MEANS OF SOLID-STATE TRACK DETECTOR.
           AFTER ETCHING IN 6N NAOH SOLUTION, THE FISSION TRACKS
           WERE OBSERVED BY AN OPTICAL MICRO-SCOPE.
DETECTOR   (SOLST) SOLID STATE TRACK DETECTOR,
           CYLINDRICAL LEXAN SHEET.
ANALYSIS   THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF FRAGMENTS IS APPROXIMATELY
           GIVEN BY
               W(THETA) = 1 + B*COS(THETA)**2
           WHERE (THETA) IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE FISSION FRAGMENT
           AND THE INCIDENT NEUTRON. B IS FOUND TO BE 34.
