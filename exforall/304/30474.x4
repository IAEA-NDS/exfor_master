MONITOR    (79-AU-197(N,2N)79-AU-196,,SIG)
            FOR DETERMINATION OF THE AVERAGE NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
METHOD     MEASUREMENT OF THE TRITIUM BETA ACTIVITY.
           THE SEPARATION OF TRITIUM WAS CARRIED OUT BY VACUUM
           EXTRACTION METHOD AND BY CATALYTIC OXIDATION METHOD.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)
PART-DET   (B-)  DECAY BETA- OF TRITIUM.

           REACTION, ITS CONTRIBUTION CAN BE NEGLECTED.   AND
           B-10(N,T) CAN BE CALCULATED FROM THE MEASURED VALUE OF

           WITH THE ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCE RATIO.
