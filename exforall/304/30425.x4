FACILITY   (REAC,3ISLSOR) Israel research reactor IRR-1
INC-SOURCE (REAC)
INC-SPECT  Fast neutron flux of 4.x 10**11 neutrons/cm2/sec.
           Cadmium shield to thorium was used to minimize thermal
            neutron capture.
SAMPLE     2 gram of Th-232 in the form of thorium nitrate.
METHOD     (CHSEP) Separation of the fission-produced Kr and Xe
            from the other elements by sweeping with a stream of
            helium.
            Fission-produced tin and antimony were chemically
            separated as hydrides, using Na-B-H(4).
           (GSPEC) The gamma ray spectra of these noble gases and
            their daughters were measured and the corresponding
            independent yields were calculated.
            The gamma tin and antimony ray spectra were measured
            and the corresponding independent yields were
            calculated directly besides for Sn-131 which was
            calculated by comparing the measurements from Th-232
            to those from U-235.

            Fractional independent fission yield (FIY)
ANALYSIS   The fractional independent yields were calculated by
            dividing the measured independent yields by the
            respective chain yields.
           The independent yields were determined absolutely using
            the known absolute gamma-ray abundances.
FLAG       (1.) Derived from the measured 'FIY' of the parent,
            appeared in Table 1 of Phys.Rev.C16(1977)266.
           (2.) Derived from the measured 'FIY' of the parent, but
            the daughter contributes a few percent and its yield,
            estimated as the (1.0+-0.3) normal yield (D.R.Nathaway
            and A.W.Barton, UCRL-51458(1973) was subtracted.
           (3.) Derived from the measured 'FIY' of the parent, but
            the daughter contributes a few percent and its yield,
            estimated as the (1.0+-0.3) normal yield (K.Wolfsberg,
            private communication) was subtracted.
           (4.) Derived from the measured 'FIY' of the parent,
            appeared in Table 4 of J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem.40(1978)757.
