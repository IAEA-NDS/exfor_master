TITLE      Light-charged-particle emission in keV neutron-induced
           fission of Pu-239.
FACILITY   (VDG,3INDITK) 2MV.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)Thickness of Li-target for 2MeV protons = 20keV.
           (P-T) Thickness of t-target for 2MeV protons = 100keV.
SAMPLE     880 micrograms/cm2 Pu-239 foil,purity=96.97%, active
           area=3 cm2.
METHOD     (COINC).of fission fragments and LCP.
           The natural alphas and fission fragments were stopped
           in an alu-foil before reaching the LCP-detector.
           (PHD).on the fission side,cutoff energy = approx 6MeV,
           on the LCP-side, cutoff energy = 8MeV.
           Before and after each fast-neutron run, thermal runs
           were performed to check the detector performance and
           for normalization of the LCP-spectra.
DETECTOR   (IOCH).Filled with high purity argon,pressure = 1atm.
           (SIBAR).Surface-barrier,diameter=2cm,depletion depth=
           400micro-m,mounted inside the ionization chamber, to
           detect light charged particles ('LCP').
ANALYSIS   A Gaussian was fitted by least squares method to the
           measured spectra beyond 12MeV. The LCP-yields above
           12MeV were attributed to alpha-particles alone. The
           difference between measured spectra between 8 and 12MeV
           and Gaussian was assumed to be due to tritons. The
           quoted alpha and triton yields -relative to thermal-
           were obtained through this assumption.
MONITOR    A low intensity Ac-227 source was used for energy-
           calibration.
CORRECTION The observed spectra were corrected for chance coinc.
           Using singles LCP-spectra, then for energy losses in
           the source,gas and alu-foil.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details given.
STATUS     (TABLE) The numerical data were communicated
                                                   from G.K.Mehta.
