AUTHOR     (B.KRISHNARAJULU,S.SEN,G.K.MEHTA)
TITLE      LIGHT-CHARGED-PARTICLE EMISSION IN KEV NEUTRON-INDUCED
           FISSION OF PU-239.
FACILITY   (VDG) 2MV.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)THICKNESS OF LI-TARGET FOR 2MEV PROTONS = 20KEV.
           (P-T) THICKNESS OF T-TARGET FOR 2MEV PROTONS = 100KEV.
SAMPLE     880 MICROGRAMS/CM2 PU-239 FOIL,PURITY=96.97 PC, ACTIVE
           AREA=3 CM2.
METHOD     (COINC).OF FISSION FRAGMENTS AND LCP.
           THE NATURAL ALFAS AND FISSION FRAGMENTS WERE STOPPED IN
           AN ALU-FOIL BEFORE REACHING THE LCP-DETECTOR.
           (PHD).ON THE FISSION SIDE,CUTOFF ENERGY = APPROX 6MEV,
           ON THE LCP-SIDE,CUTOFF ENERGY = 8MEV.
           BEFORE AND AFTER EACH FAST-NEUTRON RUN, THERMAL RUNS
           WERE PERFORMED TO CHECK THE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE AND
           FOR NORMALIZATION OF THE LCP-SPECTRA.
DETECTOR   (IOCH).FILLED WITH HIGH PURITY ARGON,PRESSURE = 1ATM.
           (SOLST).SURFACE-BARRIER,DIAMETER=2CM,DEPLETION DEPTH=
           400MICRO-M,MOUNTED INSIDE THE IONIZATION CHAMBER. TO
           DETECT LIGHT CHARGED PARTICLES ('LCP').
ANALYSIS   A GAUSSIAN WAS FITTED BY LEAST SQUARES METHOD TO THE
           MEASURED SPECTRA BEYOND 12MEV. THE LCP-YIELDS ABOVE
           12MEV WERE ATTRIBUTED TO ALFA-PARTICLES ALONE. THE
           DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEASURED SPECTRA BETWEEN 8 AND 12MEV
           AND GAUSSIAN WAS ASSUMED TO BE DUE TO TRITONS. THE
           QUOTED ALFA AND TRITON YIELDS -RELATIVE TO THERMAL-
           WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THIS ASSUMPTION.
MONITOR    A LOW INTENSITY AC-227 SOURCE WAS USED FOR ENERGY-
           CALIBRATION.
STATUS     THE NUMERICAL DATA WERE COMMUNICATED FROM G.K.MEHTA.
HISTORY    (790629C) TL.
CORRECTION THE OBSERVED SPECTRA WERE CORRECTED FOR CHANCE COINC.
           USING SINGLES LCP-SPECTRA, THEN FOR ENERGY LOSSES IN
           THE SOURCE,GAS AND ALU-FOIL.
ERR-ANALYS NO DETAILS GIVEN.
