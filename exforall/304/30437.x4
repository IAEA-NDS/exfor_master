CORRECTION SINCE 99 PERC. OF ALL FISSIONS IN THE CURIUM-SAMPLE
           WILL BE FROM CM-245, NO CORRECTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
           FROM FISSIONS OF OTHER CURIUM ISOTOPES WERE APPLIED.
           NO INFORMATION IS GIVEN ON CORRECTIONS DUE TO CHEMICAL

           REGARDED AS CHAIN YIELDS EXCEPT CD-115,SN-121,SN-125.
           NORMALIZATION  RELATIVE YIELDS HAVE BEEN MEASURED. THE
             ABSOLUTE DATA GIVEN BELOW WERE OBTAINED BY FORCING
             THE SUM OF ALL CHAIN YIELDS (INCLUDING INTERPOLATED
             AND EXTRAPOLATED VALUES FOR MASS CHAINS NOT MEASURED)
             TO TOTAL 200 PERCENT.
           FISSION YIELDS MEASURED IN A THERMAL REACTOR NEUTRON
             SPECTRUM CAN BE REGARDED AS MAXWELLIAN AVERAGE DATA.
METHOD     OF DATA ANALYSIS
          1FROM MEASURED FISSION PRODUCT ACTIVITES,'R-VALUES' (R)
           WERE CALCULATED AS GIVEN UNDER 'MISC-COL' BELOW.
          2YIELDS FOR PRODUCT X FROM FISSION OF CM-245 (=Y(X,245))
           ARE CALCULATED AS
             Y(X,245)=R*Y(99,245)*Y(X,235)/Y(99,235), WHERE
           Y(99,245) IS AN ASSUMED VALUE FOR THE CM-245 FISSION
                     YIELD OF MO-99
           Y(X,235) AND Y(99,235) ARE THE U-235 FISSION YIELDS OF
                    FISSION PRODUCT X AND MO-99 RESPECTIVELY.

COMMENT   1COMPILERS NOTES  THE STATISTICAL ERROR (MISC1-ERR) DOES
           NOT INCLUDE ERRORS OF CHEMICAL YIELD,SELF ABSORPTION IN
           THE SAMPLE,DECAY SPECTRA ANALYSIS,ETC.
          2TAKING THIS INTO ACCOUNT,THE GENERAL ERROR OF 5 PERC
           MENTIONED IN THE TEXT OF THE PUBLICATION SHOULD BE MORE
           REALISTIC FOR CALCULATING THE ERROR OF RELATIVE CM-245
           FISSION YIELDS.
          3THE 10 PERC ERROR OF THE FINAL NORMALIZATION SEEMS TO
           BE OPTIMISTIC IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT ABOUT 140 PERC.
            (OR 95 PERC.,IF REFLECTED YIELD ARE INCLUDED) OF THE
           TOTAL SUM OF YIELDS (200 PERC.) ARE ESTIMATED VALUES.
          2CM-245 FISSION YIELDS RELATIVE TO AN ARBITRARY VALUE
           FOR MO-99 (MONIT1),AS SHOWN IN TABLE 1 OF THE FINAL
           PUBLICATION,ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DATA TABLE BELOW.
           ONLY THE RESPECTIVE ERRORS ARE SHOWN (DATA-ERR1).
ERR-ANALYS FOR INDIVIDUAL FISSION PRODUCTS THE AUTHORS GIVE ONLY
           STATISTICAL ERRORS DERIVED FROM 'R-VALUES' IN TABLE 1.
           CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TOTAL ERROR ARE ONLY GIVEN IN A
           MORE GENERAL WAY WITHIN THE TEXT.
           COMBINED RELATIVE ERRORS WERE CALCULATED BY THE COMPI-
           LER AS SQUARE-ROOT OF THE SUM OF SQUARES OF INDIVIDUAL
           RELATIVE ERRORS.
           FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF RENORMALIZATION AND A BETTER
           COMPARISON OF ERRORS,THE MISC1-ERR,MONIT2-ERR AND
           DATA-ERR1 ARE GIVEN AS RELATIVE ERRORS.
          1(MISC1-ERR) PURELY STATISTICAL ERROR OF 'R-VALUES',
             PRESUMABLY 1 STANDARD DEVIATION, DERIVED FROM THE
             SPREAD AND NUMBER OF DETERMINATIONS.
          2(DATA-ERR1) COMBINED ERROR OF RELATIVE CM-245 FISSION
             YIELDS (SEE,HOWEVER,COMPILERS NOTE BELOW) DERIVED BY
             THE COMPILER FROM MISC1-ERR AND THE ERRORS OF U-235
             FISSION YIELDS (MONIT2).NOTE,THAT THE ERRORS OF
             Y(99,235) AND OF Y(X,235) ARE COMBINED.
             THE MONIT2-ERRORS ARE TAKEN FROM NEDO-12154-1.
          3(DATA-ERR2) THE ESTIMATED OVERALL ERROR OF CM-245
             'ABSOLUTE' FISSION YIELDS INCLUDING A 10 PERC. ERROR
             IN THE FINAL NORMALIZATION DERIVED BY THE COMPILER
             FROM THE TEXT OF THE FINAL PUBLICATION.
