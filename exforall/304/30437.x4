TITLE      Mass yield from thermal neutron induced fission
           of Cm-245
FACILITY   (REAC,3INDTRM) CIRUS reactor
INC-SPECT  Thermal reactor spectrum. The cadmium-ratio for U-235
           and Cm-245 is about 200 in irradiation position.
SAMPLE     (96-CM-245,ENR=0.9386)
           Curium purified free of plutonium and fission products.
           Curium (approx. 50 micrograms/cm2) and uranium (approx.
           5 micrograms/cm2) electrodeposited on gold-plated alu-
           minum foils, wrapped in superpure Al-catcher-foils.
           Isotopic composition:
              Curium sample    Cm-244   93.86%
                               Cm-245    2.01%
                               Cm-246    4.13%
              Uranium sample  90% U-235
METHOD     Yield determined by Th 'R-value' method relative to
           U-235 thermal fission yields (see EXFOR 30437.002).
           (REC) Fission fragments were collected by the 'thin-
           target-recoil-catcher' technique.
           (GSPEC) High yield products were measured by direct
           gamma counting.
           (CHSEP) For low yield products radiochemical separation
            was employed followed by beta- or gamma-counting

CORRECTION Since 99% of all fissions in the curium-sample
           will be from Cm-245, no corrections for contributions
           from fissions of other curium isotopes were applied.
           No information is given on corrections due to chemical
           separation procedures and sample counting.

REACTION   (96-CM-245(N,F)ELEM/MASS,CUM,FY,,MXW)
ANALYSIS   From measured fission product activities ratios
           'R-values' calculated as
           R=a(99,235)*a(X,245)/(a(99,245)*a(X,235))
             where 99,X,235 and 245 have the meaning explained
             under method above.
           Yields for product X from fission of Cm-245 (=Y(X,245))
           are calculated as
             Y(X,245)=R*Y(99,245)*Y(X,235)/Y(99,235), where
           Y(99,245) is an assumed value for the Cm-245 fission
                     yield of Mo-99
           Y(X,235) and Y(99,235) are the U-235 fission yields of
                    fission product X and Mo-99 respectively.

           products.
