FACILITY   (REAC,3RUMPIT)
INC-SOURCE (THCOL) Thermal column of VVRS-IFA reactor with the
            standard neutron field, Sigma-Sigma facility
INC-SPECT  Fast reactor spectrum calculated with ANISN code and
            ENDF/B-III library is mentioned by I.Girlea et al.,
            "Neutron spectrum measurements performed in Sigma-
             Sigma facility by means of the proton recoil
             counters" to be published.
COMMENT    By compiler (2015-07-23):
            A neutron spectrum of the Sigma-Sigma facility is
            available in the IRDF-2002 (standard spectra).
