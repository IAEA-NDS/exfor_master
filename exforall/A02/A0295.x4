METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,INTB,BCINT,MOMIX). For Each Irradiation the
            The Individal Mn-54 Calibration was Used.Furthermore,
            For All Alpha-Irradiated Sources the Efficiencies
            Were Determined.Leaving Off All Values Which were
            Obviously Too Small Due to Bad Positioning We
            Calculated on Average Value of X-Ray Energy (5.41 KEV)
            Which was Used to Calculate the Cross Sections For
            Protons,Deuterons,He-3-Induced Reactions.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
           (SOLST).The Sources were Measured Directly in Front
           Of a Liquid Nitrogen Cooled Si(LI)-Detector.
ANALYSIS   (AREA).Peak Area was Determined by Summing Up the
           Respective Channels.
STATUS     (CURVE).By CAJAD.
SAMPLE     Foils of Natural Vanadium(PURITY 99.8PER CENT)With
           Thicknesses of 8.1 and 9.9Mg/Cm**2,Respectively,have
           Been Irradiated at Various Energies with Protons,
           Deuterons,He-3 and Alpha-Particles in the Internal
           Beam of the Karesruhe Isochronous Cyclotron.

COMMENT    /by Authors/.In Case of Production of V-49 by Alpha-
           Irradiation of Natural Vanadium Foils Such a
           Calibration Activity is Produced in the Same Targets by
           Means of an (A,N)-Reaction Leading to Mn-54.  This
           Nucleus  Decays by Electron Capture Mainly to the 834.8
           KeV Level of Cr-54 Which Deexcites by the Respective
           Groundstate  Transition.  The Ratio of Emitted K-X-Rays
           To Gamma-Rays has Been Determined Experimentally.
           Consequently,the Absolute X-Ray Intensities For Mn-54
           And from this Also For V-49 can be Determined from  the
           Same Target Foil Ruling Out Uncertainties from the
           Geometrical Setup of Source and Detector and from the
           Absorption.
