TITLE      Excitation functions of deuteron induced nuclear
           reactions on natural tellurium and enriched 122-Te:
           Production of 123-I via the 122-Te(d,n) 123-I-process

           (R,INDC(GER)-24/2+SPECIAL,28,1982). Short report.
INSTITUTE  (2GERJUL)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL).The compact cyclotron CV28.
           (ISOCY,2GERJUL).The incident energy CV28 was 14.MeV,
           one 'Julic' was 50.MeV.
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV)
MONITOR    (23-V-51(D,2N)24-CR-51,,SIG) - The beam current was
            monitored.
             Several vanadium (99% pure) and aluminum (99.9%
           pure) foils were inserted at several intervals in the
           stacks to allow beam current determination and the
           required energy degradation.

STATUS     (CURVE). By CAJAD.

ADD-RES    The method of target preparation. The device for
           high current beam.
SAMPLE     An electroplating method was developed to obtain thin
           tellurium samples. Titanium foils of 25 mu-m and
           10 mu-m thickness were used as backing material.
COMMENT     S.M.Qaim (2018-01-24): Some of the points near the
            threshold appear to be shifted since the energy
            calibration of the cyclotron at that time was not
            very good.

SAMPLE     Several stacks of natural tellurium each consisting
           of about 6 Ti-Te discs, were irradiated.
           Tellurium films of 6.-7. mu-m thickness, corresponding
           to a tellurium weight of 4.- 4.5 mg/cm were used.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The total errors in the measured cross
           sections were estimated by taking square roots of
           the sums of the squares of the individual errors,
           such as those occurring in the determination of
           the thickness of each Ti-foil and tellurium-film, in
           beam current measurements, in the determination of
           the absolute activity of samples ( including
           statistical errors, errors in the efficiency  of the
           detector, counting geometry and decay schemes etc.),
           as well as errors in the energy scale
           calculations. The total errors in cross sections
           vary from  case to case, but in general lie between
           10 and 12%.

SAMPLE     (52-TE-122,ENR=0.9645) Enrichment of 122-Te - 96.45%
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The total errors in the measured cross
           sections were estimated by taking square roots of
           the sums of the squares of the individual errors,
           such   as those occurring in the determination of
           the thickness of each Ti-foil and tellurium-film, in
           beam current measurements, in the determination of
           the absolute activity of samples ( including
           statistical errors, errors in the efficiency  of the
           detector, counting geometry and decay schemes etc.),
           as well as errors in the energy scale
           calculations. The total errors in cross sections
           vary from  case to case, but in general lie between
