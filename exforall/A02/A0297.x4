COMMENT    - By Author:  this Experiment has Been done with a View
           To Studying Complete and Incomplete Fusion in
           Heavy-Ion-Induced Reactions.  Excitation Functions For
           Several Reactions Induced by 12-C-5+ Ions on 165-Ho at
           Incident Energies from 55 to 80 MeV have Been Measured
           Using the Activation Technique.  The Analysis of the
           Data has Been done Using the Codes "Alice 91" and
           "Cascade".  Significant Contributions from Both the
           Complete and the Incomplete Fusion Channels have Been
           Observed.  Further, in the Case of the Reaction (C,P3N)
           Considerable Contribution from the Decay of Higher
           Charge Isobar Precursor has Been Observed.
FACILITY   (VDGT,3INDIND) Nuclear Science Center, New Delhi
SAMPLE     Rolled Natural Holmium Foils (PURITY >99.9%) Of
           Thickness 2 Milligramm/Cm**2 were Used As Target. The
           A Transmission Method Based on the Measurements of the
           Energy Lost by a Particles While Passing Through the
           Sample has Been Utilized to Measure the Thickness of
           Each Target Individually.  Individual Samples Backed by
           Aluminum Catcher Foils of Thickness 1 Milligramm/Cm**2.
METHOD     (EXTB) The Samples were Irradiated with a 12-C-5+ Beam
           Of Current 30 Na at Four Different Energies:  55, 62,
           71, and 80 MeV.
           (ACTIV) The Irradiations were Performed For 4-5 H
           Duration Each.
           (BCINT) As Well As from the Counts of the Two
           Rutherford Monitors Kept at + and - 30 Degrees with
           Respect to the Beam Direction.  They were Found to
           Agree with Each Other Within 5%.
           (GSPEC)
           (SITA) See Sample.
DETECTOR   (HPGE)
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Error in the Incident Beam Energy has Been
           Determined by Calculating the Energy Spread in Half of
           The Sample Thickness.
           (ERR-T) The Error in the Thickness of the Sample
           Material is Expected to be <1%.
           It is Estimated That the Beam Current Fluctuations May
           Introduce <3% Error. The Statistical Fluctuations in
           Efficiency is Estimated to be <2%.
           In Order to Minimie the Loss Due to the Nuclei
           Recoiling Out of the Target, the Sample and the Catcher
           Foil were Counted Together.

COMMENT    - By Authors: the Contribution of 171-Lu Isotope from
           The Precursor Decay of 171-Hf at 62 and 71 MeV is
           Expected to be Negligible Because of the Relatively
           High Value of Threshold Energy For the Latter.
           However, at 80 MeV, Measured Cross Section For 171-Lu
           Is Cumulative.
