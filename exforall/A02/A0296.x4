COMMENT    -By  Author:   We report excitation function for the
           reaction 130-Te(p,n)130-I in the energy range 4-18 MeV
           The measurements were done employing slacked foil
           activation technique and enriched isotope. To the best
           of our knowledge this excitation function has been
           reported for the first time.  The theoretical analysis
           of the excitation function has been done employing both
           the semiclassical as well as quantum mechanical
           descriptions of the pre-equilibrium emission.  In
           general, theoretical calculations agree well with ihe
           experimental data.

SAMPLE     (52-TE-130,ENR=0.61) An enriched isotope (61%) of
           Te-130 was used for preparing the samples, which
           were made by vacuum evaporation, of 1.1 mg/cm2
           thickness on aluminum backing of 6.75 mg/cm2. The
           square pieces of targets of size 1.2x1.2 cm2 were
           used as samples in the stack. Each target was mounted
           individually on a conducting metal frame for heat
           dissipation. A stack for irradiation was made by
           taking seven targets with aluminum foils of suitable
           thickness as degraders.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors may be due to the factors:
           (ERR-S) statistical error
           (ERR-1,,1.) The uncertainty in the determination of the
           number of target nuclei. The errors estimated to be <1%
           (ERR-2,,3.)  The uncertainty in the beam flux
           fluctuation - <3%.
           (ERR-3,,8.)  The uncertainty in the efficiency of the
           detector are estimated to be < 8%.
           (ERR-4,,1.5) The uncertainty in the measured cross
           section due to the maximum beam intensity loss at the
           end of the stack was estimated to be < 1.5%
           (EN-ERR) The errors in the energy represent the energy
           spread in half of the sample thickness along with the
           inherent  energy uncertainty in the proton beam energy.
           ANALYSIS   (AREA) The measured cross section values at
           are the weighted average of the cross sections
           calculated from the measured intensities of gamma-rays
           of different energies emitted by the residual nucleus
           I-130.
ADD-RES    (COMP) With code 'EXIFON'. The code is based on an
           analytical model for statistical multistep direct and
           multistep compound reaction.
