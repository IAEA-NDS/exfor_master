COMMENT    -By  Author:   We Report Excitation Function For the
           Reaction 130-Te(P,N)130-I in the Energy Range 4-18 MeV
           The Measurements were done Employing Slacked Foil
           Activation Technique and Enriched Isotope. To the Best
           Of Our Knowledge this Excilation Function has Been
           Reported For the First Time.  The Theoretical Analysis
           Of the Excitation Function has Been done Employing Both
           The Semiclassical As Well As Quantum Mechanical
           Descriptions of the Prequilibrium Emission.  In
           General, Theoretical Calculations Agree Well with Ihe
           Experimental Data.

SAMPLE     An Enriched Isotope (61%) Of Tellurium (MASS
           NUMBER=130) Was Used For Preparing the Samples, Which
           Were Made by Vacuum Evaporation, of 1.1
           Milligramm/Cm**2  Thickness on Aluminum Backing of 6.75
           Milligramm/Cm**2.  The Square Pieces of Targets of Size
           1.2X1.2 Cm2 were Used As Samples in the Stack.  Each
           Target was Mounted Individually on a Conducting Metal
           Frame  For  Heat  Dissipation.  A Stack For Irradiation
           Was Made by Taking Seven Targets with Aluminum Foils of
           Suitable Thickness As Degraders.
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The Errors in the Energy Represent the Energy
           Spread in Half of the Sample Thickness Along with the
           Inherent  Energy Uncertainty in the Proton Beam Energy.
           (ERR-S) Staistical Error Only
           (ERR-T) The Errors May be Due to the Factors:
           1. The Statistical Error of Gamma Counting
           2. The Uncertainty in the Determination of the Number
           Of Target Nuclei. The Errors Estimated to be <1%.
           3. During the Irradiation the Beam Current Often
           Fluctuates, Which Result in Variation of the Incident
           Flux. It is Expected That the Beam Flux Fluctuation May
           Introduce Errors of <3%.
           4. The Uncertaities in the Efficiency of the
           Detector are Estimated to be < 8%.
           5. The Error in the Measured Cross Section Due to the
           Maximum Beam Intensity Loss at the End of the Stack was
           Estimated to be < 1.5%
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The Measured Cross Section Values at Each Energy
           Are the Weighted Average of the Cross Sections
           Calculated from the Measured Intensities of Gamma-Rays
           Of Different Energies Emitted by the Residual Nucleus
           I-130.

           Multistep Compound Reaction.
