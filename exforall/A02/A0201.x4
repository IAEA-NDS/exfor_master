ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Errors in the cross section values are due
           to uncertainties of the individual quantities involved
           in their determination, as the absolute activity of
           the gamma ray, the deuteron flux, etc.
           (EN-ERR) The uncertainty in the particle energy for
           each data point is due to the energy spread of the
           incident beam from the cyclotron
COMMENT    /by Authors/ All data were obtained as an average of
           data from three determinations. The listed errors are
           the greatest deviations from the average.
           /by Compiler/. It is not obviously to account Rh-106.
           Authors remarked that the subtraction of this nuclide
           introduces a certain error in the determination
           of photopeak areas (roughly estimated as +-15%)
