TITLE      Excitation functions for the reactions producing
           121I,123I and 124I from irradiation of natural
           antimony with 3He and 4He particles with energies
           up to 30 MeV.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK HHL) 'MRC' cyclotron - 4He beam
           (CYCLO,2UK BIR) 3He beam.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3 * 3 inch.
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EDEG,CHSEP)
           (BCINT) Beam current integration was carried out
           calorimetrically (see REL-REF) and later using a copper
           foil activation technique similar to the method
           described by Lebowitz et al. (see REL-REF).

SAMPLE     Thin natural antimony targets were prepared by vacuum
           distillation of antimony powder (99.999%) onto disks
           of aluminium foil (99.99%) of 0.001 in thickness. Two
           to three Mg were deposited over an area of 3.46 cm2.
           Degradation of the 4He or 3He particle beams by
           this thickness of antimony would in no case exceed 2%
           over the energy range considered. The uniformity of
           color of these targets indicated that there was
           little variation of thickness although no attempt was
           made to confirm this by measurement. After careful
           weighing these coated target foils were covered with
           a 0.001 inch aluminium foil to protect the coating,
           and the edges crimped to form a sealed envelope.
ADD-RES    Chemical separation method.

           energy estimated from experimental data of Bewley et
           al., and the range energy compilation of Williamson.
COMMENT    /By compiler/  Since q-value for (alpha,2n) reaction
           121Sb is 15.5 MeV the results at 9.72-15.29 MeV
           on appear to be in error. However, the energy spread
           may provide enough of an overlap with high cross
           sections region to produce this apparent anomaly.
