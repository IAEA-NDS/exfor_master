TITLE      Cyclotron production of 38-S by the reaction
           40-Ar(p,3p)38-S.

FACILITY   (SYNCY,2NEDIKO)
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV,SITA,EXTB)
SAMPLE     Target-technical Ar.
           The measurements were performed by simultaneously
           irradiating a row of cylindrical vessels,each
           filled with 70cm of argon gas.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2 x 2 in. NaI(Tl)
           (GELI) The current was calculated from the intensity of
           the 1338 keV gamma-ray emitted by 57Ni produced by
           Ni-28(p,pn)Ni-57 and measured with a Ge(Li)-detector.
MONITOR    (28-NI-58(P,X)28-NI-57,CUM,SIG) The beam current was
           monitored by means of activation foils of nickel
            (85 mg Ni/cm2) placed in front of the "stack" of
           cylindrical vessels.
DECAY-MON  (28-NI-57,35.93HR,DG,1338.)
ADD-RES    (TTY-C) The method cyclotron production of 38-S in
           certain well-defined,chemical forms such as sulfate
           or hydrogen sulfate.
