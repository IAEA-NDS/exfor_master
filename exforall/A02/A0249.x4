           1332 keV) .
           (GE) For X-ray radiation, a 1 cm thick Ge detector
           was used
           (SIBAR) Si surface-barrier detector (150 mm2 active
           area, 500 um-thick Au-Si surface barrier detector,

COMMENT    /By authors/ Po-211 is daughter of At-211. The nuclear
            decay properties (alpha, X-ray, gamma emissions) were
            evaluated for At-211 and its daughter Po-211 in order
            to refine or to obtain the prerequisite nuclear data
            for subsequent radiopharmaceutical development and
            therapeutic applications of At-211.

COMMENT    /By authors/.Po-210 (daughter of At-210) is
           undesirable in a radio-pharmaceutical preparation due
           to its 138.38 day half-life. It has not been previously
           mentioned as a radiocontaminant in At-211 preparation,
           except as it arises from the decay of At-210.
