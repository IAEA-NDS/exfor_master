SAMPLE     Arsine is liberated from a warm mixture of arsenic
           pentoxide, zinc powder and sulphuric acid. It is
           flushed towards two tungsten electrodes with oxygen-
           free nitrogen. When a discharge (from a Tesla vacuum
           tester) is passed through the electrodes, arsenic is
           deposited onto an aluminium plancha positioned to
           catch it.
             Target made is this way had weight of approximately
           0.7 mg of arsenic distributed uniformly over an
           area about 2 cm**2.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  Standard deviation of the mean of cross-

           'He' ions of the same incident energy and the
           random error obtained in atomic absorption
           estimation of the arsenic content.

ADD-RES    The upper limits of 76-Br and 76-As production cross
           sections are less 25 mb at 28.1 MeV using analytical
           method.

COMMENT    /By compiler/ Since q-value for (alpha,2n) reaction on
           As-75 is -14.2 MeV the results at 13.8 MeV appear
           to be in error. However, the energy spread may provide
           enough of an overlap with high cross sections region
           to produce this apparent anomaly.
           /By authors/  To explain this fact the energy scale
           should be shifted by about 0.5 MeV.
