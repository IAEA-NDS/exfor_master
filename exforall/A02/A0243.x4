           TARGET IRRADIATION.
SAMPLE     ARSINE IS LIBERATED FROM A WARM MIXTURE OF ARSENIC
           PENTOXIDE, ZINC POWDER AND SULPHURIC ACID. IT IS
           FLUSHED TOWARDS TWO TUNGSTEN ELECTRODES WITH OXIGEN-
           FREE NITROGEN. WHEN A DISCHARGE (FROM A TESLA VACUUM
           TESTER) IS PASSED THROUGH THE ELECTRODES, ARSENIC IS
           DEPOSITED ONTO AN ALUMINIUM PLANCHAT POSITIONED TO
           CATCH IT.
                 TARGET MADE IS THIS WAY HAD WEIGHT OF APPROXIMATE
           LY 0.7 MG OF ARSENIC DISTRIBUTED UNIFORMLY OVER AN
           AREA ABOUT 2 CM**2.

COMMENT    /BY COMPILER/. SINCE Q-VALUE FOR (A,2N) REACTION ON
           AS-75 IS -14.2 MEV THE RESULTS AT 13.8 MEV APPEAR
           TO BE IN ERROR. HOWEVER, THE ENERGY SPREAD
           MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH OF AN OVERLAP WITH HIGH CROSS
           SECTIONS REGION TO PRODUCE THIS APPARENT ANOMALY.
           /BY AUTHORS/. TO EXPLAIN THIS FACT THE ENERGY SCALE
           SHOULD BE SHIFTED BY ABOUT 0.5 MEV.
