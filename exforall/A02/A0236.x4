TITLE      Thick target yields of 34m-Cl and 38-Cl produced by
           various charged particles on phosphorus, sulphur and
           chlorine targets.

INSTITUTE  (4RUSFEI)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,4RUSFEI) The irradiation time was 15 min, the
            beam intensity 0.02 mu-A.
SAMPLE     The samples for irradiation were the powder of red
           phosphorus and the pressed pellets of S and CsCl.
METHOD     (BCINT,SITA,ACTIV,EDEG)
           For the determination of relative curve, the
           irradiation was carried out in the special target
           device rotating 10 samples, and before each of them
           the monitoring and absorbing foils were placed. The
           absolute value of the thick target yield was
           determined at the maximum energy of charged particles,
           the irradiation in this case was curried out in a
           target device with faraday cup. The irradiation time
           was 15 min, the beam intensity 0.02 muA.
DETECTOR   (NAICR) a 70 x 70 mm NaI(Tl) scintillation detector,
           coupled with a 256-channel analyzer. The detector was
           calibrated by standard sources of gamma-rays.
           (SI) The maximum energy of the charged particle beam
           was measured. The energy after the aluminum
           absorbing foils  was calculated using Stopping
           power tables (see REL-REF).
REL-REF    (R,,C.F.Williamson+,R,CEA-R-3042,1966). Stopping power
           tables.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The percentage error of the absolute
           value of the thick target yield is 15%
