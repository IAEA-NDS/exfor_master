FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDVEC)
SAMPLE     Enriched Isotopes of 128-Te(87%) And 130-Te(61%) Were
           Used For the Preparation of Samples. The Elements were
           Deposited on Aluminum Foils of Thickness 6.75
           Milligramm/Cm**2.  Thicknesses of 128-Te and 130-Te
           Deposits were 920 and 1100 Microgramm/Cm**2,
           Respectively.
METHOD     (STTA) A Stack of Foils with Energy Degrader, in
           Between Them,If Necessary, is Irradiated in a Fixed
           Geometry
           (EXTB) A Diffused Alpha Beam
           (BCINT)
           (GSPEC)
           (ACTIV) The Beam Currents 100 Nanoampere were Used For
           Irradiation.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The Uncertainty Includes:
           1. The Errors in the Thickness of Deposition of the
           Sample Materials, Which are Estimated to be <1%.
           2. It was Estimated That Beam Flux Fluctuations May
           Introduce Errors <4%.
           3. The Measured Detection Efficiency Never Exceed 1.5%
           The Uncertainties Due to Decay Data are not Included.
           (EN-ERR) No Consideration of Straggling is Made in
           The Incident Energy of Alpha Particles on Each Foil in
           The Stack.
CORRECTION On Dead Time were Applied in Counting Rates.

           (20020420U) Last checking has been done.
ADD-RES    (COMP) The Code "Act" Uses the Hauser-Feshbach Model
           For Compound Nuclei Calculations While the Exciton
           Model of Griffin is Used For Simulating the
           Preequilibrium Contribution.
