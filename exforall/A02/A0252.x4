           (6-C-12)
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Protons from the Elastic Scattering and
           Alpha-Particles from the (P,A) Reaction were Detected
           In the Louvain-Edinburgh Detector Array (LEDA), a
           Concentric Multistrip Silicon Detector That Provided
           Data at Sixteen Angles from 12 to 28 Degrees in the
           Lab. System with a Very Large Coverage (90%) In the
           Azimuthal Angle.
METHOD     (SITA) See Sample
           (EDEG) The 14 MeV 18-F Beam was First Degraded to 10
           MeV in a 300 Mugramm/Cm2 Carbon Foil in Front of a 275
           Mugramm/Cm2 Polyethylene Target in Which It was Slowed
           Down to 5.0 MeV;  the C.M.  Energy Region from 265 to
           535 KeV Wvs Scanned.

COMMENT    - By Authors: As the Angular Region Covered by the
           Detector at the Resonance Energy was from 20 to 40
           C.-M. Degrees, the Corrected Number of Counts was Then
           Extrapolated to 4*Pi Solid Angle, Using the L=1
           Character of the Angular Distribution.
