REL-REF    (O,A0258001,R.Coszach+,J,PL/B,353,184,1995)
           investigation of the same reaction in 550-740 C.M. keV
           region.
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)
SAMPLE     275 mu-gr/cm2 polyethylene target.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Protons from the elastic scattering and
           alpha-particles from the (p,alpha) reaction were
           detected in the Louvain-Edinburgh detector array (LEDA)
           a concentric multistrip silicon detector that provided
           data at sixteen angles from 12 to 28 degrees in the
           lab. System with a very large coverage (90%) in the
           azimuthal angle.
METHOD     (SITA)
           (EDEG) the 14 MeV 18-F beam was first degraded to 10
           MeV in a 300 mu-gr/cm2 carbon foil in front of a 275
           mu-gr/cm2 polyethylene target in which it was slowed
           down to 5.0 MeV;  the C.M.  energy region from 265 to
           535 keV was scanned.
ADD-RES    (RRATE) In Giga-Kelvin region.

REACTION   (9-F-18(P,A),,WID/STR)
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Main source of the uncertainty is reaction
           yield determination.
ANALYSIS   (INTAD,SLA)
COMMENT    - by authors: as the angular region covered by the
           detector at the resonance energy was from 20 to 40
           C.-M. degrees, the corrected number of counts was then
           extrapolated to 4*pi solid angle, using the l=1
           character of the angular distribution.
