TITLE      Absolute cross sections for the production of 18F via
           the 18O(p,n)18F reaction

METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,ACTIV,CHSEP,BCINT)
           The proton irradiations were performed on the
           Brookhaven tandem van de Graaff accelerator. Typically
           the irradiations were for 1.5-3.0 minutes duration
           and the beam currents were 100-300 nA. The specific
           details pertaining to the beam energy analysis, the
           beam focusing and collimator system, and Faraday cup
           have been reported previously see 'REL-REF'. The
           defocused proton beam was directed through a 1 cm
           collimator which had permanent magnets installed to
           suppress the secondary electrons produced in the
           collimator.
SAMPLE     The beam passed through a thin (5.46 mg/cm2,
           1/4 mil, 6.4 um) Havar foil, a small air path
            (~ 1.5 mg/cm2) and a Havar target window
            (6.44 mg/cm2) before entering the target gas. The
           total charge collected by the Faraday cup for each
           run was determined with calibrated current
           integrators. The target gas consisted of 91.7%
           enriched 18O-2 with a gross composition of 99.8% mole
           oxygen. The impurities consisted of 4.0% 17O and
           4.3% 16O in the form of either O-2 or CO-2. The CO-2
           and N-2 impurities were less 0.1% each.
            The target chamber was constructed of Al and had
           valved filling ports. The cylindrical chamber was
           2.0 cm deep and 2.5 cm in diameter. Target pressures
           ranged between 200 and 600 Torr. The targets were
           loaded by way of a vacuum line equipped with a
           Barocell differential pressure transducer.
           A preliminary experiment indicated that less than 0.1%
           of the total activity remained in the gas phase in the
           Al targets. This was determined by passing the
           irradiated 18O2 target gas through a charcoal trap
           at liquid n2 temperature and counting the activity
           trapped. In subsequent irradiations the gas was vented
           and the target opened for removal of the 18F activity.

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The only activities present were the 18-F
           and 13-N produced from the (p,alpha) reaction on the
           4.3% 16-O present.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The uncertainty in the disintegration
           rate, which combines the effect of the counting
           statistics (1% approximately) and the decay
           curve analysis (less 3%).
           (ERR-2,,1.) Beam current integration uncertainty.
           (ERR-3,,2.) Maximum uncertainty due to effect of any
           fluctuations in the intensity.
           (ERR-4,,1.) The upper limit uncertainty in the number
           of target nuclei.
           (ERR-5) The error of chemical transfer of 18-F.

DECAY-DATA (9-F-18,109.8MIN,AR,511.,2.)
FLAG       (1.) This datum was determined at the BNL 60-inch
            cyclotron using the same Faraday cup assembly.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainty in the cross sections
           determined by combining the errors in quadrature.
COMMENT    /By authors/. The energy of the irradiation was taken
           as the mid-point in the range of the protons in the
           target gas.
