METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,ACTIV,CHSEP)
           THE PROTON IRRADIATIONS WERE PERFORMED ON THE
           BROOKHAVEN TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR. TYPICALLY
           THE IRRADIATIONS WERE FOR 1.5-3.0 MINUTES DURATION
           AND THE BEAM CURRENTS WERE 100-300 NA. THE SPECIFIC
           DETAILS PERTAINING TO THE BEAM ENERGY ANALYSIS,THE
           BEAM FOCUSING AND COLLIMATOR SYSTEM,AND FARADAY CUP
           HAVE BEEN REPORTED PREVIOUSLY SEE 'REL-REF'. THE
           DEFOCUSED PROTON BEAM WAS DIRECTED THROUGH A 1 CM
           COLLIMATOR WHICH HAD PERMANENT MAGNETS INSTALLED TO
           SUPPRESS THE SECONDARY ELECTRONS PRODUCED IN THE
           COLLIMATOR.
SAMPLE     THE BEAM PASSED THROUGH A THIN (5.46MG/CM**2,
           1/4MIL,6.4MUM) HAVAR FOIL,A SMALL AIR PATH
            (AP.1.5MG/CM**2) AND A HAVAR TARGET WINDOW
            (6.44MG/CM**2) BEFORE ENTERING THE TARGET GAS. THE
           TOTAL CHARGE COLLECTED BY THE FARADAY CUP FOR EACH
           RUN WAS DETERMINED WITH CALIBRATED CURRENT
           INTEGRATORS. THE TARGET GAS CONSISTED OF 91.7 PER CENT
           ENRICHED 18O-2 WITH A GROSS COMPOSITION OF 99.8 MOLE
           PER CENT OXYGEN. THE IMPURITIES CONSISTED OF 4.0 PER
           CENT 17O AND 4.3 PER CENT 16O IN THE FORM OF EITHER
           O-2 OR CO-2. THE CO-2 AND N-2 IMPURITIES WERE LT 0.1
           PER CENT EACH. THE TARGET CHAMBER WAS CONSTRUCTED OF AL
           AND HAD VALVED FILLING PORTS. THE CYLINDRICAL CHAMBER
           WAS 2.0 CM DEEP AND 2.5 CM IN DIAMETER.TARGET PRESSURES
            RANGED BETWEEN 200 AND 600 TORR. THE TARGETS WERE
           LOADED BY WAY OF A VACUUM LINE EQUIPPED WITH A
           BAROCELL DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSDUCER.
           A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT INDICATED THAT LESS THAT 0.1
           PER CENT OF THE TOTAL ACTIVITY REMAINED IN THE GAS
           PHASE IN THE AL TARGETS. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY
           PASSING THE IRRADIATED 18O2 TARGET GAS THROUGH A
           CHARCOAL TRAP AT LIQUID N2 TEMPERATURE AND COUNTING
           THE ACTIVITY TRAPPED. IN SUBSEQUENT IRRADIATIONS THE
           GAS WAS VENTED AND THE TARGET OPENED FOR REMOVAL OF
           THE 18F ACTIVITY.

COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.
           THE ENERGY OF THE IRRADIATION WAS TAKEN AS THE
           MID-POINT IN THE RANGE OF THE PROTONS IN THE TARGET
           GAS.
