SAMPLE     THE PROTON BEAM PASSED THROUGH A THIN (0.00625G/CM**2)
           'HAVAR' FOIL AND A SMALL AIR PATH(0.0015G/CM**2)BEFORE
           STRIKING THE ALUMINIUM COVER FOIL OF THE KAPTON TARGET
            1 OR 2 MILS THICK(1.905 CM DIAMETER BY EITHER 0.0025
           OR 0.0050 CM THICK)SANDWICHED BETWEEN A 1 MIL(0.0025CM)
           AND A 3 MIL(0.0076CM) AL FOIL WERE USED.
           FROM FOUR TO SIX TARGET STACKS WERE IRRADIATED SIMUL-
           TANEOUSLY IN THE CROSS SECTION MEASUREMENTS.
COMMENT    /BY AUTHORS/.THE CROSS SECTIONS WERE COMPARED TO
            THOSE OF JACOBS ET.AL.THERE IS EXCELLENTLY AGREEMENT
            IN SOME REGIONS AND VERY POOR AGREEMENT IN OTHERS.
