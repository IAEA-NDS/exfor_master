SAMPLE     The proton beam passed through a thin (0.00625g/cm**2)
           'havar' foil and a small air path(0.0015g/cm**2)before
           striking the aluminium cover foil of the kapton target
            1 or 2 mils thick(1.905 cm diameter by either 0.0025
           or 0.0050 cm thick)sandwiched between a 1 mil(0.0025cm)
           and a 3 mil(0.0076cm) Al foil were used.
           From four to six target stacks were irradiated simul-
           taneously in the cross section measurements.
COMMENT    /By authors/ The cross sections were compared to
            those of Jacobs et.al. There is excellently agreement
            in some regions and very poor agreement in others.

REACTION   (7-N-14(P,A)6-C-11,,TTY,,SAT)
SAMPLE     For the thick target yield studies,stack of 2 mil
            (0.0051cm) thick kapton foils(held in a 0.0076 cm
            Al packet) sufficiently thick to stop the proton beam
            of the desired energy were used.The thickness ranged
           from 0.28 g/cm**2 for proton energies below 9 MeV to
            1g/cm**2 for proton energies up to 18 MeV.
COMMENT    /By authors/.figure 1 contains the results of the
           thick target yields determined at the cyclotron and
           the Van de Graff. The yields determinations of the
           gas target are included to illustrate the dramatic
           difference between the gas and solid targets.
FLAG       (1.) This is measurement on the tandem Van de Graff.
           (2.) This is measurement on the cyclotron.
           (3.).This is measurement with gas target.
           (4.).Melamine target.
           (5.).Adenine target.
MISC-COL   (MISC1).Calculated yields in a manner described in
            text from the excitation functions of Jacobs. See

           yield.
