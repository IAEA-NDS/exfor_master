TITLE      3-HE ACTIVATION ANALYSIS FOR S,CL,K AND CA.
AUTHOR     (D.M.LEE,S.S.MARKOWITZ).
INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
REFERENCE  (J,RCA,19,159,74)
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK).HE-3++ BEAM.
METHOD     (BCINT,STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG).
           THIN TARGETS WERE IRRADIATED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT
           DIFFERENT ENERGIES BY STACKED-FOIL TECHNIQUE. THICK
           TARGETS WERE IRRADIATED ONE-AT-A-TIME WITH A THIN
           STANDARD IN THE SAME STACK, OR WITH A THICK STANDARD
           FROM TWO SUCCESSIVE IRRADIATION.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA)
COMMENT    /BY AUTHOR/. ABSOLUTE CROSS-SECTIONS WERE CALCULATED
           BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE REACTIONS WERE
           ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO A SINGLE REACTION ON A
           SPECIFIC TARGET NUCLIDE.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S). AVERAGE DEVIATION.
           EACH OF THE CROSS-SECTIONS SHOWN IN 'DATA-SECTION'
           REPRESENTS AN AVERAGE VALUE OF 2-3 REPLICATES.
