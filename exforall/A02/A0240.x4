TITLE      3He activation analysis for S,Cl,K and Ca.

FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Berkeley 88-inch cyclotron
              He-3++ beam.
METHOD     (BCINT,STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,EDEG).
           Thin targets were irradiated simultaneously at
           different energies by stacked-foil technique. Thick
           targets were irradiated one-at-a-time with a thin
           standard in the same stack, or with a thick standard
           from two successive irradiations.
DETECTOR   (GELI) Two Ge(Li) detectors, having active volumes of
           l6 cm3 and 30 cm3
ANALYSIS    Absolute cross-sections were calculated
           based on the assumption that the reactions were
           attributed entirely to a single reaction on a
           specific target nuclide.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T). The estimated absolute uncertainty in the
           cross sections includes:
            * uncertainty in the determination of total
              beam current,
            * uncertainty in the half-lives of nuclides,
            * uncertainty in the determination of disintegration
              rates,
            * the uniformity of thickness of targets,
            * possibility of recoil gas losses during irradiation.
           (ERR-S). Average deviation.
           Each of the cross-sections shown in 'data-section'
           represents an average value of 2-3 replicates.

REACTION   (16-S-32(HE3,X)17-CL-34-M,(CUM),SIG)
COMMENT    /By compiler/.
           Q-value for (He3,n) reaction is -0.8 MeV. Therefore
           the production of 18-Ar-34 is possible.

SAMPLE     Pure sulfur on to tantalum backing-foils. Sulfur
           targets were protected by depositing a thin film of
           aluminum over the sulfur to promote heat transfer
           during the irradiations. The thickness of the targets
           were determined by weighing; they ranged from 1.5 to
           4.5 mg/cm2.
