TITLE      Comparison of the (p,xn) cross sections from U-238,
           U-235 and Th-232 targets irradiated with 200 MeV
           protons

           source at the 200 MeV Linac injector of the
           Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).
           In one of the experiments of the thorium target, the
           irradiation was carried out at the Brookhaven Linac
           Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility under comparable
           irradiation conditions.
