TITLE      CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF C-11 IN C
           TARGETS BY C-12 AT RELATIVISTIC ENERGIES.

INSTITUTE  (1USABRK)
           (1USAIOW)
FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USABRK)
DETECTOR   (NAICR)
METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,SITA).FIRST, A LOW INTENSITY RUN WAS MADE
           IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL BEAM PARTICLES WERE COUNTED
           WITH PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS AND C-11 ACTIVITY WAS
           PRODUCED IN A THICK GRAPHITE BLOCK. NEXT, THE C-11
           ACTIVITY IN A 0.159 CM THICK POLYSTYRENE TARGET WAS
           DETERMINED RELATIVE TO A DIGITIAL READOUT ION CHAMBER
           BEAM MONITOR IN A HIGH-INTENSITY RUN. FINALLY, THE
           C-11 ACTIVITY IN A THICK GRAPHITE BLOCK WAS ALSO
           DETERMINED AT HIGH BEAM INTENSITY RELATIVE TO THE ION
           CHAMBER. THE C-12(C-12,X)C-11 CROSS SECTION WAS
           CALCULATED USING DATA FROM THE THREE RUNS.
ADD-RES    (COMP)
