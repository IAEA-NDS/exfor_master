           targets by C-12 at relativistic energies

DETECTOR   (NAICR) The scintillators were all 3.81 cm in
           diameter and ranged from 0.159 cm to 0.636 cm in
           thickness.
METHOD     (EXTB,BCINT,SITA) First, a low intensity run was made
           in which the individual beam particles were counted
           with plastic scintillators and C-11 activity was
           produced in a thick graphite block. Next, the C-11
           activity in a 0.159 cm thick polystyrene target was
           determined relative to a digital readout ion chamber
           beam monitor in a high-intensity run. Finally, the
           C-11 activity in a thick graphite block was also
           determined at high beam intensity relative to the ion
           chamber.
ANALYSIS   The C-12(C-12,x)C-11 cross section was
           calculated using data from the three runs.
ADD-RES    (COMP)
SAMPLE     Thick graphite block and 0.159 cm thick polystyrene
           target.
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1,,1.5) Uncertainty due to shifting of beam
           position, variations in placement and angle of the
           targets, and losses in counting 12C ions due to
           pileup or coincidence problems.
           (ERR-S) Statistical error
