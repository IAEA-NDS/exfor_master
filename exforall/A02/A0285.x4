REFERENCE  (J,RCA,33,181,1983)
FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK)
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,INTB,BCINT)
SAMPLE     6.25Mg/Cm**2 Aluminium Foils were Irradiated in the
           Internal Beam of the Karlsruhe Isochronous Cyclotron
           At 17 Energies Between 25 and 153 MeV.
DETECTOR   (GELI)
ANALYSIS   (AREA).Automatic Peak Determination was Performed and
           Checked in Several Cases by Hand Analysis.It was
           Found to be Accurate to Withim 4-8%. See Err-1.

COMMENT    1. Compiler Could not Exclude the Production Mg-22 and
            Ne-24.
           2. Authors did not Observe Na-22 and Na-24 Production
           At 23.3 MeV. Na-22 Production did not Observe at 28.4
           MeV Too.
