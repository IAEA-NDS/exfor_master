TITLE      Determination of Cross Section of Alpha-Induced Nuclear
           Reaction on Natural Cr and Zr by Stacked Foil
           Activation For Thin Layer Activation Analysis

FACILITY   (ISOCY,3INDIND)
METHOD     (STTA)
           (BCINT) The Beam Current was Measured Through a Faraday
           Cup and a Copper Monitoring Foil was Always Put  Before
           The Stacked Target in Each Irradiation to Check the
           Beam Current Measurement
           (EXTB,ACTIV) The Irradiation was Carried Out with About
           400 Nano-A For 4 Hours in the Zr Stack and 200 Nano-A
           For 4 Hours in the Cr and V Stacks.
           (GSPEC) The Time Dependent Counting Measurements were
           Taken at Least Twice For Each Radioisotope to Follow
           The Half-Life.
