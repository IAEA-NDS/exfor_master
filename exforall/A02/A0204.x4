TITLE      Determination of cross section of alpha-induced
           nuclear reaction on natural Cr and Zr by stacked foil
           activation for thin layer activation analysis

METHOD     (STTA)
           (BCINT) The beam current was measured through a Faraday
           cup and a copper monitoring foil was always put before
           the stacked target in each irradiation to check the
           beam current measurement
           (EXTB,ACTIV) The irradiation was carried out with about
           400 nA for 4 hours in the Zr stack and 200 nA for four
           hours in the Cr and V stacks.
           (GSPEC) The time dependent counting measurements were
           taken at least twice for each radioisotope to follow
           the half-life.

           - By compiler - The authors could determine production
           cross section of Nb-92-M only, because half-life of
           Nb-92-G is very long.
