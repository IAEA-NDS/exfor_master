SAMPLE     Zinc and tungsten foil of high purity were cut and
           washed very carefully and placed between copper or
           aluminium monitoring foils for the irradiations.
           In the reactions with chromium,a chemical compound
           between copper and potassium chromate was prepared.
           The powder was suspended in water,and then deposited
           onto thin aluminium foils, which were folded over
           after drying.
METHOD     (STTA,EXTB,ACTIV,EDEG).
DETECTOR   (GELI) 30 cm3 Ge(Li) detector. Resolution was 2.9 keV
            for 1332.keV gamma-rays.

ERR-ANALYS          Additional uncertainties in the deuteron
           energies for the data points are due to the energy
           spread of the incident beam and to the energy
           straggling in the target.

CORRECTION   These measurements are subject to a small uncertainty
           arising from the 67Zn(d,2n)67Ga reaction. The rather
           small contribution of this reaction was subtracted,
           using the excitation function obtained from the
           systematics (see REL-REF).

COMMENT    /By authors/ Because this state decays partially by
           isomeric transition, the cross sections listed in
           table 2 contain 2% of the formation cross section of
            52m-Mn. No correction was made for this contribution.
