COMMENT    *By authors*.  A new measurement of the 18-F(p,alpha)
           reaction and the 18-F(p,p) elastic scattering was
           performed at the radioactive ion beam facility in
           Louvain-La-Neuve. Values were deduced for the
           resonance energy, total width, partial width, and
           resonance strength of the 7.07 MeV level in Ne-19,
           confirming and increasing the precision of a first
           result obtained several years ago in the same lab.

DETECTOR   (SIBAR) protons from the elastic scattering and
           alpha-particles from the (p,alpha) reaction were
           detected in the Louvain-Edinburgh detector array (LEDA)
           A concentric multistrip silicon detector that provided
           data at sixteen angles from 12 to 28 degrees in the
           lab. system with a very large coverage (90%) in the
           azimuthal angle.
METHOD     (SITA,TTM) see sample. Inverse kinematics.
