COMMENT    -By Authors:  the Main Feature of the Present
           Measurement is the Use of a Small-Size Target,
           Implanted Into a Low-Z Material and a Uniformly Scanned
           Particle Beam Larger Than the Target.
SAMPLE     The 7-Be Target was Prepared at Isolde/Cern by Direct
           Implantation at 60 KeV of a Radioactive 7-Be Beam Into
           A Copper Substrate.  The Use of a 7-Be Target Implanted
           In Copper Eliminates the Backscattering Loss.
