SAMPLE     The 7-Be target was prepared at ISOLDE/CERN by direct
           implantation at 60 keV of a radioactive 7-Be beam into
           a copper substrate. The use of a 7-Be target implanted
           in copper eliminates the backscattering loss.
DETECTOR   (SIBAR)
METHOD     (BCINT,SITA)
COMMENT    -By Authors:  the main feature of the present
           measurement is the use of a small-size target,
           implanted into a low-Z material and a uniformly scanned
           particle beam larger than the target.

REACTION   (4-BE-7(P,G)5-B-8,,SIG,,SFC)
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The two main sources of uncertainty in the
           measurement are the determination of detected
           alpha-particles and the absolute efficiency of the
           gamma sources used to determine 7-Be number in used
           target.
           (ERR-1) The accuracy of the number of 7-Be nuclei in
           the target.
           (ERR-2) The accuracy of the total alpha count.
